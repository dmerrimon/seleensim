Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) will be conducted only in Japan  
Study Population:   
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) and Phase 2 (Dose Expansion)  
The study will be conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) or R/R higher risk myelodysplastic s yndrome (MDS).  
• A subject with R/R AML is defined as a subject who relapsed after or is refractory to induction 
and not a candidate for salvage t herapy .  
• A subject wi th R/R higher risk MDS is defined as a subject with Revised International 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS -R) for myelodysplasia of > 3.5 who relapsed after, or is 
refractory to, induction.  
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   
A total of approximately 122 subjects are planned for enrollment in this study.  
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation)  
Approximately 18 subjects with either R/R AML or R/R higher risk MDS will be enrolled.  
Phase 2 (Dose Expansion)  
Approximately 104 subjects per dose level. Each dose level may enro ll up to 52 R/R AML subjects 
and up to 52  R/R higher risk MDS subjects. Both groups of subjects will enroll in parallel and 
independently.  
Study Design Overview:   
This study is a phase 1/2, open -label study of ASP7517 (human embryonic kidney cell transfected 
with encoding target antigen Wilms’ tumor protein 1 [WT1]) in subjects with R/R AML and R/R 
higher risk MDS. Subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of AS P7517. Subjects will receive 
1 dose of ASP7517 per cycle for a total of up to 2 doses during the escalation phase and up to 
6 doses during the expansion phase.  
An End -of-Treatment (EoT) visit will be conducted for all subjects within 7 days of the princip al 
investigator decision to discontinue the subject from treatment or prior to the initiation of new 
anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. If a subject is completing all visits in the last treatment 
cycle, the EoT visit will be within 7 days from the  last planned visit.  
After the EoT visit, Observation Period 1 will be 12 weeks or until 1 post -treatment 
discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects who achieve composite complete remission  (CRc) or 
partial remission (PR) for AML and CR, bone marrow (BM) C R or PR or hematologic 
improvement (HI) for MDS or other clinical benefits, as determined by the investigator, will 
remain in the study in Observation Period 2 until 1 post -treatment discontinuation criterion is met. 
Safety and efficacy will be monitored d uring Observation Periods 1 and 2.  
Upon treatment  or post -treatment  discontinuation  criterion is met and subjects discontinue from the 
Treatment Period, Observation Period 1, or Observation Period 2, all subjects will be followed for 
survival and subsequen t anti -cancer treatments and outcomes by telephone calls every 3  months.  
In phase 1 (dose escalation), the starting dose level is 1 × 106 cells/dose and the decision to dose 
escalate to the next dose levels (1  × 107 and 1 × 108 cells/dose) will be made bas ed on the 
assessment of safety variables, including the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  In phase 2 (dose expansion), subjects  who have not met any individual treatment discontinuation  
criteria and  who are receiving clinical benefit (defined  as achieving CRc or PR for AML and CR, 
BM CR , PR or HI for MDS, or other clinical benefits as determined by the investigator ) will 
continue further treatment with ASP7517  after the first 2 cycles , as decided by the investigator.  
After completing 4 cycles of treatment, subjects who achieve CR will not continue with ASP7517 ; 
subjects who do not reach CR , but also do not experience disease progression , may receive an 
additional 2 doses for a total of 6 doses . 
Phase 1 Dose Escalation : 
The dose escalation portion will assess safety and tolerability of ASP7517. Subjects will receive 
2 single doses of ASP7517 via intravenous infusion. Dosing will occur on day 1 of each cycle, with 
a total of 2 cycles.  
Subjects must be managed under hospit alization for at least 7 days during the first cycle of the dose 
escalation phase. In addition, prior to hospital discharge , the investigator must ensure subject safety 
by performing medical tests and procedures listed on day 7 of cycle 1 and tests conside red 
clinically necessary in the opinion of the investigator to evaluat e the subject’s general condition  
and adverse event (AE) resolution. T he subject should also be followed on an outpatient basis on 
planned visits during cycle s 1 and 2 after hospital dis charge during the DLT assessment period to 
closely monitor any AEs . Subjects may be hospitalized days 1 to 7 during cycle 2 based on 
investigator opinion.  
After dosing of ASP7517, subjects must be observed for safety for a minimum of 4 hours. The 
safety o bservation will consist of hourly vital signs and AE observations. If new AEs are observed 
that are ≥  grade 3 during this time, subjects should continue to be observed at the investigator’s 
discretion.  
Dose escalation will be guided according to the Bayes ian optimal interval (BOIN) design  [Liu et 
al, 2015]  to determine the next dose level based on DLT occurrence. After the planned number of 
evaluable subjects have completed the DLT observation period for a given dose level, safety for 
that dose level will be assessed. Each dose level in the dose escalation will enroll a minimum of 3 
and may enroll a maximum of 8 subjects with  up to 4 evaluable  subjects for the initial assessment 
of each dose level. Refer to [Section 9.2.6  DLT Evaluation Analysis Set] for definition of evaluable 
subjects. Enrollment within each dose escalation cohort will be s taggered such that there will be 28  
calendar days between the trea tment initiation of the first subject  and the second subject, as well as 
14 calendar days between the second subject and the third subject at the same dose le vel for all 
escalation cohorts. An interval of 28 calendar days will separate  initiation of first dose of study 
treatment for the last subject in a dose cohort from the first dose of the first subject in the 
subsequent  dose cohort. The 28 -day separation is equivalent to the 28 -DLT evaluation period. If 
the decision is made to stay at the current dose l evel, then an additional 3 or 4 evaluable subjects 
may be enrolled to the current dose level. Three to 18 subjects will be enrolled in the dose 
escalation phase. A minimum number of 6 and a maximum number of 8 subjects must be enrolled 
at the dose level used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and t he recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) . 
Study enrollment and study treatment will be temporarily interrupted during dose escalation 
pending review of the following:  
• Any death that is not related to disease progression occurring within 30 days of receiving 
investigational product.  
• Occurrence of two grade  ≥ 4 DLTs in 2 study subjects.  
• Any grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Dose Escalation and Safety Committee : 
A Dose Escalation  and Safety Committee (DESC) consisting of sponsor representatives and 
investigators will convene once a dose level cohort completes the  DLT observation period and data 
are available for review. Additional details regarding responsibilities, membership requirements 
and safety review time points are included in the DESC Charter . The DESC will also review the 
aggregate safety data from the phase 1 dose escalation and the phase 2 expansion cohorts.  
While safety data from the DLT observation period in the escalation cohorts are the minimum 
safety data needed for the DESC  meeting, a ll available safety findings  will be considered by the 
DESC . The DESC  will assess whether a longer DLT observation period is warranted based on 
emerging data. Additionally, only when determining the RP2D, the DESC  may choose a more 
conservative dosing decision than the MTD selected  by BOIN  design , based on evaluation of the 
safety data and other available data.  
The decision on the dose level for the next cohort will be based on the BOIN design. Also, MTD 
will be determined by BOIN from at least 6 subjects w ith the maximum of 8 subjects under the 
maximum of 2 cohorts. The dose for phase 2 expansion will not be higher than the MTD.  
Subject Replacement during Dose Escalation:  
Subjects may be replaced in the dose escalation cohort if:  
● Subject is discovered to have enrolled without fully satisfying eligibility criteria.  
● Subject received less than the planned dose in cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT.  
● Subject has no DLT and withdraws from the study before the end of the DLT evaluation period.  
The decision regarding replacement of individual subjects will be made by the sponsor with 
discussions with the treating investigator.  
Phase 2 (Dose Expansion) : 
Phase 2 will assess the safety and efficacy of ASP7517. This phase of the study may open once the 
RP2D and/o r MTD are determined from the dose escalation phase, OR all of the following 
conditions are met before the RP2D and/or MTD determination.  
⚫ At least 1 subject in the dose escalation cohort (phase 1) achieves CRc for AML subjects, or 
CR, BM CR or PR for MDS s ubjects.  
⚫ The dose level to be expanded is deemed tolerable by the DESC.  
⚫ The dose that will be opened for expansion is determined to be equal or lower than possible 
MTD.  
Phase 2 will include the following groups and may enroll in parallel and independently:  
⚫ Subjects with R/R AML.  
⚫ Subjects with R/R higher risk MDS.  
The CRc rate for subjects with R/R AML and CR + BM CR + PR rate for R/R higher risk MDS are 
continuously monitored using the Bayesian optimal phase 2 (BOP2) design [Zhou et al, 2017]. The 
number of dose levels investigated during phase 2 will be based upon  the data from phase 1. 
Initially, 12  subjects will be enrolled at each dose level for each disease type during stage 1 of 
BOP2. If the response rate does not meet the optimal stopping boundaries (see table below), then 
stage 2 will open and an additional 20 subjects may be enrolled during this stage. Combining the 
data from stage 1 and stage 2, stage 3 may be opened for an additional 20 subjects for a total 
maximum sample size of 52  for each disease type, if the response rate does not meet the optimal 
stopping boundaries (see table below). Otherwise, the enrollment at that dose level will be closed.  
When the total number of subjects reaches the maximum sample size of 52, it may be concluded 
that ASP7517  is efficacious if the number of responses is greater than or equal to 1 2 and 10 for

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  AML and MDS, respectively. The number of subjects in stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 may be 
changed according to the optimized stopping boundaries.  
Optimized Stopping Boundaries for AML  
Number of subjects treated  Stop if number of responses ≤  
12 1 
32 5 
AML: acute myeloid leukemia  
Optimized Stopping Boundaries for MDS  
Number of subjects treated  Stop if number of responses ≤  
12 0 
32 4 
MDS: myelodysplastic s yndrome  
If more than 1  dose level is open for enrollment within a selected disease type, the newly enrolled 
subjects with that disease type w ill be randomly allocated to 1  of the open dose levels.  
Random ization will be weighted toward  newly opened dose levels, with the allocati on ratio based 
on the number of open slots still available at each dose level. For example, if dose level ‘x’ 
enrolled 3  subjects and dose level ‘y’ is newly opened for expansion, the next subject would be 
randomly allocated to dose level ‘x’ or ‘y’ with t he ratio of 9:12 .  
When escalation and expansion cohorts are both open for enrollment, enrollment into escalation 
cohorts takes priority such that subjects who are eligible for both will be preferentially enro lled in 
the escalation cohorts.

ASP7517 injection 1 × 107 cells/mL, 2.5 mL/vial for intravenous infusion.  
Dose(s):   
Phase 1  (Dose Escalation)  
Starting dose of ASP7517 is 1 × 106 cells/dose, with escalation doses of 1 × 107 and  
1 × 108 cells/dose.  
Subjects will receive 2 single doses of ASP7517 on C1D1 and cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1).  
Phase 2 (Dose Expansion)  
Subjects will receive 1 dose of ASP7517 on day 1 of each 28 -day cycle at RP2D or MTD as 
established by phase 1 for up to 6 doses total during the expansion phase.  
Mode(s) of Administration:  
ASP7517 will be diluted with normal saline to 50 mL and administered by intravenous infusion at 
4 to 6 mL/min infusion rate through a dedicated intravenous line , followed by flushing.  
Dose Limiting Toxicity Criteria:  
A DLT is defined as any of the followi ng events that occur within 28 days starting with the first 
dose on C1D1  and that is considered to be related to IP. Confirmation of DLTs will be made by the 
DESC. The severity of AEs will be assessed according to NCI -CTCAE, version 5.0.  
DLT is defined as follows:  
⚫ Non-hematologic AEs that are ≥ grade 3.  
⚫ Confirmed Hy’s law case.  
⚫ New onset of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (with minimum of 2 grade worsening from baseline) 
within 24 hours of dosing.  
⚫ Prolonged myelosuppression, defined as absolute neutrophil count <  500/µL for more than 
28 days off therapy and in the absence of evidence of active leukemia or MDS in the marrow 
or blood, will be considered a DLT.  
The following AEs will not be considered as DLTs:  
● Electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae or deemed not clinically 
significant and corrected with appropriate management or supplementation within 72  hours of 
the onset.  
● Grade 3 infusion site reaction if successfully managed and resolved within 72 hours.  
● Grade 3 febrile neutropen ia with or without infection.  
● Alopecia, anorexia or fatigue.  
● Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting if not requiring tube feeding or total parenteral nutrition, or 
diarrhea and/or constipation if not requiring or prolonging hospitalization that can be managed 
to grade ≤ 2 with standard antiemetic or antidiarrheal medications used at prescribed dose 
within 7  days of onset.  
● Grade 3 liver function test (LFT) elevations that resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 7 days; LFT 
elevations lasting > 7  days that are considered to be c linically significant and at least possibly 
related to ASP7517 will be considered to be a DLT.  
● Immune -related AEs grade 3 that resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 7 days.  
● Grade 3 or higher hyperuricemia due to tumor lysis that resolves to ≤ grade 1 with medical 
interventions, including hospitalization with intravenous hydration and/or rasburicase.

De-escalate if number of subjects with  
DLT =  2 2 2 or 3 3 3 or 4  3 or 4  
Stop if number of subjects with DLT ≥  3 3 4 4 5 5 
DLT: dose limiting toxicity  
Dose escalation within individua l subjects will not be allowed.  
Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD determination will be based on at least 6 evaluable subjects at that dose level  based on 
the BOIN design . Based on the observed DLT(s) during the DLT observatio n period, the MTD  is 
the highest dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to, but not over, the 
target DLT rate of 0.30.  
The dose level determined to be the MTD must have data from at least 6 subjects.  
Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
The sponsor, in conjunction with the DESC, will determine the RP2D of ASP7517 taking into 
consideration the safety and efficacy data, as well as other ava ilable data , such as pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of ASP7517. The RP2D will not exceed the MTD.  
The dos e level determined to be the RP2D must have data from at least 6 subjects.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Formal Stopping Rules:  
Stopping Rules b ased on Safety for Phase 2  
The stopping rules described below will be applied to both AML and MDS disease types.  
The safety in phase 2 will be monitored using Bayesian logistic model based on safety events 
including:  
⚫ All DLT data obtained at the time of the analysis  from both escalation and expansion cohorts . 
⚫ Drug related treatment emergent AEs leading to death.  
Safety monitoring with the  Bayesian  model will start when phase 2  is opened. Enrollment in phase 
2 will be stopped based on the following 2  criteria:  
⚫ If the posterior mean of the  safety event  rate is higher than 30% as indicated by Bayesian 
logistic model across disease types at a given dose level, then enrollment will be stopped in 
phase 2 at that dose level and at higher dose levels for that therapy.  
⚫ Additionally, if the posterior mean of t he safety event  rate is higher than 30% as indicated by 
Bayesian  logistic model in a specific disease type at a dose level, enrollment of that dose level 
and any higher dose -level will be stopped for that disease type.  
Statistical Methods  
Sample Size Justification:  
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) : The sample size for the dose escalation phase is not based on a 
statistical power calculation. The number of subjects enrolled will be dependent on the DLT 
incidence. The estimated number of subjects, a minimum of 6 evaluable and up to 18, should 
provide adequate information for the dose escalation and safety objectives of the study.  
Phase 2 (Dose Expansion) : The sample size in phase 2 is up to 104  subjects per dose level. Each 
dose level may enroll up to 52 R/R AML subjects and up to 52 R/R higher risk MDS subjects. The 
response rate is monitored using the BOP2 design. For AML, with assumption of the effica cious 
CRc rate is 30% and the inefficacious CRc rate is 15%, the statistical power would be 
approx imately 0.83 while controlling the type I error rate at 0.10. For MDS, with assumption of the 
efficacious CR + BM CR + PR rate is 25% and the inefficacious CR + BM CR + PR rate is 12%, 
the statistical power would be approximately 0.83, while controlling th e type I error rate at 0.10.  
Efficacy:   
For R/R AML: Response to treatment will be defined per modified Cheson criteria [ Cheson et al, 
2003 ]. 
For R/R higher risk MDS: Response to treatment will be defined per Cheson criteria [ Cheson et al, 
2006] . 
Response rates will be summarized using exact 90% confidence interval by dose level for phase 1 
and by dose level and disease type for phase 2.  Time to endpoints, including event free survival 
and overall survival , will be listed and summarized using Kapla n-Meier method.  
Pharmacokinetics:   
Summary statistics of pharmacokinetics may be tabulated. Exploratory analysis between 
pharmacokinetic parameter and clinical measures (e.g., efficacy or safety) may be performed.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Pharmacodynamics:   
Descriptive statistics will be provided for pharmacodynamics parameters whenever applicable. 
Exploratory analysis of the relationship between pharmacodynamic measurements and 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile in subjects may be performed.  
Safety:  
Descript ive statistics will be used to summarize safety data. All safety data will be summarized by 
treatment received (safety analysis set).  
Safety analyses will consist of data summaries of AEs, DLTs and other safety parameters. The 
number and percentage of sub jects experiencing 1 or more AE(s) will be summarized by cohort 
and dose level. The relationship to IP and severity of AE will also be summarized. All summaries 
of AEs will include only treatment -emergent events unless otherwise stated. AEs will be coded t o 
system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA terminology and will be graded by the 
investigator using the NCI -CTCAE severity grade (version 5.0).  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized by cohort and dose level using descriptive statistics for 
shifts in change from baseline and will be presented in listings of clinically significant 
abnormalities. Vital signs and electrocardiogram parameters and their changes from baseline will 
be summarized by cohort and dose level using descriptive statistics.  
Interim Analysis:  
No interim analysis is planned.  
Safety, pharmacokinetic and other clinical data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine 
if the study will proceed to the next dose level/phase.  
For phase 2, according to the BOP2 design, the fut ility analysis for efficacy will be performed at 
the end of stage 1 and stage 2. Twelve  subjects will be enrolled at each dose level for each disease 
type during stage 1 of BOP2. If the response rate does not meet the optimal stopping boundaries, 
then stag e 2 will open and an additional 20 subjects may be enrolled during this stage. Combining 
the data from stage 1 and stage 2, stage 3 may be opened for an additional 20 subjects for a total 
maximum sample size of 52 for each disease type, if the response rat e does not meet the optimal 
stopping boundaries.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia in adults. AML 
accounts for approximately 3 2% of acute leukemia diagnosed in adults  [American Cancer 
Society, 2014] . The median age at diagnosis is 67 years of age, with 54% of patients 
diagnosed at 65 years or older [O’Donnell et al, 2012].  In Japan, it was estimated that 
5600  patients were diagnosed with AML in 2017  [Kantar Health, 2017] . It is estimated that 
19940  people will be diagno sed with AML, and 11180  will die from the dise ase in 2020 in 
the US  [American Cancer Society, 20 20]. While 60% to 80% of younger patie nts achieve a 
complete remission  (CR) with standard therapy, only about 20% to 30% of the overall patient 
population has l ong-term disease -free survival. Outcomes are worse for patients aged 
60 years or over, with CR  rates in the range of 40% to 55% and poor long -term survival rates. 
Along with age, remission rates and overall survival (OS) depend on a number of other 
factors, including cytogenetics, previous bone marrow disorders (such as myelodysplastic 
syndromes [MDS]) and co -morbidities [Rowe & Tallman, 2010; Rowe et al, 2010; Breems 
et al, 2005; Karanes et al, 1999]. Although FDA approved targeted therapies for AML  (both 
newly diagnosed and relapsed/ refractory [R/R] patients) have become available, currently 
there is no effective cure for the disease.  
Approximately 30% of adult AML patients are refractory to induction therapy. Furthermore, 
of those who achieve CR, a pproximately 75% will relapse. Several chemotherapy regimens 
have been used for patients with resistant or relapsed disease; however, the chemotherapy 
combinations are universally dose -intensive , with  high risk of unacceptable toxicity  in older 
patients . While these regimens may generate second remission rates of up to 50% in patients 
with a first remission of more than 1 year, toxicity is prohibitively high in most patients over 
50 to 60 years [Rowe & Tallman, 2010; Rowe et al, 2010; Breems et al, 2005; Ka ranes et al, 
1999]. Additionally, if the patient (including younger patients) relapses within 6 months of 
their initial CR, the chance of attaining a second remission is less than 20% with 
chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, survival after first relapse is ap proximately 10%, 
demonstrating the lack of an effective cure for patients in relapsed AML [Rowe & Tallman, 
2010]. Patients who are in second relapse or refractory to first salvage have an extremely 
poor prognosis, with survival measured in weeks [Giles et al, 2005].  
MDS s are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders with an inherent tendency for 
leukemic transformation. In Japan, it was estimated that 8500 patients were diagnosed with 
MDS in 2017  [Kantar Health , 2018] . In the US, the incidence of  MDS has been estimated 
between 5.3 and 13.1 cases per 100,000 population per year, rising with age to an estimated 
75 to 162 cases per 100,000 population per year among patients ≥ 65 years of age [Cogle, 
2015].  MDS is clinically characterized by periphera l blood cytopenias ; as a result, the clinical 
course of MDS patients is often fraught with complications related to peripheral blood 
cytopenias along with an inherent risk for leukemic transformation, which is encountered in 
30% of de novo MDS patients [Do tson & Lebowicz, 2018]. The outcome of MDS patients is 
extremely variable with median survival ranging from over 5 years to less than 9 months.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Therefore, over the years, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed to enable 
accurate risk -strati fication of these patients [Greenberg et al, 2012; Greenberg et al, 1997; 
Malcovati et al, 2007; Kantarjian et al, 2008]. In addition, recent discovery of genes is being 
used to refine the current diagnostic and prognostic approach [Bejar et al, 2011; Beja r et al, 
2012] and additionally serve as novel therapeutic targets for ongoing clinical trials in MDS. 
Currently  approved drugs for the treatment of MDS are not curative and no standard of care 
is available for patients after failure to respond to hypometh ylating agents [Uy et al, 2017]. 
Allogen eic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy , but the morbidity and mortality 
associated with the latter precludes it from being a feasible option in the vast majority of 
MDS patients with a median age at di agnosis of 70 to 75 years [Sekeres & Culter, 2014].  
The majority of patients with MDS and AML are not cured with available therapies, 
underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives that will improve the clinical 
outcomes of these patients.   
The Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1) gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 11. WT1 
suppresses transcription of hemopoietic related proteins including macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor , transforming growth factor -beta, and retinoic acid receptor -alpha 
[Ros enfeld et al, 2003]. This gene, originally defined as a tumor suppressor gene, is also a 
gene transcription factor overexpressed in leukemic cells, where it induces inhibition of 
apoptosis and differentiation [Polák et al, 2012]. The gene is essential in m esenchymal tissue 
maintenance through the Wnt4 pathway [Chau & Hastie, 2012] and it is expressed in a small 
percentage of bone marrow CD34+ cells [Fraizer et al, 1995]. It is upregulated in early 
myeloid progenitors and is down regulated at later stages of  differentiation. Studies in mice 
have shown that WT1  overexpression is required for leukemogenesis [Hosen et al, 2007; 
Hohenstein & Hastie, 2006]. Most patients with AML (86% to 91%) [NCCN Guidelines , 
2018] and MDS show overexpressed WT1 [Rautenberg et al, 2018; Miyagi et al, 1993;  Miwa 
et al, 1992].  
2.1.1 Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
2.1.1.1  Pharmacology  
ASP7517 is an artificial adjuvant  vector  cell (aAVC) vaccine that induces both natural killer 
(NK) cell dependent antitumor effects (innate immunity) and WT1 -specif ic T cell dependent 
antitumor effects (adaptive immunity). In a B16 -F10 mouse metastatic melanoma model, a 
single intravenous dose of t he m urine ASP7517 -surrogate suppressed an increase of lung 
weights caused by lung metastasis. Under the condition of NK c ell depletion in mice, the 
antitumor effect was canceled. These results provide a proof of mechanism that the 
ASP7517 -surrogate exerts an antitumor effect through NK -cell derived innate immunity 
(Study 7517 -PH-9007).  
To assess adaptive immunity, a murine A ML survival model was used, where mice were 
inoculated with murine C1498 AML cells. ASP7517 -surrogate significantly prolonged 
survival time in mice inoculated with WT1 expressing C1498 cells, when compared with 
mice inoculated with C1498 cells not expressi ng WT1 (Study 7517 -PH-9003).

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  In this same AML model, mice administered ASP7517 -surrogate (5 × 102, 5 × 103 or 5 × 104 
cells/mouse) showed a dose -related response to this therapeutic  (Study 7517 -PH-9012).  
2.1.1.2  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
A biodistribution study  for ASP7517 was performed by determining tissue distribution of the 
human genomic Alu sequence. After a single intravenous administration of ASP7517 to 
C57BL/6J mice at 1 × 108 cells/kg, ASP7517 -derived human DNA in tissues was detected in 
the blood and i n all tissues examined 1 hour after administration, and the levels of the 
ASP7517 DNA in the blood and lung were higher than in other tissues. ASP7517 DNA 
decreased rapidly and was below the limit of quantification in almost all tissues at 24 hours 
after administration. ASP7517 DNA was n ot detected in urine or feces. No remarkable sex 
differences were observed  (Study 7517 -ME-0001).  
2.1.1.3  Nonclinical Toxicology  
General tox icity of ASP7517 was evaluated in 2 Good Laboratory Practice  toxicity studies in 
C57BL/6J mic e (Studies 7517-TX-0002 and 7517 -TX-0005).  
The target organs of  toxicity identified include d the liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, uri nary 
bladder and epididymis. In addition, emboli were observed in the liver and spleen, and 
decreases in platelet co unts were transiently noted on d ay 1 after the first or second dose. All 
of the observed to xicities listed above were reversible. No observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was not determined . 
These preclinical studies have identified the liver as the dose limiti ng target organ of toxicity 
for ASP7517. Liver -related findings included increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased liver weight, white foci, emboli, mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltration and focal necrosis of h epatocytes at doses ≥ 1 × 105 cells/kg at 
1 day after a single dose of ASP7517. These findings completely resolved by 28 days 
postdose. Administration of a second dose of ASP7517, 4 weeks after the first dose, resulted 
in liver findings similar to those se en after the first dose. Dose -related decreases in platelet 
counts were observed 1 day after administering ASP7517 at doses ≥ 1 × 105 cells/kg. Platelet 
counts showed signs of recovery by 7 days and fully recovered by day 28.  
2.1.1.4  Clinical Studies  
Aside from th e ongoing trial, no clinical studies of ASP7517 have been conducted.  
2.1.2 Summary of Key Safety Information for Investigational Product  
2.1.2.1  Potential Risk  
No studies with ASP7517  in humans have been conducted yet. The potential risks described 
below  are based on AS P7517  nonclinical studies and clinical data from compounds with 
similar  mechanism of action or composition . The management of toxicities should be based 
on institutional standard of care, publi shed guidelines, as well as on  investigator judgment, 
the proto col instructions regarding  risk monitoring,  and interruption or  discontinuation of

2.1.2.1.1  Liver  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that  the liver c ould be the target organ of toxicity for 
ASP7517 , which is related to the activation of an innate immune response by presenting 
α-GalCer linked to CD1d on the surface of ASP7517 to natural killer T (NKT) cells. The 
activation of NKT cells is thought to be responsible for the hepatic injury induced with 
ASP7517. The hepatic findings could be monitored (increased AST and ALT 1 day after 
administration) and were completely reversed by 28 days after ASP7517 administration. The 
adverse events (AEs) in mice inclu ded increased liver weight, AST and ALT elevation, 
emboli, hepatocyte focal necrosis, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, microgranuloma, 
granulomatous inflammation, mononuclear cell aggregation and pigment laden macrophage 
infiltration. Close monitoring  of liver function and toxicities is required during clinical 
studies.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  2.1.2.1.2  Hematology  
A dose -related decrease in platelet count was noted 1 day after the first dose. There was also 
a dose related decrease in platelet count following the second dose. Platelet c ounts were 
increased above baseline 7 days after the first and second dose and recovered to normal 
physiological ranges by day 28. The standard assessment of hematology is recommended in 
clinical studies.  
2.1.2.1.3  Kidney  
Increased serum creatinine was seen 1 day after the first dose. This finding was completely 
resolved 7 days after the  first dose.  In addition, h istological assessment showed basophilic 
tubules and infiltration of  mononuclear cells 7 days after the second dose. These histological 
finding s were completely resolved 28 days after  the second dose. The presence of basophilic 
tubules is interpreted as regeneration of renal  tubules.  The standard monitoring of kidney 
function  parameters (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) is recommended in clinical  studies.  
2.1.2.1.4  Spleen  
Spleen weights were increased 1 day after the first  and second  dose and showed a trend 
toward recovery  in 28 days . In addition, h istological assessments showed apoptosis in 
lymphoid follicle of the spleen 1 day after the first or second do se. This finding was  
completely resolved by 7 days after ASP7517 administration. Also, e mboli were observed in 
the spleen 1 day after administering the first and second dose of ASP7517  and resolved 
completely by 7 days after dosing.  
In addition, l ymphoid follicular hyperplasia was  noted 7 days after the first or  second dose 
that increased in  incidence and severity with dose  increase , whereas it had not been observed 
1 day after the first and  second doses. This finding was partially or completely resolved b y 
28 days post dosing. S tandard  hematology testing is recommended in clinical studies . 
2.1.2.1.5  Other  
AEs reported from  solid tumor,  early phase  clinical trials  using  α-GalCer based 
immunotherapies include:  fever, headache, fatigue, dizziness, chest pain, lymphopen ia, hot 
flash, hyperkalemia, l actate dehydrogenase  increase, creatinine increase, anemia,  increased 
cancer pain and h yperbilirubinemia . In general, these therapies were  shown to be safe  and no 
severe adverse events (SAEs) are related to the treatment  [Kuni i et al, 2009; Motohashi  et al, 
2009; Uchida et al, 200 8; Ishikawa  et al, 2005].  
The AE s reported in early phase WT1 - peptide vaccine clinical studies  in AML and MDS  
patients were mainly grade 1 or 2 events including fatigue, headache, pruritus, muscular 
weakness, bone pa in, pain in extremity, flushing, dry skin , transient local erythema and 
induration, fever, transient erythema nodosum -like lesions and persistent cough . Also , grade 
3 and 4 AEs reported as l ymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, white  blood 
cell count dec rease and platelet count decrease . Overall, the protocol treatments were well 
tolerated and associated only with transient loc al grade 1 or 2 toxicities [Maslak, 2018; 
Keilholz et al, 2009 ].

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  In addition, based on the abo ve and the mechanism of action of ASP7517, immune -related 
adverse reactions (e.g., fever, headache, fatigue, hot flashes, diarrhea and muscular and joint 
pain) should be considered and managed as required per standard of care.  
2.1.2.1.6  Infusion -related Reactions  
In nonclinical studies with ASP7517, infusion -related reactions (IRRs)/cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS) were not seen. However, there are potential toxicities with intravenous 
infusion immunotherapy and the exact mechanism causing standard infusion reactions is 
unclear, but most reactions appear to arise from cytokine release from immune -mediated 
mechanisms [Lee et al, 2014].  
The symptoms and signs associated with a standard infusion reaction include fever, shaking 
chills, flushing and/or itching, changes in h eart rate and blood pressure, shortness of breath or 
chest discomfort, pain in back or abdomen, nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea and skin rash.  
In addition to the signs and symptoms associated with a standard infusion reaction, CRS may 
result in neurologic  signs and symptoms such as mental status changes, confusion and 
delirium. Renal and hepatic manifestations may include azotemia, elevated transaminases and 
hyperbilirubinemia, respectively. Coagulation parameters maybe also be affected and 
manifested by e levated D -dimer and hypofibrinogenemia, with or without bleeding. In 
addition, tumor lysis syndrome may also be associated with CRS [Lee et al, 2014]. Patients 
should be closely monitored for IRRs and CRS and appropriately managed per standard of 
care.  
2.1.2.1.7  Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Based on the nonclinical data, no signs or symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis were 
seen following ASP7517 administration. The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis overlap 
with those of standard infusion reactions. How ever, certain features are highly suggestive of 
anaphylaxis, such as urticaria, repetitive cough, wheeze, throat tightness and change in voice, 
angioedema (usually of face, eyelids or lip), hypotension, loss of consciousness, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal cr amping and diarrhea. Patients should be monitored closely for any 
signs or symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis and managed appropriately per 
standard of care.  
2.1.2.1.8  Potential for Anti -HLA Antibodies  
Anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies are form ed following exposure to foreign 
HLA antigens, which may occur following the exposure to ASP7517. The presence of anti -
HLA antibodies can result in engraftment failure in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT). Patients will be monitored for the pr esence of Anti -HLA antibodies in clinical trials.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
Correlations between WT1 expression level and AML and MDS disease condition/ 
progression have been reported [Miyawaki et al, 2005; Tamaki et al, 1999]. In patients with 
MDS, expression of WT 1 is associated with higher blast counts and an increased risk of 
progression to AML [Tamaki et al, 1999]. ASP7517 has effects against WT1 expressing

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  tumors  by inducing both NK  cell activity (innate immunity) and WT1 -specific T cell 
dependent antitumor eff ects (adaptive immunity). Nonclinical s tudies were performed to 
demonstrate that both the innate and adaptive immune systems were ac tivated by aAVC. In 
addition, nonclinical data suggest  that ASP7517 is active in AML as described in  
[Section  2.1.1  Nonclinical and Clinical Data]  and t he Investigator’s Brochure ; therefore, 
ASP7517 is targeting WT1 for the treatment of AML/MDS and may result in clinical benefit.  
2.3 Risk Bene fit Assessment  
Among AML patients , approximately 30%  are refractory to  induction therapy and of those 
who achieve CR, approximately 75% will relapse. Generally, there is no established standard 
of care for these patients and less than 20% will achieve CR w ith subsequent treatment. The 
response duration for patients who achieve CR with subsequent treatment is limited and most 
patients relapse. Patients who are in second relapse or refractory to first salvage have an 
extremely poor prognosis, with survival me asured in weeks.  
For MDS, the currently available treatment s are not curative and no standard of care is 
available for patients after failure to respond to hypomethylating agents [Uy et al, 2017] . 
Patients with higher -risk disease have an expected median overall survival  of less than 
2 years. Patients who experience standard treatment failure have median sur vival of less than 
6 months and limited treatment option s with consideration given t o clinical trials [Sekeres & 
Culter , 2014].  
ASP7517 has effects against WT1 expressing tumors and showed no significant safety 
findings in the pre -clinical pharmacology studies. In the repeated dose toxicity studies with 
mice, all major findings were reversible and monitorable and will not interfere with human 
clinical  studies recruiting AML and MDS patients, considering its potential benefit against 
the risk.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  4 STUDY DESIGN AND DOS E RATIONALE  
4.1 Study Design  
This study is a phase 1/2, open -label study of ASP7517 (human embryonic kidney cell 
transfected with encoding target antigen WT1) in subjects with R/R AML and R/R higher 
risk MDS.  
A total of approximately 122 subjects are planned for enrollment in this study.  
In phase 1 (Dose Escalation) , approximately 18 subj ects with either AML or MDS will be enrolled.  
In phase 2 (Dose Expansion) , approximately 104 subjects  will be enrolled per dose level. Each 
dose level may enroll up to  52 subjects with R/R AML and up to  52 subjects with R/R higher 
risk MDS. Both groups of subjects will enroll in parallel and  independently.  
4.1.1 Study Periods  
The study cons ists of the following periods:  
● Screening (up to 14 days)  
● Treatment (two 28 -day cycles  during escalation phase; up to six 28 -day cycles during 
expansion phase ) 
● EoT visit  
● Post-Treatment  
○ Observation Period 1 ( 12 weeks or until 1  post-treatment discontinuation criterion 
is met, whichever occurs first)  
○ Observation Period 2 (assessment visit every month until 1 post-treatment 
discontinuation criterion is met)  
● Survival and subsequent treatment follow -up every 3 months  
During the treatment period, s ubjects will receive an intravenous infusion of ASP7517 
(human embryonic kidney cell transfected wi th encoding target antigen WT1).  
In phase 1 (dose escalation), subjects will receive 1  dose of ASP7517 per cycle for a  total of 
2 doses.  
In phase 2 (dose expansion), subjects who have not met any individual treatment 
discontinuation criteria and who are receiving clinical benefit (defined as achieving CRc or 
PR for AML and CR, BM CR, PR or  HI for MDS, or other clinical benefits as determined by 
the investigator) will continue further treatment with ASP7517 after the first 2 cycles, as 
decided by the investigator.   
After completing 4 cycles of treatment, subjects who achieve CR will not con tinue with 
ASP7517; subjects who do not reach CR , but also do not experience disease progression , 
may receive an additional 2 doses for a total of 6 doses . 
Each cycle is defined as 28 days  with a total of up to 6 treatment cycles .  
An End -of-Treatment (EoT) visit will be conducted for all subjects within 7  days of the 
principal investigator decision to discontinue the subject from treatment or prior to the

19 Sep 2022  Astellas  Page 48 of 138 
Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. If a subject is completing all visits 
in the last treatment cycle, the EoT visit will be within 7 days from the last planned visit.  
After the EoT  visit, Observation Period 1 will be 12 weeks or until  1 post -treatment 
discontinuation criterion is met, whichever comes first . Subjects who achieve composite 
complete remission ( CRc) or PR for AML and CR , bone marrow (BM) CR  or PR or HI for 
MDS or other clinical benefits, as determined by the investigator, will remain in the study in 
Observation Period 2 until 1 post -treatment discontinuation criteri on is met. Safety and 
efficacy will be monitored during Observation Periods 1 and 2.  
Upon treatment  or post -treatment  discontinuation  criterion is met and subjects discontinue 
from the Treatment Period, Observation Period 1, or Observ ation Period 2 , all subjects will 
be followed for survival  and subsequent anti -cancer treatments and outcomes  by telephone 
calls every 3  months.  
This study consists of 2 parts: phase 1 do se escalation and p hase 2 dose expansion.  
4.1.2 Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
The dose escalation portion will assess safety and tolerability of ASP7517. In the dose 
escalation phase, s ubjects must be managed under hospitalization for at least 7 days during 
the first cycle of the dose escalation phase. In addition, prior to hospital di scharge , the 
investigator must ensure subject safety by performing medical tests and procedures listed on 
day 7 of cycle 1 and tests considered clinically necessary  in the opinion of the investigator  to 
evaluate the subject ’s general c ondition and AE resolution. T he subject should also be 
followed on an outpatient basis on planned visits during cycle 1 and 2 after hospital discharge 
during the DLT assessment period to closely monitor any AEs. Subjects may be hospitalized 
days 1 to 7 during cycle 2 base d on investigator opinion.  
After dos ing of ASP7517, subjects must be observed for safety for a minimum of 4 hours. 
The safety observation will consist of hourly vital signs and AE observations. If new AEs are 
observed that are ≥ grade 3 during this time, subjects should continue to be observed at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
In phase 1 (dose escalation), the starting dose level is 1 × 106 cells/dose and the decision  to 
dose escal ate to the next dose levels (1  × 107 and 1 × 108 cells/dose) will be made b ased on 
the assessment of safety variables, including the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs). Dose escalation will be  guided according to the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) 
design  [Liu et al, 2015]  to determine the next dose level based on DLT  occurrence. After the 
planned number of evaluable subjects have completed the DLT observation period for a 
given dose level, safety for that dose level will be assessed. Each dose level in the dose 
escalation phase will enroll a minimum of 3 and may enrol l a maximum of 8 subjects with up 
to 4 evaluable subjects for the initial assessment  of each dose level.  Enrollment within each 
dose escalation cohort will be  staggered such that there will be 28  calendar days between the 
treatment initiation of the first subject  and the second subject, as well as 14 calendar days 
between the second subject and the third subject  at the same dose level for all escalation 
cohorts. An interval of 28 calendar days will separate initiation of first dose of study

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  treatment for the last subject in a dose cohort from the first subject in the subsequent  dose 
cohort . The 28 -day separation is equivalent to the 28 -DLT evaluation period. If the decision  
is made to stay at the current dose level, then an additional 3 or 4 evaluable subj ects may be 
enrolled to the current dose level. Three to 18 subjects will be enrolled in the dose escalation 
phase. A minimum number of 6  subjects  and a maximum number of 8  subjects  must be 
enrolled at the dose level used to determine the maximum tolerated  dose (MTD) and the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).  
Safety  data and other  available  clinical data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to 
determine if the study will proceed to the next dose level/ phase.   
Subject Replacement during Dose Escalation:  
Subje cts may be replaced in the dose escalation cohort if:  
● Subject is discovered to have enrolled without fully satisfying eligibility criteria.  
● Subject received less than the planned dose in cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT.  
● Subject has no DLT and withdraws from the study before the end of the DLT evaluation 
period.  
The decision regarding replacement of individual subjects will be made by the sponsor with 
discussions with the treating investigator.  
4.1.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity Criteria  
A DLT is defined as any of th e following events that occur within 28 days starting with the 
first dose on C1D1  and that is considered to be related to IP. Confirmation of DLTs will be 
made by the Dose Escalation and Safety Committee ( DESC). The severity of AEs will be 
assessed according to NCI -CTCAE, version 5.0.  
DLT is defined as follows:  
⚫ Non-hematologic AEs that are ≥ grade 3.  
⚫ Confirmed Hy’s law case . 
⚫ New onset of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (with minimum of 2 grade worsening from 
baseline) within 24 hours of dosing . 
⚫ Prolonged myelosuppression, defi ned as ANC  < 500/µL for more than 28  days off 
therapy and in the absence of evidence of active leukemia or MDS in the marrow or 
blood, will be considered a DLT.  
The following AEs will not be considered as DLTs:  
● Electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae or deemed not 
clinically significant and corrected with appropriate management or supplementation 
within 72  hours of onset . 
● Grade 3 infusion site reaction if successfully managed and resolved wit hin 72 hours . 
● Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with or without infection .  
● Alopecia, anorexia or fatigue . 
● Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting if not requiring tube feeding or total parenteral nutrition, 
or diarrhea and/or constipation if not requiring or prolonging hospitalization that can be

prescribed dose s within 7  days of onset . 
● Grade 3 liver function test (LFT) elevations that resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 7 days; LFT 
elevations las ting > 7  days that are considered to be clinically significant and at least 
possibly related to ASP7517 will be considered to be a DLT.  
● Immune -related AEs grade 3 that resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 7 days . 
● Grade 3 or higher hyperuricemia due to tumor lysis t hat resolves to ≤ grade 1 with 
medical interventions, including hospitalization with intravenous hydration and/or 
rasburicase . 
Dose evaluation and dose escalation stopping rules based on the BOIN design with target 
DLT rate of 0.30 and optimal interval of (0.236, 0.359) are as follows:  
Action  Number of Subjects Treated at  
Current Dose Level  
3 4 5 6 7 8 
Escalate dose if number of subjects with DLT ≤  0 0 1 1 1 1 
Stay at current dose level if number of subjects 
with DLT =  1 1 - 2 2 2 
De-escalate if number of subjects with  
DLT =  2 2 2 or 3  3 3 or 4  3 or 4  
Stop if number of subjects with DLT ≥  3 3 4 4 5 5 
DLT: dose limiting toxicity  
Dose escalation within individual subjects will not be allowed.  
4.1.4 Dose Escalation and Safety Committee  
A DESC consisting of sponsor representatives and i nvestigators will convene once a dose 
level cohort completes the  DLT observation period and data are available for review. Refer to 
[Section 10.4.1  Dose Escalation and Safety Committee] and DESC charter for additional 
details.  
The DESC  will also review the aggregate safety data from the phase 1 dose escalation and 
the phase 2 expansion cohorts.  
Study enrollment and st udy treatment will be temporarily interrupted during dose escalation 
pending review of the following:  
● Any death that is not related to disease progression occurring within 30 days of receiving 
investigational product.  
● Occurrence of two grade ≥ 4 DLTs in 2 study subjects.  
● Any grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis.  
Additional information  regarding DESC responsibilities, membership requirements and 
safety review tim e points are described in [Section 10.4 Dose Escalation and Safety 
Committee ] and further detailed in the DESC Charter.

Phase 2 will assess the safety and efficacy of ASP7517. This phase of the study may  open 
once the RP2D and/or MTD are determined from  the dose escalation phase, OR all of the 
following  conditions are met before the RP2D and/or MTD determination.  
● At least  1 subject in the dose escalation cohort (phase 1) achieves CRc for AML 
subjects, or CR, BM CR  or PR for MDS subjects . 
● The dose level to be expanded is deemed t olerable by the DESC. 
● The dose that will be opened for expansion  is determined to be equal or lower than the 
possible MTD.  
Phase 2  will include the following  groups and may enroll i n parallel and independently:  
● Subjects with R/R AML . 
● Subjects with R/R higher risk MDS.  
The CRc rate for subjects with R/R AML and CR + BM CR + PR rate for R/R higher risk 
MDS are continuousl y monitored using the Bayesian optimal p hase 2 (BO P2) design [Zho u 
et al, 2017]. The number of d ose levels investigated during p hase 2 will be based upon the 
data from p hase 1. Initially, 12  subjects will be enrolled at each dose level for each diseas e 
type during stage 1 of BOP2. If the response rate does not meet the optimal stopping 
boundaries (see table below), then stage 2 will open and an additional 20 subjects may be 
enrolled during this stage. Combining the data from stage 1 and stage 2, stage 3 may be 
opened for an additional 20 subjects for a total maximum samp le size of 52 for each disease 
type, if the response rate does not meet the  optimal stopping boundaries (see table below). 
Otherwise, the enrollment at that dose level will be  closed.  
When the total number of subjects reaches the maximum sample size of 52 , it may be 
concluded that  ASP7517 is efficacious if the number of responses is greater than  or equal to  
12 and 10 for AML and MDS, respectively. The number of subjects in stage 1, stage 2 and 
stage 3 may be changed according to the optimized stopping boundaries.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Stopping Rules based on Safety for Phase 2  
The stopping rules described below will be applied to both AML and MDS disease types.  
The safety in phase 2 will be monitored using a Bayesian logistic model based on  safety 
events including:  
⚫ All DLT data obtained at the time of the analysis  from both escalation and expansion 
cohorts .  
⚫ Drug related treatment emergent AEs leading to death.  
Safety monitoring with these models will start when phase 2 is opened. Enrollment in phase 2 
will be stopped  based on the following 2  criteria:  
⚫ If the posterior mean of the safety event  rate is higher than 30% as indicated by Bayesian 
logistic model across disease types at a given  dose level, then enrollment will be stopped  
in phase 2 at that dose level and at higher dose levels for that therapy.  
⚫ Additionally, if the posterior mean of th e safety event  rate is higher than 30% as indicated 
by Bayesian logistic model in a specific disease type at a dose level, enrollment of that 
dose lev el and any higher dose level will be stopped  for that disease type.  
4.1.6 Dose Rationale  
The starting  dose for the first in human (FiH)  study is anticipated to b e safe with minimal 
pharmacological  activity, as supported by the nonclinical studies.  The starting dose of 
ASP7517 is set to 1 × 106 cells/dose by intravenous infusion.  
Nonclinical pharmacology data suggest  ASP7517 -surrogate shows prolonged survival when 
administered intravenously  to a C1498 -WT1 inocu lated mouse AML model (per 30  g mouse), 
and prolonged survival was confirmed at the lowest dose level (5 × 102 cells/mouse) in the 
study . The dose of 5 × 102 cells/mouse  is calculated as 1.7  × 104 cells/kg (5  × 102 cells/30 g);  
therefore , the starting dose is estimated to be 1  × 106 cells/dose (1.7  × 104 cells/kg  × 60 kg) . 
The starting dose was also assessed according to the results of the nonclinical toxicology 
studies. Toxicities (e.g. , liver findings, changes in platelet count) were observed after 
ASP7517 intravenous administration at the lowest dose used in nonclinical studies 
(1 × 105 cells/kg: equivalent to 6 × 106 cells/dose, administered pe r 60 kg human), and the 
NOAEL  was not established in the studies. However, these adverse effects are considered to 
be immune -related reactions based on the mechanism of action of ASP7517, and it is expected 
that the toxicities are reversible and monitorable  in the nonclin ical studies . Consequently, it is 
considered possible to set the starting dose for the Fi H study as 1 × 106 cells/dose , 6-fold 
lower than the lowest dose of nonclinical toxicology studies , with careful clinical monitoring.  
The dosing regimen for the FiH st udy is  a total of up to 2 doses  in the escalation phase and up 
to 6 doses in the expansion phase, one dose in each  28-day cycle, which  is supported by 
nonclinical pharmacology data. In mice immunized with specific antigen expressing aAVC  at 
day 0 and day 2 8, NKT cells and T cells were stimulated  after first and second 
administration.  Also, long term a ntigen -specific antitumor immune memory was 
demonstrated in an EG7 inoculated mouse model after single administration .

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  6.2.2 Handling , Storage  and Accountability  
● The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all IP received and any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the IP.  
● Only subjects enrolled in the study ma y receive IP and only authorized study site 
personnel may supply or administer IP. Only IP with appropriate expiry/retest dating 
may be dispensed.  
● All IP must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in acc ordance with the labeled storage conditions and access must be 
limited to the investigator and authorized study site personnel.  
● The investigator, institution or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is

● Further guidance and instruction on final disposition of used and unused IP is provided 
in the pharmacy manual . 
Refer to the pharmacy manual for detailed infor mation regarding IP handling, storage and 
accountability of the IP . 
6.3 Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open -label study. Subject enrollment and dispensation of IP  will be performed via 
the interactive response technology (IRT) system. Specific IRT proce dures will be described 
in the respective study manual.  
6.3.1 Assignment and Allocation  
Priority for enrollment will be given to the phase 1 dose escalation portion before phase 2 
dose expansion.  
For p hase 2 enrollment, if more than 1 dose level is open for enro llment within a selected 
disease type, the newly enrolled subjects with that disease type will be randomly allocated  to 
1 of the open dose levels. Randomization will be weighted towards newly opened dose 
levels, with the allocation ratio based on the numbe r of open slots still  available at each dose 
level. For example, if dose level ‘x’ enrolled 3  subjects and dose level ‘y’ is newly opened for 
expansion, the next subject would be randomly allocated to dose level ‘x’ or ‘y’ with the ratio 
of 9:12.  
When esca lation and expansion cohorts are both open for enrollment, enrollment into 
escalation cohorts takes priority such that subjects who are eligible for both will be 
preferentially enrolled in the escalation cohorts.  
6.4 Investigational Product Compliance  
Dosing w ill take place in the clinical unit. The administration of IP will be supervised  to 
ensure treatment compliance . The exact day and time of IP administration will be

RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion). There must be no presenc e of 
Auer rods. There should be no evidence of extramedullary leukemia. The blast counts in 
peripheral blood must be ≤ 2%.   
● Complete Remission with Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp)  
For subjects to be classified as being in CRp at a post -baseline visit, they must achieve 
CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (< 100  109/L). 
● Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematological Recovery (CRi)  
For subjects to be classified as being in CRi at a post -baseline visit, they must fulfill all 
the criteria for CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual 
neutropenia (ANC < 1  109/L) with or without complete platelet recovery. RBC and 
platelet transfusion independence is not re quired.

For subjects to be classified as being in CRc at a post -baseline visit, they must either 
achieve CR, CRp or CRi at the visit.  
● Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh)  
For subjects to be classifie d as CRh at a post -baseline visit, if they have marrow blasts 
< 5%, partial hematologic recovery ANC ≥ 0.5 × 109/L and platelets ≥ 50 × 109/L, no 
evidence of extramedullary leukemia and cannot be classified as CR. The blast counts in 
peripheral blood must be ≤ 2%.  
● Partial Remission  (PR)  
For subjects to be classified as being in PR at a post -baseline visit, they must have bone 
marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells with evidence of peripheral recovery

50% in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate with the total marrow blasts 
between 5% and 25%. A value of less or equal than 5% blasts is also considered a PR if 
Auer rods are present. There should be no  evidence of extramedullary leukemia.  
● Not Evaluable (NE)/No Response (NR)  
In the situation where no bone marrow assessments are performed or myeloblast value is 
missing, blast value from peripheral blood is missing or ≤ 2%, and extramedullary 
leukemia is m issing or not present, the response will be classified as NE. In any case 
response cannot be categorized as CR, CRp, CRi, PR or NE, it will be categorized as 
NR.

7.1.1.3  Hematology Laboratory Assessments  
Primary endpoints of hematology clinical laboratory tests will be perfor med at every visit. 
Refer to [Section 9.4.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint] for definitions of CRc for subjects 
with R/R AML and CR + BM CR + PR for R/R hig her risk MDS.  
Secondary endpoints of hematology clinical laboratory tests will be performed at every visit. 
Refer to [Section 9.4.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint] for defi nitions of duration of 
remission, event -free survival (EFS), OS, CR, BM CR, best response, CRh, HI, and objective 
response.  
7.1.2 Bone Marrow Aspirations and/or Biopsies  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedules of Assessments [ Table  1 
and Table  2]. After the completion of Observation Period 1 (8 weeks), subjects remaining in 
the study, becaus e they achieved remission ( CRc or PR for AML subjects and CR , BM CR, 
PR, or HI  for MDS subjects ) or have clinical benefit as determined by in vestigator, will have 
bone marrow samples collected in Observation Period 2 every 3 months or if there is 
suspicion of relapse in the whole blood.  If bone marrow aspirate is unobtainable (e.g., dry 
tap), an additional  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  tube of whole blood should be collected 
instead. Bone marrow aspirate is required, and bone  marrow biopsy is preferred. In case of 
inadequate aspirate, bone marrow biopsy is required.  Samples must be submitted to a central 
laboratory for analysis. Please refer to the laboratory manual for additional information.

7.3 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in  [Appendix 12.4 AEs: Definitions and 
Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting ].  
The investigator and medically qualified designee(s) are resp onsible for detecting, documenting 
and recording events that met the definition of an AE or SAE. Collection, reporting and follow -
up of Special Situations and defect in IP follow the procedures for AE and SAE.  
7.3.1 Time Period for Collecting Adverse Event and S erious Adverse Event 
Information  
In order to identify any events that may be associated with study procedures and could lead to 
a change in th e conduct of the study, the sponsor  collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received IP. AE collection will begin from time of informed consent and continue through 
post-treatment period and at least 30 days after last IP dose and prior to the start of new 
anticancer treatment. In addition, the following will be collected regardless of the st art of new 
anticancer therapy:   
● Any IP-related SAE  that is ongoing will be followed until resolved  
● Any SAE that is deemed to be related to IP by the investigator  
7.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The methods of recording, evalua ting and assessing seriousness, causality and severity of 
AEs and SAEs are described in [Appendix 12.4 AEs: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Fo llow-up or Reporting]. Care will be taken not to introduce bias 
when detecting AEs and/or SA Es. Open -ended and non leading verbal questioning of the 
subject  is the preferred method to inquire about AE  occurrences.  
An AE with a change in severity is recorded  as a new AE.  
7.3.3 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
If after the protocol -defined AE collection period [ see Section 7.3.1  Time Period for 
Collecting AE and SAE Information] , an AE progresse s to an SAE, or the investigator learns 
of any (S)AE (SAE or AE)  including death, where he/she considers there is reasonable 
possibility it is related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify

19 Sep 2022  Astellas  Page 66 of 138 
Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  the sponsor.  Such events should be collected and followed up until resolved or judged to be 
no longer clinically significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can be 
fully characterized by the investigator.  
7.3.4 Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt  notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential, so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
In the case of an SA E, the investigator must contact the sponsor  by fax or email immediately 
(within 24 hours of awareness).  
Procedures for reporting SAEs to the sponsor are described in [Section 12.4.5  Reporting 
Procedures for SAEs or Defect of Investigational Product].  
7.3.5 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events  
Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not b e considered as an  (S)AE:  
● Disease p rogression: events including defined study endpoints that are clearly consistent 
with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease are not to be recorded 
as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data as outlined in 
[Secti on 7.1 Efficacy Assessments ]. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is 
due to anticipated disease progression and/or if there is eviden ce suggesting a causal 
relationship between the IP and the event, it should be reported as an (S)AE. All deaths 
up to 30 days after the final administration  of IP must be reported as an SAE, even if 
attributed to disease progression.  
● Pre-planned and elective hospital/clinical procedures/interventions or procedures for 
diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen during the course of the study . For example, admission for treatment of a  
pre-existing condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a 
worsening of the preexisting condition such as transfusion for preexisting anemia, 
leukopenia or thrombocytopenia will not be reported as an SAE. These procedur es are 
collect ed per the eCRF’s completion g uidelines.  
7.3.6 Special Situations  
Certain special situations observed in association with the IP, such as incorrect administration 
(e.g., wrong dose of IP or background therapy) are collected in the eCRF, as protocol 
deviation pe r [Section 10.3 Major Protocol Deviations]  or may require special reporting, as 
described below. These special situations are not considered AEs, but do require to  be 
communicated to Astellas as per the timelines defined below.  
If a special situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is to be assessed 
separately from the special situation and captured as an AE in  the eCRF . If the AE meets the 
definition of a n SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [Section 12.4.5  Reporting

special situation are to be included in the clinical description on the SAE worksheet . 
The special situations are:  
● Pregnancy  
● Medication error, overdose and use outside protocol  
● Misuse/abuse  
● Occupational exposure  
● (Suspicion of) Transmiss ion of infectious agent related to microbiological contamination 
at the site  
● Suspected drug -drug interaction  
Instructions and procedures for reporting special situations are provided in [Appendix 12.4.6  
Reporting Procedures for Special Situations].  
7.3.7 Defects of Investigational Product  
Defect is defined as the product defect, which may cause generally poor conditions where the 
cells cause adverse reactions that affect the human body. When a defect in IP occurs, the 
investigator must contact the sponsor by fax or email immediately (within 24 hours of 
awareness). Instructions and procedures for the expedited reporting of defects are provided in 
[Appendix 12.4.5  Reporting Procedures for SAEs or Defect of Investigational Product ]. 
7.3.8 Supply  of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study  
When new information becomes available that is necess ary for conducting the study properly, 
the sponsor will inform all investi gators involved in the study as well as the appropriate 
regulatory authorities. Investigators should inform the IRB/IEC of such information when 
needed.  
The investigator will also inform the subjects, who will be required to sign an updated ICF  in 
order to continue in the study.  
Specific to Japan : 
1. When information is obtained regarding serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions 
(or other) that are speci fied in Article 273 of the  Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and 
Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy 
Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics , in compliance with Article 80 -2 
Paragraph 6 of the Pharmaceutical  Affairs Law, the sponsor should in form all  
investiga tors involved in the study, head of the study site and appropriate  regulatory 
authorities of such information. The head of the study site who receives such information 
will decide whether the study shoul d be continued after he aring the opinions of the IRB. 
The investigator will supply the new information to the subjects, in compliance with 
[Appendix 12.1.5.2  Suppl y of New and Important Information Influencing the Subject’s 
Consent and Revision of the Written I nformation].

brochure , protocol, written information, information o n the matters coveri ng the quality 
of the test product , efficacy and safety, information necessary for conduct ing the study 
properly  or documents to be examined by the IRB , these documents should be sent to the 
IRB.  
3. When the sponsor receives a safety issue from any source either Japan or worldwide that 
requires an urgent safety measure (USM) to be implemented, then the sponsor  will report 
that safety information to all study sites in Japan and rest of world (within 24  hours of 
awareness).  
7.3.9 Urgent Safety Measures  
An USM i s an intervention that  is not defined by the protocol and can be put in place with 
immediate effect without needing to gain prior approval by the sponsor, relevant competent 
authorities  (CA) , IRB/IEC, where applicable, in ord er to protect subjects  from any immediate 
hazard to their health and/or safety. Either the investigator or the sponsor can initiate a USM. 
The cause of a USM can be safety -, product - or procedure -related.  
7.3.10  Reporting Urgent Safety Me asures  
In the event of a potential USM, the investigator must contact the study physician and/or 
Astellas team member (within 24 hours of awareness). Full details of the potential USM are 
to be recorded in the subject’s medical records. The sponsor may req uest additional 
information related to the event to support their evaluation.  
If the event is confirmed to be a USM , the sponsor will take appropriate action to ensure the 
safety and welfare of the subjects . These actions may include but are not limited t o a change 
in study procedures or study treatment, halting  further enrollment in the study , or stopping 
the study in its entirety. The sponsor or s ponsor's designee will notify the relevant CA and 
concerned ethics committee  within the timelines required pe r current local regulations, and 
will inform the investigators , as required. When required, investigators must notify their 
IRB/IEC within timelines set by regional regulations.

9.1 Sample Size  
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation)  
The sample size for the dose escalation phase is not based on a statistical power calculation. 
The number of subjects enrolled will be d ependent on the DLT incidence. The estimated 
number of subjects, a minimum of 6 evaluable and up to 18, should provide adequate 
information for the dose escalation and safety objectives of the study.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Phase 2 (Dose Expansion)  
The sample size in phase 2 is u p to 104  subjects per dose level. Each dose level may enroll up 
to 52 R/R AML subjects and up to 52 R/R higher risk MDS subjects. The response rate is 
monitore d using the BOP2 design. For AML, with assumption of the efficacious CRc rate is 
30% and the inef ficacious CRc rate is 15%, the statistical power would be approximately 
0.83 while controlling the type I error rate at 0.10. For MDS, with assumption of the 
efficacious CR + BM CR + PR rate is 25% and the inefficacious CR + BM CR + PR rate is 
12%, the sta tistical power would be approximately 0.83, while controlling the type I error 
rate at 0.10.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  CR + BM CR + PR rate is defined for MDS subjects as the number of subjects who achieve 
the best response of CR + BM CR + PR divided by the number of subjects in the analysis 
population. Response to treatment will be defined per Cheson criteria [Cheson et al, 2006].  
Response rates will be calculated and its 90% confidence interval will be constructed by 
Clopper -Pearson method by dose level for phase 1 and by dose level and disease type for 
phase 2.  
9.4.1.2  Sensitivity  Analysis  
Sensitivity analysis will be defined in the SAP.  
9.4.1.3  Phase 2 Expansion  
The CRc rate for subjects with R/R AML and CR + BM CR + PR rate for R/R higher risk 
MDS are continuously monitored using the BOP2 design [Zhou et al, 2017]. The number of 
dose levels investigated during phase 2 will be based upon the data fr om phase 1. Initially, 
12 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level for each disease type during stage 1 of BOP2. 
If the response rate does not meet the optimal stopping boundaries (see table below), then 
stage 2 will open and an additional 20 subjects may be enrolled during this stage. Combining 
the data from stage 1 and stage 2, stage 3 may be opened for an additional 20 subjects for a 
total maximum sample size of 52 for each disease type, if the response rate does not meet the 
optimal stopping boundar ies (see table below). Otherwise, the enrollment at that dose level 
will be closed.  
When the total number of subjects reaches the maximum sample size of 52, it may be 
concluded that ASP7517 is efficacious if the number of responses is greater than or equa l to 
12 and 10 for AML and MDS, respectively. The number of subjects in stage 1, stage 2 and 
stage 3 may be changed according to the optimized stopping boundaries.

9.7 Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinuation of the Study)  
No interim analysis is planned.  
Safety, pharmacokinetic and other clinical data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to 
determine if the study will proceed to the next dose level/phase.  
For phase 2, according to the BOP2 design, the futility analysis for efficacy will be 
performed at t he end of stage 1 and stage 2. Twelve subjects will be enrolled at each dose 
level for each diseas e type during stage 1 of BOP2. If the response rate does not meet the 
optimal stopping boundaries, then stage 2 will open and an additional 20 subjects may be 
enrolled during this stage. Combining the data from st age 1 and stage 2, stage 3 may be 
opened for an additional 20 subjects for a total maximum sample size of 52 for each disease 
type, if the response rate does not meet the optimal stopping boundaries.  
The safety in phase 2 will be monitored using Bayesian l ogistic model based on all DLT data 
obtained at the time of the analysis for both escalation and expansion cohorts and drug -
related TEAEs leading to death. Safety monitoring with these models will start when phase 2 
is opened. Enrollment in phase 2 may be held based on the following 2  criteria:

19 Sep 2022  Astellas  Page 80 of 138 
Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  1. If the posterior mean of the DLT rate is higher than 30% as indicated by Bayesian 
logistic model across disease types at a given dose level, then enrollment will be stopped 
in phase 2 at that dose level and at higher  dose levels for that therapy.  
2. Additionally, if the posterior mean of the DLT rate is higher than 30% as indicated by 
Bayesian logistic model in a specific disease type at a dose level, enrollment of that dose 
level and any higher dose -level will be stoppe d for that disease type.  
9.8 Additional Conventions  
If the start and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication s are incomplete, imputed dates 
will be used to determ ine whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent  or to allocate a 
concomitant medication to the  study period it was taken . 
See the SAP for details of the definition for analysis windows to be used for analyses by visit.  
Study s ites that do not enroll at least 1 subject will be pooled for analyses by study site. The 
pooling decision s will be made and  documented prior to study hard lock.  
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will be done. Exceptions are the start 
and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medications if they are missing on day of first IP 
administration . The imputed dates will be used to assess if the AEs or concom itant 
medications are treatment emergent  or concomitant, respectively. Listings of the AEs and 
concomitant medications will present the actual partial dates; imputed dates will not be 
shown.  
10 OPERATIONAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1 Data Collection  
The investigator or site designee will enter data collected using an electronic data capture  
system. In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the investigator or 
designee should record data (including clinical laboratory values, if applicable) in the eCRF 
within 5 days after the subject’s visit.   
The investigator or site designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and that all entries are verifiable with the source . These 
documents should be appropriately maintained by the study site. 
The monitor should verify the data in the eCRFs with the source and confirm that ther e are no 
inconsistencies among  them.  
Clinical l aboratory tests are performed and analyzed by the institution’s local laboratory. The 
local laboratory results must be submitted for centralized data entry (centralized l aboratory 
data will be transferred electronically to the sponsor or designee at predefined intervals 
during the study). The c entral ized laboratory data vendor will provide the sponsor or 
designee with a complete and clean copy of the data.

Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group. 
Descr iptive statistics will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median and maximum for continuous endpoints and frequency and percentage for categorical 
endpoints.   
10.2.2  Medical History  
A detailed medical history for each subject will be o btained during screening period and will 
be summarized by treatment group.  
10.3 Major Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented  or intended as a systematic change . All deviations from the protocol are to be 
recorded. A protocol  waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an 
investigator to deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly prohibited.  
The investigator  is responsible for ensu ring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol and must protec t the rights, safety and 
well-being  of subjects. The investigator  should not implement any deviation from, or changes 
of, the protocol, unless it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects.  
A major protocol  deviation is one  that may potentially impact the completeness, accuracy or 
reliability of data contributing to the primary endpoint or affect the rights, safety or 
well-being of a subject . Major protocol deviations will have additional reporting 
requirements.  
When a major deviation from the protocol  is identified for an individual subject, the 
investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor is notified. The sponsor will follow  up with 
the investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safety 
and/or efficacy  of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study.  
The major protocol deviation criteria  that will be summarized at t he end of the study  are as 
follows:  
PD1 - Entered  into the study even though the subject did not satisfy entry criteria   
PD2 - Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn  
PD3 - Received wr ong treatment or incorrect dose  
PD4 - Recei ved excluded concomitant treatment  
The investigator will also assure that deviation s meeting IRB/IEC and appropriate  regulatory 
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriately. All documentation and 
communicatio ns to the IRB/IEC and app ropriate  regulatory authorities will be provided to the 
sponsor and maintained wi thin the Trial Master File.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  10.4 STUDY ORGANIZATION  
10.4.1  Dose Escalation  and Safety Committee  
A DESC  consisting of sponsor representatives and investigators will convene once a dose 
level cohort completes the DLT observation period and data are available for review. 
Additional details regarding responsibilities, membership requirements and safety review 
time points are included in the DESC Charter . The DESC will also review the aggregate 
safety data from the phase 1 dose escalation and  the phase 2 expansion cohorts.  
While safety data from the DLT observation period in the escalation cohorts are the 
minimu m safety data needed for the DESC  meeting, all available safety findings will be 
considered by the DESC.  The DESC  will assess whether a longer DLT observation period is 
warranted, based on emerging data. Additionally, only when determining RP2D, the DESC  
may choose a more conservative dosing decision  than the MTD selected  by BOIN  design , 
based on evaluation of the safety data and other available data.  
The decision on the dose level for the next cohort will be based on the BOIN design. Also, 
MTD will be dete rmined by BOIN from at least 6 subjects with the maximum of 8 subjects 
under the maximum of 2 cohorts. The dose for phase 2 expansion will not be higher than the 
MTD.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  12.3 Contraception Requirements  
WOCBP who are eligible for participation in the study, including those who choose complete 
abstinence , must have pregnancy tests  as specified in  the S chedule s of A ssessments  [Table  1 
and Table  2]. Pregnancy test results must confirm that the subject is not pregnant.  
WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND METHO DS OF 
CONTRACEPTION DEFINITIONS  
A female  is considered fertile (i.e., WOCBP) following m enarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal unless permanently sterile.  
Females  in the following categories are not considered WOCBP : 
● Prem enarchal  
● Premenopausal with 1 of the following  (i.e., permanently sterile) : 
○ Documented hysterectomy  
○ Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
○ Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
● Postmenopausal  
A postmenopausal state is defined as at least 12 months after last menstrual bleeding without 
an alternative medical cause.  
In case the last menstrual bleeding cannot be clearly determined, confirmation with more 
than 1 follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH) measurement of at least >  40 IU/L (or higher per 
local institutional guidelines) is required.  
Females on hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and whose menopausal status is in d oubt 
will be required to use 1 of the non estrogen hormonal highly effective contr aception methods 
if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  12.4 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting  
12.4.1  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untow ard medical occurrence in a subject  administered a n IP, and which does 
not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated wit h the use of IP  whether or not 
considered related to the IP . 
12.4.1.1  Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g. , hematology, biochemistry  or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessment (e.g., vital signs , physical examination , ECGs or radiographic scans ), 
including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to underlying disea se, is to 
be reported as an (S)AE.  
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety assessment , 
which is associated with the underlying disease , does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition.  
Repeating an abnormal laboratory test or other safety assessment, in the absence of any of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error does  not require reporting as an AE.  
12.4.1.2  Potential Cases of Drug -induced Liver Injury  
Refer to [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment ] for detailed instructions 
on drug induced liver injury . Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT  concurrent or with 
abnorm al elevations in TBL  that meet the c riteria outlined in [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safety 
Monitoring and Assessment ], in the absence of other causes of liver injury, are considered 
potential  cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and are always to be 
considered important medical events and reported per [Appendix  12.4.5  Reporting  
Procedures for SAEs or Defect of Investigational Product ].  
12.4.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, the event :  
● Results in death  
● Is life -threatening (A n AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subje ct at immediate risk of death; i t 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death .) 
● Resu lts in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
● Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect

- CONFIDENTIAL - 
 
19 Sep 2022  Astellas  Page 98 of 138 
Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  ● Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed pe r study) 
or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned 
hospital ization is not caused by an AE)   
● Other medically important events (defined in paragraph below)  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding w hether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization , but may jeopardize the 
subject  or may req uire intervention to prevent 1  of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may result in disability/incapacity, usually are 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchosp asm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization , or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
12.4.3  Criteria for Causal Relationship to Investigational Product  
A medically qualified investigator is obligated to assess the relation ship between IP and each 
occurrence of each (S)AE. This investigator will use medical judgment as well as the 
reference safety information [ Section 2.1.2  Summary of Key Safety Information for 
Investigational Product ] to determine the relationship.  The causality assessment is 1  of the 
criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
The investigator is requested to provide an explanat ion for the causality assessment for each 
(S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the (S)AE and has 
provided an assessment of causality.   
Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the IP and each 
(S)AE  will be assessed by answering “yes” or “no”  to the question “ Do you consider that 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP? ” 
When making an assessment of causality, the following factors are to be cons idered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a “reasonable possibility ” 
that an (S)AE may have been caused by the IP (rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out) 
or if there is evidence to reasonably deny a causal rela tionship:  
● Has the subject been administered IP ?  
● Plausibility  (i.e., could the event been caused by the suspect  drug? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinical 
and study  data, etc. ) 
● De-challen ge/dose reduction/r echallenge:  
○ De-challenge: Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after only stopping the dose of 
the suspect drug  without any treatment ? 
○ Dose reduction: Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after reducing the dose of the 
suspect drug?  
○ Rechallenge : Did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?

19 Sep 2022  Astellas  Page 99 of 138 
Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  ● Laboratory or other test results : a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the IP (e.g., based on values pre -, during and 
post-treatment)  
● Available alternative explanations independent of IP exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history, concurrent or underlying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family history, season, location, etc. , and strength of the 
alternative explanation   
● Finally, judging which are more likely b ased on all the a bove contents, factors of 
reasonable possibility or confounding factors, comprehensive judgment of p lausible 
temporal relationship between exposure to th e IP and (S)AE onset and/or resolution  will 
be provided . Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the IP? 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include  in the initial report to the sponsor . However, it is very important that 
the investigator always assesses  causality for every event before the initial transmission of the 
SAE data to the sponsor . With limited or insufficient information about the event to  make an 
informed medical judgment and in absence of any indication or evidence to establish a causal 
relationship, a causality assessment of “no” is to be considered. In such instance, the 
investigator is expected to obtain additional information regardin g the event as soon as 
possible and to re -evaluate the causality upon receipt of additional information. The 
medically qualified investigator may revise his/her assessment of causality in light of new 
information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE fol low-up report and update the eCRF  
with the new information and updated causality assessment.  
12.4.4  Criteria  for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be graded usin g the NCI -CTCAE 
guidelines (version 5.0). The items that are not stipulated in the NCI -CTCAE  guidelines 
(version  5.0) will be assessed according to the criteria below and entered into the eCRF : 
Table  10 Grading Scale Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
Grade  Assessment Standard  
1 - Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 - Moderate  Minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL†  
3 - Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life threatening, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL‡  
4 - Life-threatening  Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated  
5 - Death  Death relat ed to AE  
ADL: activities of daily living; AE: adverse event . 
†Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using  the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
‡Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications and not 
bedridden.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result and neonatal data , etc., should be included in this 
information.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy is to be reported for a female 
subject as an AE in the eCRF  or SAE per [Appendix  12.4.5  Reporting Procedures for SAEs 
or Defect of Investigational Product ]. For (S)AEs experienced by a female partner of a male 
subject, (S)AEs are to be reported via the SAE worksheet .  
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy when  also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below:  
● “Spontaneous abortion ” includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.  
● Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the IP.  
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the IP is judged as “possible” by the 
investigator.  
● Congenital anomaly (including anomaly in miscarried fetus)  
Unless a co ngenital anomaly is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embryo or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by visual examination  or other 
means as appropriate . (S)AEs experienced by the newborn/infant should be reported via the 
pregnancy re porting form. Generally, follow up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following 
the estimated delivery date.   
12.4.6.2  Medic ation Error, Overdose and “Off -label Use”  
If a medication error  (defined as an unintended failure in the treatment process t hat leads to, 
or has the potential to lead to, harm to the subject) , overdose or “off -label use” (i.e., use 
outside of what is stated in the protocol) is suspected, refer to [Section 10.3 Major Protocol 
Deviations ]. Any associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF . If the AE meets the 
definition of a n SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in [Appendix  12.4.5  
Reporting Procedures for SAEs or Defect of Investigational Product]  together with the details 
of the medication error , overdose and/or “off -label use .” 
No information on overdose of ASP7517 i s available. As ASP7517 is administered 
intravenously, the pharmacy manual will provide detailed instructions for preparation to 
ensure that the correct dose is dispensed. In the event of an overdose, subjects should be 
managed by symptomatic and supportiv e care and observed in a controlled medical setting. 
In the event of suspected ASP7517 medication error, the subject should receive supportive 
care and monitoring.  The medical monitor/e xpert should be contacted as app licable.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  12.5 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide guidance for the monitoring of drug -induced liver 
injury during the course of the study. It should be noted that this section does not specify the 
End of Study analyses of liver enzymes. The end of study liver enz ymes analyses will be 
described in the SAP. Any subject enrolled in a study  with active drug therapy and reveals an 
increase of serum  aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 ×  ULN or biliru bin > 2 ×  ULN should 
undergo detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at  least ALP, ALT, AST  and TBL). 
Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. Subjects should 
be asked if they have any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction.  
Definition of Liver Abnormalities  
Confirmed abnormali ties will be characterized as  moderate and severe where ULN is as 
shown below.  
Table  11 Moderate and Severe Liver Abnormalities  
 ALT or AST   TBL  
Moderate  > 3 × ULN  or > 2 × ULN  
Severe  > 3 × ULN  and†  > 2 × ULN  
ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; TBL: total bilirubin; ULN: upper limit of normal  
†Samples taken simultaneously or within maximum 24 hours . 
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any of 
the following:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
● ALT or AST > 3 ×  ULN and † TBL > 2 ×  ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) 
> 1.5 (if INR t esting is applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 3 ×  ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)   
† Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up. 
Follow -up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. The study site personnel are to complete 
the liver abnormality case report form (LA -CRF).  Subjects with confirmed  abno rmal LFTs  
should be followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs  should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly , and then weekly 
or less if abnormali ties stabilize or the IP  has been discontinued an d the subject is asymptomatic.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology, may be considered an important medical event  and may be reported as a SAE. The 
sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
functio n abnormalities po ssibly attributable to IP  are observed.  
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Symptoms 
and new -onset diseases are to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF . Illnesses and 
conditions such as hypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may lead 
to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese hyperlipoprote inemic and/or diabetic subject s, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.  The investigator should ensure that the medical history form 
captures any illness that predates study enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function.  
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications are to be entered in the eCRF . Information on alcohol, other 
substance us e and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF  or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
● Based on the subject’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
○ Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other  infectious agents)  
○ Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
○ Other clinical laboratory tests , including INR  and direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterol ogy or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any additional testing and possibl e etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Treatment Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury,  the subject may 
be discontinued from study treatment. The investigator may determine that it is not in the 
subject’s best interest to continue study treatment. Discontinuation of study treatment should 
be considered if:

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Hy’s Law d efinition : Drug -induced jaundice caused by hepatocellular injury, without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 % to 50% 
mortality (or transplant).  
The 2 “requirements” for Hy’s Law are:  
1. Evidence that a drug can cause hepato cellular -type injury, generally show n by an increase 
in AT  elevat ions > 3  × ULN (“2 ×  ULN elevations are too common in treated and 
untreated subject s to be discriminating”).  
2. Cases of increased TBL (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent AT elevations at least 
3 × ULN and no evidence of intra - or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated ALP) 
or Gilbert’s syndrome [Temple, 2006].  
FDA Guidance for Industry  titled, “Drug -induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation”  issued by the FDA on July 2009:  
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3 -fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control drug 
or placebo.  
2. Among  subjects showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much great er than 
3 × ULN, 1  or more also show elevation of serum TBL to >  2 × ULN, without initial 
findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP).  
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre existing or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of 
causing the observed injury.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  12.8 Pharmacogenomic Analysis With Banked Sample  
INTRODUCTION  
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturally occurring differences in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression of genes  based on genetic variation may impact what 
treatment options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by 
technologies such as genotyping, gene sequencing, statistical geneti cs and Genome -Wide 
Association s tudies, the relationship betw een gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy or 
toxicity may be better understood. As many diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic 
variations, PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determining the way a 
subject may or may not r espond to a drug.  
OBJECTIVES  
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze  or determine  genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or to xicity/safety.  
By analyzing genetic variations, it may be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity.  
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N 
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study may participate  in the PGx sub study. 
Subjects must provide written consent prior to providing any blood samples that may be used 
at a later time for PGx analysis.  
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE  
Subjects who con sent to participate in this sub study will provide 4 to 6 mL  sample of whole 
blood and buccal swab  per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by the 
unique subject number.  Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as directed by 
Astellas.  
PGx ANALYSIS  
Details on the potential PGx analysis can not be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis if evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing the drug’s 
pharmaco kinetics, efficacy and/or safety.  
DISPOSAL OF PGx  SAMPLES/DATA  
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a p eriod of up to 15 years following study 
database hard-lock. If there is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroyed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at 
any time. When a subject’s with draw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroyed. The results of any PGx analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will  
be retained at Astellas indefinitely unless otherwise specified by local regulation .

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  12.9 Clinical Study Continuity  
INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide acceptable alternate methods to assess safety and 
efficacy parameters, as appropriate, in the event the clinical study is interrupted at the 
country, state, site or subject level during any crisis (e.g., natural disaster, pandemic).  
BENEFIT -RISK RATIONA LE 
Maintaining the safety of clinical study subjects and delivering continuity of care in th e 
clinical study setting is paramount during any crisis. The site is expected to follow the 
protocol and associated Schedules of Assessments [ Table  1, Table  2, Table  3 and Table  4] 
unless the site principal investigator discusses the need with the Astellas medical monitor to 
implement the alternate measures.  
The approach outlined within this appendix defines which assessments are required to 
maintain a favorable benefit/risk to the subject, to maintain overall study integrity and to 
provide acceptable alternate methods to complete the study required assessments and 
procedures if study activities are unable to be performed as described in [ Section 7 Study 
Procedures and Assessments] due to a crisis.  
INFORMED CONSENT  
Subjects who need to follow any or all of the alternate measures outlined in this Appendix 
will be required to provide informed consent which explicitly informs them of the nature of, 
and rationale for these changes, and gain their agreement to continue participation in the 
study prior to the implementation of any of these changes. In the event the urgency of 
imple menting the alternate measures does not allow for the subject to provide written consent 
prior to implementation, the principal investigator or designee will obtain oral agreement 
from the subject followed by written documentation as soon as is feasible. A  separate 
addendum to the study informed consent will be provided to document the subject’s consent 
of the changes.  
SUBJECT PROCEDURES A SSESSMENT  
Sites with subjects who are currently enrolled into this clinical study may consider 
implementing the alternat e methods outlined below if one or more of the following 
conditions are met due to the crisis:  
● Regional or local travel has been restricted, inclusive of mandatory shelter in place 
measures, which makes subject travel to/from the study site nearly impossib le 
● Site facilities have been closed for clinical study conduct  
● Site has been restricted to treating subjects with conditions outside of the scope of the 
study  
● Site personnel have temporarily relocated the conduct of the study to a location that 
place a bu rden on the subject with respect to time and travel  
● Subject(s) have temporarily relocated from the current study site to an alternate study site 
avoid placing a burden on the subject with respect to travel

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  ● Subject(s) have temporarily relocated from their h ome location and the new distances 
from the site would cause undue burden with respect to time and travel  
● Subject has risk factors for which traveling to the site poses an additional risk to the 
subject’s health and safety  
Adherence to the original protoco l as reflected in the Schedules of Assessments [ Table  1, 
Table  2, Table  3 and Table  4] is expected, where plausible, in the case of a crisis. The 
alternate measures as noted in Table  13, Table  14, Table  15 and Table  16 below are only 
permissible in the event of a crisis, and after discussing the need with the Astellas medical 
monitor to implement the alternate measures. This is to allow for continuity of receiving 
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) and maintai ning critical safety and efficacy 
assessments for subjects participating in the study at a time of crisis.  
If one or more of the alternate measures noted below is implemented for a subject, the site 
should document in the subject’s source document the just ification for implementing the 
alternate measure and the actual alternate measures that were implemented, along with the 
corresponding time point(s).

If any of the conditions outlined above in the Subject s Procedures Assessment are met , one or 
all of the following mitigating strategies will be employed, as needed, to ensure continuity of 
IP supply to the subjects:   
● Increase  stock of I P on site to reduce number of shipments required, if site space will 
allow . 
DATA COLLE CTION REQUIREMENTS  
Additional data may be collected in order to indicate how participation in the study may have 
been affected by a crisis and to accommodate data collection resulting from alternate 
measures implemented to manage the conduct of the study a nd subject safety.  
● Critical assessments for safety and efficacy based on study endpoints to be identified as

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  Definition of Key Study Terms  
Terms  Definition of Terms  
Baseline  Assessments of subjects as they enter a study  before they receive any 
treatment.  
Endpoint  Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study . 
Note : Not all endpoints are themselves assessments since certain endpoints 
might apply to populations or emerge from analysis of results. That is, 
endpoints might be facts about asses sments (e.g., prolongation of survival).  
Enroll  To register or enter  a subject into a study. Note : Once a su bject has received 
the investigational product or placebo, the protocol applies to the subject.  
Intervention  The drug, device, therapy or process  under investigation in a study  that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study  (e.g., health -
related qu ality of life, efficacy, safety and  pharmacoeconomics).  
Investigational 
period  Period of time where major interests of protocol objectives are o bserved, and 
where the test product  or comparative drug (sometimes without 
randomization) is given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment 
after completing  administration of the test product  or comparative drug.  
Post investigational 
period  Period of time after the last assessment of the protocol. Follow -up 
observations for sustained adverse events and/or survival are done in this 
period.  
Randomization  The process of assigning subjects to treatment or control groups us ing an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.  
Note : Unequal randomization is used to allocate subjects into groups at a 
diffe rential rate; for example, 3  subjects may be assigned to a treatment 
group for every one assigned to t he control group.  
Screening  A process of active consideration of potential su bjects for enrollment  in a 
study . 
Screen failure  Potential subject who signed the informed consent form,  but did not meet 1 
or more criteria required for participation in the study and was  not enrolled . 
Screening period  Period of time before entering the investigational period, usually from the 
time when a subject signs the consent  form until just before the test product  
or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is  given to a 
subject.  
Study period  Period of time from the first study site initiation date to the last study site 
completing the study.  
Variable  Any quantity  that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Version 7.5 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 5  13 ATTACHMENT 1:  NONSU BSTANTIAL AMENDMENT 5 
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Protocol 7517 -CL-0101 A Phase 1/2 Open -label Study Investigating the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ASP7517 in Subjects with 
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Relapsed/Refractory Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS)  
Amendment 5 Nonsubstantial 19 Sep 2022  
This amendment is considered to be  nonsubstantial  based on the criteria set forth in A rticle 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament 
and the Council of the European Union  because it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity of participants nor the scientific 
value of the study.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The overall rationale for this amendment is to update the protocol to adjust study timelines, provide clarification and correct errors.  
Summary of Changes

Clinical Trial Period: Approximately 6 weeks; start J Phase of Development: I 
date to be determined 
Clinical Trial Design: This is a single-center repeated insult patch test in healthy male and female subjects 
aced 18 to 79 years. inclusive. 
Objectives: The first primary objective of this trial is to determine by repetitive epidermal contact, the primary 
or cumulative irritation potential of a test material. The second primary objective of this trial is to determine •· 
by reoetitive eoidermal contact, the allergic contact sensitization ootential of a test material. 
Methodology: Subjects will be patched with a test material, a positive control and a negative control 10 times 
over 40 da ys, 9 during Induction Phase and 1 during Challenge Phase. Each patch will be worn for 
approximately two days. Before each patch application, the test site will be evaluated using the Erythemal 
Scoring Scale (ESS) and Additional Reaction Scoring. Following a Rest Phase of approximately 10 to 14 days, 
the subjects will again be pa tched on a virgin test site with the test material (but not the negative control, nor • 
the positive control). After two days of skin contact, the test sites will be evaluated using the ESS and 
Additional Reaction Scoring on removal day and Days 1 and 2 post-removal. The ESS and Additional Reaction , 
Scoring results will be evaluated to determine the allergic potential of the test material. The three test sites · 
will be as follows: test material; saline neoatlve control: and oositive control (0.4% SLS). 
Number of Subjects Planne d and Analyzed: Approximately 57 subjects will be enrolled in the trial so that at! 
least ?0 subjects will complete the trial. Data from all subjects who complete the Induction Phase will bej 
analyzed for irritant contact dermatitis potential. Data from all subjects who complete the Challenge Phase wi!J 1) 
. be analyzed for allerqic contact sensitization ootential. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Healthy adult male and non-pregnant females aged 18-79 years, 
inclusive. 
Test Material, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch Number: The test material, approximate 8 mm disc of 
NeoMatriX™, will be applied to the cotton pad of each patch. Patches consisting of the test material and 
controls will be aoolied to soecific test sites on the back of each subiect. 
Duration of Treatment: Fresh patches of test material and controls during the Induction Phase (approximately: 
3 weeks); no patches during the Rest Phase (approximately 2 weeks); and one patch of test material d1,1ring 
Challenge Phase (approximately 1 week). No negative control nor positive control will be applied d1,1rir:ig the.

1 Background 
A repeated insult patch test is a test devised to ascertain if an agent has the potential to cause contact 
irritation or contact allergy in the skin (Reference 12.1 and 12.2). Allergy is only elicited in 
immunologically competent individuals who have become sensitized through exposure to the agent 
following repeated cutaneous patch applications. 
2 Trial Objective 
The first primary objective of this trial is to determine by repetitive epidermal contact, the primary or 
cumulative irritation potential of a test material. 
The second primary objective of this trial is to determine by repetitive epidermal contact, the ailf-!rgic 
contact sensitization potential of a test material. "

6.1 Design 
This is a single-center RIPT in healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 79 years; 
inclusive. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 7 days prior to the first .dose 
administration. Subjects will be asked to appear at the Testing Facility on Day 0 for the first 
application of patches. During the Induction Phase subjects will be pa tched 9 times in 21 
days. Evaluations of the test sites will occur prior to patch application. The scores of these 
evaluations will be analyzed for irritant contact dermatitis potential. 
After an approximately 2 week Rest Phase, subjects will return to the Testing Facility fqr the 
Challenge Phase. Virgin sites on the subjects' back will receive patches. The patches wilJ 
remain on the test sites for two days of continuous skin contact. Evaluations of the sites wi!I 
occur the day of patch removal and 1 day and 2 days after patch removal. The scores of 
these evaluations will be analyzed for allergic contact sensitization potential. i ,

' 
Also, each subject will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information may, be 
obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations by the trial 
personnel or spontaneous reports from the subjects. This includes AEs resulting from concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications or progressive disease states. 
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited or noted during examination, shall be recorded on the subject's 
CRF using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4. 
The PI will evaluate all AEs for their relationship to, or association with the test material ( or .other 
causes) and their intensity. Additionally, the actions taken (e.g., reduction of test material 
concentration, discontinuation of test material application, administration of treatment,. etc.) and the 
resulting outcome of the AE will be indicated on a CRF (e.g., Sponsor, CPT, MedWatch or other 
appropriate Form). ' 
Any subject who is withdrawn from the trial due to an AE will be followed until the outcome of the event 
is determined, and the PI will prepare a written summary of the event and document the available 
follow-up information on a CRF. ;. '~ . ' : \:,\,,

Death 
If the Grade changes within a day, the maximum Grade shall be recorded. If the Grade 
changes over a longer period of time, the changes shall be recorded as separate _events 
(having separate onset and stop dates for each grade). 
8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
The PI will evaluate all serious AEs as to their intensity, relation to test material, outcome, 
and action taken. An SAE is defined as any AE that suggests a signi_ficant clinical hazard, 
contraindication, side effect, or precaution. This includes any event which: ' 
• Results in death; 
• Is life-threatening; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Is an important medical event based on medical judgment, which jeopardizes the 
subject and requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome's 
listed above. 1 
-.~ • ·; 
,,-, ,I'\! 
ANY SAE, INCLUDING DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE, WHICH OCCURS DURING THE TRIAL, 
WHETHER OR NOT RELATED TO THE TEST MATERIAL, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE 
SPONSOR OR MEDICAL MONITOR WITHIN 24 HOURS OF WHEN THE PI BECAME AWARE OF 
THE SAE. 
Dayna Healy 
dhealy@nextgenbiologics.com 
The PI must complete an AE form and send the form to the Medical Monitor or Sponsor 
within 24 hours of when the PI became aware of the SAE. · : 
CPT may supply MedWatch Forms for SAE reporting, but the responsibi,lity for reportinq SAEs 
to FDA rests with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor. If additional information regarding :a 
previously submitted SAE is obtained, a follow-up SAE report will be completed and sent to 
the Sponsor or Medical Monitor as indicated above. A copy of safety reports that c1r¢ filed 
with the FDA will be sent to each PI participating in any ongoing trials the Spo~~or is 
conducting with the same test material. : i;t;

The PI will promptly notify the IRB for only the following AEs. 
• A single occurrence of a serious event that is uncommon and strongly associated with 
drug exposure. 
• A single occurrence, or more often a small number of occurrences of a serious, event 
that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but uncomm on in the clinic;a:I trlal 
populations. 
• Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on an aggregate analysis, is determined to be 
an unanticipated problem. There should be a determination that the series pf AEs 
represents a signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and involve risk to 
human subjects. 
• An SAE that is described in the investigator's brochure, protocol, or informed consent 
documents, but occurs at a specificity that is inconsistent with prior observations., AA. 1 
• An SAE that is described or addressed in the investigator's brochure, protocol' or 
informed consent documents, but for which the rate of occurrence in the trial 
represents a clinically significant increase in the expected rate of occurrence. 
• Any other AE or safety finding that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigator's 
brochure, clinical trial protocol, or informed consent documents, or would prompt other 
action by the IRB to ensure the protection of human subjects. 
8.4 Management of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be reported from the time a signed and da ted informed consent form is obtained 
until completion of the last trial-related procedure. Those AEs meeting the definition of SAEs 
must be reported using the Adverse Event Form, including SAEs spontaneously reported to 
the PI within 30 days after the subject has completed the trial (including post-trial follow 
up). The Sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities. . ' ~ I 
All pregnancies occurring during clinical trials must be reported to the Sponsor, or its 
designee, by the PI within 24 hours of observation or notification o~ the occurrence. AU 
efforts should be made to obtain follow-up information regarding the outcome of pregnancy 
and any postnatal sequelae in the infant. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is not ah 
SAE, complications or serious outcomes of the pregnancy must be reported as appropriate. 
Events that meet the criteria for an SAE must be reported. Pregnancy is consid~(id ah 
exclusion criterion in this trial. Any trial subject who becomes pregnant durin~ ; trial 
participation must promptly discontinue further administration of the test material. 
Symptomatic treatment of suspected AEs shall be initiated as medically indicated. '. Any such 
treatment must be recorded on the CRF. Interruption or discontinuation of test rnateri~I 
application may also be required in some circumstances. Causes of AEs other than the trial 
test material (such as intercurrent illness, other medications, or treatments) shall be 
excluded before adjustment, interruption, or discontinuation of the trial test material. If 
there is doubt concerning the cause of a serious or potentially serious AE, exposure to the 
trial test material shall be discontinued. 
8.5 Test Material Deficiency 
I 
Any inadequacy of the test material with respect to its identity, quality, durability, .reli9bilit{,, 
or performance will be considered a deficiency. Test material deficiencies can include but 
are not limited to malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.

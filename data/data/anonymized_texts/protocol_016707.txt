Efficacy and safety of loteprednol 0.5% gel for routine prophylaxis after photorefractive keratectomy compared to
prednisolone acetate 1% suspension and fluorometholone 0.1% suspension

https://erica.research.utah.edu/erica/app/portal/smartform/printProject/_New Application/IRB_00075978?packetIds=ProjectPrintPacket_8D7962D662 … 2/206. Study Purposes and Objectives:
Hypothesis: Loteprednol 0.5% gel will perform similarly or better than a regimen of prednisolone acetate 1% and
fluorometholone 0.1% in the prevention of visually significant postoperative corneal haze after photorefractive
keratectomy (PRK) with a lower incidence of intraocular pressure elevation.
Objectives: We aim to conduct a prospective, randomized trial to compare the incidence of intraocular pressure rise
and visually significant postoperative corneal haze after PRK with the use of loteprednol 0.5% gel compared to the
use of earlier generation steroids, prednisolone acetate 1% suspension and fluorometholone 0.1% suspension.
Patients undergoing PRK will be assigned to 1 of 2 postoperative steroid regimens. Group 1 will use only loteprednol 0.5% gel, tapered of f slowly based on
clinical evaluations of the corneal healing response.  Group 2 will use prednisolone acetate 1% suspension tapered down to a regimen of fluorometholone
0.1% which will then be tapered off based on clinical evaluations of the corneal healing response.  If no difference in efficacy or safety is
detected between these two regimens, this study will support the use of either steroid regimen in patients after PRK.
If there is a major difference in the efficacy or safety of these two regimens, this could influence post-refractive
surgery treatment practices.
7. Is this a multi-site study, where more than one site needs IRB approval?
    Yes No
8. Background and Introduction:
In photo-ablation  procedures, an excimer laser is used to  sculpt corneal tissue to correct refractive error.  During PRK, the surface epithelium is
removed and the laser energy is applied to reshape the underlying corneal stroma.  This procedure is FDA approved and used widely.  Corneal haze is a
well known and a potentially vision threatening postoperative complication of PRK.  Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids are routinely prescribed by most
surgeons postoperatively to help prevent this complication.
Desirable characteristics for prophylactic topical steroids to be used after PRK include ef fective modulation of the
healing response to prevent corneal haze while at the same time minimizing side ef fects, such as intraocular
pressure elevation or cataract formation.  Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid that exerts its therapeutic ef fects
and is then quickly changed into inactive metabolites by nonspecific esterases found in the cornea [1].  This relatively
fast metabolism of loteprednol gives it a lower side effect profile than other steroids, including a smaller effect on
intraocular pressure [2, 3].  In the ophthalmic literature, there is currently no consensus on a standard regimen or
which type of corticosteroid should be used after PRK.
A retrospective study done at our institution demonstrated a similar incidence of haze and increased intraocular
pressure in patients treated with loteprednol 0.5% suspension or fluorometholone 0.1% suspension after both groups
received prednisolone acetate 1% suspension for the first 3-4 weeks postoperatively after PRK [4].  This study was
limited by its retrospective nature, but was the first study to report the ef ficacy and noninferiority of loteprednol
compared to other steroids for prophylaxis after photorefractive keratectomy .  Our current prospective study could
help determine whether loteprednol has true advantages over traditional topical steroids after PRK.

https://erica.research.utah.edu/erica/app/portal/smartform/printProject/_New Application/IRB_00075978?packetIds=ProjectPrintPacket_8D7962D662 … 7/206. Describe all the procedures chronologically, from screening/enrollment through study closeout, which will be
completed in the research project.
Patients who are interested and eligible to participate in this study will be enrolled and will read and sign the study
informed consent prior to surgery.  As is standard for our PRK cases, they will also be required to watch an
informational video, read and sign the "Consent to Have Refractive Surgery" and respond to a brief test concerning
its content.
Prior to surgery, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two postoperative steroid regimens.  Group 1 will use
loteprednol 0.5% gel in both eyes, starting at a frequency of four times per day for the first week and then tapered of f
based on clinical judgement of the corneal healing response.  Group 2 will use prednisolone acetate 1% suspension
in both eyes, starting at a frequency of four times per day for the first week, then tapered down to a regimen of
fluorometholone 0.1% suspension, which will then be tapered off based on clinical judgement of the corneal healing
response.
All surgical procedures will be performed according to the standard of care and the surgeons' standard practices.  The study outcome measures are
standard of care for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of refractive surgery patients.
The primary outcome measure will be intraocular pressure at each study time point.  Secondary outcomes will be grade of corneal haze, manifest refraction,
best corrected visual acuity, and uncorrected visual acuity.
Study outcome measures will be evaluated for each treated eye of each subject at each study time point.  Routine
clinical management may be altered if the intraocular pressure is elevated suf ficiently to require medical intervention,
if there is significant postoperative corneal haze, or if there are other postoperative complications.  In these situations,
additional IOP lowering drops may be added or the steroid decreased, changed, or increased, based on the clinical
picture and physician judgement.  Additional examinations between study time points may be performed as
necessary according to the surgeon's usual care, but will not be considered part of the study data.  Patients have the
right to withdraw at any time and future medical care will not be influenced by their lack of participation.
If enhancement surgery is deemed necessary and performed during the one-year post-operative period, study data
 collection will end for that eye at the time of the enhancement.  All prior data collected will still be included in the
statistical analysis and if only one eye requires enhancement, data collection will continue on the fellow eye until the
last planned study time point.
Eyes will be evaluated with the following procedures:
- Intraocular pressure (by applanation tonometry): Pre-operatively and post-operative week 1 (± 3 days), month 1 (±
10 days), month 2 (± 10 days), month 3 (± 14 days), month 6 (± 1 month), and month 12 (± 1 month)
Note: Intraocular pressure will be measured by a technician or physician who is masked to the treatment regimen of
the patient at each visit.
- Grade of corneal haze (Fantes scale): Post-operative m onth 1 (± 10 days), month 2 (± 10 days), month 3 (± 14 days), month 6 (± 1
month), and month 12 (± 1 month)
Note: Corneal haze will be graded by a study physician who did not perform the original surgery and is masked to the treatment regimen of the patient at
each visit.
- Manifest refraction (sphere, cylinder, and axis): Pre-operatively and post-operatively month 1 (± 10 days), month 2 (± 10
days), month 3 (± 14 days), month 6 (± 1 month), and month 12 (± 1 month)
- Best corrected visual acuity: Pre-operatively and post-operatively month 1 (± 10 days), month 2 (± 10 days), month 3 (± 14 days), month 6 (± 1 month), and
month 12 (± 1 month)
- Uncorrected visual acuity: Pre-operatively and post-operative day 1 (± 1 day), week 1 (± 3 days), month 1 (± 10 days), month 2 (± 10 days), month 3 (± 14
days), month 6 (± 1 month), and month 12 (± 1 month)
- Pupil size measured in the dark: Pre-operatively only
- Corneal pachymetry: Pre-operatively only
Data and Safety Monitoring:
There is no formal data and safety monitoring board for this study . All treatments, procedures, and testing being
performed in the study are within the standard of care and treatment for PRK patients.  This study does not put study
participants at any known increased risk beyond that normally assumed by patients undergoing PRK outside the
study. The investigators feel that the standard processes for identifying and reporting adverse events (AE) are
sufficient to safeguard the well-being of study participants.

https://erica.research.utah.edu/erica/app/portal/smartform/printProject/_New Application/IRB_00075978?packetIds=ProjectPrintPacket_8D7962D662 … 8/20The investigators have a nomogram from which they work and therefore have expected vision outcomes for patients
on an individual basis.  It is routine practice to compare actual with expected outcomes as a quality assurance
measure.  Should any concerns arise prior to completion of the study , a safety analysis will be conducted
immediately.
For this protocol, an AE is any “on study” untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome,
intercurrent illness) that is experienced by a study subject, regardless of the suspected cause.  Both serious and non-
serious AEs will be graded on a three ‑point scale (mild, moderate, severe), and the investigators will assess whether
there is a reasonable possibility that study procedure caused or contributed to the AE.
Adverse events that start on Day 0 (Surgery) through the last study visit will be recorded on the study AE log and
described in detail in the patient chart.  Subjects discontinued early from the study due to an adverse event will be
asked to return for a final evaluation.  All study-related adverse events will be followed until resolution (or determined
to be irreversible, chronic, or stable).
Adverse events that are determined to be unexpected, possibly related to the study procedure, and place subjects at
increased risk, will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to their guidelines.
Standard of Care / Research Costs:
All procedures are considered within the standard of care for PRK surgery and will be billed to patients in the usual
manner; however, participants will be eligible for a reduced study fee for their surgery and post-operative care. PRK
surgery is considered cosmetic surgery and is never billed to insurance. The refractive surgery charge includes
standard post-operative examinations up to one year.
Loteprednol 0.5% gel is not available in a generic formulation and is therefore significantly more expensive than
generic prednisolone acetate 1% suspension and fluorometholone 0.1% suspension.  A request for a donation of
loteprednol 0.5% gel for this study has been submitted to Bausch and Lomb and is currently under review .  If
approved, this drug donation will allow us to eliminate the additional expense of a branded drug for patients that are
randomized to the loteprednol group.
If enhancement surgery is deemed necessary during the one-year post-operative period, this will be included based
on the patient’s initial fee, as is standard of care.  Any other costs related to management of adverse events, or if
additional refractive correction is necessary at some time after the one-year postoperative period, will remain the
patient’s responsibility and are not included in the study surgery fee.
7. Are all procedures for research purposes only (non-standard or non-standard of care procedures)?
  Yes No
If no, list the procedures that are performed for research purposes only (non-standard or non-standard
of care procedures):
Only data collection and analysis are for research purposes only .  All other procedures are within the standard
of care.
8. Is there a safety monitoring plan for this study?
  Yes No
9. Provide a summary of the statistical methods, data analysis, or data interpretation planned for this study .
Factors for determining the proposed sample size (e.g., power) should be stated.
Standard statistics will be calculated and used to describe the two treatment groups in terms of all study variables:
intraocular pressure, grade of corneal haze, manifest refraction, best corrected visual acuity, and uncorrected visual acuity.  Statistics will be
compiled for each variable at the study time points listed in the data collection protocol.  Patients withdrawn from the study prior
to surgery will not be included in the data analysis and will be replaced in the enrollment group.  For eyes that require
enhancement surgery, only data collected prior to the enhancement surgery will be included in the statistical analysis.
Prior studies have considered intraocular pressure elevation of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg above baseline
clinically significant.  A prior study of healthy volunteers demonstrated an incidence of IOP elevation > 10 mm Hg of
1.95% in patients using loteprednol eye drops versus 7.48% in patients using dexamethasone eye drops [1].  Using
these expected proportions, an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 80%, we would need a sample size of 230 patients (460
eyes). In order to account for about 10% dropout, we intend to enroll 250 patients in the study , 125 in the loteprednol
arm and 125 in the prednisolone and fluorometholone arm.

3. Describe the consent process(es), including the timing of consent. Describe whether there is a waiting period
between the consent process and obtaining consent from the participant (i.e., any time between informing
participants and actually obtaining consent).
All of our standard evaluation and consent processes for refractive surgery will be followed. Patients who are interested
in refractive surgery undergo a standard refractive surgery screening examination with the surgeon, during which their
candidacy for refractive surgery is determined and the risks and benefits of all potential refractive procedures for which
they medically qualify, which may or may not include PRK, are discussed. Patients who are not already aware of the
study are also informed about the possibility of participating in the study during or prior to this first clinic visit. Patients
who are good candidates medically and motivated to undergo surgery are then scheduled for a repeat examination to
ensure refractive and keratometric stability, as well as to further discuss and finalize the surgical plan based on the
patient's goals and clinical findings, as is our usual standard. If a patient is deemed medically eligible for and chooses to
undergo PRK, they may choose to be included in the study. The study risks and benefits will be discussed and patients
will be given opportunities to ask questions regarding the study at any of the clinic visits described above. Consent will
be signed by the patient prior to undergoing surgery.
4. Describe what measures will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.
Patients interested in refractive surgery are screened and, based on clinical findings, the screening surgeon presents
them with the risks and benefits of all procedures for which there are good candidates, which may or may not include
PRK. All patients are free to undergo the refractive procedure that is best suited to them, including PRK, without
participating in the study.
5. Describe the provisions that are made to allow adequate time to exchange information and questions between
the investigator and participant.
All study participants will meet with their surgeon on at least 3 occasions prior to undergoing surgery . This includes the
initial refractive surgery screening, repeat exam, and on the day of surgery prior to the procedure. Patients will have the
opportunity to discuss the study and surgical plan at any of these visits.

5. Data Monitoring Plan
1. Privacy Protections: Privacy refers to persons and to their interest in controlling access of others to themselves. Privacy
can be defined in terms of having control over the extent, timing and circumstances of sharing oneself (physically ,
behaviorally, or intellectually) with others. What precautions will be used to ensure subject privacy is protected?
 Select all that apply:
The research intervention is conducted in a private place
Discussing the study with participants individually instead of in front of a group
The collection of information about participants is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the research, so
that no unneeded information is being collected
Other or additional details (specify):
  Other or additional details (specify):
Precautions will be taken to maintain confidentiality of patient records and personal information. Raw data (pre-
operative and post-operative measurements and operative report) will be maintained as part of the patient’ s confidential
medical record, in accordance with University, state and federal guidelines. Study data will be compiled into an
electronic file by the investigators and maintained on a password-protected network. Data entries will be coded by
patient identification number. Any reports of the results of this study that are published or presented will not disclose the
subject’s identity.
2. Confidentiality Precautions: Confidentiality is an extension of the concept of privacy; it refers to the subject's
understanding of, and agreement to, the ways identifiable information will be stored and shared. Identifiable information
can be printed information, electronic information or visual information such as photographs.  What precautions will be
used to maintain the confidentiality of identifiable information?
 Select all that apply:
Storing research data on password protected computers or in locked cabinets or of fices
Participant identifiers will be stored separately from the coded, participant data
  Other or additional details (specify):
3.Will photos, audio recordings, or video recordings, or medical images of participants be made
during the study?  
  Yes No

Title: Efficacy and safety of loteprednol 0.5% gel for routine
prophylaxis after photorefractive keratectomy compared to
prednisolone acetate 1% suspension and fluorometholone
0.1% suspension 
 
6. Risks and Beneﬁts
1.Describe the reasonable foreseeable risks or discomforts to the participants:
This study does not put study participants at any known increased risk beyond that normally assumed by patients
undergoing photorefractive keratectomy outside the study, including but not limited to decreased vision, over-correction,
under-correction, pain, glare, halos, dry eyes, infection, and corneal haze.  The risk of topical steroid-related
complications following photorefractive keratectomy, including elevated intraocular pressure, infection, and cataract
formation, is assumed by all patients undergoing the procedure at our institution, as it is our routine standard practice to
put patients on a tapering regimen of topical steroids post-operatively to decrease the risk of corneal haze.
2.Describe the potential benefits to society AND to participants (do not include compensation):
There may be no direct benefits to participants from their participation in this study . If no difference in efficacy or safety is detected between the two post-operative
treatment regimens, this study will support the use of either steroid regimen in patients after PRK. If there is a major dif ference in the efficacy or safety of these two
regimens, this could influence post-refractive surgery treatment practices.
3.Are there any costs to the participants from participation in research?
  Yes No
  If yes, specify:
All subjects will be charged the research-discounted price for PRK ($1200 per eye) and will be responsible for the
cost of all necessary medications. Loteprednol is significantly more expensive than prednisolone and
fluorometholone. Bausch and Lomb has unconditionally donated loteprednol 0.5% gel for this study, thus patients
randomized to the loteprednol arm will be provided this medication without charge. Patients randomized to the
prednisolone/fluorometholone arm will be responsible for paying for this medication, just as they would be were they
not enrolled in the study.
4.Is there any compensation to the participants?
  Yes No
 a. If yes, answer the following:
Specify overall amount:
 b.Specify when participants will be paid (e.g. at each visit, at end of study , etc.):
 c.If applicable, please specify payment by visit or other time interval (e.g. $10 per visit, etc.):
 d.If applicable, explain plan for prorating payments if participant does not complete the study:

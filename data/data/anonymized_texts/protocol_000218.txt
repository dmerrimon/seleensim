Page  5 of 72 Study Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint s: 
• Clinical cure at the test of cure (TOC) visit: defined as survival and the 
resolution of diarrhea in the 24- hour period immediately before  EOT that 
is maintained for 48 hours post EOT  without a requirement for additional 
CDI treatment. Diarrhea is defined as ≥ 3 unformed bowel movements 
(UBMs) in a 24 -hour period; <  3 UBMs is considered as resolution of 
diarrhea. A UBM is defined as a Type 5, 6, or 7 bowel movement on the 
Bristol Stool Chart.  
• Safety endpoints for  all subjects: These include the nature, frequency, and 
severity of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs); 
changes from baseline in findings on physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, safety laboratory tests (hematology, biochemi stry, 
urinalysis); and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings.  
Secondary E ndpoint:  
• SCC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least 48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 28 ± 2 days post 
EOT. Recurrence is defined as a new episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 
24-hour period) with a positive toxin result, using a Sponsor -approved 
C. difficile  free toxin test and, in the opinion of the Investigator, requir ing 
retreatment with an antibacterial agent for C.  difficile . 
Pharmacokinetic E ndpoint:  
• Systemic exposure of ibezapolstat will be determined by measuring 
plasma ibezapolstat  concentrations at specified time points following dose 
administration; fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at 
specified study visits.  
Exploratory E ndpoints:  
• Microbial endpoints: Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial diversity will be assessed for ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both segments, and in comparison to those 
treated with vancomycin  in Segment 2B. Changes will be assessed during 
the treatment period and post EOT . 
• Time to resolution of diarrhea, defined as the time from outset of 
treatment to the first formed bowel movement not followed within the 
next 24 hours by a UBM, will be recor ded. 
• Time to hospital discharge (for hospitalized subjects only) is defined as time from outset of treatment to day of discharge, and not followed by readmission for treatment of CDI before the TOC visit.  
• Quality of life assessments including EuroQoL 5 Dim ension 5 Level 
(EQ-5D-5L) and medical resource utilization data will be  performed at 
designated time points during Segment 2B.  
• ECC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least 
48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 ± 2 days post 
EOT  (ECC 56) and 84 ± 2 days post EOT  (ECC 84). Recurrence is defined 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  6 of 72 as a new episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24 -hour period) with a 
positive toxin result, using a Sponsor -approved C. difficile  free toxin test 
and, in the opinion of the Investigator, requiring retreatment with an 
antibacterial agent for C. difficile . 
Study Design:  This Phase  2, multicenter, open -label single -arm segment followed by a 
double -blind, randomized, active -controlled segment is designed to evaluate 
ibezapolstat  in the treatment of  CDI. Segment 2A of this trial is an open -label 
cohort of up to 20 subjects in  up to 5 study centers in the Un ited States and 
Canada. In Segment 2A, up to 20 subjects with diarrhea caused by C. difficile  
will be treated with ibezapolstat  450 mg orally for 10 days. All subjects will be 
followed for recurrence for 28 ± 2 days. After 10  subjects have completed 
treatment and again after all subjects have completed treatment, a Trial 
Oversight Committee  will assess the safety and tolerability , and, as data allow, 
efficacy, to make recommendation regarding whether the study should 
continue.  
In Segment 2 B, at least  72 additional subjects with CDI will be enrolled and 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat  450 mg every 12 hours or 
vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours for 10 days and followed for 28 ± 2 
days for recurrence. Additionally, a pproximately 16 subjects recruited from 
selected sites will participate in an extended follow -up period consisting of 
observation visits at 56 days  and 84  days after treatment to evaluate the long -
term impact of ibezapolstat  on the microbiome and on disease recurrence.  The 
2 treatments will be identical in appearance, dosing times, and number of capsules administered to maintain the blind.  
Subjects in both segments will be evaluated for cure, safety, and tolerability. All sub jects in both segments will have stool samples tested for microbiome  
profiles . Pharmacokinetic (PK)  testing for systemic exposure will be 
performed on blood samples in Segment 2A  and approximately  50% of 
subjects  (ie, approximately 36 subjects)  in Segment 2B . Stool samples will be 
tested for study drug concentration in Segment 2A and Segment 2B.  
Selection of Subjects : Inclusion Criteria : 
1. Male or female 18 to 90 years of age, inclusive, at the time of Screening.  
2. Capable of reading, understanding, and signing the written informed 
consent; able to adhere to all study procedures and attend all scheduled 
study visits.  
3. Confirmed diagnosis of mild or moderate CDI as defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology o f 
America guidelines. Subjects will be diagnosed with CDI based on 
clinical and laboratory findings:  
a. The presence of diarrhea, defined as passage of ≥ 3 UBMs within 
24 hours before dosing; an unformed stool is defined as a Type 5, 6, 
or 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart .

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  9 of 72 Treatment Duration:  Subjects will receive study drug for 10 days.  
Efficacy  Subjects will receive a diary and will be instructed to record in it each day of 
the study the date and time of dosing of study drug; date, time, and consistency 
of all bowel movements up to Day 12/TOC ; and the date, time, and 
consistency of all UBMs from TOC to Day 38. 
Sustained clinical cure will be determined in the 24 -hour period immediately 
before  EOT that is maintained for 48 hours post EOT.  
SCC will be determined by following all subjects for 28 ± 2 days post 
treatment for recurrence of UBMs , although only subjects with clinical cure 
are eligible to be classified as SCC . 
Exploratory:  The time to resolution of diarrhea will be determined by measuring the time 
from outset of treatment to the first formed bowel movement not followed 
within the next 24 hours by a UBM.  
Time to hospital discharge will be determined by measuring time from the 
outset of treatment to the day of discharge that is not followed by a readmission for treatment of CDI before the  TOC visit  (for hospitalized 
subjects only) . 
Microbiome testing to determine the microbial content of stool samples will occur at  specified time points during the study.  
Quality of life assessments including EQ -5D-5L and medical resource 
utilization data w ill be performed at designated time points during 
Segment  2B.  
ECC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least 48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 ± 2 days post EOT (ECC56) and 84 ± 2 days post EOT (ECC84). Recurrence is defined as a new 
episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24- hour period) with a positive toxin 
result, using a Sponsor -approved C. difficile  free toxin test and, in the opinion 
of the Investigator, requiring retreatment with an antibacterial agent for 
C. difficile . 
Safety : Safety assessments include vital signs, physical examination, ECG recording s, 
collection of AEs, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalysis).  
Pharmacokinetics : During Segment 2A and Segment 2B , stool  sampl es will be collected to 
analyze ibezapolstat  levels at designated time points.  In Segment 2A  and 
approximately  50% of subjects in Segment 2B , blood samples will be collected 
to analyze ibezapolstat levels at designated time points.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Study Populations  
The Enrolled population includes all subjects who sign an informed consen t 
form . 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population includes all subjects who are enrolled and 
treated in Segment 2A or who are randomized in Segment 2B and will be used to analyze efficacy. In Segment 2B, subjects will be analyzed based on their 
randomized assignment.  This population will be used for the primary analyses 
of efficacy.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of subjec ts in the ITT population 
with no major protocol deviations. The determination of which subjec ts have 
major protocol violations will be made in a blinded manner prior to database 
lock. For analyses based on the PP population, subjec ts will be grouped 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  10 of 72 according to the trea tment to which they were randomized. This population 
will be used for a secondary analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  
The ITT Extension population will include all randomized Segment 2B 
subjects who participate in the extended follow -up period. Subjects will be 
analyzed based on their randomized assignment.  
The Safety population includes all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and will be used to analyze safety. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment actually received.  
The PK population includes all subjects who take at least 1 dose of active study treatment ( ibezapolstat) and have at least 1 quantifiable plasma 
concentration collected post dose without any important protocol 
deviations /violations  or events tha t would affect the PK. 
Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical cure at the TOC visit  defined as 
survival and the resolution of diarrhea in the 24- hour period immediately 
before the EOT and maintained for 48 hours after EOT without a requirement 
for additional CDI treatment. For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with a 95% exact (Clopper -Pearson) confidence interval for the true cure percentage. For 
Segment 2B, the null and alterna tive hy potheses for this endpoint are:  
H
0: π 1,T ≤ π 1,C - δ and  H1: π 1,T > π 1,C - δ, 
where π 1,T and π 1,C are the true proportions of subjects with clinical cure at the 
TOC visit for the ibezapolstat  450 mg and vancomycin 125 mg treatments, 
respectively, and δ is the non -inferiority margin which is here taken to be 0.25.  
This endpoint will be summarized by treatment group using frequencies and 
percentages, together with an exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval 
for the true cure percentage.  A 95% confidence interval based on the normal 
approximation will also be calculated for the difference between th e 
2 population proportions. The null hypothesis will be tested using a one -sided 
normal approximation test of non- inferiority at the 0.03037 significance level 
(Pocock 1977 ) for an overall significance level of 0.05. In the event 
non-inferiority of ibezapolstat 450 mg is demonstrated, Fisher’s exact test 
(two-sided) will be used to conduct a test for superiority at the 0.05 
significance lev el. 
A single interim analysis will be performed when the first 36 Segment 2B 
subje
cts in the ITT Population (one half of the planned sample size) have data 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. The null hypothesis (see Section 14.3.1) will 
be tested using a one -sided normal approximation test of non- inferiority at a 
one-sided α=0.03037 level of significance (Pocock 1977) for an overall 
significance level of 0.05. If the p- value is less than or equal to 0.03037 at the 
time of the interim analysis, then the study will be stopped early for success.  
A secondar y endpoint  is SCC. For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with an exact (Clopper -Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. For 
Segment 2B, this endpoint will be summarized by treatment group using 
frequencies and percentages, together with an exact (Clopper -Pearson) 95% 
confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. A 95% confidence interval 
based on the normal approximation will also be calculated for the difference 
between the 2 population proportions. The null hypothesis that the true

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  11 of 72 proportions are equal for the 2 treatments will be tested using a two -sided 
Fisher’s exact test  at the 0.05 significance level . 
Safety  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be coded using the most recent version 
of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
summarized. If a subject  experiences more than 1 occurrence of the same AE, 
the occurrence with the greatest severity and the closest relationship with the 
study drug will be used in the summary tables.  
The number and percentage of subjects with at least one TEAE, at least one 
treatment -related TEAE, at least one serious TEAE, and at least one TEAE 
leading to study discontinuation will be presented by treatment group. A Es that 
are definitely, probably, or possibly related, or for which the relationship is 
missing, will be considered related.  
The number and percentage of subjects having a TEAE in each System Organ Class (SOC) and having each individual  type of AE (Preferred Term) will be 
presented. TEAEs will also be summarized at the event level by SOC/Preferred Term and severity. This will be done for all TEAEs, all serious TEAEs, and all TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.  
All AEs will be listed by subject , along with information regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs data will be summarized by treatment 
group and time point using descriptive statistics, for both the actual values and 
the change s from baseline, as well as the numbers and percentages of subjects  
with values outside the limits of the normal range at each time point. Electrocardiogram data will be summarized by treatment group and time point 
using descriptive statistics for both the actual values and the changes from 
baseline. 
Concomitant medications initiated during  the study period will be summarized 
by treatment group using frequencies and percentages.  
Exploratory Analyses  
Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial 
diversity will be determined at designated time points during the stu dy. 
Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial 
diversity will be assessed for ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both segments, 
and in comparison to those treated with vancomycin in Segment 2B. Changes will be assessed during the treatment period and post EOT.  
For Segment 2A, time to resolution of diarrhea will be summarized using the 
Kaplan -Meier method, with estimates of the true resolution of diarrhea rate at 
Days  1, 5, 10, 12, and 40. The estimated median time to resolution of diarrhea,

Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Systemic exposure of ibezapolstat  will be determined by measuring plasma 
ibezapolstat  concentrations at specified time points following dose 
administration. Fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at 
specified study visits. Plasma and fecal ibezapolstat concentrations will be 
listed by study segment, treatment, study day and/or nominal time, and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Summary statistics will be generated for ibezapolstat  plasma and fecal 
concentrations. Given sufficient plasma and fecal levels over the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ), the data will be analyzed as follows: Median (and range) 
and mean (and standard deviation) ibezapolstat  plasma concentrations at each 
nominal time p oint will be calculated. Concentrations reported as below the 
LLOQ will be set to zero for descriptive statistics.

Page  19 of 72 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Clostridioides Difficile  
Clostridioides  d ifficile  (C. difficile ) is an anaerobic, spore- forming, Gram -positive bacterium. 
It is the causative agent of C. difficile  infection (CDI), an increasingly common, potentially 
life-threatening disease. C. difficile  can live harmlessly in the  colon, but in the presence of an 
antibiotic administered for another condition, overgrowth may occur, replacing normal 
bacterial flora and resulting in CDI and or C. difficile -associated disease ( Nelson, 2017 ). 
The epidemiology of C. difficile  has changed with  the emergence of the North American 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 strain, and use of more sensitive assays ( Lessa, 2015). 
CDI infection  affects approximately 500,000 patients in the United States (US) each year, 
and is associated with 15,000 to 30,000 deaths ( McDonald, 2018). In fact, 65,000 hospital 
acquired hospital-onset cases, 50,000 hospital acquired post-discharge cases, and 263,000 nursing home-onset cases, result in $4 billion in excess costs to the healthcare system 
annually ( Clostridium Infections – Pipeline Review, 2012 ). Hospitalizations for CDI 
among nonpregnant adults has doubled from 2000 through 2010 and are projected to 
continue to increase in 2011 and 2012 ( Lessa, 2015).  
Although the discontinuation of predisposing antibiotic therapy and treatment with 
metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or the recently approved drug fidaxomicin (Dificid
®), are 
effective in management of CDI, the development of new alternative therapeutic measures 
will be of great benefit. Not only is the incidence of hospitalizations and deaths associated with C. difficile  rising ( Lessa, 2015;  Louie, 2012 ; Zilberberg, 2008 ), but some strains may 
become hypervirulent and increasingly resistant to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (Razavi, 2007).  
Current treatment strategy includes discontinuation of predisposing antibiotic and oral administration of vancomycin or fidaxomicin. If access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited, metronidazole may be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI only ( McDonald, 
2018).  
While vancomycin continues to show good clinical efficacy for C. difficile , there is an 
increasing incidence of serious illness because of  vancomycin- resistant enterococci in the 
United S tates, and use of oral vancomycin (as well as oral metronidazole) has been shown to 
promote overgrowth of this pathogen ( Al-Nassir, 2008). Use of vancomycin to treat C. 
difficile  is also associated with unacceptably high recurrence rates. Fidaxomicin (Dificid), 
although newly approved for treatment of CDI, is a treatment option if the risk of recurrence is high, but not for complicated CDI ( Smits, 2016 ). 
Several additional products are under development, and inc lude small molecules, natural 
products, vaccines, and fecal transplants ( Clostridium Infections – Pipeline Review, 2012; 
McDonald, 2018).

Page  20 of 72 Ibezapolstat (ACX-362E ) has activity in vitro and in vivo against C. difficile (Xu, 2011; 
Dvoskin, 2012). The crisis in antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive bacteria prompted the 
development of novel antibacterials through structure–activity relationship studies of 
replication -specific DNA polymerase IIIC. It is from among these compounds that 
antibacterial compounds against C.  difficile  with potent in vitro activity have been 
discovered. Among these is ibezapolstat , which also shows potent in vivo activity in the 
established Syrian golden hamster model of CDI ( Kokkot ou, 2008; Dvoskin, 2012).  
Ibezapolstat  is an inhibitor of the C. difficile  DNA polymerase IIIC and is highly selective for 
C. difficile  compared with other Gram-positive anaerobes and aerobic bact eria. Ibezapolstat , 
2-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-7- (2-[morpholinyl]ethyl)guanine, is a small molecule, poorly 
bioavailable and active orally in the hamster model. In vitro, ibezapolstat  inhibited numerous 
C. difficile  strains, with a  minimum inhibitory concentra tion required to inhibit the growth of 
90% of organisms value of 4 µg/mL, and without inhibiting Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus 
spp., important "good" intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or Gram- negative bacteria. These results 
suggest that development of ibezapolstat  as an oral treatment for CDI in human patients will 
result in a novel, first- in-class drug to treat this emerging infectious disease. 
Subjects in this study will be administered 450 mg ibezapolstat  orally every 12 hours for 
10 days. Ibezapolst at is administered orally because it has been shown that ibezapolstat  has 
low oral availability with low systemic absorption, and also has a unique specificity for 
C. difficile  that does not affect the normal good flora of the colon, an important advantage to 
prevent recurrence.  
5.2 Background on Ibezapolstat 
5.2.1 Nonclinical Studies  
In 14
-day multiple oral dose studies, doses of ibezapolstat  were given orally at doses ranging 
from 60 to 600 mg/kg in dogs, and 100 to 2000 mg/kg/day in rats. Bioavailability appeared to be approximately 10% after comparing intravenous and oral dosing in both rats 
(approximately 8%) and dogs (approximately 11%). The apparent plasma clearance after 
single dosing appeared to be approximately 90 to 140 L/h in rats and 60 to 90 L/h in dogs after administration of oral doses ranging from 60 to 1000 mg/kg/day. No toxicity was seen in these studies so the no observed adverse effect level was > 600 mg/kg/day in dogs and 
> 2000 mg/kg/day in rats (data on file). 
Ibezapolstat  was excreted in urine and feces after oral administration in rats. Approximately 
9% and 0.4% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively; considering the oral 
bioavailability is approximately 10%, and that ibezapolstat  is metabolized to 11 different 
metabolites. F ecal concentrations after a 50  mg/kg oral dose in rats were 107 to 191 µg/g at 
10 to 24 hours post dose (data on file).

Page  21 of 72 5.2.2 Clinical Studies  
A Phase 1 study of ibezapolstat in healthy subjects (ACX -362E-101) ha s been completed . 
Study ACX-362E-101 wa s a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part, single-
ascending dose, multiple-ascending dose, food effect study  in which ibezapolstat  was 
administered in doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg. The primary 
objective of the study was to determine the safety of ibezapolstat  in both single and multiple 
doses to healthy subjects. Secondary objectives of the study were to determine system ic and 
fecal pharmacokinetics ( PK) of ibezapolstat  after single and multiple  doses and to compare 
fecal microbiome effects of ibezapolstat  compared to those of vancomycin after multiple 
doses. The plasma and stool levels of ibezapolstat  were also determined after a fed and fasted 
state. Part 1 (n = 6 ibezapolstat ; n = 2 placebo) wa s a single-ascending dose, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled escalation study. Part 2 (n = 8 ibezapolstat ) was a separate, 
single dose cohort at the dose determined in Part 1 and w as a randomized, open-label, food 
effect, 2 -period cross-over study in which subjects w ere assigned a single dose of 
ibezapolstat  in either a high- fat, high- calorie , fed state followed by a fasted state, or in a 
fasted state followed by a high- fat, high- calorie fed state.  Part 3 (n = 6 ibezapolstat ; n = 2 
placebo) was a multiple -dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation 
study in which tolerability, plasma PK, fecal concentrations, and fecal microbiome effects of ibezapolstat  were  evaluated. In addition, a positive-control subgroup was randomly assigned 
to dosing with vancomycin and tolerability, fecal concentrations, and fecal microbiome effect 
were evaluated for these subjects.  
Preliminary r esults from Study ACX-362E-101 showed a favorable safety profile. Adverse 
events (AEs) were well tolerated, simi lar to placebo, and transitory. AEs in subjects who 
received ibezapolstat  included cough, cystitis-noninfective, dizziness, nasal congestion, 
twitching sensation, and headache that were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to ibezapolstat  and epigastric pain, headache (3 events), dyspepsia,  nausea, prolonged PR 
interval, shortness of breath, and tachycardia that were considered by the Investigator to be 
possibly or probably related to ibezapolstat . All the events were mild in intensity except for 1 
of moderate intensity  (headache) . No AE req uired a change in therapy or intervention. 
Ibezapolstat  was shown to have ideal PK  for a C. difficile  antibiotic. Systemic concentrations 
of ibezapolstat  after administration showed low systemic absorption. Fecal levels were 
several orders of magnitude higher than the microbial inhibitory concentration of C. difficile  
(4000 to 6000 µg/g stool). Study results demonstrated that after ibezapolstat  administration, 
there is a favorable microbiome profile remaining in the gut with less disruption to normal microbiota compared to vancomycin, which was largely driven by decreased killing of 
Bacteroidetes  and Fi rmicutes  bacteria, which constitute > 80% of normal microbiota . These 
results support continuing the development of ibezapolstat  for the treatment of CDI.  
The food effect on ibezapolstat  following a 300 mg single dose of ibezapolstat  show ed a 
peak plasma concentration of ibezapolstat  of approximately 3 times greater in a fasting state

Page  22 of 72 versus a fed state, although the ibezapolstat  plasma concentration returned to zero sooner in 
the fasting state . 
Comparison of multiple doses of 300 mg and 450 mg dosing of ibezapolstat  showed plasma 
concentrations peaking at approximately 2 times greater with the 450 mg dose compared to 
the 300 mg dose. Multiple dosing showed higher peaks of ibezapolstat  in stool samples in 
subjects who received 450 mg ibezapolstat  compared to 300 mg ibezapolstat . 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of Ibezapolstat 
Based on the available nonclinical and clinical data to date, the conduct of the study, as 
spec
ified in this protocol, is considered justifiable. The nonclinical data suggest an acceptable 
safety margin for the selected dose of ibezapolstat . 
All subjects will receive an active treatment for their CDI in the study. Subjects who fail to 
respond to study treatment will be offered treatment for CDI according to the standard of 
care antibiotic at the Investigator’s discretion. 
This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. Aspects of the st udy 
concerned with the study drug will meet the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice. 
Subjects will be closely monitored for safety during the study. The study progresses in 
stages, only going to the next stage after the Trial Oversight Committee  (Section 14.7) has 
fully assessed the safety and tolerability of the prior stage and recommends continuing the 
study. 
The Sponsor will immediately notif y the Principal Investigator (PI) if any additional safety or 
toxicology information becomes available during the study. The collection of blood samples may be accompanied by mild bruising, but it is usually 
painless.  
As this is the first administration of  ibezapolstat  to subjects with CDI, all effects cannot be 
reliably predicted. Facilities and staff for resuscitation and the treatment of other medical emergencies will be provided.  
5.4 Study Rationale 
The growing prevalence, epidemic nature, and health care burden of C. difficile  di arrhea 
provides a strong rationale to discover and develop oral agents to treat the condition in addition to those in current use. To that end, purine derivatives with potent inhibition of the growth of C. difficile  clinical isolates in culture have been identified. Based on the finding 
that these molecules, inhibitors of DNA polymerase IIIC (pol  IIIC), are potent inhibitors of 
the growth of the anaerobic bacterium C. difficile , the gene for pol IIIC from this organism 
was cloned and expressed for testing. This showed that inhibition of this enzyme by these anti-C. difficile  compounds is, as expected, the likely basis for their antibacterial effect. One

Page  23 of 72 of these purine- based in hibitors of C. difficile  pol IIIC, ibezapolstat , is highly active in vitro 
and in vivo, displaying excellent potential for further development as a clinical agent for the 
treatment of CDI ( Torti, 2011).  
New anti -CDI agents are needed to supplement those in current use for a t least 2  significant 
reasons: f irstly, ibezapolstat  selectively inhibits pol IIIC, a target heretofore unexploited in 
C. difficile  drug development. This property gives ibezapolstat strong potential for bypassing 
the resistance mechanism that may emerge in C. difficile  during the prolonged administration 
of the agents in current use. Secondly, undesirable clinical issues frequently develop with prolonged use of some therapies such as vancomycin . Recurrence of C. difficile  with 
vancomycin is a problem because vancomycin disrupts the normal balance of “good” bacteria in the gut, allowing “bad” bacteria to take over. Ibezapolstat , with its limited 
spectrum of activity, does not appear to disrupt the normal gut microbiome, thus having the potential to prevent the development and takeover  of resistant strains  needed for recurrence. 
Data from  Study ACX-362E-101 supports further rationale for advancing  ibezapolstat  into 
Phase 2 studies in the treatment of C. difficile . When administered to healthy subjects, 
ibezapolstat  was well tolerated, with an AE profile similar to placebo. All AEs but 1 were 
mild, transient, and nonrecurrent despite continued dosing. No AE required a change in 
therapy or an intervention and there were no clinically important adverse changes in physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory testing results, or electrocardiograms ( ECGs ). 
Ibezapolstat  was shown to be an ideal treatment for C. difficile ; it has low systemic exposure 
after oral dosing and showed no accumulation following 10 days of repeat dosing, yet fecal concentrations rose rapidly and were sustained at 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the minimum inhibitory concentration for C. difficile . Furth ermore, after treatment with 
ibezapolstat , the fecal microbiome remained favorable, with less disruption to microbiota 
compared to vancomycin. Ibezapolstat  treatment resulted in decreased killing of 
Bacteroide tes and Firmicutes , which generally comprise 80% to 90% of the healthy fecal 
microbiome. The 450 mg dose of ibezapolstat  proved to result in higher fecal concentrations 
of ibezapolstat  over the 300 mg dose, while also having an acceptable safety profile, and thus 
was chosen  as the dose moving forward. Treatment with oral vancomycin is the standard of 
care for patients with CDI. Vancomycin treatment will be incorporated as a positive control 
into this study to allow accurate and sophisticated comparison of the respective effe cts of 
ibezapolstat  and vancomycin on the fecal microbiome. Such data will provide valuable 
information regarding potential advantages of ibezapolstat  over the current standard of care, 
such as preservation of “good” elements of the microbiome or quicker r ecovery to 
pretreatment profiles. Furthermore, comparative microbiome profiling may provide information on the benefits  of ibezapolstat  to maintain normal intestinal flora, which has the 
potential to improve the efficiency of future ibezapolstat efficacy s tudies.

Page  24 of 72 5.4.1 Justification for Dose 
The ibezapolstat  dose chosen for this study is 450 mg. The results from Study ACX-362E-
101 showed that after administration of ibezapolstat  450 mg every 12 hours, stool 
concentrations of ibezapolstat  peak at higher concentrations compared to the 300 mg dose 
given every 12 hours and are consistently 2  to 3 orders of magnitude above the C. difficile  
minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms. The 
450 mg dose had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile  and thus was selected to ensure 
presumed therapeutic levels of ibezapolstat  in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of subject s with 
CDI, while minimally impacting normal gut microbiome composition. 
Vancomycin is a registered product and is commercially available. The usual adult total daily dose is 500 mg to 2 g administered orally in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. For this study, 125 mg vancomycin will be administered approximately every 6 hours for 10 days, per 
current treatment guidelines for CDI ( McDonald, 2018).  
The 10- day duration of treatment was selected because: (a) this is the recommended duration 
of therapy for all  current standard  of care oral CDI drugs, according to the most recent 
Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Guidelines ( McDonald, 2018); (b) by the same token, it is the standard regimen of oral 
vancomycin, which is being used as the active control agent in the Phase 2B segment of this 
trial; (c) Phase 1 data have established the safety of ibezapolstat  over 10 days of oral dosing; 
and (d) no human data exist to indicate that a shorter course of therapy with ibezapolstat  
would achieve acceptable efficacy for the treatment of CDI.

• Clinical cure at the test of cure (TOC) visit: defined as survival and the resolution of 
diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before EOT that is maintained for 48 
hours post EOT without a requirement for additional CDI treatment. Diarrhea is 
defined as ≥ 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs) in a 24-hour period; < 3 UBMs 
is considered as resolution of diarrhea. A UBM is defined as a Type 5, 6, or 7 bowel 
movement on the Bristol Stool Chart ( Appendix 2).

The secondary efficacy endpoint of this study is : 
• SCC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least 48 hours post EOT ) 
and no recurrence of CDI within the 28 ± 2 days post EOT. Recurrence is defined as a 
new episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24-hour period) with a positive toxin result, 
using a Sponsor-approved C. difficile  free toxin test and, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, requiring retreatment with an antibacterial agent for C. difficile . 
6.2.2.2 Pharmacokinetic Endpoint  
The secondary PK endpoint is as follows: 
• Systemic exposure of ibezapolstat  will be determined by measuring plasma 
ibezapolstat  concentrations at specified time points following dose administration; 
fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at specified study visits.  
6.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory endpoints of this study are as follows: 
• Microbial endpoints: Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial diversity will be assessed for ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both 
segments, and in comparison to those treated with vancomycin in Segment 2B.

Page  26 of 72 Changes will be assessed during the treatment period and post EOT. Details of the 
final microbiome analysis will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) or 
relevant laboratory manual . 
• Time to resolution of diarrhea, defined as the time from outset of treatment to the first 
formed bowel movement not followed within the next 24 hours by a UBM, will be 
recorded.  
• Time to hospital discharge (for hospitalized subjects only) is defined as time from 
outset of treatment to day of discharge, and not followed by readmiss ion for treatment 
of CDI before the TOC visit.  
• Quality of life assessments including EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level ( EQ-5D-5L) and 
medical resource utilization data will be performed at designated time points during 
Segment  2B.  
• ECC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least 48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 ± 2 days post EOT (ECC56) and 84 ± 2 days post EOT (ECC84). Recurrence is defined as a new episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24-hour period) with a positive toxin result, using a Sponsor-approved C. difficile  
free toxin test and, in the opinion of the Investigator, requiring ret reatment with an 
antibacterial agent for C. difficile . 
7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This Phase 2, multicenter, combined segment open- labe l single -arm segment  followed by a 
double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical segment  is designed to evaluate 
ibezapolstat  in the treatment of  CDI . 
Segment 2A of this trial is an open -label cohort of up to 20 subjects in up to 5 study centers 
in the United S tates and Canada . If safety, tolerability, and efficacy are considered acceptable 
by the Trial Oversight Committee , Segment 2A will be followed by a double-blind, 
randomized, active-controlled trial with an additional cohort of at least  72 subjects.  
In Segment 2A, up to 20 subjects with diarrhea caused by C. difficile  will be enrolled and 
treated with ibezapolstat  450 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days. All subjects will be  
followed for recurrence for 28 ± 2 days, regardless of response to ibezapolstat . After up to 
10 subject s have been enrolled in the study and completed the full course of treatment in 
Segment 2A , there will be an assessment of safety, tolerability, and, as data allow, efficacy, 
by the Trial Oversight Committee , which will make a recommendation regarding continued 
enrollment of Segment 2A . The Trial Oversight Committee  will consist of both the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor (Chair), the Syneos Health  Medical Monitor, and up to 2 PIs who enrolled 
subjects in Segment  2A.

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  27 of 72 Another assessment of safety, tolerabil ity, and efficacy will be made by the Trial Oversight 
Committee  after all subjects have been enrolled in Segment 2A and followed through at least 
the EOT visit.  
In Segment 2B, at least  72 additional subjects with CDI will be enrolled and randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat  450 mg orally every 12 hours with food or to 
vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours in up to 30 centers in the U nited S tates and Canada. 
Treatment will be administered for 10  days , and subjects will be followed for 28 ± 2 days for 
recurrence. Blinding in Segment 2B will be maintained by over-encapsulation of both drugs 
and dosing every 6 hours in all subjects. Subjects randomized to ibezapolstat  will receive 
2 doses per day of ibezapolstat and 2 doses per day of placebo. Additionally, subjects recruited from selected sites will participate in an extended follow -up period consisting of 
observation visits at 56 and 84 days after treatment to evaluate the long -term impact of 
ibezapolstat on the microbiome and on disease recurrence. At these selected sites, consecutive subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in the extended follow-up period until approximately 16 subjects are recruited. 
For all subjects , the diagnosis of CDI will be based on unexplained and new onset of diarrhea 
(≥ 3 UBMs in a 24-hour period) and a positive result using a US Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA) -approved test to detect free C. difficile  toxins A and B in stools. 
Baseline safety evaluations will consist of physical examination, vital signs, routine 
laboratory (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) testing, and ECG. 
Subjects will be evaluated for treatment response and safety ( AEs, physical examination, 
vital signs, lab oratory tests, and ECG) at designated time points according to Table 4. 
Clinical cure of CDI will be defined as survival and the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour 
period immediately before EOT that is maintained for 48  hours post EOT without a 
requirement for additional CDI treatment. All s ubjects, regardless of outcome after 10 days 
of treatment,  will be followed for recurrence until Day 38; recurrence is defined as a new 
episode of diarrhea (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24-hour period) with a positive free toxin test result 
(using a Sponsor-approved diagnostic test) that in the opinion of the Investigator requires 
retreatment with an antibacterial for C. difficile . 
Stool samples for microbiome testing in Segment A and Segment B will be collected at the 
time points  outlined in Table  4, frozen, and sent to the central laboratory for analysis. An 
additional sample will be collected in the event of a ny suspected recurrence post TOC , 
regardless of the outcome from the 10 days of treatment. S amples will also be collected in 
the event of any suspected recurrence at 56 and 84 days after  EOT for those subjects 
participating in the extended follow-up period. Evaluation of changes to the microbiome at 
the TOC visit as well as overgro wth by vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus  and multi-drug 
resistant organisms  will be performed using Next Gen metagenomics sequencing and 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction .

Page  28 of 72 For PK analysis  in Segment 2A and 2B, f ecal concentrations of ibezapolstat will be 
determined for the stool samples collected at time points outlined in Table 4. Blood samples 
to measure plasma levels of ibezapolstat  in Segment 2A and approximately 50% of subjects 
(ie, approximately 36 subjects) in Segment 2B will be drawn 2 hours and 4 hours after the 
morning dose at time points specified in Table 4.

7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
Ibezapolstat  is unde r clinical development for  the treatment of CDI.  
A 10-day treatment period was selected  to support the primary endpoint of initial cure rate 
and the 28 ± 2  days post EOT is considered the most appropriate measure of efficacy for 
sustained cure for comparison to vancomycin, since it captures both cure of the initial 
infection and any onset of CDI recurrence.  
The open- label Segment 2A  will allow an initial evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of ibezapolstat  in a limited number of subjects diagnosed with CDI, since there has 
been only limited clinical exposure in healthy subjects to date and  no clinical exposure in 
subjects diagnosed with CDI. The randomized, double-blind Segment 2B allows an 
evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ibezapolstat  in a blinded comparison to 
vancomycin, the current standard of care for CDI. The extended follow -up period allows an 
evaluation of the long-term impact of ibezapolstat on the microbiome and on the incidence of 
recurrent CDI . 
To ensure the randomized population has a true CDI, the diagnosis of CDI is confirmed by 
the presence of free toxins in stool, which is the most rigorous sign of true infection in accordance with treatment guidelines.  
Vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours over 10 days is a standard therapy option for CDI. Segment 2A: Open -Label Segment 2B: Double -Blind Active -Controlled

subsequently meet all the requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
therefore do not enroll (screen failures)  may  be rescreened. Such individuals may be allowed 
to rescreen up to 2 times . Subjects  with a negative toxin text will not be rescreened, unless 
the subject  is experiencing a new , separate diarrheal episode.  
8.4 Study Discontinuation, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects  
Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped ear
lier than the protocol planned duration. Discontinuation of study treatment can be decided 
by either the subject or the Investigator.  
If a subject  discontinues study treatment and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notify the Medical Monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Subjects  who 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  32 of 72 complete or discontinue early from the study will be asked to return to the study site within 
10 days of the last administration of study drug to complete End of Study assessments as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a 
treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) or serious TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be 
followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by the Investigator to no longer be clinically significant. 
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject  may not reenter the study. 
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• subject  withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject's participation in the study may 
be terminated at his/her request or on the basis of the Investigator’ s clinical judgment 
for safety, behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE/ SAE  
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis 
that became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from 
the study 
• general or specific changes in the subject's condition that renders him/her ineligible 
for further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• subject  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance, failure 
to return for defined number of visits) 
• lost to follow-up: the subject  stopped coming for visits, and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject  
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section  12.6.4. 
Additionally, the Sponsor may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or 
other reasons aligned with GCP studies. This study may be terminated at the discretion of the Sponsor or any regulatory agency. An Investigator may elect to discontinue or stop the study 
at his or her study site for any reason, including safety or low enrollment. 
Subjects who discontinue the study will not be replaced. Subjects who discontinue the study 
will be offered treat ment for CDI according to the standard of care antibiotic, at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. In addition, if a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the study center study records.

Page  33 of 72 8.4.1 Lost to Follow- Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study center. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subject s who are lost to follow-up. These efforts 
must be documented in the subject ’s file.  
9 TREATMENTS  
Study treatment includes ibezapolstat , vancomycin, and placebo.  
9.1 Ibezapolstat 
9.1.1 Description

All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled and monitored 
area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator, 
appropriate pharmacists, and authorized study center staff. 
9.1.6 Dietary and Lifestyle Restrictions  
In the Phase 1 study, the food effect on ibezapolstat following a single dose of ibezapolstat 
showed a peak plasma concentration of ibezapolstat of approximately 3 times greater in a 
fasting state versus a fed state. Therefore, to minimize systemic absorption and maximize 
colonic concentrations, subjects in Segment 2B will be instructed to take their morning and

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  34 of 72 evening doses (every 12 hours) of study drug with food; subjects will record their fed or 
fasting status for each dose. The requirement to take study drug with food only affects 
ibezapolstat but not vancomycin or placebo; therefore, only morning and evening doses must 
be taken with food by all subjects in this blinded trial. There is no dietary requirement for the 
other two daily dosing times.  
9.2 Vancomycin 
Vancomycin is commercially available as vancomycin hydrochloride 125-mg capsules. Vanc
omycin capsules will be over- encapsulated with gelatin capsules to be identical in 
appearance to ibezapolstat . 
Vancomycin will be packaged in blister packs identical to ibezapolstat  with each dose 
labeled as “Day X Dose X.”  
Vancomycin will be administered according to instructions in the package insert. 
Vancomycin is administered orally as 125 mg every 6 hours. Although the requirement to 
take study drug with food only affects ibezapolstat, not vancomycin or placebo, to maintain the blind in Segment 2B, only morning and evening doses must be taken with food; subjects will record their fed or fasting status for each dose. There is no dietary requirement for the 
other 2 daily dosing times. 
9.3 Placebo  
Placebo powder will be filled into gelatin capsules to be identical in appearance to 
ibezap
olstat. See Section 9.4 for placebo dosing instructions. 
The placebo capsules ar e manufactured by Piramal Enterprises Limited Pharmaceutical 
Development Services  in Ahmedabad, India and will be supplied by Acurx Pharmaceuticals. 
Packaging, labeling, storage, and handling of placebo will be the same as for ibezapolstat . 
9.4 Dosage Schedule  
Segment 2A  
In thi
s open-label segment, ibezapolstat  will be administered to all enrolled subjects as 
450 mg (three  150 mg capsules) every 12 hours for 10 days. Study drug will be administered 
with 240 mL water . There are no dietary requirements for this part of the study. 
Segment 2B  
Subjects randomly assigned to ibezapolstat  will receive 450 mg ibezapolstat (three 150 mg 
capsules) orally every 12 hours for 10 days. Blinding is maintained in Segment 2B by 
over-encapsulation of all study drugs to appear identical. Because ibezapolstat  and 
vancomycin have different dosing regimens (every 12 hours versus every 6 hours, 
respectively), subjects randomized to ibezapolstat  will receive a placebo twice a day opposite 
of ibezapolstat  dosing to mimic vancomycin dosing every 6 hours in order to maintain the 
blind. Thus, subjects assigned to ibezapolstat  will receive ibezapolstat  every 12 hours (eg, 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201

Page  35 of 72 6 AM  and 6 PM ) and a placebo capsule (eg, 12 AM and 12 PM ) every 12 hours. Subjects 
randomized to vancomycin will receive 1 vancomycin capsule and 2 placebo capsules to 
mimic the 3  ibezapolstat  150 mg capsules every 12 hours (eg, 6 AM  and 6 PM) and a single 
vancomycin capsule (eg, 12 AM  and 12 PM ) every 12 hours. 
Study drug will be administered with 240 mL water.  The morning and evening doses (every 12 hours) of study drug must be taken with food. Subjects will record their fed or fasting 
status for each dose in the subject diary.

9.5 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment and Blinding  
9.5.1 Method of Study  Treatment Assignment  
Segment 2A  
Subjects will be screened and enrolled in the order they present to the study centers and will 
be assigned the next available sequential subject number. Subject number will be assigned sequentially by electronic data capture ( EDC ). 
Segment 2 B 
On Day 1, subjects will be randomly allocated to kits containing blister packs of either 
ibezapolstat  or vancomycin and will be assigned a randomization number according to an 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  36 of 72 interactive  web response system ( IWRS) . The randomization schedule will be produced by 
staff outside the study team and kept secure from blinded study staff until after the study 
database is locked. Site staff will give the kits containing the blister packs to hospital staff 
while the subject is in the hospital (if needed), or to the subject  to take home for self-dosing. 
9.5.2 Blinding  
Segment 2A  
Segment 2A is an open-label study; therefore, blinding is not applicable. 
Segment 2B  
Segment 2B is a double-blind study. Ibezapolstat , placebo , and vancomycin capsules will be 
identical in physical appearance by over- encapsulation , packaged into blister packs with each 
dose labeled,  and will be administered 4 times a day so that neither study staff nor the 
subjects will know to which treatment the subject was assigned. Subjects randomized to 
vancomycin will receive 3 capsules (1 vancomycin capsule and 2 placebo capsules) to mimic 
the 3 ib ezapolstat  150 mg capsules every 12  hours (eg, 6 AM  and 6 PM ) and a single 
vancomycin capsule (eg, 12 AM  and 12 PM ) every 12 hours. The Investigator, study staff, 
Sponsor, Trial Oversight Committee , and the subject will remain blinded to study treatment 
throughout the study. 
According to the randomization schedule as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4), the Investigator or designee will obtain the kit number from the  IWRS for the 
subject . The pharmacist or designee will provide the assigned kit number to the subject. No 
study site personnel, subjects , Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor designees will be unblinded to 
treatment assignment throughout the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. If an 
Investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study treatment, that subject  will 
continue in the study and undergo all protocol-required procedures for the determination of 
safety and efficacy.  
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of AEs or 
concerns for the subject’s safety  or wellbeing , the Investigator may break the randomization 
code for the  subject  via the IWRS , by which system the unblinding will be captured. The 
Investigator is responsible for notifying the Medical Monitor and/or Sponsor of such an event 
within 24 hours. The unblinding and its cause will also be documented in the eCRF. 
9.6 Dosage Modification 
Doses of study drug may not be modified in this study. 
9.7 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated individual will maintain records of drug kit number 
deli
vered to the study site (including amounts and lot numbers received , and confirmation of 
appropriate temperature conditions during transit), the inventory at the study site , the 
distribution to and use by each subject, and the return of materials to the Sponsor for storage 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  37 of 72 or disposal. These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration 
dates, in -clinic temperature log, and unique code numbers assigned to the product and study 
subjects . 
If the subject is hospitalized, administration of all study drug will be supervised by study site personnel to ensure compliance. Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study drug and only authorized study center staff may administer the study drug to the subject. The subject will enter the date and time of dose administration and indicate fed or fasting status 
for each dose in the subject diary. 
If the subject is discharged or not hospitalized, a t each visi t after initiation of treatment, study 
site personnel will record compliance of the subject with the subject’s  assigned regimen. 
Subject s will receive a diary and are to record the time and date of each dose they take in the 
diary. Subjects  will be instruc ted to bring their diaries and drug kits containing 
unused/partially used/empty blister pack s back for inspection at each study visit , as 
compliance will be assessed by capsule counts and recorded in the eCRF . Subjects  are to be 
reminded of the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on 
taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Discontinuation for noncompliance is at the Investigator’s discretion and is to be noted in the 
eCRF.  
Study site personnel will be instructed to keep unused study drug and empty study drug 
packaging for drug accountability. Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor 
until accountability has been fully monitored. Any unused study treatment material may be destroyed by the study center according to their standard operating procedures upon written approval of the Sponsor. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subjects were 
administered study drug from the correct study treatment kits and reconcile the products 
received from the drug  dispensing center. 
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
9.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
9.8.1 Prior Medications  
Re
stricted prior therapies  are provided in Section  8.2. Any medication or vaccine (including 
over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the 
subject took wi thin 30 days be fore, or is currently receiving at the Screening visit, must be 
recorded in the eCRF along with: 
• Reasons for use 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  38 of 72 • Dosage information including dose and frequency 
Because of the seriousness of CDI, subjects need to start on an anti- C. difficile antibacterial 
drug as soon as possible once a CDI is suspected . However, subjects cannot have received 
more than 24 hours of an anti- C. difficile  antibacterial medication before study drug 
treatment . Subjects also can not have received more than 48 hours of any anti- C. difficile 
antibacterial for the current CDI episode within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. 
Doing so may mask the treatment effect of ibezapolstat . 
9.8.2 Concomitant Medications 
All medications and other treatments taken by the subject  during the study, including 
over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements, must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  The entry must include the dose, regimen, route, indication, and dates 
of use. 
Refer to Table 3 for a list of medications that may alter bowel motility or impact CDI status 
and hence have the potential to confound study results. Control over administration of these 
medications is necessa ry, considering the primary endpoint of the study, but it is understood 
that a medication should not be withheld for purposes of the study if an alternative and comparable treatment cannot be provided, and the subject ’s health would otherwise be 
compromised. 
From baseline/Day 1 to Day 12/TOC visit, confounding medications are NOT permitted. 
Any confounding medications taken should be recorded in the eCRF. 
From the Day 12/TOC visit to Day 38, confounding medications, except for CDI medication 
for recurrence,  should be AVOIDED. Any confounding medications taken during this time 
should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Throughout the study, if antimicrobial therapy is required for infections other than those 
because of  C. difficile , antimicrobials without activity/effic acy against C. difficile  should be 
prescribed where possible without compromising the medical care of the subject.

Page  45 of 72 10.1 Informed Consent  
Before  performing any study- rel ated procedures, the Invest igator (or designee) will obtain 
written informed consent from the subject . 
In the event that rescreening occurs , the individual is required to sign a new ICF and must be 
assigned a new identification num ber. 
10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Tabl
e 4). Section  12.5 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 4).  
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include provision of subject diaries, 
assessment of clinical response, measurements of plasma and fecal ibezapolstat  concentrations at 
specific concentrations, characterization of the fecal microbiome, assessment of recurrence, 
measurement of time to resolution of diarrhea, and measurement of time to hospital discharge. 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include vital signs, physical examinations, 
ECGs , clinical  laboratory assessments, pregnancy tests, concomitant medications, and AEs . 
The Invest igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow -up or are considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to the use of study drug. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  
Study discontinuation procedures are described in Section  8.4. 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs leading to study discontinuation is discussed in Section  8.4. 
11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments (Table 4) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Subject Diary  
Subjects will be provided with a diary and completion instruction at the baseline visit (Day  1). 
Ade
quate time should be allocated on Day 1 to ensure that the subject understands how to 
complete the diary and is willing and able to do so every day  throughout the study through 
Day 38/end of study visit. NOTE: The primary objective and endpoint for this study relies on 
subject reported data collected via the diary. It is critical that the Investigator and subject 
understand that accurate, complete, and contemporaneous diary data is required to meet the study primary objective. It is particularly important to ensure that each subject completes the diary 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  46 of 72 every day. The diary will have reminders for subjects to take the study drug and to complete the 
diary daily. 
Subjects will be asked to record the f ollowing details in their diary: 
• Date and time of each dose of study drug and if it was taken with food 
• Date, time, and consistency (using the Bristol Stool Chart) of all bowel movements (up to 
Day 12/TOC) 
• Date, time, and consistency of all UBMs from TOC to Day 38. Subjects will be required 
to answer a question every day in the diary to indicate if UBMs were experienced and to record the details of the UBMs if they occurred.  
Information from the diary will be used directly for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. The Investigator or designee will be required to monitor the subject’s diary entries and contact the subject to discuss any omissions or inaccurate entries. 
Data changes that constitute subject reported data are not permitted. Changes t o diary data will 
be limited to administrative corrections such as erroneous subject number, visit date, subject 
status, and elimination of duplicate data or merging of data for the same subject. 
Subject  reported diary errors will be reported as protocol deviations. 
Investigators or designated site staff will be responsible to have a missed diary entry completed 
by asking the subject about the missed data when the subject brings the diary to study visits. 
Subject s who have difficulty completing the diary ma y be supported by a care provider either 
temporarily or for the duration of the study. This is permitted as long as the Investigator is 
confident that the support provided is adequate to ensure accurate entries into the diary on the 
subject’s behalf. The I nvestigator must document agreement for a care provider to enter 
information into the diary on behalf of the subject and the rationale.  
11.2 Clinical Cure  
Clinical cure: sur vival and the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before 
EOT that i s maintained for 48 hours post EOT without a requirement for additional CDI 
treatment . 
Treatment failures are defined as those subjects : 
• Who do not respond with reduced diarrhea; or 
• Whose diarrhea worsens during therapy; or 
• Who do not remain free of diarrhea for at least 2  days after the end of therapy ; or 
• Who require an additional treatment for CDI before the TOC visit; or 
• Who do not survive until the TOC visit. 
Subjects who failed study treatment will be offered treatment for CDI according to standa rd of 
care antibiotic at the Investigator’s discretion.

Page  47 of 72 After EOT, all subject s will be followed for up to an additional 28 ± 2 days to  assess the 
recurrence of CDI . There also will be post treatment observation visits on Day 6 6 and Day 94 for 
those subjects participating in the extended follow-up period. 
11.3 Sustained Clinical Cure  
Sustained clinical cure: no recurrence of diarrhea from TOC  to Da y 38 among the subset of 
subjects who achieved an initial clinical cure. Recurrence is defined as ≥ 3 UBMs in any 24-hour 
period with free C. difficile  toxin A or B (or both) detected in a stool sample and, in the opinion 
of the Investigator, there is a need for CDI retreatment. 
The Investigator’s assessment of SCC will be based on the Investigator’s decision that there is no 
need for further treatment for CDI based on post treatment symptoms and signs during the 
28 ± 2 days post treatment.  
11.4 Extended  Clinical Cure  
Extended clinical cure: no recurrence of diarrhea from TOC to Day 56 (ECC56) and Day 84 
(ECC 84)
 among the subset of subjects who achieved an initial clinical cure. Recurrence is 
defined as ≥ 3 UBMs in any 24-hour period with free C.  difficile  toxin A or B (or both) detected 
in a stool sample and, in the opinion of the Investigator, there is a need for CDI retreatment. 
The Investigator’s assessment of ECC will be based on the Investigator’s decision that there is 
no need for further treatment for CDI based on post treatment symptoms and signs during the 
28 ± 2 days post treatment. 
11.5 Microbial Assessments  
Microbiome testing: Stool samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Table 4 and 
anal
yzed for microbial quantity and diversity by polymerase chain reaction and Next Gen 
sequencing. 
Subjects will be provided with kits for collecting stool samples at home. A cooling device will be 
included to preserve the sample during transport to the study clinic. Stool samples must be brought to the study clinic within 24 hours of collection. 
11.6 Time to Resolution of Diarrhea  
Time to resolution of diarrhea: the time from outset of treatment to the first formed bowel 
mov
emen t not followed within the next 24 hours by a UBM. 
11.7 Time to Hospital Discharge 
Time from outset of treatment to the day of discharge, and not followed by readmission for 
tre
atment of CDI before the TOC visit (for hospitalized subjects only). 
12 SAFETY AND TOLER ABILITY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety and tolerability assessments (vital signs, physical examinations, ECG recording, AEs, 
clinical laboratory results [routine hematology, biochemistry, and  urinalysis]), pregnancy tests,

Page  48 of 72 and concomitant medications are to be perform ed at protocol- specified visits, as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 4).  Study subjects will be monitored carefully throughout each 
dosing period for adverse experiences. A qualified physician will assess the relationship of AEs 
to study drug and in general based on such considerations as temporal relationship to study drug 
administration, subject’s relevant medical history, and whether the finding is likely because of  a 
pre-existing condition. 
12.1 Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening . Inv estigators should document the occurrence, 
signs, and symptoms of the subject’s  pre-existing conditions , including all prior significant 
illnesses , up to and including 1 year  before Screening. Additional pre -existing conditions present 
at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing ( Day 1 ) are to be 
regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include alcohol consumption and smoking history. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs in the eCRF  in accordance with Section  12.6. All 
changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all subjects  and incl ude age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, and CDI history. 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, respiration rate, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood 
pre
ssure measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4). All vital signs will be measured after the subject  has been resting in a sitting or supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. Either an automated or manual measurement of blood pressure is acceptable; however, the same method should be used for the duration of the study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital signs are recorded; height (without shoe s) will 
be recorded at Screening only. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate measurements will be repeated 
at the Investigator’s di scretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements 
must be recorded as AEs.  
12.3 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cer
vical and axillary lymph nodes; and ne urological and musculoskeletal systems) will be 
performed at Screening  (Visit 1). Physical examinations will be performed by a physician. 
A limited physical examination to verify continued subject  eligibility and to follow -up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  49 of 72 Assessments (Table 4). Symptom- driven, limited  physical examinations will be performed as 
clinically indicated at any study visit.  
12.4 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting (sitting or supine for at least 10 minutes) ECG will be obtained at the visits 
indi
cated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 4 ). Study sites may use their standard operating 
procedures for detailed instructions on conducting the ECG. 
At Screening, the I nvestigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that 
could exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; 
if the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented in the eCRF. ECGs will 
be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  
12.5 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessment samples ( Tabl e 5) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 4).

performed if the results of dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated. All 
laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator. A legible copy of all 
reports must be included in the subject’s  medical record (source document) for that visit  and the 
site must enter laboratory results manually into EDC for each subject. Any laboratory test result

Page  50 of 72 considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE (clinically 
significant AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant abnormal values 
occurring during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, 
or are no longer clinically significant. 
12.6 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if
 present at Screening , worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) 
present at Screening  will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject’s  medical history. 
Recurrence of CDI is a disease- related event that is common in subjects with CDI and can be 
serious/life threatening. Because recurrent CDI  is an important medical event, all recurrences of 
CDI will be reporte d to the Sponsor per the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs. 
Subjects  will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached. 
Each AE is to be documented in the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented in the eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time the subject  gives informed consent through study completion, as indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 4 ). Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, is 
required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a  level acceptable to the 
Investigator. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug are given in Table 6 and Table 7. 
Table 6. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity 
MILD : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.

This document is confidential.  
Page  51 of 72 SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
Table 7. Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug  
UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc. ). 
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug- relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depress ion, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned  an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pa ttern 
of response to the test drug. 
Abbreviation: AE , adverse event. 
12.6.1 Serious Adverse Events  
An S AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , and/or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs 
if they are thought to jeopardize the subject  and/or require medical or surgical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE.  
SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the Investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either the 
Sponsor or the Investigator believes that an event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting.

This document is confidential.  
Page  52 of 72 12.6.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study, or within 
30 days of stopping the treatment must be reported to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor. Any such SAE because of  
any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or when the Investigator becomes aware of the event. Notification can be made using 
the dedicated fax line or email  for the Syneos Health  pharmacovigilance group: 
Syneos Health Safety and P harmacovigilance fax num ber: 1-877-464-7787 
Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance email address : safetyreporting@syneoshealth.com 
If the Investigator contacts the Syneos Health pharmacovigilance group by telephone, then a 
written report must follow within 24 hours and is to include a full description of the event and sequelae in the format detailed in the SAE reporting form. 
The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the Investigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in order to determine the etiology of the problem. The Investigator must report all additional follow-up 
evaluations to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the additional information or as soon as is  practicable. All SAEs will be 
followed up until the Investigator and Sp onsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the subject’s  
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to baseline values  (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures. 
12.6.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse r eactions (SUSARs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
• serious 
• unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safety information in the Investigator’s Brochure) 
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study treatment 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  53 of 72 The Investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to study treatment. The Sponsor 
(or Syneos Health) will consi der the Investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event 
meets the criteria for being reportable as a 7 -day or 15-day safety report. S USARs  that are fatal 
or life -threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the independent ethic s 
committee ( IEC)/institutional review board ( IRB) (where required) within 7 days after the 
Sponsor (or Syneos Health) has first knowledge of them, with a follow-up report submitted 
within a further 8 calendar days. Other SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory 
authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 15 calendar days after the Sponsor (or Syneos Health) first 
has knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor (or Syneos Health) is responsible for reporting SUSARs and any other events 
required to be reported in an expedited manner  to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within the applicabl e timeframes.  
12.6.4 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening . 
Following administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female subjects  will be 
reported until the subject  completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported 
immediately by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; 
however, the Investigator will follow -up with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and 
must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion 
of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow-up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous or therapeutic abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the I nvestigator will report the 
event by faxing/emailing  a completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
If the Investigator be comes aware of a pregnancy occurring in the partner of a subject  
participating in the study, the pregnancy should be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Information regarding the pregnancy must only be 
submitted  after obtaining written consent from the pregnant partner. The Investigator will 
arrange counseling for the pregnant partner by a specialist to discuss the risks of continuing with 
the pregnancy  and the possible effects on the fetus. 
Upon discontinuation from the study, only those procedures that would not expose the subject  to 
undue risk will be performed. The Investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a subje ct is 
subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.

Page  54 of 72 12.6.5 Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for ibezapolstat . The Investigator must immediately notify the 
Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study drug. Overdosage should be managed with 
symptomatic and supportive care. 
12.7 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L  is a questionnaire, which has been developed as a standardized measure of health 
status, which can provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to com plete. Subject s will be 
asked to complete the EQ -5D- 5L at certain intervals in Segment 2B throughout the study, as 
specified in Table 4. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The EQ-5D-
5L essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ -5D descriptive system (page 2) and the EQ visual 
analog  scale (page 3). T he EQ -5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. 
If, at any visit, the subject is unable to complete the EQ-5D-5L independently, then it should not be compl eted for that visit.  
12.8 Medical Resource Utilization Questions  
Medical resource utilization data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected in the eCR
F by the Investigator and study site personnel for all subjects throughout the study. Protocol-
mandated procedures, tests, and encounters are excluded. Data collected will include: 
• Length of hospital stay 
• Hospital admissions and readmissions, and reasons for admission 
• Subject location at admission and discharge 
13 PHARMACOKINETICS  
13.1 Pharmacokinetic Samplin g 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided separately by the S
ponsor or Sponsor designee and will be detailed in the Sample Processing Instructions.  
Any changes in the timing or addition of time points for any planned study assessments must be 
documented and approved by the relevant study team member(s) and then archived in the 
Sponsor and study center study files but will not constitute a protocol amendment. The IRB will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety monitoring scheme or amendment of the ICF. 
13.1.1 Blood Samples 
For Segment 2A and approximately  50% of subjects in Segment 2B : Blood samples for PK  
analysis of ibezapolstat  plasma levels will be collected at the time  points indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 4).  The actual date and time of each blood sample collection 
will be recorded.  The actual date and time of st udy treatment administration will also be

This document is confidential.  
Page  55 of 72 recorded. The timing of PK samples may be altered , and/or PK samples may be obtained at 
additional time  points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. Blood samples will be taken either by 
direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. 
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, labeling, freezing and storage, and shipping 
procedures are provided in a separate laboratory manual.  
13.1.2 Stool Samples  
In conjunction with the drawing of multiple blood samples, multiple stool samples will be collected at the time  points in Segment 2A and 2B indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4) for fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  through the TOC visit. The actual date and time 
of each fecal  void will be recorded.  
Subjects will be provided with kits for collecting stool samples a t home. A cooling device will be 
included to preserve the sample. Stool samples must be brought to the study clinic within 
24 hours of collection. 
Details of stool sample collection, processing, labeling, storage, and shipping procedures are 
provided in th e Sample Processing Instructions. 
13.2 Pharmacokinetic Bioanalytical Methodology 
The concentration of study drug will be determined from the plasma and stool samples using a 
vali
dated bioanalytical method.  Details of the method validation and sample analysis will be 
included with a separate bioanalytical report.  PK samples will be collected in Segment 2A  and 
approximately 50% of subjects in Segment 2B. 
13.3 Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables 
A population PK  anal ysis may  be conducted using plasma and fecal ibezapolstat concentrations. 
The model developed using this approach will be used to predict parameters such as, but not 
limited to, C max and AUC 0-inf for each subject. This analysis will be described in a separate PK 
analysis plan and results from the population PK analysis will also be presented in a separate report.
 
14 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document will provide further 
details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will serve as a complement to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  The SAP will describe the subject analysis sets to be included in the analyses and 
procedures for handling missing data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical 
analyses of the endpoints. 
The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® software  version 9.4 or higher. All data 
will be listed, and summary tables will be provided. Summary statistics will be presented by 
treatment group.  
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  56 of 72 The following descriptive statistics will be used as applicable to summarize the study data unless 
otherwise specified:  
• Continuous variables: sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Geometric mean and coefficient of variation will be included for relevant PK parameter summaries.  
• Categorical variables: frequencies and percentages.  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Segment 2A is considered a proof- of-pri nciple substudy and is not hypothesis driven; the sample 
size of up to 20 subjects was selected to provide some degree of precision for the estimated cure 
rate, as shown in the table below: 
Table 8. Estimate d Cure Rate and Associated 95% Confidence Intervals  Based on the 
Normal Approximation 
Estimated Cure Rate (%)  95% Confidence Interval (%)  
75 (56.0, 94.0)  
80 (62.5, 97.5)  
85 (69.4, 100.0)  
90 (76.9, 100.0)  
Sample size for Segment 2B  was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
1. Non-inferiority study 
2. Endpoint is clinical cure at the TOC visit 
3. One-sided normal approximation test 
4. Overall alpha = 0.05 
5. Allocation to treatment = 1:1 
6. True cure rate = 0.80 in both arms  
7. Non-inferiority margin = 0.25 
8. Power = 80%  
9. Sample size adjusted for one interim analysis  (Pocock 1977). 
A sample size of 3 6 subjects per treatment group, or 72 subjects  total, will satisfy these criteria . 
Further, subjects at  selected sites will undergo  extended follow-up to Day 94. At these selected 
sites, consecutive subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in the extended 
follow-up period until approximately 16 subjects are recruited. 
14.2 Anal ysis Populations 
14.2.1 Enrolled  Pop ulation 
The Enrolled population will include all subjects who sign the ICF. 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  57 of 72 14.2.2 Intent -to-Treat Population 
The intent- to-treat ( ITT) population will include all subjects  who are enrolled and treated in 
Segment 2A or who are randomi zed in Segment 2B . In Segment 2B, subjects will be analyzed 
based on their randomized assignment. The ITT population will be used as the primary analysis 
of efficacy.  
14.2.3 Per Protocol  Population 
The PP population will consist of patients in the ITT population with no major protocol 
deviations. The determination of which subjec ts have major protocol violations will be made in a 
blinded manner before the  database lock. For analyses based on the PP population, subjec ts will 
be grouped according to the treatment to which they were randomized. This population will be 
used for a secondary analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
14.2.4 ITT Extension Population 
The ITT Extension population will include all randomized Segment 2B subjects  who participate 
in the extended follow-up period. Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized 
assignment. The ITT Extension population will be used for the analysis of the ECC56 and 
ECC84 exploratory endpoints.  
14.2.5 Safety Population 
The Safety population will include all subjects  who receive at least 1  dose of study drug. 
Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment actually received.  This population will be used 
for the analysis of safety.  
14.2.6 Pharmacokinetic Population 
The PK population will include all subjects who take at least 1 dose of active study treatment and 
have at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration collected post dose without important protocol deviations/violations or events thought to affect the PK. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis 
14.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The
 primary efficacy endpoint is clinical cure at the TOC visit, defined as survival and resolution 
of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before EOT that is maintained  for 48 hours post 
EOT  without a requirement for additional CDI treatment. 
After EOT, subject s with initial clinical cure will be followed for up to an additional 28 ± 2 days 
to assess the recurrence of CDI.  
For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with a 95% exact (Clopper- Pearson) confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
For Segment 2B, the null and alternative hypotheses for this endpoint are as follows: 
H
0: π 1,T ≤ π 1,C - δ

This document is confidential.  
Page  58 of 72 H1: π 1,T > π 1,C - δ, 
where π 1,T and π 1,C are the true proportions of subjects with clinical cure at the TOC visit for the 
ibezapolstat  450 mg and vancomycin 125 mg treatments, respectively, and δ is the non-
inferiority margin which is here taken to be 0.25. 
This endpoint will be summarized by treatment group using frequencies and percentages, 
together with an exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
The 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation will also be c alculated for the 
difference between the 2 population proportions (π 1,C – π1,T). The null hypothesis will be tested 
using a one-sided normal approximation test non-inferiority at the 0.03037 significance level 
(Pocock  1977) for an overall significance level of 0.05. In the event non-inferiority of 
ibezapolstat  450 mg is demonstrated, Fisher’s exact test (two-sided) will be used to conduct a 
test for superiority  at the 0.05 significance level . 
14.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoint : Sustained Clinical Cure  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is SCC , which is defined below, and is determined for subject s 
who achieve initial clinical cure. The determination will be made at the Day 38 follow-up visit. 
1. Recurrence is defined as ≥  3 bowel movements with unformed stools in any 24-hour 
period with free C. difficile toxin A or B (or both) detected in a stool sample and in the 
opinion of the Investigator, there is a need for CDI retreatment.  
2. SCC is  defined a s initial clinical cure without subsequent recurrence within 28 ± 2 days 
post EOT.  
For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with an exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
For Segment 2B, this endpoint will be summarized by treatment group using frequencies and percentages, together with an exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. A 95% confidence interval based on the normal a pproximation will also be 
calculated for the difference between the 2 population proportions (π
1,C – π1,T). The null 
hypothesis that the true proportions are equal for the 2 treatments will be tested using a two -sided 
Fisher’s exact test at the 0.05 signif icance level . 
14.3.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
14.3.3.1 Microbial Assessments  
Microbiome testing: Stool samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Table 4 and 
analyzed for microbial quantity and diversity by polymerase chain reaction and Next Gen sequencing. 
Changes in the total fecal bacterial quantity and microbial diversity will be assessed for 
ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both segments, and in comparison to those treated with 
vancomycin in Segment 2B. Changes will be assessed during the treatment period and post EOT.

Page  59 of 72 Details of the final microbiome analysis will be described in the SAP or relevant laboratory 
manual.  
14.3.3.2 Time to Resolution of Diarrhea  
For Segment 2A, time to resolution of diarrhea, defined as the time from onset of treatment to 
the first formed bowel movement not followed within the next 24 hours by a UBM, will be 
summarized using the Kaplan- Meier method, with estimates of the true resolution of diarrhea 
rate at Days 1, 5, 10, 12, and 40. The estimated median time to resolution of diarrhea, together with a 95% confidence interval, will also be presented. For Segment 2B, the analysis will be the 
same as for Segment 2A, except that the results will be presented by treatment group. 
14.3.3.3 Time to Hospital Discharge 
For Segment 2A, time to hospital discharge, defined as the time from onset of treatment to the 
day of discharge, and not followed by readmission for treatment of CDI before the TOC visit (for hospitalized subjects only), will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For Segment 2B, the 
analysis will be the same as for Segment A, except that the results will be presented by treatment 
group. 
14.3.3.4 Quality of Life Assessments  
The EQ -5D-5L scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the EQ-5D- 5L visual analog scale score 
will be summarized by treatment group and time point using descriptive statistics.  
Medical resource utilization data will be summarized by treatment group and time point using 
descriptive statistics for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  
These analyses will be performed for Segment 2B only. 
Further details of the statistical analyses of the EQ -5D- 5L and Medical Resource Utilization will 
be described in the SAP.  
14.3.3.5 ECC56 and ECC84  
These endpoints will be summarized by treatment group using frequenci es and percentages, 
together with exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence intervals for the true percentages. Also, 95% confidence interval s based on the normal approximation will be calculated for the 
differences between the 2 population proportions. Th ese endpoints will be analyzed based on the 
ITT Extension Population. 
14.4 Safety Analysis 
TEAEs are defined as any AE wi th onset date on or after the date of the start of the study drug or 
any AE  already present at baseline that worsens in severity . All reported AEs will be coded using 
the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Events with missing onset dates will be considered to be treatment-emergent unless there is additional information indicating that the AE started before study treatment. Only TE AEs will be 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  60 of 72 summarized. If a subject  experiences more than 1 occurrence of the same AE, the occurrence 
with the greatest severity and the closest relationship with the study drug will be used in the 
summary tables.  
The number and percentage of subjects with at least one TEAE, at least one treatment- related 
TEAE, at least one serious TEAE, and at least one TEAE leading to study discontinuation will be 
presented by treatment group. AEs that are definitely, probably, or possibly related, or for which the relationship is missing, will be considered related.  
The number and percentage of subjects having a TEAE in each System Organ Class (SOC) and 
having each individual type of AE  (Preferred Term) will be presented. TEAEs will also be 
summarized at the event level by SOC/Preferred Term and severity. This will be done for all 
TEAEs, all seriou s TEAEs, and all TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study. 
All AEs will be listed by subject , along with information regarding onset, duration, relationship 
and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome.
 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs data will be summarized by treatment group and time point using descriptive statistics  for both the actual values and the changes from baseline, as well 
as numbers and percentages of subjects  with values outside the limits of the normal range at each 
time point. Electrocardiogram data will be summarized by treatme nt group and time point using 
descriptive statistics for both the actual values and the changes from baseline.  
Concomitant medications initiated during the study period will be summarized by treatment 
group using frequencies and percentages. 
14.5 Pharmacokineti c Analysis  
The PK Analysis Set will be used for all summaries and exploratory analyses of PK data. 
Syst
emic exposure of ibezapolstat  will be determined by measuring plasma ibezapolstat  
concentrations at specified time points following dose administration. Fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at specified study visits. Plasma and fecal ibezapolstat  
concentrations will be listed by study segment , treatment, study day and/or nominal time, and 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Summary statistics will be generated for ibezapolstat  plasma and fecal concentrations. Given 
sufficient plasma and fecal levels over the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), the data will be 
analyzed as follows. Median (and range) and mean (and standard deviation) ibezapolstat  plasma 
concentrations at each nominal time point will be calculated, as appropriate. Concentrations 
reported as below the LLOQ will be set to zero for descriptive statistics . 
14.6 Interim Analysis  
A single interim analysis will be performed when the first 36 Segment 2B subjects in the ITT 
Popula
tion (one half of the planned sample size) have data for the primary efficacy endpoint of 
clinical cure at the TOC visit. The null hypothe sis (see  Section  14.3.1) will be tested with  a

This document is confidential.  
Page  61 of 72 one-sided normal approximation test of non-inferiority at a one- sided α=0.03037 level of 
significance ( Pocock  1977) for an overall significance level of 0.05. If the p-value is less than or 
equal to 0.03037 at the time of the interim analysis, then the study may be stopped early for 
success.  
14.7 Trial Oversight  Committee  
A Trial Oversight Committee will be established by the Sponsor to review accumulating safety 
data at regular intervals throughout the study and monitor overall study conduct. Members will 
include the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, C linical Research Organization  Medical Monito r, a 
biostatistician, and 1 PI who has enrolled subjects in Segment 2A. The Trial Oversight 
Committee can recommend in writing to the Sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop the 
clinical study on the basis of efficacy and safety considerations. The Tr ial Oversight 
Committee’s specific duties as well as statistical monitoring guidelines and procedures will be 
governed by a Trial Oversight Committee Charter. 
After up to 10 subjects have been enrolled and completed the full course of treatment in Segment 
2A, the Trial Oversight Committee will assess safety, tolerability, and as data allow, efficacy and 
will make a recommendation to the Sponsor regarding continued enrollment of Segment 2A. 
Another assessment of safety, tolerability, and efficacy will be made by the Trial Oversight 
Committee after all subjects have been enrolled in Segment 2A and followed through at least the 
EOT visit. If the Trial Oversight Committee judges the results to be favorable, it will recommend 
to the Sponsor that Segment 2B commence, or alternatively may make other recommendations to 
the Sponsor to modify Segment 2A or the entire study, such as, for example, expanding 
Segment  2A, adding another open-label dose group, and/or prospectively adjusting the sample 
size of Segment 2B.

activities.  As part of this procedure, the PI or designee must explain orally and in writing the 
nature of the study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration, alternative therapy available, and 
the benefits and risks involved in study participation. The subject  should be informed that he/she 
may withdraw from the study at any time, and the subject  will receive all information that is 
required by local regulations and guidelines for ICH.  The PI will provide the Sponsor or its 
representative with a copy of the IEC/IRB -approved ICF before  the start of the study. 
15.2 Data Handling 
Any data to be recorded directly in the eCRF s (to be considered as source data) will be identified 
at the start of the study. Data reported in the eCRF that are derived from source documents 
should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepancies must be explained. See also 
Section  15.3. 
Clinical data will be entered by site personnel on eCRFs for transmission to the Sponsor. Data on 
eCRF s transmitted via the web -based data system must correspond to and be supported by source 
documentation maintained at the study site, unless the study site makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original or source documentation is maintained.  In such cases, the 
study site should document which eCRFs are subject to direct data entry and should have in place procedures to obtain and retain copies of the information submitted by direct data entry. All study forms and records transmitted to  the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly  identifying personal information is not transmitted.  The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet-based EDC system maintained by Syneos Health.  Access to 
the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s i nternet web site, where a 
user unique assigned username and password are required for access.  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made through the use of the EDC system . 
eCRF s will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been resolved. 
15.3 Source Documents  
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certified copies of orig
inal records of clinical findings, observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The Investigator will provide direct 
access to source documents and/or source data in the facilitation of trial -related moni toring, 
audits, review by IECs/IRBs, and regulatory inspections. 
The Investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects . Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to 
source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be explained if necessary.

Page  69 of 72 APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below)  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
a. Documented hysterectomy  
b. Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
c. Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject ’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
a. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement 
is insufficient.  
b. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
 
Contraception Guidance:  
Male Subjects  
Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (total 
abstinence on a long- term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
In addition, male subject s must refrain from donating sperm for 30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment.  
Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration for 
30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

Page  70 of 72 Female Subjects  
Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use two 
highly effective methods of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table 9.

• Oral 
• Injectable  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods Th at Are User I ndependenta 
Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized Partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method if the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexua l Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the treatment period and continuing for 30 days after the End of Study visit. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject . 
NOTES:  
• Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subject s participating in 
clinical studies.  
• Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, 2 highly effective methods of contraception should 
be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

Page  71 of 72 Pregnancy Testing:  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative 
highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test (a urine test will be provided by the Central Laboratory) 
• Pregnancy testing will be performed at Day 12, Day 38, and whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Male Subject s With Partners Who B ecome Pregnant 
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject  is in this study up to 30 days following the 
last dose of study treatment. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, 
the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Female Subject s Who B ecome Pregnant  
The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject  who becomes 
pregnant up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a subject 's 
pregnancy. The subject  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject  and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnan cy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the Investigator will be reported to 
the Sponsor as described in Section  12.6.4. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study subject s, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.

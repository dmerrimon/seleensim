If you would like to learn more about this study: If you are interested in learning more about the study, please continue to read, or have someone read to you, the information below. It is important that you understand this information before making your decision about participation. If there is anything that you do not understand or if you have questions about the research, be sure to ask any member of the research staff or the study doctor. A. The Nature, Duration and Purpose of This Study: As previously stated, the purpose of this study is to determine if topical capsaicin cream is a useful treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. This is an off-label use of capsaicin cream. Currently the FDA rates capsaicin cream as a pregnancy category B drug meaning: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Many medications commonly given to pregnant women fall in this class including Tylenol and prenatal vitamins.  Why are you being asked to take part in this research? You have presented for treatment of nausea and vomiting during your first trimester of pregnancy. About 30 people will take part in the study at Women and Infants Hospital.   B. The Means By Which The Study Is To Be Conducted: What will you be asked to do?   This is a randomized control trial. If you agree to be in the study we will ask you to do the following things. • We will assign you by chance, like a coin toss, to one of two groups. Each group will receive standard treatment for their nausea and vomiting with the addition of a cream applied to their stomach. Neither you or the researcher will know what cream you received. You and the researcher cannot choose your study group.  You will have a 50% chance of being assigned to either study group. 
 
Page 5 of 20           Version 10/12/2021 
• You will otherwise receive conventional, standard treatment for your nausea and vomiting including IV fluids and commonly used anti-nausea medication, Reglan and if needed Zofran • You will be checked on every 30 minutes regarding your symptom. You will record the severity of your symptoms on a scale every 30 minutes for up to three hours. This is not part of routine care but is part of the study. Should you feel your symptoms have improved to where you would like to go home or your symptoms have resolved, you will be discharged from the hospital.  • If your symptoms have not improved after 90 minutes you will receive the second IV medication, Zofran.  • If your symptoms have not improved after three hours further care will be determined by your provider  If you agree to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign the consent form before we do any interventions.  C. The Risks, Hazards, and Discomforts of the Study:  Taking part in a research study involves inconveniences and risks. The primary risks to this study are risks related with the medications you will receive. You will be monitored in a health care facility throughout duration of your treatment. Aside from the cream the other medications you may receive are commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. If you have any questions about any of the possible risks listed below, you can talk to your study doctor or your regular doctor.   Examples:   Side effects of the Capsaicin cream include:    • Most common side effects are non-severe skin reactions occurring in  >10% of people including,  application site burning (14%), application site redness  (2% to 63%), application site pain (10% to 42%) • Less common side effects include: o Cardiovascular: High blood pressure (2%) o Dermatologic: Scratching of skin (2%), dryness of skin at application site (2%), bump on skin (application site: 6%), itching of skin (2%) o Gastrointestinal: Nausea (5%), vomiting (3%) o Local: Swelling at application site (2% to 4%), itching at application site (6%) o Nervous system: Headache (3%) o Respiratory: Cough (2%), respiratory tract infection (4%) • In less than <1% of users: o Cardiovascular: Fast heat beat or feeling of extra heart beats  o Dermatologic: Skin blister o Local: Application site allergic reaction  o Nervous system: Dizziness 
 
Page 6 of 20           Version 10/12/2021 
o Ophthalmic: Eye itching   Side effects of Reglan include: • A serious reaction called “drug-induced extrapyramidal reaction” may occur. This can cause involuntary movements of your arms, legs, face and mouth  • Common but less severe reactions are drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, and headache • More severe but less common reactions include changes in your blood pressure or heart rate   Side effects of Zofran include:  • A potentially life-threatening side effect of Zofran can lead to abnormalities in your heart rate that can cause life threatening changes in your heart beat • Most common side effects include constipation, headache, dizziness, and fatigue    Other Potential Physical Risks: Because this intervention is experimental there may be other side effects we do not know about yet. We can give you other medicines to make any side effects less serious or to make you feel better.  There is always a chance that any medical treatment can harm you. The research treatments/procedures in this study are no different. In addition to the risks described in this consent, you may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect. If we learn about other risks, we will let you know what they are so that you can decide whether or not you want to continue to be in the study.  Privacy and re-identification risks Through all stages of sample and data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis, your privacy and confidentiality will be protected, with these exceptions: the research team is required to report child abuse and neglect, or substantial risk of harm to self or others to state or local authorities.  A number of efforts will be made to keep your information confidential.  These are outlined in the Privacy and Confidentiality of this form. Despite these efforts, it may be possible to identify you based on the information in these databases and other public information (including information you tell people or post about yourself). The risk of this happening is currently very low. It is possible also that someone could get unauthorized access or break into the system that stores information about you. Every precaution will be taken to minimize this risk. There also may be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen.  D. The Possible Benefit You or Others:

 Principal Investigator: Lauren Murphy, Maureen Hamel IRBNet ID: 1763191-1  Overview: At the time of emergency department evaluation for a chief complaint of nausea or vomiting of pregnancy, we will enroll 30 women across Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island. Participants will be randomized to either adjunctive capsaicin cream treatment or placebo cream. All participants will receive an IV fluid bolus of 1000cc of lactated ringers, Reglan 10mg IV and will have 5g of the appropriate cream administered topically immediately after administration of the IV Reglan. If an additional agent is needed 8mg of IV Zofran will be administered.    Eligibility criteria will include pregnant women in the first trimester (0-14 weeks gestation) ages 18-50 YO presenting to the emergency room at Women & Infants Hospital in Rhode Island with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Eligible participants will be English or Spanish speaking, and will not have taken an anti-emetic such as Reglan or Zofran within the 6 hours prior to presentation. Exclusion criteria will include allergy to Reglan, capsaicin or Zofran, another identifiable source for nausea and vomiting (i.e. gastritis, COVID, diabetic ketoacidosis), molar pregnancies, or patients with a history of gastroparesis or preexisting diabetes mellitus. Women who present to the emergency room with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy will be approached for enrollment and if interested and eligible (as determined by a brief questionnaire), will be consented by a key study personnel. The questionnaire will be completed by the KSP obtaining consent and will be thrown away after determination of eligibility. The questionnaire will be completed in the subjects preferred language with interpreter services used as needed. No identifiable PHI will be on the questionnaire. Study personnel will consist of providers working in the Emergency Room at Women & Infants Hospital. These providers will receive education and training regarding the project’s rationale and procedures. Once a patient is identified as eligible, the provider will consent interested women and obtain electronic consent. Women who identify Spanish as their primary language will be consented with the use of a certified in-person medical Spanish interpreter or Cyracom phone Spanish medical interpreters.   Study Aims: Nausea and vomiting is a common medical condition of pregnancy affecting 50-80% of pregnant women; this condition not only impacts a women’s quality of life, but also is a significant driver of health care costs because of frequent office visits, emergency room visits, and preterm hospitalizations1, 2. Studies have estimated the economic burden of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy to be as high as $1,778,473,782 annually2. Hyperemesis gravidarum is an extreme form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and results in evidence of acute starvation (i.e. large ketonuria), and weight loss of at least 5% from a woman’s pre-pregnancy weight3. Some studies note hyperemesis to be one of the leading causes of pre-term hospitalization second only to preterm labor4. Despite its prevalence, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is one of the most challenging conditions to treat and medical regimens vary by geography and institution. Additionally, there is a paucity of data demonstrating effective therapies for this common medical complication.   Societal recommendations for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy describe step-wise approaches with multiple medications because no one medication or treatment regimen has demonstrated superior efficacy3. First line medications include daily vitamin B6 and doxylamine and then escalation to antiemetics. There are multiple classes of antiemetics 
 
Page 16 of 20           Version 10/12/2021 
including, dopamine agonists (i.e. metoclopramide), phenothiazine medications (i.e. promethazine), and the serotonin inhibitor ondansetron. While these medications are generally accepted as safe in pregnancy, they are not without risk. Specifically, many antiemetics can result in extrapyramidal symptoms and QT prolongation. Importantly, the use of multiple classes of antiemetics can potentiate each individual medication’s negative side effects.  Capsaicin cream, a potent TRPV1 agonist, is commonly used to relieve muscular and neuropathic pain. Recent studies have also implicated the TRPV1 receptor in the modulation of nausea and vomiting The TRPV1 receptor is located in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Though the mechanism for improving symptoms of nausea and vomiting is not entirely clear, it is hypothesized that activation of TRPV1 receptors and capsaicin sensitive nociceptors is associated with hormonal regulation, and modulation of neurotransmitters implicated in nausea and vomiting. Examples include inhibiting the pro-emetic neurotransmitter histamine, desensitizing vagal nerve cholinergic transmission, and reducing substance P in the chemoreceptor trigger zones5,6.  Recently, the use of capsaicin cream has gained popularity in Emergency Medicine for the treatment of hyperemesis secondary to cannabis use with studies demonstrating significant reduction in symptoms 60 minutes after application of 0.1% capsaicin cream7. Capsaicin cream has an excellent safety profile with side effects predominantly limited to skin irritation and erythema at the application site. Importantly, it does not cause the neurologic or QT prolongation effects seen with the previously mentioned antiemetic medications.  Additionally, animal studies have demonstrated that capsaicin cream does not have teratogenic effects and the FDA has classified it as category B, the same category as commonly used and prescribed antiemetics.  Although pregnant women have been excluded from large clinical trials using capsaicin cream to treat nausea and vomiting, there are small studies and case reports demonstrating safety and efficacy of both ingested and topical capsaicin in pregnancy. Yuan et al performed a randomized control trial of women between 22 to 33 weeks gestation with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) assessing the effects of oral capsaicin powder on pregnancy outcomes. The study demonstrated a decrease in large for gestational age newborns in the capsaicin group compared with the placebo group but did not demonstrate any adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes8. Additionally, a case series by Yosipovitch et al of topical capsaicin for treatment of acute lipodermatosclerosis and lobular panniculitis included a single pregnant individual in her second trimester. The patient was treated with 0.075% capsaicin cream five times a day for three weeks with the only adverse effect reported being minimal burning at the site of application9. Finally, Abedian et al used 0.075% capsaicin cream to treat intraoperative nausea during cesarean section without reported adverse effects on maternal or neonatal well-being and additionally found a statistically significant reduction in need for antiemetics in the treatment group10.  While the data on the safety of capsaicin cream in pregnancy is mounting, its utility as an antiemetic has not been well studied in pregnancy.  This proposal will be one of the first, if not the first to randomize pregnant women presenting with nausea and emesis to this safe, potential treatment.  This pilot study could be the first step in revolutionizing the treatment of hyperemesis.    Our long-term goal is to find an effective treatment regimen for a common yet elusive medical complication of pregnancy while improving women’s quality of life and reducing health-care costs. The overall objective of this application is to assess the effectiveness of capsaicin cream as an adjunctive medication in improving perceived nausea and vomiting symptoms as well as

decreasing the need for additional treatments and total time in the emergency room. We also want to determine the feasibility of this treatment as an adjunctive agent in the outpatient setting. Our central hypothesis is that women assigned to adjunctive treatment with capsaicin cream will have decreased time to symptom control, decreased need for additional treatment and decreased length of stay in the emergency department. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Determine whether adjunctive treatment with capsaicin cream decreases patient’s perceived time to symptom control. H1: Women treated with capsaicin cream will have decreased time to perceived symptom control as measured by a validated scale used to measure patient’s perception of the severity of nausea and vomiting symptoms (i.e. VAS).  Aim 2: Determine whether adjunctive treatment with capsaicin cream decreases the need for treatment with additional anti-emetics. H2: Women treated with capsaicin cream will have decreased need for additional antiemetics.  Aim3: Determine whether adjunctive treatment with capsaicin cream decreases length of stay in the emergency department. H3: Women treated with capsaicin cream will have decreased time to discharge from the emergency department.  It is anticipated that this investigation will demonstrate that women treated with capsaicin cream experience less distress due to their nausea and vomiting symptoms that women who receive routine care; that treatment with adjunctive capsaicin cream reduces perceived severity of symptoms more quickly than placebo leading to the decreased need for additional therapy; and that capsaicin cream decreases the total length of stay in the hospital compared to routine care.  Research Design: Key study personnel (KSP) at Women and Infants Hospital will identify and enroll women during their emergency department visit. Once a patient is identified as eligible, the KSP will approach and consent interested women. Women who identify Spanish as their primary language will be consented with the use of a certified in-person medical Spanish interpreter or Cyracom phone Spanish medical interpreter. Electronic consent will be obtained in English or Spanish as per patient preference. Women who agree to participate in the study will be randomized using block randomization to one of two groups: treatment with IVF, Reglan and 0.075% capsaicin cream or treatment with IVF, Reglan, and placebo cream. Pharmacy will dispense medication to the research nurse/emergency room provider.  The capsaicin cream and the placebo cream are both unscented and are also the same color and texture; they will both be dispensed in identical packaging to ensure study personnel; ED providers and the participant are blinded to study assignment.  All participants will receive an IV fluid bolus of 1000cc of lactated ringers, Reglan 10mg IV and will have 5g of the appropriate cream administered topically. Specifically, the emergency room provider will apply 5g of the cream to the participant’s abdomen using a gloved hand immediately after administration of the IV Reglan. The time of cream application will serve as time 0 and the “Intervention start time.”  Participants will indicate the severity of their symptoms immediately prior to administration of Reglan, at time 0 and every 30 minutes for a total of 120 minutes after administration of the first medications (or discharge) using a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS)11,12. The scale will be provided in English or Spanish as appropriate. The scales will be provided on paper for subjects to fill out and will be marked with a unique patient identifier number. The completed scales will

be collected by KSP and stored in a designated project binder. If at the 90-minute time mark the patient does not report improvement of their symptoms, Zofran 8mg IV will be administered.  If a participant's symptoms do not improve after Zofran administration, escalation of care will be at the discretion of the primary covering provider. A participant’s request for discharge will be to indicate satisfactory improvement in a participant’s perception of his/her nausea and vomiting symptoms. The time elapsed from the “Intervention start time” to request for discharge will be calculated to determine the primary outcome of “Time to symptom relief. Given that this is a medication intervention study, we have asked Dr. Stephen Carr, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, member of the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine and former member of the IRB at Women & Infants Hospital to serve as a Data Safety Monitor. Every three to six months he will review the unblended data, review any and all adverse events and ensure proper reporting to the IRB. Analytical Plan: Variables as outlined below will be extracted from the participants chart: ● Estimated due date, gravidity and parity, BMI, Age ● Medications received, total treatment time, admission versus discharge ● Subjected improvement of symptoms, adverse reactions (skin irritation etc.) The data will be analyzed with assistance from the Research Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  We anticipate comparing treatment and placebo groups on all baseline characteristics to ensure effective randomization as well as mean times to symptomatic improvement, mean times to “satisfactory symptomatic improvement”, mean length of stay, rate of additional medication administration, mean number of additional medications needed to treat symptoms and admission rates. We will evaluate patients’ perception of severity of symptoms using the VAS (Figure 2)11,12, a validated scale currently used in the post-operative and emergency room settings to assess patient’s perception of the severity of his/her nausea and vomiting symptoms. The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat.  We will test for group differences by T-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and by Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.  If censoring of time to improvement or length of stay occurs, we will estimate group differences by time-to-event approaches and the log-rank test.  Setting alpha at 0.05 and power at 80%, a standardized mean difference in time until discharge of 1.1 (Cohen’s d) will be detectable with 15 patients per group.  While our efficacy estimate may not achieve statistical significance at the standard 5% level, estimates of means, standard deviations, and proportions will be used to inform sample size calculations for a larger trial.   Expected outcomes: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy continues to be a significant cause of morbidity experienced by pregnant women and a large source of health care costs and usage during pregnancy. The majority of therapies are oral or IV medications with potential side effects when taken either alone or in combination. We are proposing the use of capsaicin cream, an easy to administer medication that does not require IV access or the ability to tolerate oral intake. If proven effective, this medication could be used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the outpatient setting. Patients could easily self-administer it at home. It is anticipated that this investigation will demonstrate that women treated with capsaicin cream experience less distress due to their nausea and vomiting symptoms that women who receive routine care; that treatment with adjunctive capsaicin cream reduces perceived severity of symptoms more quickly than placebo leading to the decreased need for additional therapy; and that capsaicin cream decreases the total length of stay in the hospital compared to routine care. Through this study we will have a better understanding on the potential for capsaicin cream to be used as an adjunctive treatment for acute presentations of nausea and vomiting in

pregnancy. This project represents a pilot proof of concept study; thus the small sample size of N=30. We anticipate that 15 patients in each group will allow us demonstrate the efficacy of capsaicin as an adjunctive therapy to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy among patients with the most severe symptoms. Treatment for nausea and vomiting is always multi-pronged. If capsaicin as an adjunctive therapy is efficacious among the sickest of patients, then the data  will inform the feasibility and acceptability of a future larger randomized control trial assessing the potential of capsaicin cream to be utilized as an adjunctive therapy for managing hyperemesis symptoms.

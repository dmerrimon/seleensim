CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  prior to enrollment to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria requirements 
will be required to return to the clinic within 45 days to complete the 
remaining activities. Subjects who require “washout” for longer than 45 days will be re -consented. A brief physical examination including vital 
signs, UPT (if applicable), electrocardiogram (ECG), Fitzpatrick Skin Type a ssessment, clinical evaluations (lesions counts, IGA, as well as 
baseline local skin reactions (LSRs) pre- application), and photographs 
will be performed at this visit. Prior and concomitant therapy and 
concomitant medications/procedures will be reviewed. Subjects will be 
randomized and assigned a test article kit number. Test article and 
Subject Diary will be dispensed. Subjects and parent/guardian (if 
applicable) will be instructed on how to apply the test article and to 
record applications in the Subject  Diary. The first dose will be applied 
during this visit under supervision of the investigator. Adverse events 
(AEs) and LSRs post -application will be assessed. The subject will be 
scheduled for the first follow -up visit.  
 
2. Visits 2 and 3 (Weeks 4 & 8) : Sub jects will return after the initial 
treatment for clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and LSRs), UPT (if applicable), and review of concomitant medications/procedures. Test article application and compliance will be reviewed (from Subject Diary) , test article and Subject Diary will be dispensed/returned (as 
required), and photography will be performed. The subject will be 
scheduled for the next follow -up visit.  
 
3. Visit 4 (Final Visit, Week 12 & Early Termination): Subjects will return 
for the fina l visit for review of concomitant medications/procedures, 
UPT (if applicable), ECG, clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and LSRs), and photography. All test article will be returned and 
compliance documented (from Subject Diary).  
Study Measurem ents Efficacy  will be assessed by the investigator as follows:  
• Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) : Overall severity of acne 
using a five -point scale from 0 = clear to 4 = severe will be conducted 
at each visit. This is a static morphological scale that  refers to a point 
in time and not a comparison to Baseline.  
• Acne Lesion Counts:  Total lesions, including inflammatory lesions 
(papules, pustules, and nodules) and non- inflammatory lesions (open 
and closed comedones), on the face will be accurately counted , but 
recorded separately at each visit. 
 Safety  will be assessed by the investigator via the evaluation of local and 
systemic AEs and UPTs at each visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, or at the end of treatment). ECGs will also be assessed at Baseline and  Week 12.  
 
LSRs including telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, and scaling/dryness will be assessed by the investigator at each visit using a 
five-point ordinal scale (0 = none, 1 = trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = 
severe). Subjects will be asked to rate the severity of stinging/burning and 
pruritus using a four -point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = 
severe) at each visit (Baseline [pre- and post -application], and Weeks 4, 8, 
and 12).

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  Study Endpoints  Efficacy  Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoints (Hierarchical)  
• P1: Proportion of subjects in each treatment group achieving 
“success” at Week 12, with “success” defined as an IGA score of 
“clear (score=0)” or “almost clear (score=1)” AND at least a two -
point reduction in IGA compared to Baseline.  
• P2: Absolute change from  Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12.  
• P3: Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts 
in each treatment group at Week 12.  
 
Secondary Endpoints (Hierarchical)  
• S1: Absolute change from Baseline in tot al lesions counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
• S2: Percent change from Baseline in total lesions counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
• S3: Percent change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesions 
count in each treatment group at Week 12.  
• S4: Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesions count in 
each treatment group at Week 12.  
 
Safety Endpoints:  
• Local and systemic AEs at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 
12). 
• LSRs: telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
scalin g/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus scored by frequency 
and severity at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12).  
• UPTs in all WOCBP at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12).  
• Material changes from Baseline in ECGs at Week 12.  
Sample Size 
Calculations and Power Considerations  Assumptions used for sample size calculations were estimated from Phase 2 
Dose Escalation Study (171 -7151- 201), using a subset of subjects with 30-
75 inflammatory lesions and 30 -100 non -inflammatory lesions at Baseline . 
 
All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints have to be performed at 
the same significance level α=0.05 two -sided and the failure to reject a null 
hypothesis will imply the failure of rejecting all of the subsequent null hypotheses.  
 
In order to k e e p  t h e  o v e r a l l  Ty p e  I I  e r r o r  β = 0 . 1  f o r  t h e  w h o l e  s t u dy ,  t h e 
sample size for the three hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be 
calculated considering an individual Type II error β=0.033.  
 
For an IGA success rate of (continuity corrected) 14.00% f or CB -03-01 
cream and 2.17% for vehicle cream (odds ratio=7.3), sample size was 
estimated to be 202 subjects per treatment group.  
 
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion 
counts of -22 for CB -03-01 cream and -1 for vehicle cream  (standard 
deviation=17), sample size was calculated to be 19 subjects per treatment 
group.

Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, 2015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06   
For a mean absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of 
-15 for CB -03-01 cream and -10 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=17), 
sample size was  calculated to be 334 subjects per treatment group.  
 
The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the 
same significance level α=0.05 two -sided of the primary endpoints if and 
only if all the null hypotheses on the primary endpoints are rejected.  
 For a mean absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -13 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=17), sample 
size was calculated to be 13 subjects per treatment group.  
 For a mean percent change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -14 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample 
size was calculated to be 77 subjects per treatment group.  
 For a mean percent change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion counts 
of -33 for CB -03-01 cream and -5 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), 
sample size was calculated to be 43 subjects per treatment group.  
 
For a mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -37 for CB -03-01 cream and -23 for vehicle cre
am (standard 
deviation=40), sample size was calculated to be 172 subjects per treatment 
group.  
 
Based on those assumptions, at least 350 subjects in each treatment group 
(CB-03-01 cream, 1% BID and vehicle BID) will be included into each 
Phase 3 study to p rovide sufficient power (90%) with the chosen primary 
endpoints.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise 
stated. Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will 
be provided for base line variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables.  
Continuous variables will be described by descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and maximum). Frequency 
counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for 
categorical data. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group.  
 
Study Sets:  
The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application 
of the test article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) set will include all randomize d 
subjects. The per -protocol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT set and will 
include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol 
deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of efficacy will b e conducted on both the ITT and PP sets, with the 
ITT set considered as the primary set for statistical analysis. Multiple 
imputation will be used to impute missing values for the primary endpoints 
and absolute change in total lesions count (S1) in the ITT  analyses. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results obtained on the ITT set for the primary endpoints (change from 
Baseline in non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and IGA

(i.e., S2 -S4: percent change in lesions counts) will be calculated using the 
values obtained from the multiple imputation of the primary efficacy 
endpoints and secondary efficacy endpoint #1 (S1).  
 Efficacy Analyse s: 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for P1 through P3.  
 
P1: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed 
effects will be used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving 
“success” in each treatment group at Week 12, where “success” is defined as an IGA score of “clear (score=0)” or “almost clear (score=1)” AND at least a two -point improvement in IGA compared to Baseline.  
 P2: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the 
absolute change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 
P3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from 
Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12 , 
with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline 
inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in 
hierarchical order for S1 through S4.  
 S1: An A NCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from 
Baseline in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 
S2: An ANCOVA will be used  to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate. 
 
S3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in non -inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -
inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 S4: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory 
lesion count as the covariate.

Non-compliance will be defined as a compliance value less than 80%.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize test article compliance at 
each visit and overall for the ITT and PP sets. The proportion of compliant and non -compliant subjects will be summarized by table of frequencies at 
each visit and overall for the ITT and PP sets.  Subjects with an overall 
compliance not evaluable (due to missing data) or less than 80% will be excluded from the PP set. 
 
Extent of Exposure  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the ITT, PP, and Safety sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of 
test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each 
subject. 
 
Safety Analyses:  
Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
LSRs (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, 
scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) will be summarized by the 
frequency of each individual LSR by treatment group and severity at each visit.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs)  
Pre-treatment AEs (PTAEs) and Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be 
coded using the MedDRA codi ng dictionary. TEAEs will be summarized by 
treatment group and overall. The number and proportion of subjects with any TEAE and the number of TEAEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), seriousness, relationship to t est 
article, and severity.  
 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs ) 
ECGs will be evaluated for any material change during the study period. Results (normal/borderline/abnormal) of the ECG and descriptive statistics will be provided by treatment group at each visit for h eart rate, RR duration, 
PR duration, QRS duration, QT duration including Bazett’s and Fridericia’s

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  1. BACKGROUND  
CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α-propionat e) is a steroidal antiandrogen that is being developed 
as a 1% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, an androgen -dependent skin 
disorder. CB -03-01 binds to the human androgen receptor displacing the androgenic 
hormones and acts as an androgen antagonist. In human plasma, CB -03-01 is rapidly 
metabolized to parent cortexolone so that its systemic bioavailability after topical 
application is anticipated to be low. Cortexolone, the main by -product, is a physiological 
component of the pool of endogenous corticosteroids, and is an intermediate in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, but it only exhibits weak glucocorticoid properties [ 1]. 
 In single -dose studies in mouse and in rat, and following repeated subcutaneous 
administration in rats, and dermal administration in rabbits and minipigs, the drug was well tolerated with no significant local or unexpected systemic effects. CB -03-01 is not 
mutagenic in the Ames test or in the human chromosome aberration test, and it is not a skin sensitizer.  
 To date, four Phase 1 and three Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed with CB-03-01 cream in Europe and the United States, with over 500 subjects exposed to CB -03-01 
creams. All studies were conducted using CB -03-01 cream, 1%; additional concentrations 
of CB -03-01 cream (0.1% and 0.5%) were also used in the most -recent Phase 2 Dose-
Escalating study. The studies included:  
1. A Phase 1 Single Dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study in 24 healthy volunteers [randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-ascending dose],  
2. A Phase 1 Repeat Dose PK Study in 24 healthy volunteers [randomized, vehicle -
controlled, 14- day repeat -dose], 
3. A Phase 1 Steady State PK Study in 8 subjects with acne vulgaris [single center, open-label, pilot, 6- week repeat -dose] 
4. A Phase 1 Three- week  Cumulative Skin Irritation Study in 36 healthy volunteers, 
5. A Phase 2 Hypothalamic- Pituitary -Adrenal axis (HPA)/PK study in 42 subjects 
with acne vulgaris [open-label, 14- day repeat -dose] 
6. A Phase 2 Comparator Proof of Concept Study in 72 adult subjects wit h facial acne 
vulgaris [randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, active -comparator ( Retin -
A
® [tretinoin] 0.05% cream), 8- week repeat -dose], and 
7. A Phase 2 Dose -Escalating Study in 363 subjects with facial acne vulgaris [multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled, 12- week repeat -dose] 
 Overall, the data that resulted from the completion of the aforementioned studies has demonstrated that CB -03-01 creams selected for clinical development (a) are well tolerated 
locally, (b) result in minimal systemic exposure when applied topically, (c) have a clinical safety profile without any concern and similar to the placebo, and (d) at 1% concentration

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  applied BID are significantly more effective than its vehicle at reducing inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory lesions counts in adolescent and adult subjects. 
 
CB-03-01 could offer advantages over existing products for acne vulgaris due to its 
potential efficacy and lack of systemic antiandrogen activity. Because its pharmacological action appears to be limited to the local site of application, use of CB -03-01 may be able 
to mitigate the side effects related to systemic exposure to hormonal agents currently used in the treatment of acne.  
2. RATIONALE  
The concentration of CB -03-01 selected for the initial clinical studies (1%) was based on 
antiandrogenic activity in the hamster flank organ test in which the best effective concentration was 0.8% [ 1]. The results of the Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study demonstrated 
that CB -03-01 cream, 1% applied BID had more favorable results than other treatments 
(0.1% BID, 0.5% BID, and 1% QD) and no material safety issues were noted with any of 
the concentrations of CB -03-01 cream [ 2]. Based on the collective findings of the previous 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, CB -03-01 cream, 1% BID appears to be the best treatment 
candidate to advance for further clinical study and development as a topical treatment for acne vulgaris. Thus, the present Phase 3 study has been designed to determine and compare 
the efficacy of treatment with CB -03-01 cream, 1% and the vehicle cream applied twice 
daily for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris.  
3. OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safe ty and efficacy of CB -03-01 
cream, 1% versus the vehicle cream applied twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with facial acne vulgaris.  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group 
comparison study of safe ty and efficacy for CB -03-01 cream, 1% in male and female 
subjects, 9 years or older with moderate to severe acne vulgaris on the face . Eligible 
subjects must have acne vulgaris of the face (which can include the nose) with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4, at least 30 to a maximum of 75 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), and at least 30 to a maximum of 100 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones). At least 700 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 38 sites. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
 
1. CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α-propionate) cream, 1% 
2. Vehicle cream

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  will be dispensed onto a fingertip and applied to the face by dabbing small amounts gently 
on multiple regions of the face (e.g., forehead, nose, cheeks, chin). Using a fingertip, the cream will be spread to provide a thin, uniform layer of the cream over the entire face.  Subjects and parents/guardians (if applicable) will be instructed to apply the cream to the whole face twice daily (morning and in the evening) for 12 weeks. The subject should ideally allow at least eight (8) hours between applications. All subjects should not wash the treated area for at least four (4) hours following test article application; and MUST 
NOT  APPLY THE TEST ARTIC LE WITHIN FOUR (4) HOURS PRIOR TO ANY 
STUDY VISIT . 
 Subjects will be provided with a Subject Diary to record the dates and time of application. Subjects will be instructed to only apply the study cream to the face as instructed by the investigator or designated study personnel. Note: T he dispensing, recording, and 
application of the test article by the subject may require adult supervision by the subject’s parent/guardian.  
 Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will also be provided with a Subject Instruction Sheet providing them with instructions on how to use and store the cream at home during the study period.  Subject and parent/guardian (if applicable) will be instructed to bring all the containers of cream (used and unused) and their completed diaries to each visit. The study  staff will 
weigh all the returned containers and will record the weights on the appropriate study medication accountability logs and case report forms (CRFs).  
 
Subjects who are not compliant with applying the creams as instructed (determined from subject diaries and/or the weight of test article used) may  be discontinued from the study. 
6.3 Warnings, Precautions and Contraindications 
These test articles are for topical use only. Care should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.  Subjects with a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles should not participate in this study.  
 Should skin irritation or rash develop, subjects should discontinue use and contact the study site. 
 In case of accidental ingestion, subjects should contact the investigator immediately.

7. RANDOMIZATION ASSIGNMENT  
Subjects who are eligible for enrollment into the study will be randomized to receive CB -
03-01 cream or vehicle cream in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization scheme will be blocked by 
investigational site. At each site, subject kits will be dispensed according to the kit number 
assigned by an IVRS/IWRS system as subjects are enrolled. At each site, the study staff 
will add the site number (provided to each site) and the subject number (starting with 001) to each kit label. The kit number dispensed to each subject will also be recorded on the 
source documents and CRFs. Treatment group designation will remain blinded until the final database is locked (unless unblinding is required as described in Section 15). Subjects 
who withdraw prematurely from the study will not be replaced. 
8. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPIES

9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will consist of a Screening/Baseline Visit and three (3) scheduled visits.  
 
Specific activities for each study visit are listed below.  
9.1 Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline 
Subjects can be screened for the study up to 45 days before Visit 1. During screening, the study requirements will be reviewed, written informed consent/assent obtained, and eligibility confirmed. If app licable, the washout from prohibited medications or treatments 
will be determined and implemented. Subjects who require “washout” for longer than 45 days will be re -consented.  
 At Screening, the investigator or designee will:  
• Obtain a signed, written informed consent (unless the subject signed a consent 
within the past 45 days). Note: a subject under 18 years of age must provide written 
informed assent and be accompanied by the parent or legal guardian at the time of assent/consent signing. The parent or legal guardian must provide informed consent for the subject. If a subject becomes 18 years of age during the study, the subject must provide written informed consent at that time to continue study participation.  
• Complete review and documentation of the subject’s medical and dermatological 
history and demographic information. 
• Record any concomitant medications and therapies. 
• Confirm the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Have subject complete washout from any prohibited medications, if necessary. 
 
Once the Screening procedures have been completed, the investigator or designee will:  
• Perform a dermatologic exam and brief physical exam (including vital signs, height, 
and weight). 
• Perform a Fitzpatrick Skin Type assessment (see Section 10.3).  
• Perform a UPT for all WOCBP (see Section 5.1.1  for definition). The results must 
be negative for the subject to be enrolled into the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  10.1 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)  
At every study visit, overall severity of acne using a five -point scale from 0 = clear to 
4 = severe will be conducted at each visit. This is a static morphological scale that refers 
to a point in time and not a comparison to Baseline. Subjects must have an IGA score of 3 
(moderate) or 4 (severe) at Baseline.  
 
0 Clear  Absence of active disease with no inflammatory or non -
inflammatory lesions.  
1 Almost Clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than one small 
inflammatory lesions.  
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodular/cystic 
lesions).  
3 Moderate  Up to many non -inflammatory lesions and may have so me 
inflammatory lesions but no more than one nodular/cystic lesion. 
4 Severe  Up to many non -inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions 
but no more than a few nodular/cystic lesions. 
10.2 Acne Lesion Counting  
The number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on the face vertically from the hairline 
to mandible rim and horizontally from ear to ear, including those on the nose will be 
counted to determine subject eligibility at Visit 1. Subjects must have at least 30 to a maximum of 75 inflammatory lesions and 30 to a maximum of 100 non- inflammatory 
lesions on the face (which can include the nose) at Baseline.  
 Lesions are defined as follow s: 
• Comedones- open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads).  
• Papules - raised inflammatory lesions with no visible purulent material.  
• Pustules- raised inflammatory lesions with visible purulent material.  
• Nodules- Any circumscribed, inflammatory masses greater or equal to 5 mm in 
diameter with or without cystic changes.  
10.3 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment  
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will document the subject’s skin phototype (I -VI) 
using the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment as described below:

10.4 Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
At every study visit, the investigator or designee will document the severity of the 
following LSRs known to be associated with application of topical steroids: 
• Telangiectasia  
• Skin atrophy 
• Striae rubrae  
A five -point ordinal scale will be used to assess the severity of these reactions (0 = none, 
1 = trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe).  
 
In addition, the investigator or designee will evaluate the severity of the following LSRs known to be associated with acne vulgaris, using the five -point ordinal scales described 
below: 
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Scaling/dryness

focused on other activities  
2 Moderate - often aware  of itching, annoying, sometimes disturbs sleep and daytime 
activities  
3 Severe -constant itching, distressing; frequent sleep disturbance, interferes with 
activities  
 These LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication) or require withholding the application of the test articles will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.  
11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is required in this study. Photographs taken as part of this 
study will be used to document the effects of treatment, AEs, or other findings during the trial. Color photographs (both sides of the face and the front of the face) of the areas with 
acne lesions of all enrolled subject s will be performed at the Baseline Visit prior to 
application of the test articles and at Visits 2, 3, and 4. The study sites will be provided with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized photographs. In addition, investigators at all s tudy sites may take photos as they deem appropriate to document the 
clinical status of the subject (e.g., an AE, etc.).  Photographs taken for this study are for 
informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment.  Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If a subject initially consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the Sponsor may use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above.

12.1 Urine Pregnancy Tests (UPTs)  
The UPT will be performed at the study site if the site is registered and conforms to Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments  (CLIA) regulations for such testing (site possesses 
at a minimum a current valid C LIA Certificate of Waiver) or at an appropriately registered 
reference laboratory. A UPT will be performed at every visit on all WOCBP (see Section 
5.1.1 for definition). The investigator will report the UPT results on the CRFs, in the 
subject’s medical records and, if applicable, in independent records maintained at the study 
site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU of β-HCG/mL o f urine.  
13. END OF STUDY CRITERI A 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
End of Study form for all completed and discontinued subjects. 
13.1 Completion of the Study  
Each subject who completes the 12- week course of treatment as specified in this protocol 
will have completed the study.  
13.2 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following 
reasons:  
• Whenever the subject or the subject’s parent/guardian decides it is in the subject’s 
best interest to be withdrawn, Note: if the subject or parent/guardian decides to withdraw from the study due to an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal due to an AE. 
• Whenever the investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to be withdrawn  
• AEs 
• Worsening of condition or treatment failure (in the opinion of the investigator) 
• Noncompliance 
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up  
• Sponsor administrative reasons 
 If a subject withdraws prematurely during the 12- week treatment period for any reason, the 
Visit 4 procedures should be completed at that time. Subjects who withdraw prematurely will not be replaced. When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a treatment -related 
AE (i.e., possibly, probably or definitely related as defined in Section 14), when possible, 
the subject should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the AE.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  13.3 Study Termination 
The study may be  terminated by the investigator or the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to 
continue, he or she may stop the study. A study termination by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor. 
 In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be submitted to the Sponsor by the investigator within five (5) working days.  In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate notification will be given to the investigator.  
14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
 
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug  (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless the event occurred as a result of a study- related procedure and is unanticipated, in such cases, the event should be recorded 
as an AE and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of test article. These data are considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
 Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists Therapeutics, Inc. (TI) in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose- related test article toxicity;  
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or vehicle/placebo 
being tes ted or used as a reference in the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may be 
either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be completely recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the investigator shoul d 
report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their particip ation in the 
study should receive follow -up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE 
that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE is considered by the investigator to be treatment- related (i.e., 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to test article). 
14.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if they become serious.  LSRs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1% -1% 
concentration) include (with decreasing frequency) erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, stinging/burning, edema, and telangiectasia; however most LSRs were typically of minimal to mild severity. No subjects discontinued treatment due to these LSRs.  
 AEs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1 -1% 
concentration) were minimal, typically mild in severity, a nd most were recovered/resolved 
without sequelae at the end of the study. Only two AEs in one (1) subject were judged as probably or possibly related to treatment; both of these treatment -related AEs (burning and 
cold at application site) were mild in seve rity. Two SAEs have been reported to date; both 
were not related to treatment and were resolved at the end of the study. In addition, one subject discontinued early from the study due to an AE (urinary tract infection), which was not related to treatment.  
 The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit.  The severity of each AE, as judged by the investigator, will be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild - The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.  
 
Moderate - The AE causes the subject d iscomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06   
Severe - The AE causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual 
activities, and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
 
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories:  
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed b y improvement on stopping or reducing 
the dosage, and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re- challenge).  
 
Probable  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the test article; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
 
Possi ble - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
 
Unlikely  - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlyin g 
illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
 
Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
The investigator should categorize the outcome of  the AE according to the following 
categories:  
  Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE.  
  Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.

 The investigator should report any other action taken due to the AE.  An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 A suspected adverse reactio n is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event.   For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected a dverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not lis ted at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE CRF and on the TI SAE Report Form, 
and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opinion of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening event.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convuls ions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
• Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre -planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen, and 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by either the investigator or the Sponsor require expeditious handling and reporting to TI to comply with regulatory requirements. All serious AEs, 
whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by telephone to the Medical Monitor and, in the event that he/she is unavailable, to  the 
Project Manager listed on the first page of the protocol.  Written notification of all SAEs 
should be sent to the Project Manager by email or confirmed facsimile transmission. These

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  include those SAEs listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an 
assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
 
Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In this case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the Sponsor. In addition, such information should also be provided to the site’s respective IRB per their gov erning guidelines for SAE reporting.  
 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the test article, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to TI, if available.  As required, TI will notify participating  investigators of all suspected adverse reactions 
that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed 
in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are:  
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions,  
ii) Findings from other studies including epidemiological studies, pooled analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles,  
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the test articles or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure, and 
iv) Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
 Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately su bmit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent/assent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by the investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations.  
14.3 Pregnancy  
WOCBP (see Section 5.1.1 for definition) must have a negative UPT prior to study 
enrollment and must use a highly effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment,

Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, 2015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial 
participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject and parent/guardian must sign an informed consent/assent form documenting this discussion. 
 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately 
if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 WOCBP enrolling into the study must have a pregnancy test prior to study therapy, and monthly throughout the course of the study. The study therapy must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are known, and a negative UPT must be confirmed to continue in the trial. If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not receive test article and must not be enrolled in the study.  
 If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of la boratory pregnancy testing are 
available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not apply further test article and must be discontinued from the study.  If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to TI. The  investigator 
must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and keep careful source documentation of the event.  Protocol- required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x -ray studies).  
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by the investigator and her managing physician or health care provider (e.g. , obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to TI, on 
the appropriate TI pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as 
AEs (or SAEs, if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight  weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed 
to the test article(s) should be recorded as an SAE and details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
Blinding is important for the integrity of this clinical drug trial. However, the blind may be broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in which knowledge of the test article identity is critical to the subject’s management. Before breaking the blind for a

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  subject, the investigator s hould determine that the information is necessary (i.e., that it will 
alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the  subject is receiving active product without the need for unblinding. The 
need to break the blind should first be discussed with the responsible Medical Monitor and the best method to do this will be determined. 
16. CLINICAL SUPPLIES  
16.1 Test Article Information  
Test articles will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee. Detailed information 
on the packaging/labeling, blinding/unblinding, storage and preparation, dispensing,

17. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1 Study Endpoints  
17.1.1  Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints (Hierarchical):  
• P1: Proportion of subjects in each treatment group achievin g “success” at Week 
12, with “success” defined as an IGA score of “clear (score=0)” or “almost clear (score=1)” AND at least a two -point reduction in IGA compared to Baseline. 
• P2: Absolute change from Baseline in non- inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12. 
• P3: Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment 
group at Week 12.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  Secondary Endpoints (Hierarchical): 
• S1: Absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts (including inflammatory 
and non- inflammatory) in each treatment group at Week 12.  
• S2: Percent change from Baseline in total lesion counts (including inflammatory 
and non- inflammatory) in each treatment group at Week 12.  
• S3: Percent change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesions count in each  
treatment group at Week 12. 
• S4: Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesions count in each treatment 
group at Week 12. 
17.1.2  Safety Endpoints  
• Local and systemic AEs at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• LSRs: telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus scored by frequency and severity at every visit 
(Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• UPTs in all WOCBP at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• Material changes from Baseline in ECGs at Week 12.  
17.2 Sample Size Calculations and Power Considerations  
Assumptions used for sample size calculation were estimated from Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study (171 -7151- 201) [ 2], using a subset of subjects with 30- 75 inflammatory 
lesions and 30- 100 non- inflammatory lesions at Baseline. Sample size calculations were 
performed on the basis of the formulas for testing superiority in terms of mean differences and odds ratio of Wang and Chow. 
 
All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints have to be performed at the same significance level α=0.05 two -sided and the failure to reject a null hypothesis will imply 
the failure of rejecting all of the subsequent null hypotheses.  In order  to keep the overall Type II error β=0.1 for the whole study, the sample size for the 
three hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be calculated considering an individual Type II error β=0.033.  
 For an IGA success rate of (continuity corrected) 14.00% for CB -03-01 cream and 2.17% 
for vehicle cream (odds ratio=7), sample size was estimated to be 202 subjects per treatment group.  
 For a mean absolute change from Baseline in non- inflammatory lesion counts of -22 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -1 for vehicle cr eam (standard deviation=17), sample size was 
calculated to be 19 subjects per treatment group.

Sponsor Name: Cassiopea S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, 2015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  For a mean absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -14 for CB -
03-01 cream and -11 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=17), sample size was calculated 
to be 334 subjects per treatment group. 
 The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the same significance level α=0.05 two -sided of the primary endpoints if and only if all the null hypotheses on 
the primary endpoints are rejected.  
 For a mean absolute change from Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB -03-01 cream 
and - 13 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=17), sample size was calculated to be 13 
subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from  Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB -03-01 cream 
and - 14 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was calculated to be 77 
subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion counts of -33 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -5 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was 
calculated to be 43 subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -37 for CB -03-
01 cream and -23 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was calculated to 
be 172 subjects per treatment group.  Based on those assumptions, at least 350 subjects in each treatment group (CB -03-01 
cream, 1% BID and vehicle BID) will be included in each Phase 3 study to pr ovide 
sufficient power (90%) with the chosen primary endpoints. 
17.3 Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS
® unless otherwise stated. Summary 
tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for baseline 
variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard  deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and 
maximum). Frequency counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for categorical data. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group.  
 The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application of the test article. The ITT set will include all randomized subjects. The PP set will be a subset of the ITT set and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety  will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of 
efficacy will be conducted on both the ITT and PP sets, with the ITT set considered as the primary set for statistical analysis. Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing values for the primary  endpoints and absolute change in total lesions count (S1) in the ITT

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results 
obtained on the ITT set for the primary endpoints (change from Baseline in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and IGA “success” at Week 12). Missing 
values for the other secondary endpoints (i.e., S2- S4: percent change in lesions counts) will 
be calculated using the values obtained from the multiple imputation of the primary efficacy  endpoints and secondary efficacy endpoint #1 (S1). 
17.3.1  Efficacy Analyses 
17.3.1.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for P1 through P3.  P1: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects will be 
used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving “success” in each treatment group at Week 12, where “success” is defined as an IGA score of “clear” (score=0) or “almost clear” (score=1) AND at least a two -point improvement in IGA compared to Baseline.  
 P2: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the absolute change 
from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects an d the Baseline non- inflammatory lesion 
count as the covariate.  
 P3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline in 
inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and  the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
17.3.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for S1 through S4.  S1: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Bas eline in total lesion 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 S2: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in total lesi on 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 S3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in non-
inflammatory lesion count s in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -inflammatory lesion count as the 
covariate.

inflammatory lesion counts  in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
17.3.1.3 Imputation of Missing Data  
Missing values for the primary endpoint in the ITT analyses will be imputed by 
• Multiple imputation using missing at random assumption;  
• Missing at worst value (for the entire set); 
• Worst case;  
• Last observation carried forward; and 
• Baseline observation carried forward. 
17.3.1.4 Sensitivity Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results obtained 
on the ITT set for the primary endpoints. The first sensitivity analysis will be the Per Protocol analysis. Four additional sensitivity analyses will be performed using different methods of imputation on t he ITT set. On a per -subject basis, missing values for the 
primary endpoints will be imputed with the  
1) Worst value (for the entire set);  
2) Worst case;  
3) Last observation carried forward; and 
4) Baseline observation carried forward. 
17.3.1.5 Multicenter Studies  
Each center will conduct the clinical study under a common protocol. Consistency in study 
execution at each center will be emphasized. The study is to be conducted in such a manner as to have a minimum of eight ITT subjects enrolled in each of the treatment groups at each 
center (i.e., 16 ITT subjects enrolled overall per study center). In the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for a center, then this center’s data will be combined with another center’s data in order to achieve the desired minimum  number of subjects per 
treatment arm. The combining of data across centers will be accomplished by combining data from two or more centers based on geographical and climatic similarities until the minimum number of subjects per treatment arm is achieved. The sequence of combination will be based on the total number of subjects enrolled in each center (combining the lowest with second lowest and so on). Combining center data to achieve sufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in combined centers. T hese combined centers, as well as 
individual centers with sufficient subjects per treatment arm, will be referred to as “analysis centers” in the statistical analysis.

All the hypothesis tests for the primary endpoints ha ve to be performed at the same 
significance level α=0.05 two -sided and the failure to reject a null hypothesis will imply 
the failure of rejecting of all the subsequent null hypotheses. This approach inflates the 
overall type II error β, which in the worst case scenario is equal to the sum of the Type II 
error β connected with the individual hypothesis tests.  The hypothesis test for the secondary endpoints will be performed at the same significance level α=0.05 two -sided of the primary endpoints if and only if all the null hypotheses on 
the primary endpoints are rejected.  
17.3.1.7 Subgroup Analyses 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
17.3.2  Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure Analyses  
17.3.2.1 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance to the test article will be evaluated at each visit  and overall according to the

Non-compliance will be defined as a compliance value less than 80%.  
 Descriptive stat istics will be used to summarize test article compliance at each visit and 
overall for the ITT and PP sets. The proportion of compliant and non- compliant subjects 
will be summarized by table of frequencies at each visit and overall for the ITT and PP sets. Subjects with an overall compliance not evaluable (due to missing data) or less than 
80% will be excluded from the PP set. 
17.3.2.2 Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the ITT, PP and 
Safety sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each 
subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calc ulated 
for each subject and summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics.

17.3.3.2 Adverse Events (AEs)  
Pre-treatment AEs (PTAEs) and Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be coded using 
the MedDRA coding dictionary. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group and overall. The number and proportion of subjects with any TEAE and the number of TEAEs will be tabulated by MedDRA SOC and PT, seriousness, relationship to test article, and severity.  
17.3.3.3 Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
ECGs will be evaluated for any  material change during the study period. Results 
(normal/borderline/abnormal) of the ECG and descriptive statistics will be provided by treatment group at each visit for heart rate, RR duration, PR duration, QRS duration, QT duration including Bazett’s and Fridericia’s corrections, and P axis for the Safety set. Changes in overall interpretation (normal/abnormal/borderline) of the ECG from Baseline to Week 12 will be examined using shift tables.

The test articles will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee. CB-03-01 cream, 
1% will be packaged in blind- end epoxy lined aluminum tubes, with a polypropylene cap 
closure, containing 30 grams of test article. Each subject will be assigned a subject number 
and provided with sufficient test article in standard packaging for the designated treatment period during the trial.  
Subject Boxes and Labels  
The randomization scheme will be blocked by investigational site. The box label will, at a minimum, contain the following information: protocol number, subject identifiers (subject number), the contents, an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g., Caution: New Drug Limited by United States law to investigational use), and the appropriate storage conditions 
for the test article.  
 
Subject Kits and Labels  
Each Subject Kit label will, at a minimum, contain the following information: protocol number, subject identifiers (subject number and subject initials to be filled in), the contents, the kit number , an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g., Caution: New Drug Limited 
by United States law to investigational use), and the appropriate storage conditions for the test article. In the event of an emergency, the contents of the kit can be unblinded using the proper procedures as outlined in the protocol and by instructions provided to the site.  Kits will be dispensed at Baseline, Visit 2 (Week 4), and Visit 3 (Week 8). Subjects should not have more than one (1) kit at any time. When the kits are dispensed to subjects, the Subject Kit label should be completed entirely with the necessary information recorded in the Study Medication Accountability Log at the investigative site.  
 
Tube Labels  
Each tube will contain, at a minimum, the following informatio n: the protocol number, 
subject identifiers (subject number), the contents, the tube number (with test article batch number and retest date), an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g., Caution: New Drug Limited by United States law to investigationa l use), and the appropriate storage conditions 
for the test article.  
A 3.1 Test Article Storage and Preparation  
Test articles will be stored under secure conditions until they are dispensed to the subjects. Test articles should be stored in accordance with the temperature specified on the box, kit, and tube labels.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  A 3.2 Dispensing Test Article 
Sites will receive shipments of one or more blocks of test articles. Subjects who are eligible 
for enrollment into the study will be assigned a three digit subject number by th e study 
staff in ascending order beginning with the lowest available number. 
 
The test article must be dispensed only to study subjects and only at study sites specified on the form FDA 1572 by authorized personnel as required by applicable regulations and guidelines.  On dispensing the test article for the first time on Day 1, provide each subject with sufficient test article for the designated treatment period and record the information on the Study Medication Accountability Log. Each tube contains approx imately 30 grams of test 
article and should last for approximately two weeks.   The subject will also be instructed to bring all the tubes (used and unused) to each clinic visit. When a subject returns each used tube of test article, record the date of return, and initials of the individual accepting the return for each tube of test article on the same line of the Study Medication Accountability Log as the dispensing information.  At Visit 2 and Visit 3 (Week 4 and Week 8), visually check the tubes of test article to 
determine if the subject has applied correctly the test article and, if necessary, review the application instructions with the subject. Any discrepancies or concerns with the subject regarding the use of the diary to record test article complia nce should be addressed. 
 At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Weeks 4, 8 and 12), record the weights of all returned tubes to the nearest tenth gram (0.1 gram). At each visit, all tubes should be collected and additional tubes dispensed to the subject to ensure each subject has sufficient test article for the designated treatment period. Make every effort to obtain the return of all dispensed tubes of test article. If these efforts fail, make a detailed note of the reason for the failure in the source documents and on t he Comments page of the CRFs.  
A 3.3 Test Article Supply Records at Study Sites  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a current record of test article disposition is maintained. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines, and should include: 
• Amount received placed in storage area.  
• Amount currently in storage area. 
• Label ID number (subject kit number). 
• Dates and initials of the person responsible for each product inventory 
entry/movement. 
• Amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject identifiers.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 55 
TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Amount transferred to another area for dispensing or storage. 
• Non-study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted, broken). 
• Amount returned to Sponsor or third party (if applicable). 
• Amount destroyed at st udy site, if applicable.  
 
TI will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the staff at the study site does not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
A 3.4 Dose Modifications 
The subject should not modify the treatment regimen without consultation with the 
investigator. Subjects should be instructed to discontinue use if skin irritation or rash 
develops and to contact the study site. In the event that the investigator believes dose 
modification is necessary (e.g., problems with tolerance), the subject’s care should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to making any dose modifications. All dose modifications must be reported on the appropriate CRF .
 
A 3.5 Documentation of Application and Compliance  
The date and time of the first application of test article will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. A CRF will also be used to record any changes from the application specified in the protocol (e.g., missed applications, investigator directed reduction in application frequency, etc.). The date and time of the last application of the test article will be recorded on a CRF.  A Subject Diary will be dispensed to subjects to record the dates and times of all application doses and to record a ny missed doses of the test article ( Appendix 2). Subjects will be 
instructed to bring the diary with them to each study visit.  
A 3.6 Return and Destruction of Test Arti cle Supplies  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all test article tubes must be accounted for and any missing tubes of test article must be explained on the completed Study Medication Accountability Log. All returned tubes will be weighed to the nearest tenth gram (0.1g) in order to document extent of subject exposure. Unless instructed otherwise by the Sponsor, the study site will keep the original Study Medication Accountability Log in the study file. A copy of the Study Medication Accountability  Log will be returned to the Sponsor. All 
tubes of test article will then either be a) returned to the study Sponsor or b) emptied and provided to a sponsor -identified third party vendor for appropriate destruction, according 
to applicable regulations  with  the provision of a certificate of destruction.

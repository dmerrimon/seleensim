Name of Sponsor: 
CytoDyn, Inc. 
Name of Study Product: PRO 140 (Humanized monoclonal antibody to CCR5) 
Protocol Number: 
PRO 140 _CD02_OpenLabel Therapeutic Indication: 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) Infection 
Title of Study: 
A Multi-center, Two-Part, Single-Arm, Open Label, 25-Week Trial with PRO 140 in Treatment-Experienced 
HIV-1 Subjects. 
Study Center(s): 
Up to 40 centers in the United States 
Planned Number of Subjects: 
Up to 25 subjects (or any number of subjects that can be enrolled by the time of Biologics Licence Application 
(BLA) submission for PRO 140). 
Indication for Use: 
PRO 140, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for treatment experienced adult HIV-1 
patients infected with CCR5-tropic virus. These patients must demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite 
ongoing antiretroviral therapy and have documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one ART drug 
within three drug classes (or within two or more drug classes with limited treatment option). The options may 
be limited as a result of drug antiviral class cross-resistance, documented treatment intolerance, documented 
objective assessments such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (e.g. high creatinine at baseline, limiting treatment 
options due to potential for toxicity), past adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or neuropsychiatric 
issues that could limit use of currently approved drugs. 
Study Population: 
Study population includes treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus who 
demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic 
or phenotypic resistance to ART drugs within three drug classes ( or within two drug classes with limited 
treatment option). 
Objectives: 
The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the efficacy, clinical safety and tolerability parameters of PRO 
140 in combination with failing ART during the initial one-week treatment period, and in combination with 
Optimized Background Therapy during the subsequent 24-week treatment period.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) Infection 
 Proportion of participants with ≥ 0.5 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA viral load from baseline at the 
end of the initial 1-week treatment period 
Secondary Endpoints: 
 Proportion of participants with ≥ 1 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA viral load from baseline at the end 
of the initial 1-week treatment period 
 Mean change from Baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels (log 10 copies/mL) at the end of the initial 1-week 
treatment period 
 Percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL at week 25 
 Percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 25 
 Mean change from Baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels (log 10 copies/mL) at week 25  
 Mean change from Baseline in CD4 cell count at the end of the initial 1-week treatment period 
 Mean change from Baseline in CD4 cell count at week 25 
Safety Assessments: 
 Emergence of Dual/Mixed (D/M)- and CXCR4-tropic virus in patients who had exclusive CCR5- 
tropic virus at study entry. 
 Tolerability of repeated subcutaneous administration of PRO 140 as assessed by study participants 
(using Visual Analogue Scale) and by investigator-evaluation of injection site reactions 
 Frequency of treatment-related adverse events resulting in study drug discontinuation 
 Frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events as defined by the DAIDS Adverse Event scale 
 Frequency of treatment–emergent serious adverse events 
Trial Design: 
This is a multi-center, two part study, designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRO 140 in conjunction 
with existing ART (failing regimen) for one week and Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) for 24 weeks. 
The patient population for this trial are treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with CCR5- tropic virus 
and demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented 
genotypic or phenotypic resistance to ART drugs within three drug classes ( or within two drug classes with 
limited treatment option). 
The study is divided into four phases: Screening, Baseline,Treatment, and Follow-up 
Screening Phase (up to 6 weeks): 
This phase is designed to determine whether subjects are eligible to proceed to the Treatment Phase of the

Protocol Number: 
PRO 140 _CD02_OpenLabel Therapeutic Indication:

study. This phase consists of a series of assessments designed to determine eligibility. A written informed 
consent from the subject will be obtained by the Investigator or suitably qualified individual before the 
performance of any protocol-specific procedure. 
All subjects will continue taking their existing ART (failing regimen) during the Screening Phase, Baseline, and 
first week (Part 1) of the Treatment Phase. 
Baseline (1 week): 
Potentially eligible subjects will confirm continued eligibility one week prior to the first treatment visit. HIV 
RNA will be tested at Baseline. Subjects whose result is >400 copies/mL will be enrolled one week later. 
Subjects with results <400 copies/mL will be designated as screen failure. The Baseline Visit (T0) will take place 
within 6 weeks of the Screening Visit. 
Treatment Phase (25 weeks ± allowed windows): 
The Treatment Phase is divided into two parts: 
 Part 1: 1-week treatment period consisting of PRO 140 along with existing ART (failing regimen) 
 Part 2: 24-week treatment period consisting of PRO 140 along with OBT 
The injectable study treatment (PRO 140) will be administered starting at T1 visit and weekly there after: 
o by a qualified medical professional (MD, DO, PA, LPN, LVN, NP, RN, or CMA if permitted by state 
law ) or 
o self-administered by subjects 
Subjects will receive PRO 140 700 mg administered subcutaneously once per week. 
Note: Subjects who are currently enrolled and receiving 350 mg dose will have the option to move to the 700 
mg dose for the remainder of their participation in the trial. 
Note: Study treatment injections at T1, T2, T3, T7, T11, T15, T19 and T23 must be administered at clinic. The 
remaining study treatment injections may be self-administered by subjects outside the clinic. 
Part 1: One-week treatment period [PRO 140 + existing ART] 
Part 1 of treatment phase begins with an evaluation of results of laboratory samples collected at the Screening 
Visit. All subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures and exit the study without 
further evaluation. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria, as per data gathered from Screening Visit, will be 
enrolled and receive PRO 140 for one week (Table 0-1). A visit to confirm HIV RNA continues to meet 
eligibility will be conducted one week pior to the first treatment.

Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size Determination and Rationale: 
Up to 25 subjects (or any number of subjects that can be enrolled by the time of BLA submission for PRO 
140) will be enrolled. The sample size is based on clinical judgement with an intention to supplement the data 
for the target BLA indication. 
Analysis Populations: 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as the set of subjects who are enrolled and have received at 
least one dose of PRO 140. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to their first post-baseline assessment will be included in the 
ITT population and analyzed as non-responders in the primary analysis. 
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the ITT population requirements, 
and were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be identified before the database 
lock. 
The Safety population is defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of PRO 140. This population will 
be used for the analysis of safety parameters. 
Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis of primary and secondary endpoint will be conducted on the ITT population and PP 
population will be used for supportive analysis using the same analysis methodologies. 
All data collected from the study will be presented as a by-subject listing and also summarized according to the 
variable type as:

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 STATEMENT OF INTENT 
The design, conduct and reporting of this trial shall be conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
International Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP), and all 
appropriate regulatory requirements. Investigator(s) participating in this study will have 
documented training in GCP. Independent monitoring of the trial will be accomplished utilizing 
Amarex Clinical Research as the Contract Research Organization (CRO). 
 
1.2 THE PROBLEM STATEMENT  
Though substantial progress has been made over the past two decades in the development of 
effective and well tolerated combination antiretroviral regimens, nearly 25% of patients receiving 
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) are not virologically suppressed due to various 
reasons. Recent data suggest that most virologic failure on first-line regimens occurs because of 
either pre-existing (transmitted) drug resistance or suboptimal adherence.   Patient- and regimen-
related factors play a crucial role in determining whether an antiretroviral regimen is successful 
or result in virologic failure [Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council, 2014]. 
In general, drug resistance can be considered a core issue in patients with limited treatment options. 
However, there are other known factors apart from drug resistance (such as incomplete adherence, 
medication intolerance, pharmacokinetic issues, etc.) which also contribute to limiting treatment 
options in constructing a new regimen for patients who experience treatment failure. New agents 
and drug classes (e.g., integrase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists) are necessary 
to keep up with ongoing viral mutations in an attempt to prevent viral replication and transmission 
[Tang MW, 2012][Gulick RM, 2008][Moyle G, 2008]. The availability of an effective 
maintenance regimen would benefit a subset of HIV-1 infected persons who are challenged by 
transferred resistance, medication adherence and/or chronic nucleoside toxicity. 
PRO 140 is a promising new antiretroviral agent that does not have any cross-resistance with drugs 
from other classes. Although PRO 140 would require subcutaneous (SC) administration, its 
favorable pharmacokinetics allows for weekly dosing. The purpose of this study is to exhibit 
antiviral activity of PRO 140 in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treatment of 
antiretroviral-experienced persons infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus.

1.3 NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
PRO 140 is a humanized IgG4,  monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the C-C chemokine receptor type 
5 (CCR5), under development as a therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
PRO 140 binds to the N terminus (Nt) and the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) domain of the CCR5 
cell surface receptor that HIV-1 uses to gain entry to a cell. PRO 140 binding to CCR5 blocks viral 
entry by interfering with the final phase of viral binding to the cell surface prior to fusion of the 
viral and cell membranes. PRO 140 has been administered intravenously or subcutaneously to 
174 HIV-1 infected individuals in Phase I/II studies of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics [Jacobson JM, 2010][Jacobson JM, 2010]. The drug has been well tolerated 
following administration of single doses of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg or up to three weekly doses of up to 324 
mg. Single subcutaneous doses of 324 mg have resulted in drops in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 
approximately 1.0 log 10. Repetitive weekly administration of this dose of PRO 140 has been 
associated with drops in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of approximately 1.5 log 10. Serum 
concentrations of PRO 140 above the IC 50 for clinical isolates of HIV-1 are maintained for at least 
2 weeks following a single dose of 324 mg. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels rise to baseline levels as 
PRO 140 is cleared from the plasma and, presumably, other compartments. 
 
1.4 SUMMARY OF PRIOR PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES 
1.4.1 Pre-Clinical Studies with PRO 140 
In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have been conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic, 
immunogenicity, and toxicity profiles of PRO 140 following IV and SC administration. Several 
acute and chronic toxicity studies have been conducted to support the clinical development plan. 
Acute toxicity of PRO 140 was evaluated in New Zealand rabbits, following IV administration of 
5 or 15 mg/kg. Chronic toxicity was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys following biweekly 
administration of IV doses up to 10 mg/kg for six months and biweekly administration of various 
SC doses up to 50 mg/kg for 24 weeks. The drug was generally well tolerated. Biweekly 
administration of IV doses up to 10 mg/kg for six months resulted in minimum to mild lymphoid 
hyperplasia in assorted lymph nodes and spleen, which was considered an expected immune 
response to a foreign protein. Biweekly administration of SC doses up to 50 mg/kg for 24 weeks 
resulted in minimum injection-site reactions (minimal, multifocal, mononuclear cell infiltrates in 
the subcutis), which were considered due to an inflammatory response to the injected antigen. 
Monkeys tolerated treatment with PRO 140 for 24 weeks without evidence of local or systemic 
toxicity. PRO 140 caused no mortality, cageside observations, in-life injection-site observations, 
or gross pathologic findings. Chronic treatment with PRO 140 did not affect body weight, food 
consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry or coagulation

parameters. 
Both IV and SC administration resulted in elimination half-lives of approximately 200 hours, and 
overall exposure increased with increasing doses. Following SC administration of PRO 140 in 
monkeys, the maximal concentration (C max) was achieved within 56 hours and bioavailability for 
PRO 140 after SC dosing was approximately 70%. 
1.4.2 Clinical Studies with PRO 140 
Current human experience with PRO 140 consists of seven completed clinical trials. These studies 
are summarized in Table 1-1 . In all clinical trials, the majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild 
or moderate. No dose-limiting toxicities or patterns of drug-related toxicities were observed. 
Antiviral activity was potent, rapid, prolonged, dose-dependent, and highly significant. 
1.4.2.1 PRO 140 1101 Study 
For the first-in-human trial, PRO 140 1101, the drug was administered IV at 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, or 5.0 
mg/kg and was generally well tolerated, non-immunogenic, and without clinically relevant toxicity. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) did not increase with rising PRO 140 dose levels. 
75% of subjects reported TEAEs, most of which were deemed unrelated to study treatment. 
1.4.2.2 PRO 140 1102 Study 
In PRO 140 1102 study, the majority of AEs, other than injection-site reactions, were considered 
mild and possibly related to drug administration. The majority of injection-site reactions were 
considered mild, self-resolving, and definitely related to drug administration. PRO 140 derived 
from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and administered SC at 100 mg/mL was generally well 
tolerated in healthy, normal volunteers. Overall, PRO 140 administered SC using Autoject® 2 
appeared better tolerated than manual injection. 
1.4.2.3 PRO 140 1103 Study 
In PRO 140 1103 study, administration of PRO 140 at 350 mg using Autoject® 2 appeared well 
tolerated. Manual injections, on the other hand, were associated with a greater number of AEs. 
There did not appear, however, to be any substantial difference in subject perception of pain or 
discomfort related to site of drug administration. No anti-PRO 140 antibodies were detected in any 
subjects in this study. There was a tendency of higher exposure associated with SC administration 
of PRO 140 at 350 mg in the abdomen and the thigh. A higher number of AEs were associated 
with injections in the arm. Based on these observations, thigh and abdominal administration of 
PRO 140 were preferred over arm injection.

1.4.2.4 PRO 140 1302 Study 
This initial proof-of-concept study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
subjects with early-stage, asymptomatic HIV infection, only CCR5 HIV-1 detectable, and no 
antiretroviral therapy for 12 weeks. Subjects (n=39) were randomized to receive a single IV 
injection of placebo or PRO 140 at doses of 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg. Subjects were monitored for 
antiviral effects, safety and PRO 140 pharmacokinetics (PK) for 58 days. 
The study enrolled 31 males and 8 females. The median age, CD4+ cell count and HIV-1 RNA at 
baseline were 40.3 years, 484cells/μL and 26,900 copies/mL, respectively. The baseline 
characteristics were similar for all treatment groups. 
PRO 140 demonstrated potent, rapid, prolonged and dose-dependent antiviral activity ( Figure 
1-1 and Figure 1-2 ). A single 5mg/kg dose reduced viral loads by 1.83 log 10 on average ( Figure 1-
2). These reductions represent the largest antiviral effects reported after just one dose of any HIV-
1 drug [Jacobson JM, 2008]. In the 5 mg/kg group, mean viral load reductions of greater than 1 
log10 were sustained for 2-3 weeks post-treatment ( Figure 1-2 ).

St udy Day  
 
There was no change in CCR5 virus susceptibility to PRO 140 following treatment. All subjects 
had CCR5-only virus at screening in the first-generation Trofile assay. CCR5-only tropism results 
were observed in all subjects at all other timepoints, with two exceptions: One of nine (11%) of 
placebo subjects had dual/mixed virus at baseline and all subsequent timepoints, reflecting a 
spontaneous and stable switch in co-receptor tropism results. One of 30 (3%, 0.5 mg/kg group) 
had a dual/mixed tropism result on day 8 and CCR5-only results at all other timepoints, including 
the end of the day [Jacobson JM, 2008]. Clonal analysis of the dual/mixed virus revealed that it 
reflected outgrowth of pre-existing undetected virus rather than mutation of an CCR5 virus to a 
dual/mixed virus following treatment [Marozsan, 2008]. Therefore, no significant development of 
viral resistance to PRO 140 was observed despite potent and prolonged (2-3 weeks on average) 
viral suppression, followed by slow washout of the drug. Given that resistance to other classes of 
HIV-1 drugs can develop within one week of monotherapy [Demeter LM, 2000] [Saag, 
1993][Richman, 1994], the findings indicate that PRO 140 presents a high barrier to viral 
resistance in vivo.

(AUC∞) values were 11.1, 74.3 and 278 mg x day/L for the 0.5, 2 and 5 mg/kg groups. The mean 
serum half-life was 3.5-3.9 days in the two highest dose groups. In addition, PRO 140 significantly 
masked CCR5 on circulating lymphocytes for 2-4 weeks [Jacobson JM, 2008]. The PK and 
receptor occupancy data were broadly consistent with the duration of antiviral effects.

The figure illustrates the mean serum concentrations over time by treatment group. The error bars 
depict standard deviations. The mean serum half-lives were 3.9 days and 3.5 days in the 2 mg/kg 
and 5 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. 
Intravenous PRO 140 was generally well tolerated. No drug-related serious events or dose- limiting 
toxicity was observed. The most common adverse events (headache, lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, 
and fatigue) were observed at similar frequencies across the placebo and PRO 140 dose groups. 
There was no significant effect on QTc interval intervals or other electrocardiographic parameters, 
and there were no remarkably laboratory findings. There was no loss or depletion of CD4+ or 
CCR5+ cells from the circulation. At the 5 mg/kg dose, there was a trend towards increased CD4+ 
cell counts from baseline, with mean changes of +129, +96 and +83 cells/μL observed on days 8, 
15, and 22, respectively.

1.4.2.5 PRO 140 2301 Study 
PRO 140 2301 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
study in 30 male and female adult subjects infected with HIV-1. Subjects were randomized to one 
of three groups (N=10/group), each receiving one of three treatments: (i) a single IV dose of 5 
mg/kg by 30-minute IV infusion; (ii) a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg by 30-minute IV infusion; 
(iii) a single placebo dose by 30-minute IV infusion. The objective of the study was to assess and 
characterize the PK and PD of PRO 140 administered by IV infusion, assess efficacy at a new 
dosage level, and safety and tolerability of single doses of PRO 140. 
All PRO 140-treated subjects had more than 10-fold reduction in viral loads (mean max log 10 
reductions were 1.83 for treatment groups and 0.32 for placebo) ( Figure 1-4 ). Both the 5 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg doses have shown favorable tolerability and no dose-limiting toxicity has been 
observed. High levels of receptor occupancy (>85% reduction in the number of cells detected) 
were observed for 29 days after treatment with both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses.

asymptomatic HIV infection, only CCR5 HIV-1 detectable, and no antiretroviral therapy for 12 
weeks [Thompson, 2009]. Placebo (n=10) and three PRO 140 doses were examined: 162mg 
weekly for three weeks (n=11), 324mg weekly for three weeks (n=11), and 324mg biweekly (every 
other week) for two doses (n=12). Subjects were followed for 44 days after the final dose. The 
study enrolled 40 males and 4 females. The median age, weight, CD4+ cell count and HIV-1 RNA 
at baseline were 42.3 years, 79.1 kg, 410 cells/μL and 20,000 copies/mL, respectively. Baseline 
characteristics were similar for the different treatment groups. 
Potent, dose-dependent and highly statistically significant antiviral activity was observed ( Figure 
1-5 and Figure 1-6 ). The 324mg weekly dose resulted in a mean 1.65 log 10 reduction in viral load, 
and highly significant reductions were observed for the other dose groups as well ( Figure 1-5 ). 
There was no viral rebound between 324mg doses, and the antiviral effects persisted for one 
week after the final dose ( Figure 1-6 ). The trial established the first antiviral proof of concept for 
a long-acting, self-administrable drug for HIV-1 infection [Thompson, 2009].

Subcutaneous PRO 140 was generally well tolerated both locally and systemically. There was no 
obvious dose-related pattern of toxicity. The most common adverse events (diarrhea, headache, 
lymphadenopathy and hypertension) were mild to moderate and self-resolving. These events are 
common in HIV infection and were reported with similar frequencies in the placebo and PRO 140 
treatment groups. Administration-site reactions were mild, transient, and observed in a fraction of 
subjects. There was a trend towards increased CD4+ cell counts in subjects treated with PRO 140 
(Figure 1-7 ). Based on its encouraging antiviral and tolerability profiles and the convenience of 
weekly self-administration, SC PRO 140 has been selected for further clinical development.

in HIV-1 infected patients (with exclusive CCR5-tropic virus). Participants in this study were 
experienced HIV-infected individuals who were virologically suppressed on combination 
antiretroviral therapy. Consenting patients were shifted from combination antiretroviral regimen 
to PRO 140 monotherapy for 12 weeks. 
Forty (40) subjects (M/F: 37/3) with median age of 54.5 years (26-72) and median CD4 T-cell 
count of 604.5 cells/mm3 (365-1240) were enrolled in the CD01 study. Overall, twenty-two out 
of 40 (55%) enrolled subjects completed 12 weeks of PRO140 monotherapy without experiencing 
virologic failure. Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels of ≥ 400 
copies/mL separated by at least 3 days. Of the 40 enrolled subjects, 3 subjects were found to have 
Dual/Mixed (D/M) tropism [1 at baseline and 2 at the time of virologic failure] and 37 subjects 
were found to have exclusive CCR5-tropic virus. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of CCR5-exclusive 
subjects compared to zero percent (0%) of D/M subjects experienced virologic success within 12 
weeks of PRO140 monotherapy (p=0.0465). All virologic failure subjects who had available lab 
data in both studies achieved viral suppression to < 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, as well as viral 
suppression to ‘Non Detectable’ or < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after re-initiation of ART. 
The by-subject analysis of PhenoSense® Entry Assay data for PRO140, maraviroc, and AMD3100 
shows no significant changes in the post-treatment IC50 and IC90 values were noted when 
compared with baseline values in virologic failure and non-virologic failure groups of subjects. As 
the aggregate analysis shows, the subjects who experienced virologic failure had higher IC90 value 
for PR0140 at baseline compared to subjects without virologic failure. The mean IC90 for subjects 
who experienced virologic failure was higher (10.84 µg/mL) than the IC90 for subjects without 
virologic failure (6.70 µg/mL) in the CD01 study (p=0.0115). 
Anti-PRO140 antibodies were not identified in any post-treatment sample and data derived from 
the CD01 study further supports the favorable PRO140 PK profile data generated from both pre- 
clinical as well as prior Phase 1/2 clinical trials. 
Safety data were analyzed for all 40 enrolled subjects. One (1) of 40 subjects experienced an SAE 
that was deemed not related to the study drug by the Principal Investigator. Twenty-eight 
(28) of 40 subjects (70%) experienced one or more adverse events (AEs) after receiving at least 
one dose of PRO140. The most commonly occurring AEs were infections and infestation 
conditions which were reported by 14 of 40 (35%) subjects. The majority of the reported AEs 
(63/89; 70.7%) were deemed either unlikely or not related to study treatment by the Investigator. 
Similarly, the majority of the reported AEs (72/89; 80.8%) were deemed mild in nature. 
Additionally, a letter of amendment has been filed to increase the planned number of subjects from 
40 to 43 subjects to compensate for the 3 Dual/Mixed subjects (1 at baseline and 2 at the

1.4.2.8 PRO 140_CD01-Extension Study 
PRO 140_CD01-Extension study (open-label, 28 subjects, multi-center) seeks to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 monotherapy (350 mg subcutaneous injection weekly 
for up to 108 weeks) for the continued maintenance of viral suppression following substitution of 
antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients (with exclusive CCR5-tropic virus). Participants in this study 
were HIV-infected individuals who were virologically suppressed on combination antiretroviral 
therapy and completed the first 12 weeks of CD01 study without experiencing virologic failure. 
As with the CD01 study, virologic failure was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels of ≥ 
400 copies/mL separated by at least 3 days. Consenting patients may remain on PRO 140 
monotherapy for up to 108 weeks. 
A total of 16 subjects participated in the CD01-Extension study of which one subject was 
considered not eligible as subject experienced virologic failure prior to first extension treatment. 
Fifteen (15) eligible subjects (M/F: 13/2) with median age of 55.3 years (26-68) and median CD4 
T-cell count of 586 cells/mm3 (365-1059) were enrolled in an extension study. Eleven (11) 
subjects are currently receiving weekly 350 mg PRO140 SC monotherapy and have completed 
more than one year of treatment (56 - 67 wks). One subject with undetectable viral load did not 
continue beyond 47 weeks due to relocation, and 3 subjects experienced virologic failure after a 
median time of 169 days (106-193). 
PRO140 was generally well tolerated, and no drug-related SAEs were observed. 
This clinical study is currently ongoing. 
1.4.2.9 PRO 140_CD02 Study 
PRO 140_CD02 study (double blind, placebo controlled, 50 subjects, multi-center) seeks to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 in combination with existing ART 
(failing regimen) for one week and Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) for 24 weeks in 
patients infected with HIV-1. The study population includes 50 treatment-experienced HIV- 
infected adult patients with CCR5-tropic virus who demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication 
despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented history of genotypic or phenotypic 
resistance to at least one ART drug within two drug classes. 
In double-blind treatment period, virally non-suppressed subjects will be randomized and treated 
with either PRO 140 or Placebo in combination with the failing ART regimen for 7 days. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is proportion of participants with ≥ 0.5 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA 
viral load from baseline at the end of the 7 day functional monotherapy period.

1.5 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION 
The dose of 350 mg administered SC was chosen in light of a previous analysis suggesting that 
such a dose would be likely to provide maximal viral load suppression. 
In studies with antiviral agents that block viral entry through the CCR5 receptor, there is a general 
consensus that in order to achieve robust antiviral effects and minimize the potential for drug 
resistance in combination therapy, the dose of drug should result in exposures that fall on the 
plateau of a Maximum Drug Effect (Emax) plot. 
Figure 1-8:   Emax analysis of antiviral data generated with IV and SC PRO 140. 
 
The maximal viral load reduction was analyzed with regard to drug exposure for PRO 140. Figure 
1-8 above shows this relationship. Analysis shows that PR0 140 350mg weekly dose is expected 
to fall on the plateau of the Emax plot. 
The maximal change in HIV-1 viral load from baseline was determined at any point 59 days after 
initiation of therapy. To allow approximate comparisons between the IV and SC doses, the overall 
AUC observed for repeat SC doses was conservatively estimated by multiplying the measured 
AUC0-7d by the number of doses administered. Viral load and AUC data were fit to an Emax 
equation: E = Emax x AUC/(AUC + AUC50). The orange diamond indicates projected data for 
three weekly 350 mg doses based on the mean exposure observed in the PRO 140 1103 study.

It is important to note that when larger proteins (MW> 10,000) are administered SC, they initially 
traffic through the lymphatic system. Uptake into the bloodstream occurs after the proteins reach 
the thoracic duct [Nishikawa M, 2005]. 
In addition, based on pharmacodynamic data from our prior SC and IV studies, maximum virologic 
suppression is expected to be achieved with trough concentrations that equal or exceed 
approximately 5 µg/mL. 
Finally, the mean nadir reduction in viral load achieved with 3 weekly 324 mg SC doses (1.65 
log10) was similar to the mean nadir reductions observed with single 5 or 10 mg/kg IV doses (1.8 
log10 in each case), and higher viral load reductions are expected in the present study based on the 
use of the 350 mg CHO formulation. Overall, several lines of evidence indicate that maximum 
virologic suppression will be achieved with 350 mg weekly dosing in the present study. 
Majority of subjects receiving 350 mg weekly SC dosing in monotherapy setting experienced virologic 
failure in CD01-Extension study. Review of PRO 140 clinical data to date with 350mg SC weekly 
dosing, suggests no evidence of emergence of viral isolates with reduced susceptibility to PRO 140, 
no altered viral tropism or anti-PRO 140 antibodies formation suggesting the most likely cause of viral 
rebound is inadequate dosing to fully cover CCR5 receptor populations. Based on pharmacologic 
modeling studies, we anticipate that the 700mg dose will result in a lower fraction of study participants 
with trough levels below that which will ‘uncoat’ a significant number of CD4 cells (i.e., less than a 
certain multiple of the IC50 or IC90 for PRO 140). 
 
1.6 RISKS / BENEFITS ASSESSMENT 
 
1.6.1 RISKS/DISCOMFORT TO SUBJECTS AND PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE RISK 
1.6.1.1 Risks associated with continuation of Failing Antiretroviral Treatment Regimen 
As per standard of care, patients who failing on their ART remain on failing regimen while waiting 
for the results of HIV-1 drug resistance tests. A new drug regimen is constructed by the 
Investigator based on the subject’s resistance test results and treatment history. This duration 
corresponds with the screening phase of the study. 
Once the results of resistance and tropism tests are available, the study treatment (PRO 140 700mg 
SC injection) will be added to the failing regimen for one week. After one week all subjects will 
receive PRO 140 SC injection and Optimized Background Therapy (OBT). 
Addition of study treatment (PRO 140 700mg SC injection) to the failing regimen may not be 
effective in achieving a reduction in viral load for all subjects. Such cases could lead to an

increased risk of developing drug resistance, opportunistic infections and clinical progression of 
the disease. 
1.6.1.2 Allergic Reaction 
PRO 140 belongs to the monoclonal antibody class of drugs. Monoclonal antibodies are sometimes 
associated with allergic reactions (fatigue, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, headache, nausea, pain at the 
site of injection, low blood pressure, rash, itching, and chills) or flu-like reactions such as fever, 
chills, and aches. These events are usually of short duration if they occur at all. Severe allergic 
reactions, however, can be life-threatening. Although anaphylaxis has not been observed in prior 
trials of PRO 140, infusion of proteins always carries with it the theoretical risk for anaphylactic 
shock. Accordingly, whenever PRO 140 is initially administered to subjects, there should be 
available and in place the procedures required to manage anaphylactic shock. 
1.6.1.3 Immune Response 
Subjects who take PRO 140 or other monoclonal antibodies can also develop an immune response 
to PRO 140 that may affect their ability to receive monoclonal antibodies, or to benefit from 
diagnosis or therapy with a monoclonal antibody in the future. 
1.6.1.4 Pregnancy 
Risks to unborn babies are unknown at this time; pregnant females will be excluded from this 
study. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment. 
Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree to use 
appropriate birth control methods throughout the study duration (excluding women who are not of 
childbearing potential and men who have been sterilized). 
1.6.1.5 Venipuncture 
Blood sampling is required as part of the study protocol. Blood sampling carries a minimal risk 
of minor discomfort and the possibility of minor bruising at the site of the needle puncture and, 
rarely, the possibility of infection at the needle puncture site. 
1.6.1.6 Risks to the Study Personnel and the Environment 
The principal risk in the clinical setting is in the handling of needles that may be contaminated 
with HIV, or other human pathogens. Adherence to universal precautions for working with 
infectious agents will reduce the risk of exposure to these individuals. All bio-hazardous waste 
will be disposed of as stipulated by local, state, and federal regulations and in accordance with 
study site Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 
1.6.1.7 Unknown Risks 
Protocol # PRO 140_CD02_OpenLabel  
Version 3.0 
Date: 11-Mar-2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 112   
  
As with all research there is the remote possibility of risks that are unknown or that cannot be 
foreseen based on current information. 
1.6.1.8 Theoretical risk for increased severity of West Nile virus infection 
Individuals who lack a functional CCR5 gene are at increased risk for severe infection by West 
Nile virus [Thompson, 2009] Because of this, treatment with CCR5 co-receptor antagonists poses 
a theoretical risk for increased severity of West Nile virus infection. However, this concern is 
mitigated by several factors. First, no increased risk was observed for individuals who possess one 
functional and one non-functional CCR5 gene, indicating that an intermediate amount of CCR5 is 
sufficient for defense against West Nile virus [Thompson, 2009]. Second, use of CCR5 co-receptor 
antagonists is unlikely to completely abrogate CCR5 function, and there has been no association 
reported to date between CCR5 co-receptor use and severe West Nile virus. Additionally, PRO 
140 weakly antagonizes the natural activity of CCR5 and thus is less likely to adversely affect 
immune function. Furthermore, this has not been established to be a risk with maraviroc, the anti-
CCR5 drug already FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV. 
Collectively, the experience with both IV and SC, simulation modeling and the recent confirmation 
that a higher concentration of PRO 140 synthesized using a highly efficient CHO cell line can be 
conveniently and safely administered has resulted in the design of the current study. 
 
1.6.2 INTENDED BENEFIT FOR SUBJECTS 
This study provides an opportunity for subjects to have supervised once weekly SC treatment with 
PRO 140 in addition to an optimized and simplified ART regimen. Subjects participating in the 
present short term combination therapy study for 25 weeks will contribute to the development of 
a drug which has the potential to become a treatment option for them and others in the future.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy, clinical safety and tolerability parameters of PRO 
140 in reducing HIV-1 viral load in patients on their current ART (failing regimen) during the 1- 
week treatment period, and in combination with Optimized Background Therapy during the 
subsequent 24-week treatment period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is proportion of participants with ≥ 0.5 log10 reduction in HIV-1 
RNA viral load from baseline at the end of the initial 1-week treatment period. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be proportion of participants with ≥ 1 log10 reduction in 
HIV-1 RNA viral load from baseline at the end of the initial 1-week treatment period, mean change 
from Baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels (log10 copies/mL) at the end of the initial 1-week treatment 
period, percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL at week 25, percentage 
of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 25, mean change from Baseline in 
HIV-1 RNA levels (log10 copies/mL) at week 25, mean change from Baseline in CD4 cell count 
at the end of 1-week treatment period, and mean change from Baseline in CD4 cell count at week 
25. 
Safety assessments include evaluation of emergence of Dual/Mixed (D/M)- and CXCR4-tropic 
virus in patients who had exclusive CCR5-tropic virus at study entry, tolerability of repeated 
subcutaneous administration of PRO 140 as assessed by study participants (using Visual Analogue 
Scale) and by investigator–evaluation of injection site reactions, frequency of treatment-related 
adverse events resulting in study drug discontinuation, frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
and frequency of treatment-emergent serious adverse events.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi-center, two part study, designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
PRO 140 in conjunction with existing ART (failing regimen) for one week and Optimized 
Background Therapy (OBT) for 24 weeks respectively. The patient population for this trial are 
treatment-experienced patients with CCR5-tropic virus and demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 
replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic or phenotypic 
resistance to ART drugs within three classes, or two drug classes with limited treatment options. 
The study is divided into four phases: Screening, Baseline,Treatment, and Follow-up. 
Screening Phase begins with signing of Informed Consent and lasts up to 6 weeks. Subject will 
enter the Treatment Phase as soon as HIV-1 viral tropism, genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance 
results are available for review by Investigator. 
The Baseline visit is to confirm HIV RNA continues to meet eligibility and will be conducted 
one week pior to the first treatment. 
The Treatment phase is divided into two parts: 
 Part 1: One-week treatment period consisting of PRO 140 along with existing ART (failed 
regimen). 
 Part 2: 24-week treatment period consisting of PRO 140 along with Optimized 
Background Therapy (OBT) 
All subjects will continue taking their existing ART (failed regimen) during the Screening Phase 
and first week of the Treatment Phase (Part 1). After Treatment Phase Part 1, all subjects will enter 
the 24-week treatment period (Part 2).   During this period, all subjects will receive PRO 140 SC 
injection and OBT. 
Study participants will be regularly monitored for viral load following initiation of PRO 140, and 
will cease weekly study treatment injections should they experience treatment failure. 
Subjects who experience treatment failure at any point during Treatment Phase Part 2 will undergo 
the Treatment Failure (TF) Visit assessments and will be followed up every 4 weeks until viral 
suppression is achieved (i.e., plasma HIV-1 RNA levels below level of detection) or up to a 
maximum of 6 months after cessation of therapy if the treating physician does not feel that there 
is an antiretroviral regimen that will regain full viral suppression. Subjects who do not experience 
treatment failure, will be followed up every 2 weeks for total of 4 weeks. 
Note: Subjects who are currently enrolled and receiving 350 mg dose will have the option to move 
to the 700 mg dose for the remainder of their participation in the trial.

(1) Screening Phase: This phase lasts up to 6 weeks, consists of Screening Visit (SV) and 
begins with signing of Informed Consent. Assessments performed during this phase 
determine the subject’s final eligibility for study participation. First treatment will be 
administered within 42 days of Screening Visit.  
All subjects will continue taking their existing ART (failed regimen) during the Screening 
Phase and first week of the Treatment Phase (Part 1). 
(2) Baseline: The Baseline (T0) visit will take place within 6 weeks of the Screening Visit, 
as soon as HIV-1 viral tropism, genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance results are available 
for review by Investigator.   HIV RNA and TruCount Assay will be performed to ensure 
continued eligibility prior to the first Treatment Visit (T1).  
(3) Treatment Phase: Subjects will receive up to 25 treatments, given approximately every 
week (window period of ±3 days) or until treatment failure is experienced, whichever 
comes first. 
The first Treatment Visit (T1) will take place within one week of the T0 visit.

professional (MD, DO, PA, LPN, LVN, NP,RN, or CMA if permitted by state law) or self-
administered by subjects. 
Note: Study treatment injections at T1, T2, T3, T7, T11, T15, T19 and T23 must be 
administered at clinic. The remaining study treatment injections may be self- administered 
by subjects outside the clinic. 
Any time during Treatment Period Part 2, if treatment failure occurs, Investigator will 
readjust antiretroviral regimen based on HIV-1 genotypic and/or phenotypic drug 
resistance results obtained during the TF visit. 
Subjects will be allowed to continue PRO 140 with existing OBT regimen while waiting 
for new regimen to be constructed by the Investigator. 
Treatment failure is defined in terms of virologic non-response and virologic rebound in 
Part 2 of the Treatment Phase of the study: 
a) Virologic non-response is defined as two consecutive viral load results of: 
 <0.5 log 10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA at Day 7 of Treatment Period Part  
2. [Assessment Timepoint:T3 visit] 
 <1 log 10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA at or after Week 4 of Treatment Period 
Part 2 unless HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL. [Assessment Timepoint: from T6 up to 
T25 visit] 
 Confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥400 copies/mL at Week 25 of the Treatment 
Period [Assessment Timepoint: T25 visit] 
b) Virologic rebound is defined as two consecutive viral load results of: 
≥1.0 log 10 copies/mL increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA above nadir level* in 
Treatment Period Part 2 [Assessment Timepoint: from T3 up to T25 visit] or 
*Note: This refers to “Nadir” level in the Treatment Phase which starts from T2 
visit 
 ≥400 copies/mL after suppression to <50 copies/mL in Treatment Period Part 2. 
[Assessment Timepoint: from T3 up to T25 visit] 
(4) Follow-Up Phase: The duration of follow-up depends on whether or not subject has 
experienced treatment failure during Treatment Period Part 2. 
 Subjects who experience treatment failure within Treatment Period Part 2 will be 
followed up every 4 weeks until viral suppression is achieved (i.e., plasma HIV-1 RNA 
levels below level of detection) or up to a maximum of 6 months after cessation of 
therapy if the treating physician does not feel that there is an antiretroviral regimen that 
will regain full viral suppression.

4.1 SCREENING PHASE 
4.1.1 Pre-Screening 
Sites are encouraged to pre-screen subjects for study inclusion, evaluating HIV-1 RNA prior to 
performing a full screening visit. 
 
The subject will sign and date the pre-screening informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study- 
related pre-screening procedures. A unique identification number (pre-screening number) will be 
assigned to each subject who has provided written pre-screening informed consent. The pre- 
screening number will incorporate a three-digit Study Center number (PS201, PS202, PS203….) 
and a two-digit numeric ID assigned in successive order of consenting to pre-screening procedures 
after signing the pre-screening ICF at each center, beginning with 001 at each site (e.g. PS201-01 
or PS202-01). 
 
Once the pre-screening ICF has been signed, the following procedures and information will be 
obtained to confirm pre- eligibility including: 
• Review of prior medical records for ART history and resistance to ART drugs 
• Blood sample collection for HIV-1 RNA and TruCount assay 
 
A pre-screening log will be maintained to capture the following information: 
• Pre-screening number 
• Patient initials 
• Date pre-screened 
• Initial eligibility 
• Date of re-consent (for the full consent form) or reason for ineligibility 
 
4.1.2 Screening Visits 
The subject (or Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR)) will sign and date the informed consent 
form (ICF) and Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization (according 
to site policy and practices) prior to any study-related procedures. A unique identification number 
(screening number) will be assigned to each subject who has provided written informed consent. 
The subject screening number will incorporate a three-digit Study Center number (001, 002 or 
003….) and a three-digit numeric ID assigned in successive order of entering the study after signing 
the ICF at each center, beginning with 001 at each site (e.g. 001- 001 or 002-001).

All study centers will be instructed to maintain the study-specific pre-screening, screening and 
enrollment logs at their sites. If a subject initially fails to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and is 
later reconsidered for participation, the subject will be re-consented and assigned a new screening 
number at the time of re-screening. Subjects who fail their first screening attempt may be re- 
screened a maximum of once and may be enrolled if they are found to meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria when re-screened. 
Once the ICF has been signed, screening procedures and information will be obtained to confirm 
subject eligibility including: 
 Detailed medical history (see section 7.4 ), 
 Detailed history of HIV infection and treatment (see section 7.5 ), 
 Demographic information (see section 7.3 ), 
 Prior and current medications review (see section 7.6 ), 
 Physical examination (see section 7.7 ), 
 Electrocardiogram (ECG) (see section 7.8 ), 
 Body Weight & Height measurements (see section 7.10 ) 
 Vital Signs (see section 7.10 ), 
 Collection of Blood Specimens (see section 7.11 ) for 
o Complete Blood Count 
o Biochemistry 
o Coagulation Indices [Prothrombin time (PT) and INR]

o Blood sample collection for Exploratory/Confirmatory analysis 
 Collection of Urine Specimen for Urinalysis (see section 7.11.13 ) 
 
All screening information will be fully documented in the subject’s medical records (i.e., source 
documents). 
 For consented subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria, a Screen Failure electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF) will be completed. The Screen Failure eCRF will contain the following 
details: the subject identification number, the date of ICF signature, demographic 
information (see section 7.3 ), and the reason for screen failure. No additional information 
will be required for subjects who fail screening. 
 For consented subjects who meet eligibility criteria, all required screening information will 
be transcribed onto the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
Eligible subjects that are not enrolled within 42 days of Screening Visit will have screening lab 
assessments repeated, with the exception of HIV-1 viral tropism, genotypic and/or phenotypic 
resistance, to reconfirm eligibility. 
 
4.2 BASELINE 
The Baseline (T0) visit will be performed for subjects who have met all eligibility criteria within 
6 weeks of the Screening Visit, as soon as HIV-1 viral tropism, genotypic and/or phenotypic 
resistance results are available for review by Investigator. HIV RNA and TruCount Assay will be 
performed to ensure continued eligibility prior to the first Treatment Visit (T1). Subjects who have 
an HIV RNA result >400 copies/mL will be enrolled at the T1 visit. Subjects who have an HIV 
RNA result <400 copies/mL will be designated as screen failure. 
The following assessments will be performed at the T0 visit: 
 Change in concomitant medications (see section 7.5 ) 
 Collection of Blood Specimens (see section 7.11 ) for 
o Plasma HIV-1 RNA level 
o TruCount T Assay 
 
4.3 TREATMENT PHASE 
Treatment Phase begins with an evaluation of results of laboratory samples collected during the 
Screening Phase. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria, as per data gathered from Screening 
Phase are to be treated. All subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria will be considered screen 
failure and exit the study without further evaluation.

Treatment Failure (TF) Visit assessments and is followed up until viral suppression is 
achieved or up to a maximum of 6 months after experiencing treatment failure if the 
treating physician does not feel that there is an antiretroviral regimen that will regain full 
viral suppression will be considered as having completed the study. 
 
5.2 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL 
 
A subject who enters the Treatment Phase but does not complete the study, as defined in Section 
5.1, is considered to have prematurely withdrawn from the Study. 
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatment without prejudice to future 
care. It will be documented whether or not each subject completed the clinical study. If for any 
subject, study treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason(s) will be recorded. 
The Investigator can discontinue a subject at any time if it is considered medically necessary. 
In addition, subjects WILL be withdrawn from the study, in consultation with the Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator, if any of the following are met: 
 A subject is significantly non-compliant with the requirements of the protocol. 
 The investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the subject. 
 Subject chooses to withdraw or is withdrawn due to an adverse event 
 A subject becomes pregnant 
Note: The pregnancy will be followed to term for safety follow-up. Relevant safety information 
collected after the study has completed will be reported as supplemental information. 
 Discontinuation of study by Sponsor 
Premature withdrawal from the study MAY occur if, in consultation with the Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator, any of the following are met: 
 A subject is treated with a prohibited medication.

5.2.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
Discontinuation of study treatment (PRO 140) and continuation of HAART as per standard of 
care is recommended if: 
 Subject experiences treatment failure 
Defined in terms of virologic non-response and virologic rebound in the Open-Label 
Treatment Phase (Part 2) of the study: 
(1) Virologic non-response is defined as two consecutive viral load results of: 
 <0.5 log 10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA at Day 7 of Treatment Phase Part 2. 
[Assessment Timepoint:T3 visit] 
 <1 log 10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA at or after Week 4 of Treatment Phase 
Part 2 unless HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL. [Assessment Timepoint: from T6 up to 
T25 visit] 
 Confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥400 copies/mL at Week 24 of Treatment 
Phase Part 2. [Assessment Timepoint: T25 visit] 
(2) Virologic rebound is defined as two consecutive viral load results of: 
 ≥1.0 log 10 copies/mL increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA above nadir level * in Treatment 
Phase Part 2 [Assessment Timepoint: from T3 up to T25 visit] or 
*Note: This refers to “Nadir” level in Treatment Phase Part 2 which starts from T2 visit 
 ≥400 copies/mL after suppression to <50 copies/mL in Treatment Phase Part 2. 
[Assessment Timepoint: from T3 up to T25 visit] 
 
Note: Subjects will be allowed to continue PRO 140 with existing OBT regimen while 
waiting for new regimen to be constructed by the Investigator. 
 
 Develops AIDS-defining conditions as specified in Appendix I ( Section 16.1 ) under which 
subject is unable to continue treatment with study drug (PRO 140), or subject require treatment 
with prohibited concomitant medications. 
 Shows signs or symptoms of clinically significant immunosuppression 
 Subject or the subject’s clinician wishes to adjust OBT (except in the event of toxicity 
management). 
 Subject becomes pregnant.

5.2.2 Data Collected for Withdrawn Subjects 
Patients may withdraw from the study or discontinue study treatment at any time; however, 
CytoDyn is dedicated to minimizing missing data in this study. It is therefore suggested that all 
patients, regardless of whether they continue to receive study treatment, continue within the 
study. 
Investigators considering discontinuing study treatment should contact the medical monitor prior 
to such discontinuation. Patients who have study treatment discontinued will continue to be 
followed, per protocol, whenever possible. Patients who have study treatment discontinued due 
to a serious adverse event will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study at any time due to an adverse event or serious 
adverse event (SAE), the procedures stated in Section 9.1.1 or 9.3, respectively must be followed. 
Every attempt should be made to collect follow-up information. The reason for withdrawal from 
the study will be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
Before a subject is identified as lost-to-follow up, the site should make all reasonable efforts to 
contact the subject. These attempts must be documented and should include at a minimum one 
phone call and one certified letter. 
 
5.3 SCREEN FAILURES 
A subject who has signed a consent form, has been assigned a screening number, but is not treated 
is classified as a screen failure. Subject number, demographics and reason for screen failure will be 
recorded.

The pharmacy manual provides the criteria regarding vial acceptance or rejection, as well as 
instructions for the preparation of the IP syringes to be used to administer drug. 
 
6.3 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT STORAGE 
Study drug will be shipped at 2°C to 8°C (refrigerated [36°F to 46°F]) to the investigator’s site. 
Upon receipt at the site, the responsible site staff or pharmacist should verify the integrity of the 
vials. Study drug should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (refrigerated [36°F to 46°F]). The contents of the 
vial should appear as a clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow solution; fine translucent particles 
may be present. This is normal. 
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment, storage, and dispensing of the 
study drug in a drug accountability log. An accurate record including the date and amount of 
study drug dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any time. A study CRA 
assigned to monitor the investigational site will review these documents once study drug has been 
received by the investigational site. Study drug will be accounted for on an ongoing basis during 
the study. 
 
6.4 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION 
Guidelines for dose preparation can be found in the pharmacy manual. 
PRO 140 will be provided to the administering personnel in single-use syringes prepared from vials 
of study drug stored at 2-8°C at the site pharmacy prior to use. Each of two syringes is filled to 
deliver 1.0 mL of study drug. 
Equivalent volumes of study drug will be administered subcutaneously on opposite sides of the 
abdomen. 
A 25-guage needle should be used to remove IP from vial and for administration to subjects. 
IP should be administered slowly over 15 seconds per mL. IP should not be kept in syringe for 
longer than 60 minutes. 
Note: Patients with low body fat percentages may find subcutaneous injections uncomfortable. In 
such cases, PRO 140 700 mg can be injected as four 175mg/ml injections of 1 mL each and/or can 
be placed at different areas other than abdomen as per discretion of the Investigator. 
Following each SC delivery of drug, careful examination will be made to assess the appearance of 
any study drug Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) as described in Section 16.3.  
All doses of study drug will be prepared by either the credentialed pharmacist or qualified medical 
professional and will be administered as SC injection by a qualified medical professional

(MD, DO, PA, LPN, LVN, NP, RN, or CMA if permitted by state law) or self-administered by 
subjects depending on the study visit week. 
Note: It is preferred that the same injection site be used throughout the study. At the same time, it 
is not recommended to inject the study drug into areas where skin shows signs of a previous 
injection site reaction. It is advised to change the injection site if any previous injection site reaction 
remains unresolved. 
 
6.5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT RECEIPT AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
Study drug must be used in accordance with this protocol and only under the direction of the 
responsible investigator. The investigational site must maintain complete and accurate records 
showing receipt and disposition of all study drug, including master records listing the date of 
receipt, the number and nature of medication units received, and a dispensing record which includes 
each quantity dispensed, identification of the staff member/subject to whom dispensed, the date of 
dispensing, the intended study participant, and the identification of the preparer. All used and 
unused study kits will be retained by the investigational site until drug accountability can be 
confirmed by study CRA during the monitoring visits. Instructions will be provided by Sponsor 
regarding final disposition of all study drug in compliance with applicable regulations. 
 
6.6 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT DISPOSITION 
All drug supplies are to be used only for this protocol and not for any other purpose. The investigator 
must not destroy any drug labels or any partially used or unused drug supply until instructed by the 
Sponsor. At the conclusion of the study and as appropriate during the course of the study, the 
investigator will return all used and unused drug containers and drug labels to the drug distributor 
as directed by the Sponsor. A copy of the completed drug disposition form will be sent to CytoDyn, 
Inc. or to its designee.

7 DESCRIPTION OF PROTOCOL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
 
7.1 INFORMED CONSENT 
Written informed consent will be obtained for this study by the Investigator or designee from all 
subjects before the performance of any protocol-specific procedure. This study will be conducted 
in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator must comply with applicable 
regulatory requirements and must adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The Investigator, or 
designee, must fully inform subjects of all pertinent aspects of the study. Before informed consent 
may be obtained, the Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, must provide the 
subject ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or 
not to participate in the trial. All questions about the trial must be answered to the satisfaction of 
the subject. Prior to the subject’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent must be 
signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. Authorization for release of protected health information must also be obtained, as per 
local policies. 
 
7.2 ASSESSMENT OF ELIGIBILITY 
During the Screening Phase and at T1 Visit (prior to treatment administration), the Investigator 
must assess a subject’s continued suitability and eligibility for the trial. The Inclusion and Exclusion 
criteria of this Protocol are described in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2. If the subject is not suitable or 
eligible for the trial then the subject will be a screen failure.

7.12 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION 
Refer to Section 6.4 for details. 
 
7.13 INJECTION SITE REACTION ASSESSMENT 
At each treatment visit that occurs at the clinical site, an injection site reaction assessment will be 
made for the current and previous injection sites. Injection site reaction assessments are recorded 
by the Investigator (or designee) starting after the first injection is given. Refer to sections 9.1.8 
and 16.3 for more details. 
 
7.14 PAIN ASSESSMENT USING VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) 
Tolerability of repeated subcutaneous administration of PRO 140 is evaluated based on assessment 
of subject-perceived injection site pain using the Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). This assessment 
will be performed each time subjects arrive to the clinic for the study visit. 
Beginning at Treatment Visit 2, subjects will be asked to mark the point that best represents the 
average pain intensity over the past week at the injection site on a horizontal line (100 mm in 
length) anchored by the following word descriptors at each end, “no pain" on the left side and "pain 
as bad as it could possibly be" on the right side of the line. The subject marks on the line or by 
pointing to a position on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their

9 ADVERSE EVENTS (DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING) 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when there is a safety 
evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
 
9.1 ADVERSE EVENT 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that 
occurs or is reported by the subject to have occurred, or a worsening of a pre-existing condition. 
An AE may or may not be related to the study treatment. 
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormalities in visit 
evaluations, physical examination findings or laboratory results that the Investigator believes are 
clinically significant to the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study 
treatment will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant (NCS) 
should not be recorded as an AE. 
9.1.1 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Report initiation for all AEs and SAEs will begin at the time of the first treatment visit and continue 
up until the final study visit (i.e. up to NTF-FU2 for subject who do not experience virologic failure 
or until viral suppression is achieved for subjects who experience virologic failure). All events will 
be followed to resolution or until 30 days after the subject completes the study. A final assessment 
of outcome will be made at that time. 
All AEs must be recorded in the subject’s medical records and on the eCRFs. AEs will be reported 
using customary medical terminology along with the following information: the onset and end 
dates, whether the event is considered to be a SAE (see Section 9.2 ), the impact the event had on 
study treatment (see Section 9.1.2 ), the DAIDS AE grade (intensity) of the event (see Section 
9.1.3), the causality of the event (see Section 9.1.4 ), whether treatment was given as a result of the 
event (see Section 9.1.5 ), and the outcome of the event (see Section 9.1.6 ). 
9.1.2 Impact of Study Treatment 
The impact the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, study treatment 
interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. The “not applicable” assessment will 
be used only when the subject is no longer in the treatment phase of the protocol, or if the outcome 
of the event was “death”. 
9.1.3 DAIDS AE Grade (Severity) Assessment 
Protocol # PRO 140_CD02_OpenLabel  
Version 3.0 
Date: 11-Mar-2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 92 of 112  
  
The investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of each subject and the response to treatment 
in order to judge the true nature and severity of the AE. The question of the relationship of AEs to 
study drug should be determined by the investigator after thorough consideration of all available 
facts. To assess severity, the investigator will use the DAIDS AE grading table (for adverse events 
as well as any injection site reactions refer to Section 16.2 and Section 16.3 ). 
The general guidelines for assessing the AE grade appear below. Full guidelines may be obtained 
at http://rsc.tech- 
res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/DAIDS_AE_Grading_Table_v2_NOV2014 . 
 
Table 9-1: DAIDS AE Grading Table v2 General Guidelines 
 
Grade Description 
Grade 1 indicates a mild event 
Grade 2 indicates a moderate event 
Grade 3 indicates a severe event 
Grade 4 indicates a potentially life-threatening event 
Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
DAIDS AE Grading Table Version 2.0- November 2014 
 
9.1.4 Causality Assessment 
Adverse events will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study treatment. The Principal 
Investigator (PI) must review each AE and make the determination of relationship of the event to 
the study treatment. Relationship of AEs to study treatment will be classified as follows: 
1. Definitely related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to the study treatment. An AE may be assigned an attribution of 
definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment; (2) it could not be reasonably 
explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject; (3) it follows a known 
response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
2. Probably related: This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be 
related to the study treatment. An AE may be considered probable if or when (must have 
three): (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the subject. (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a 
Protocol # PRO 140_CD02_OpenLabel  
Version 3.0 
Date: 11-Mar-2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93 of 112  
  
known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment. 
3. Possibly related : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged unlikely but cannot be ruled out 
with certainty to the study treatment. An AE may be considered possible if or when (must 
have two): (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the subject. (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment. 
4. Remotely related : In general this category can be considered applicable to those AEs 
which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged likely 
to be unrelated to the study treatment. An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must 
have two): (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the subject. (3) Disappears 
or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow a known 
response pattern to treatment with the study treatment. 
5. Unrelated : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.) and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
treatment. 
9.1.5 Treatment Given as a Result of the Event 
The event impact in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, 
non-medication therapy administered, surgery, or other (with a specification). 
9.1.6 Outcome Assessment 
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or 
death. Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are 
multiple causes of death for a given subject, only the primary cause of death will have an outcome 
of death. 
9.1.7 Expected / Anticipated Adverse Events 
The most common potential study drug-related adverse reaction reported is mild headache. Other 
adverse events likely to be related to the drug include mild to moderate diarrhea, nausea, and 
fatigue.

Version 3.0 
Date: 11-Mar-2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 112  
  
9.1.8 SC Injection-related Events 
SC and IV injections of concentrated protein materials can be associated with injection-related AEs 
that impact the ability to safely and successfully deliver the drug. Local injection-site reactions may 
include pain/discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules/cysts, pruritus, ecchymosis, etc. For SC 
injections, bleeding, absorption of the drug, leakage of drug, and induration at the local injection 
site can be additional complications. Other AEs that are common to monoclonal antibody-based 
therapies are chills, headache, backache, malaise, fever, pruritus, rash, nausea, tingling, and 
hypertension. 
SC injection-related events will be monitored according to the guidelines provided in Section 16.2 
(Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events [DAIDS 
AE Grading Table]). Injection-site reactions thought to be directly related to the injection are 
considered to be AEs of special interest, and a separate guideline for the acquisition of data 
related to this AE of special interest is provided in Section 16.3 . 
For subjects who develop grade 1 or grade 2 events, continue therapy as per protocol. If a subject 
chooses to discontinue study treatment, the site should notify the protocol team leadership, and 
encourage the subject to complete any remaining study visits until the toxicity resolves. 
For subjects who develop grade 3 events following study drug injection, the subject should be 
reevaluated closely until the AE returns to Grade ≤2, at which time study treatment may be 
reintroduced at the discretion of the site investigator. If the same Grade 3 AE recurs following the 
next administration of study drug, study treatment must be permanently discontinued. Subjects 
experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of study treatment should be 
followed closely for resolution of the AE to Grade ≤ 2 and the team leadership must be notified. 
Subjects with Grade 3 asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities in cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK) 
or triglycerides may continue study treatment. 
For grade 4 events permanently discontinue therapy. 
 
9.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) 
A SAE is defined as any AE that: 
 Results in death 
 
 Is life threatening (the subject is at immediate risk of dying from the AE) 
 
 Requires subject hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization 
 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Protocol # PRO 140_CD02_OpenLabel  
Version 3.0 
Date: 11-Mar-2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 of 112  
  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
If a pregnancy occurs in a subject or partner of a male subject during a clinical study this must also 
be reported to CytoDyn, Inc. The Investigator should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor. 
Any pregnant subject must be followed up by the Investigator or designee until the child is born. 
Any AEs of the subject during pregnancy, that meets serious criteria, must be documented and 
reported CytoDyn, Inc. Participants who become pregnant will be entered into the Antiretroviral 
Pregnancy Registry ( http://www.apregistry.com ). 
 
9.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator is required to report all SAEs that occur during the time period specified in Section 
9.1.1. Once the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE, he/she must report the SAE to Amarex 
Safety Department within 24 hours: 
 
CRO Medical Monitor Attn: Shide Badri, MD 
Amarex LLC 
20201 Century Boulevard, Suite 450 
Germantown, MD 20874 
Email: saereporting@amarexcro.com 
Phone: +1 (240) 454-6844 
Fax: +1 (240) 454-6602 
The Amarex Medical Monitor may request additional supporting documentation as it becomes 
available, such as lab reports, ECG reports, discharge summary, hospital notes, etc. 
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for 
maintaining documentation in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified. Under 
21 CFR 312.32(c), the sponsor is required to notify FDA and all participating investigators in an 
IND safety report (i.e., 7- or 15-day expedited report) of potentially serious risks from clinical trials 
or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor receives 
the safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting. Participating 
investigators include all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under any of its INDs 
or under any investigator’s IND (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).

9.3.1   SAE Follow-Up 
All subjects experiencing an SAE, including the discontinued subjects, must be closely followed 
until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further 
improvement expected, or death). 
For each SAE indicated as an unresolved event on the initial report, regardless of whether the 
subject completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow-up report with updated 
information.

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
11.1 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS 
In an effort to fulfill the obligations outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312 and 
ICH guidelines which requires the Sponsor to maintain current personal knowledge of the progress 
of a study, the Sponsor's designated monitor will visit the center(s) during the study as well as 
maintain frequent telephone and written communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor 
to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to 
ensure that data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence 
is satisfactory. 
The Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or designated CRO to inspect all 
eCRFs and corresponding study subject original medical records (source documents) at regular 
intervals throughout the study. Subject original medical records and other relevant data must be 
available to support all data recorded in the eCRF. In addition to the original medical records, these 
data may include but are not limited to, study, laboratory and diagnostic reports, neurological 
examination results, etc. 
Site inspections serve to verify strict adherence to the protocol and the accuracy of the data being 
entered on the case report forms, in accordance with federal regulations. A Monitoring Log will be 
maintained at each study site which the monitor will sign, date and state the type of visit. 
The Investigator should be aware that the study site and subject records may be inspected by the 
Sponsor and or representatives of the designated CRO, FDA or other regional regulatory authority. 
For the IA, a cut-off date for data collection and monitoring will be determined and sites will be 
requested to provide current information up to the cut-off date. 
11.2 ACCEPTABILITY OF CASE REPORT FORMS (CRFS) 
Electronic CRFs must be completed for each subject who has signed an informed consent form. For 
subjects who are screen failures, this would be limited to the screen failure eCRF page. All source 
documents and eCRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the subject's visit. Corrections to 
data on the eCRFs will be documented. The Investigator will review eCRFs to indicate that, to 
his/her knowledge, they are complete and accurate. Electronic CRFs will be reviewed by the 
Sponsor’s or designated CRO’s monitor, who will make a decision as to their acceptability.

11.3 MODIFICATION OF PROTOCOL 
The Investigator will not modify or alter this protocol without first obtaining the concurrence of the 
Sponsor. Approval by the Investigator’s IRB must also be obtained prior to implementation of the 
change, with two exceptions: 
1. When necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to the subject; or 
2. When the modification does not involve the subject’s participation in the trial. 
An amendment may also require modification of the informed consent form. The Investigator will 
provide an approval letter for the amendment and revised informed consent form, if applicable, to 
the Sponsor. An amendment must be in writing and it must be dated by both the Sponsor and the 
Investigator. If necessary, the Sponsor will submit protocol amendments to FDA and other 
appropriate regulatory authorities and notify other Investigators using this protocol. 
 
11.4 REPORTING PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The Investigator is obligated to follow the protocol without departure from the requirements written 
in the protocol. If the Investigator deviates from the protocol requirements, the Sponsor will make 
the determination as to whether the subject will continue in the study. The Sponsor also has the right 
to discontinue the subject for protocol violations. The IRB may also have to be contacted if safety 
to the subject or if the scientific soundness of the study is involved. All protocol deviations 
must be documented in the eCRFs.

standards will be documented. 
 
12.3 SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS 
Written and oral information about the study in a language understandable by the subject will be 
given to all subjects by the Investigator and/or designee. Written informed consent will be obtained 
from each subject before any procedures or assessments that would not otherwise be required for 
the care of the subject are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, 
and insurance arrangements in force are explained and the subject has been given sufficient time to 
ask questions and consider participation in the study. It will also be explained to the subjects that 
they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice to future treatment. It is permissible for a third person (e.g., a family member) to be 
present during the explanation of the study. 
The written Informed Consent Form ICF is to be in compliance with CFR 21 Part 50.27 and GCP 
guidelines. The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will approve the ICF and all amendments to the 
ICF prior to submission to the IRB/IEC. A copy of the ICF to be used will be submitted by the 
Investigator to the IRB/IEC for review and approval prior to the start of the study. Each study site 
must provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of IRB/IEC-approved ICF along with applicable 
documentation to support this approval. The original signed ICF is retained in the subject's study

13 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
 
13.1 RECORDING AND COLLECTION OF DATA 
The primary source document for this study will be the subject's medical record. If separate research 
records are maintained by the Investigator(s), the medical record and the research records will be 
considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study. 
Applicable source data will be manually transcribed to the approved eCRFs. The Investigator is 
ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data transcribed on the forms. All source documents 
and eCRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the subject's visit. 
The Investigator will review eCRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete and 
accurate. Designated source documents will be signed and dated by the appropriate study personnel. 
The Investigator must agree to complete and maintain source documents and eCRFs for each 
subject participating in the study. 
All research data will be entered, either electronically or manually, into a computerized database. 
The clinical database will be designed by the clinical data manager in accordance with 21 CFR Part 
11 and based on protocol requirements defined by the Sponsor in association with the Lead 
Investigator. 
The Investigator will maintain a confidential list of study subjects that will include each subject’s 
study number, name, date of birth, and unique hospital identification number if applicable. This list 
will be kept by the Investigator and will not be collected by the Sponsor. A notation will be made 
in the subject’s case history/medical chart that he/she is participating in a clinical study and has 
provided a signed and dated ICF as well as a release for protected health information as required 
by local policies. The Investigator must also maintain a separate screening log of all the subjects 
screened for participation in the study; it should include gender, age, eligibility status, reason for 
ineligibility, if applicable; and study allocated subject number, if applicable. 
 
13.2 CLINICAL DATA MANAGEMENT 
The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will be responsible for the processing and quality control (QC) 
of the data. Data management will be carried out as described in the Sponsor’s or CRO’s standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. 
The handling of data, including data QC, will comply with regulatory guidelines (e.g., ICH E6 
GCP, and local regulations where applicable) and the Sponsor’s or the CRO’s SOPs as well as 
provisions of the study-specific Data Management Plan.

with ICH GCP E6 and the Sponsor’s quality standards and SOPs. 
The Investigator will maintain all research records, reports, and case history reports for a period 
of two years after regulatory approval of the investigational product. If no application is filed or if 
the application is not approved, records must be maintained for two years after all investigations 
have been completed, terminated or discontinued and the FDA has been notified. 
These documents should be retained for a longer period however, if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or if needed by Sponsor or its authorized representative (as per GCP 
5.5.11). 
At the completion of the study, details of the archival process must be provided to the Sponsor. 
Study records are subject to inspection by applicable health and regulatory agencies at any time. 
Records to be retained by the Investigator include, but are not restricted to: 
 Source data and the primary records upon which they are based (e.g., subject’s progress 
notes, adverse event data, test results, and any other diagnostic procedures required to 
evaluate the progress of the study) 
 Completed CRFs 
 Signed protocols and protocol amendments 
 Laboratory results, ranges, and certifications 
 Product (e.g., IP supplies) and accountability records 
 Study personnel signature log 
 Monitoring logs 
 Correspondence to and from the Sponsor, designee and IRB 
 Investigator and sub-investigator CVs 
 Signed informed consent and protected health information consent forms 
 Subject screening and enrollment log

16.4 APPENDIX V: NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 
 
Three Question Screening Survey (Simioni, et al, 2010) 
1. ‘Do you experience frequent memory loss (e.g. do you forget the occurrence of special 
events even the more recent ones, appointments, etc.)’? 
2. ‘Do you feel that you are slower when reasoning, planning activities, or solving problems’? 
3. ‘Do you have difficulties paying attention (e.g. to a conversation, a book, or a movie)’? 
 
 
For each question, subjects should provide one of the following answers: ‘never’, ‘hardly ever’, or 
‘yes, definitely’. 
If subject answers “yes, definitely” to any question, Investigator may use additional neurological 
assessment modalities at its discretion.

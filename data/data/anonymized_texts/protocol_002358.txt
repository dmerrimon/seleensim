Masculinization Surgery in Transgender Men  
Principal Investigator  Chandler Cortina, MD, MS  
Study Sites  Froedtert Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin  
Study Population  Non-cisgender adu lts seeking chest masculinization surgery (top 
surgery).  
Primary Objectives  1. To determine the prevalence of TGNB persons undergoing 
chest masculinization surgery who have an elevated lifetime 
risk of breast cancer development and prevalenc e of those who 
undergo genetic counseling.  
2. To determine whether those TGNB persons at  elevated risk of 
breas t cancer development choose to undergo risk -reducing 
mastectomies as part of their chest masculinization surgery .

with calculated risk . 
Primary Endpoints  1. The percentage of all participants undergoing chest 
masculinization surgery who are at elevated lifetime risk of BC development (i.e., >17% ) and those who undergo genetic 
counseling. Lifetime BC risk will be estimated utilizing the Gail and IBIS models.
 
2. The percentage of those participants  with moderate to high 
lifetime BC risk or pathogenic germline variant that  say they 
would choose to undergo a risk -reducing mastectom y. 
3. The accuracy of self -perceived BC risk, as measured by the 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS),  and the personalized BC risk 
assessment taken after the VAS.  
Main Eligibility Criteria  • ≥18 years old.  
• Assigned female or intersex at birth and identify as non-
cisgender.  
• Considering undergoing gender -affirming chest masculinization 
surgery . 
• Ability to communicate in English.  
• Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it.  
Study Design  Prospective, single- arm interventional pilot study designed to test 
whether a breast cancer risk assessment, genetic  testing (when

a During Visit 1, the study team will be available to answer any additional questions the potential participant may have about the study and confirm whether they were consented. If not done so already and as an 
option, a potential participant will have the opportunity to sign the informed consent form in person.  
b Only those study participants with a family history suggestive of a pathogenic variant and/ or with an 
elevated breast cancer risk who meet genetic  testing guidelines  (Appendix 2 )1, 2 will be referred to the 
Cancer Genetics Clinic to undergo a formal genetic counseling session and possible germline genetic 
testing.  Genetic testing will be performed via the Ambry Genetics® Panel per institutional standards.  See 
Section 6.3  for additional details.  
c Only those study participants with an estimated lifetime breast cancer risk >17% (defined by the Gail 
model  [https://ibis.ikonopedia.com] and/or  IBIS model  [https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3647/gail -model -
breast -cancer -risk])  or with a pathogenic germline mutation known to increase breast cancer risk will be 
offered to meet with the PI  to discuss the utility of considering risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their 
chest masculinization surgery . If a subject is referred to the Cancer Genetics Clinic, Visit 2 is to occur 
after their Cancer Genetics Clinic  visit. 
d Participants with  an estimated lifetime breast cancer risk >17% may  be followed- up once within 60 days 
after the end of the funding period to determine if they either (i) underwent their chest masculinization 
surgery with or without the risk -reducing mastectomies , (ii) scheduled but did not undergo their chest 
masculinization surgery with or without the risk -reducing mastectomies , or (iii) say they would choose   to 
schedule/undergo risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their chest masculinization surgery. Regarding 
(i) and (ii), follow -up data will only be collected from participants that had their  procedure(s) performed by 
a MCW Plastic Surgery team member (study Co- Is) and, in certain instances, the study PI.

BC Risk Assessment  10 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 1.0 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Breast Cancer in Transgender and Nonbinary Persons 
The population of transgender and nonbinary persons (TGNB) in Wisconsin and the United States 
(US) is steadily increasing and as this population grows, the number of individuals seeking 
gender -affirming therapies, including gender -affirming operations and gender -affirming hormone 
therapy, is also increasing.3-5 In calendar year 2021 alone, the Froedtert & Medical College of 
Wisconsin Inclusion Health Clinic cared for >700 TGNB persons, and this patient population has 
been steadily increasing since the clinic opened in 2018. An exam ple of gender -affirming surgery 
is chest masculinization surgery, colloquially called top surgery, in which the majority of breast 
tissue is removed in a person with a female sex assigned at birth to allow the chest to appear 
masculine.6 While chest masculinization surgery removes most glandular breast tissue, some 
breast tissue is often left behind 
to allow for appropriate 
cosmetic contouring of the 
chest ( Figure 1) and is not 
considered synonymous to an 
oncologic risk -reducing 
mastectomy.6, 7 An oncologic 
risk-reducing mastectomy 
seeks to remove all breast 
tissue in an effort to minimize 
the future risk of breast cancer (BC) development in persons with an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer.
8-10 Additionally, there 
is an increasing number of reported cases of TG men developing BC after chest masculinization surgery, secondary to the lack of data to support routine personalized BC risk assessment prior 
to chest masculinization surgery or for BC screening after chest masculinization surgery.
7, 11- 14 
Although gender -affirming therapies are associated with improved mental health outcomes and 
well-being for TGNB persons,15 the potential long- term effects of these therapies on overall health, 
including future breast cancer risk, are  not well  understood.16-18 
BC is the most common non- skin cancer in cisgender women. The current average  lifetime risk 
for cisgender women is approx imately 13% for a person who lives to be age  85 years in the United 
States.19, 20 A person’s lifetime risk of BC development may be dramatically impacted by a family 
history of BC, increased breast density, a personal  history of atypical hyperplasia, lobular 
carcinoma in situ, high- dose radiation to the chest  before age 30, or inherited genetic mutations 
in BC susceptibility genes.21-29 Two well- validated models have been developed to estimate an 
individual’s personalized percent  lifetime BC risk: the Gail Model30-36 and the Tyrer -Cuzick BC 
Risk Evaluation Tool (also called IBIS)  that incorporate personal history ( e.g., first age at 
menarche, history of breast biopsies) and family breast and ovarian cancer history to calculate future breast cancer risk compared to the average cisgender woman.
37-43 Both models provide a 
percent estimate of a person’s lifetime risk compared to the average women (ex: 35% lifetime risk 
for a person compared to 12.5% for average risk peer).  Cisgender women with a moderate lifetime 
BC risk (17% -30%)44 can be offered BC screening at an younger age (prior to age 40 years),  
enhanced BC screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or risk -reducing medications 
such as tamoxifen or raloxifene.45-49 Those with a high lifetime BC risk,  defined as >30%,44 can 
be offered the previous options and may also consider risk-reducing mastectomies , a procedure 
reserved for this group given its potential risks and complications.1, 9, 50 -52 High and moderate 
penetrant  pathogenic variants (BRCA1/2, PTEN, CDH1, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, etc.) are known 
to elevate BC risk.2, 53- 57 Pathogenic variants (mutations) may be foun d through exploratory  

BC Risk Assessment  11 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 processes, such as commercially available kits like 23andMe®, or through formal  evaluation by a 
healthcare provider based on personal or family history. Risk -reducing mastectomies are  
generally offered to persons with a known pathogenic variant or a lifetime BC risk >30%.8, 58, 59 
While the ability to reduce BC incidence in these populations with risk-reducing  mastectomies is 
well documented, there is insufficient data to determine if the  operation provides a clear mortality 
benefit, with the exception of persons with a BRCA1 mutation.8, 9, 50, 58, 59 
Self-perceived BC risk has the potential to influence risk -modifying behaviors such as alcohol and 
smoking use, uptake of cancer screening recommendations, and has been demonstrated to 
influence the decision for risk -reducing mastectomies in cisgender women with an elevated 
lifetime BC risk.60-62 There is no contemporary data on perceived BC risk prior to chest 
masculinization surgery in TGNB persons, which may potentially influence an individual’s decision 
to undergo chest masculinization surgery ± risk-reducing mastectomies.  Given that an increa sing 
number of TGNB persons are undergoing gender -affirming chest masculinization surgery and 
that no data exists on the operation’s ability to reduce the incidence of BC, a clear opportunity 
exists to perform routine personalized BC risk assessment ( ± genetic testing) prior to chest 
masculinization surgery to identify those persons with a high lifetime BC risk who may benefit 
from undergoing oncologic risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest 
masculinization surgery.63 Currently, these individuals do not undergo personalized BC risk 
assessment prior to chest masculinization surgery. Additionally, there is a need to examine both 
the accuracy of self -perceived BC risk in TGNB persons and how it may influence gender -
affirming surgical decision making. Understanding BC ris k in TGNB persons is a critical step in 
mitigating cancer disparities in this underserved population in Wisconsin and across the United 
States and to ensure patients are informed of this risk prior to undergoing chest masculinization 
surgery.  
The Froedtert  & MCW  Inclusion Health Clinic  opened in July 2018  and is located on the 
Milwaukee Regional Medical Center  grounds  within the Sargeant Health Center. The clinic is 
focused on providing health care for LGBTQ + individuals. S ervices include primary and 
preventive care,  obstetrics and gynecology,  HIV prevention, gender -affirming care , and 
psychiatric care. The clinics are the only ones of its kind in Wisconsin and in the 2020- 2021 fiscal 
year, cared for >1,600 individual patients, of which >600 identify as tran sgender. The unique 
relation with the Inclusion Health Clinic, the Southeastern Wisconsin LGBTQ+ community, and a  
skilled Plastic Surgery team allow for a unique opportunity to conduct this investigation.  
1.2 Rationale  
The goals of this pilot study  are to 1) determine the percent of TGNB persons undergoing chest 
masculinization surgery who have an elevated lifetime risk of BC development (>17%) or  a 
pathogenic genetic mutation that increased the risk of BC development (BRCA1/2, ATM, etc .), 2) 
measur e the percent who are at risk and say they would choose to undergo risk -reducing 
mastectomies as part of chest masculinization surgery, and 3) assess and compare self -
perceived BC risk with calculated risk. The results of this study will substantially inform TGNB 
patients and surgeons on the utility of personalized BC risk assessment prior to chest 
masculinization surgery and the accuracy of self -perceived BC risk in TGNB persons. This project  
has the potential to set a new standard of care that all TGNB pe rsons should undergo a 
personalized BC risk assessment prior to gender -affirming surgery.  
BC Risk Assessment  12 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
This prospective, single- arm interventional pilot study is designed to test whether a breast cancer 
risk assessment, genetic testing (when applicable), and surgical oncologist consultation can 
inform those TGNB patients at elevated risk for breast cancer (BC) development to undergo risk -
reducing mastectom ies in tandem with their gender -affirming chest masculinization surgery. This 
study  is expected to collect and analyze novel data that describes the prevalence of elevated BC 
risk in the TGNB population and the concordance between self -perceived BC risk and calculated 
risk, a pressing need for which little is known.  
2.1 Primary Objectives 
1. To determine the prevalence of TGNB persons undergoing chest masculinization 
surgery who have an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer development and prevalence of those who undergo genetic counseling.  
2. To determine whether those TGNB persons at  elevated risk of breas t cancer 
development choose to undergo risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their chest 
masculinization surgery . 
3. To assess and compare the self -perceived breast cancer risk with calculated risk.  
2.2 Primary Endpoint s 
1. The percentage of all participants  undergoing chest masculinization surgery who are at 
elevated lifetime risk of BC development ( i.e., >17% ) and those who undergo genetic 
counseling. Lifetime BC risk will be estimated utilizing the Gail and IBIS models.  
2. The percentage of those participants  with moderate to high lifetime BC risk or 
pathogenic germline variant that say they would choose to undergo a risk -reducing 
mastectom y. 
3. The accuracy of self -perceived BC risk, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), 
and the personalized BC risk assessment taken after the VAS.

choice, standard practice, and will be collected as part of study data.  
6.2 Visit 1: Breast Cancer Risk Assessment , Risk Categorization, and Initial 
Counseling  
Participants will be scheduled within 60 days of initial screening and consent to undergo a 
personalized BC risk assessment utilizing the Gail and IBIS tools, which are both validated and widely used asses sment s.
37-43 During Visit 1 , participants will identify their self -perceived lifetime 
BC ris k on the Visual Analog Scale ( Appendix 1 ) as part of the initial study intake , which will also 
acquire identifiable patient data (name, date of birth , and medical record number)  and 
demographic information (race, ethnicity, age, sex assigned at birth, gender, etc; see Section 6.5 
for a comprehensive list of data factors to be collected). The PI and Anna Purdy, APNP will enter

For participants <35  years old, in which Gail is not validated, only the IBIS lifetime BC risk will be 
used, and a mean lifetime risk will not  be calculated.  
Participants with an average lifetime BC risk, defined as ≤17%,44 will be recommended to 
continue their gender -affirming operation as planned and will not be scheduled for a second visit.   
Those with a moderate  lifetime BC risk, defined as 17 -30%, will be counseled on their elevated 
risk and the option to consider risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest 
masculinization operation. This option will be provided for moderate- risk persons, given the 
unclear long- term BC risk reduction from chest masculinization surgery alone. Moderate risk 
individuals will also be counseled on standard risk -reducing strategies, including lifestyle 
modifications, risk -reducing endocrine therapy options, and increased breast cancer screening 
strategies.  
Participants with a high lifetime  BC risk, defined as >30%, will b e counseled on the potential 
benefit of undergoing risk -reducing mastectomies as part of their gender -affirming chest 
masculinization operation, an also be counseled on standard risk- reducing strategies , including 
lifestyle modifications, risk -reducing endocrine therapy options, and increased breast cancer 
screening strategies . 
Those participants with an elevated lifetime risk based on family history, or with an unknown family 
history (per NCCN guidelines) will be offered to meet with a Genetic counselor to  consider genetic 
study  (see Section 6.3 ). 
Those with a moderate or high risk and/or family history suggestive of pathogenic variant who decline further genetic testing or a 2
nd visit with Dr. Cortina will be given the opportunity to express 
why they declined.  
6.3 Breast Cancer Genetic Testing  
Study participants with a family history suggestive of a pathogenic variant and/or with an elevated 
BC risk who meet NCCN genetic testing guidelines  (Appendix 2 )1, 2 will be referred to the Cancer 
Genetics  Clinic to undergo a formal genetic counseling session and possible germline genetic 
testing. Genetic testing will be performed  via the Ambry Genetic s® Panel, which is our current 
institution standard.  
Persons who undergo genetic testing and are found to have a pathogenic variant for BC will be offered to see the PI, Chandler Cortina, MD, to discuss the utility of risk -reducing mastectomies 
as part of their chest masculinization operation (see Visit 2). Persons who are found to have a 
pathogenic variant that infers any other risk besides BC will be referred to the appropriate care teams for further evaluation, as is the current standard practice in our Genetics clinic.  
BC Risk Assessment  16 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 6.4 Visit 2: Surgical  Risk -Reducing Mastectomy Counseling  
Participants considering risk -reducing mastectomies will meet directly with Dr. Cortina  who can 
perform the operation in tandem with the patient’s respective plastic surgeon. Patients who 
decline risk -reducing mastectomy as part of their surgery will be given the opportunity to express 
why they declined.  This procedure is  consistent with the  current clinical workflow for cisgender 
patients.  If patients undergo risk -reducing mastectomy as part of their chest masculinization 
surgery, pathological tissue examination is standard and findings will be collected during the study 
period.

7.0 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL , END OF STUDY, AND STUDY 
DISCONTINUATION  
7.1 Subject Withdrawal  
7.1.1  Patient -Initiated Withdrawal  
A participant may decide to withdraw from the study at any time.  
7.1.2  Investigator -Initiated Withdrawal  
The investigator may withdraw a participant  whenever continued participation is no longer in their 
best interests. Reasons for withdrawing a participant  include, but are not limited to, a subject’s 
request to end participation, a subject’s noncompliance, or simply significant uncertainty on the 
part of the investigator that continued participation is prudent.  
7.1.3  Replacement Policy and Data Usage  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are enrolled, but subsequently withdraw, will be replaced. Data collected from subjects that withdraw or discontinue from the study will not be 
used.   
BC Risk Assessment  18 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 7.2 End of Study Definition  
A subject  is considered to have completed the study if they have  completed all phases of the 
study including the last scheduled procedure  shown in the  Study Calendar  or has been 
discontinued. 
7.3 Stud y Discontinuation and Closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause (as determined by the MCW study principal investigator , DSMC, sponsor, 
and/or IRB) . Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will 
be provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, investigator, funding 
agency, and regulatory authorities . If the study is prematurely te rminated or suspended, the MCW 
principal i nvestigator (PI) will promptly inform the MCW Institutional Review Board (IRB)  and 
sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will 
be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes . 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS: DEF INITIONS, COLLECTION, AND 
REPORTING  
This study is  considered to be  of minimal risk to participants due to its design and the nature of 
the intervention being tested ( i.e., risk assessment, genetic testing, and patient education). As 
described in Section 11.5.1 , participants may experience anxiety or distress upon hearing the 
results of their personalized BC risk assessment and/or their genetic tests. 
Subjects will not undergo an investigational medical intervention for the purposes of this study. While the participants’ decision to have risk -reducing mastectomies performed in tandem with 
their gender -affirming chest masculinization procedure will be assessed, t he risk -reducing 
mastectomy procedure itself or its outcomes does not fall under this study protocol. For these 
reasons, adverse and ser ious adverse events are not expected, but will be defined, collected, and 
reported as described in this section if encountered.  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation  subject administered an 
interventional product  and which does not  necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0, located on the CTEP web site:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other diagnostic procedures . 
BC Risk Assessment  19 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death.  Results in death.  
• Life- threatening . Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the participant  was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).  
• Hospitalization . Requires inpatient hospitalization ≥24 hours or prolongation of an 
existing hospitalization.  
• Disability/incapacity. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions).  
• Pregnancy 
• Medically important  event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant , require 
medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  
8.1.3  Attribution of an Adverse Event  
An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the medical intervention, using 
the following categories:  
• Definitely Related: The AE is clearly related to the intervention.  There is clear evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship, and othe r possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  
• Probably Related:  The AE is likely related to the intervention. There is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.  
• Possibly Related: The AE may be related to the intervention. There is some evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
• Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention. A clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to drug administration 
makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
BC Risk Assessment  20 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 • Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention.  The AE is completely 
independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is 
definitely related to another etiology.  
8.1.4  Expectedness of an Adverse Event  
Study Investigator or treating physician will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected as indicated in the protocol, informed consent form and/or drug 
information brochure. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is NOT consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention.  
8.2 Collection and Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse and serious adverse events are not expected, but if such events occur, they will be reported per IRB guidelines. Any events reported to the IRB will be reported to the DSMC following the same manner (routine or expedited).  
For routine reporting, the events will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual continuing progress report, and the DSMC will review events entered into OnCore
™ at the time of scheduled 
monitoring.  
For expedited DSMC reporting, the study coordinator/research nurse must notify the DSMC via 
email. For AEs, include the subject ID, date of event, grade, relatedness, expectedness, and a 
short narrative. For SAEs, DSMC will review the SAE report entered into the secure Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used for the study.  
8.3 Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subject or Other (UPIRSO)  
Unanticipated problems will be submitted to IRB of record and the DSMC, according to local 
policies and procedures. An unanticipated problem is one that is unexpected, possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to the research described in the paragraph above, and suggests the research places research participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was 
previously known or recognized.  
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator is responsible for reporting 
unanticipated problems to any regulatory agency and to the IRB. The study investigators and 
coordinators follow participants per the schedule of events outlined in the Study Calendar
 to 
ensure protocol compliance, participant safety, and quality care. Any unanticipated problems 
detected will be promptly documented by the study coordinator and submitted to the IRB and 
DSMC within 5 calendar days of study staff’s knowledge. These reviews would pick up any 
unanticipated negative trends among participants.  
8.4 Subject Complaints  
If a complaint is received by anyone on the study staff, it will be discussed with the study staff and will be addressed on a case- by-case basis. The PI will be notified of any complaints. Complaints 
will be reported to the IRB if indicated.  
BC Risk Assessment  21 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 If the subject has questions about his or her rights as a study subject, wants to report any 
problems or complaints, obtain information about the study or offer input, the subject can call the 
Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital research subject advocate at 414 -955-8844. 
This information is provided to the subject in their consent. 
9.0 STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size  Determination  and Accrual Estimates  
This is a  pilot patient outcome study  with a sample size  of N=35, which would result in a 10% 
margin of error and a 90% exact confidence interval for a true population proportion of TG men 
with increased risk of breast cancer (assuming that 4 out of 35 participants will be found to have 
an elevated BC risk). In the future, enrolling 125 TG individuals would allow investigators to obtain 
a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error of 5%.  
The sample size is also in line with reaching our accrual goal within a one- year period, as it 
represents one third of the patient population currently seen by our plastic surgeons . 
9.2 Analysis Plan  
9.2.1  Analysis Population  
Data from all participants will be used for endpoint analyses.  Data from subjects who withdraw or 
discontinue will be not used.  
9.2.2  Endpoint Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant characteristics and study outcomes 
for the above study aims. Median and range will be used for summarizing continuous variables; 
counts and percentages will be used for categorical variables.  
To assess and compare the self -perceived breast cancer risk with calculated risk  for third primary 
endpoint , self-perceived risk will be compared to mean BC calculated risk using the Wilcoxon 
related sample test . Chi-squared tests will be used to assess patient factors associated with under 
and overestimating self -perceived risk.  
9.3 Missing Data  
No major missing data relevant to the primary endpoints are anticipated. Unforeseen missing 
data, if any, will be addressed in consultation with the study statistician. 
10.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)  
10.1 Data and Safety Management Overview  
The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and the 
MCW Institutional Review Board (IRB) will approve protocol -specific DSM plans. A local, 
investigator -initiated trial will be required to be continuously monitored by the principal investigator 
of the study with biannual safety and progress reports submitted to the DSMC.  
The DSMP for this study will involve the following entities:  
BC Risk Assessment  22 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 10.2 Study Team  
The study team minimally consists of 1) the principal investigator, Dr. Chandler Cortina, 2) a nurse 
practitioner, Anna Purdy , APNP, who is a co- investigator on the study, and 3) the study 
biostatistician. While subjects are on treatment, the principal investigator will meet periodically 
with the rest of the study team to review the study status. This review will include but not be limited 
to reportable SAEs and UPIRSOs and an update of the ongoing study summary that describes study progress in terms of the study schema. The appropriateness of further subject enrollment 
and the specific intervention for a next subject enrollment is addressed. All meetings including 
attendance should be documented. 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
The MCWCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO) provides ongoing quality assurance audits.  
This study has been categorized as low risk by the MCW Cancer Center (MCWCC) Scientific 
Review Committee (SRC) and will be reviewed internally by the MCWCC CTO Quality Assurance 
Staff according to the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
 and the current version of the 
MCWCC CTO SOP, 6.5.2 Internal Quality Assurance Reviews . 
10.4 DSMC 
The Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center places the highest priority on ensuring the safety of subjects participating in clinical trials. Every cancer interventional trial conducted at MCW includes a plan for safety and data monitoring. 
More information can be found related to the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan at the 
MCWCC website ( Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
). 
This study will be reviewed by the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (MCWCC DSMC). A summary of the MCWCC DSMC activities are as follows:  
• Review the clinical trial for data integrity and safety.   
• Review all DSM reports.  
• Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct.  
• Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for the subject.  
A copy of the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and membership roster will be maintained 
in the study research file and updated as membership changes. The committee will review reports 
from the study principal investigator twice annually (or more frequently if needed) and provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension or termination as necessary.   
Any available DSMC letters will be submitted to the IRB of record as required. 
BC Risk Assessment  23 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 11.0 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, ETHICS, AND STUDY  
MANAGEMENT 
11.1 Ethical Standard  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Decla ration of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4) , consistent with GCP and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
11.2 Regulatory Compliance 
This study will be conducted in compliance with:  
• The protocol . 
• Federal regulations, as applicable, including 21 CFR § 50 (Protection of Human 
Subjects/Informed Consent); 21 CFR § 56 (Institutional Review Boards) and §312 
(Investigational New Drug Application; and 45 CFR § 46 Subparts A (Common Rule), B 
(Pregnant Women, H uman Fetuses and Neonates), C (Prisoners), and D (Children), 
GCP/ICH guidelines, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The IRB must comply 
with the regulations in 21 CFR §56 and applicable regulatory requirements.  
11.3 Informed Consent Process 
Informed co nsent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. D iscussion of the risks and 
possible benefits of this study  will be provided to subjects and their families. Consent forms 
describing in detail the study objectives , procedures,  and risks are given to the subject and 
documentation of informed consent is required prior to enrollment . Consent forms will include the 
MCW IRB template language and must be approved by the MCW IRB.  
The patient  will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the 
investigator s will explain the research study to the patient  and answer any questions that may 
arise. In accordance with 46 C FR §46.111, the patient  will sign and date the informed consent 
document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  A witness should only 
sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. The subjects will have the opportunity to discuss 
the s tudy with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The subjects may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.  
If the patient signs the consent form, t he original signed document will become part of the pat ient’s 
medical records and the patient will receive a copy of the signed document.  
11.4 Subject Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the principal investigator , participating 
investigators, and  any staff. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to 
participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing.  
The study protocol, documentation, data,  and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or data will be released to any unauthorized third 
party without prior written approval of the principal investigator . The conditions for maintaining 
BC Risk Assessment  24 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 confidentiality of the subjects’ records are required for the life of the data. These rules apply 
equally to any and all MCWCC projects.  
The principal investigator  will allow access to all source data and documents for the purposes of  
monitoring, audits, IRB review and regulatory inspections.  
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the principal investigator may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. 
The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
11.5 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
11.5.1  Potential and Protections Against Risks  
There is the potential for participant anxiety or distress regarding the results of their personalized 
BC risk asse ssment and/or their genetic test results. Our study team will do our best to answer 
questions and assuage concerns regarding anxiety of distress of testing results, we are also supported by the psychiatry and social work teams in the Clinical Cancer Center . 
Another  risk of taking part in a research study is that more people will handle the personal health 
information collected for this study. The study team will make every effort to protect the information 
and keep it confidential  (see Section 10.1
), but it is possible that an unauthorized person might 
see it. Depending on the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could 
embarrass the subject or affect his/her ability to get insurance.  
11.5.2  Potential Benefits  
Participants will be informed of their personal breast cancer risk which may influence if they 
undergo top surgery and how they undergo top surgery. This may also influence if they should 
consider genetic testing which may also impact their family members. 
Findings from this proposal will inform the TGNB community and healthcare providers on how 
instituting a personalized BC risk assessment impacts surgical -decision regarding chest 
masculinization surgery.  
For these reasons, the potential benefits of the study are reasonable in relation to the anticipated 
risks to the study participants.  
11.6 Protection of Human Subjects  
11.6.1  Protection from Unnecessary Harm  
Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human experimentation. This 
is accomplished through the IRB mechanism and the informed consent process. The IRB reviews 
all proposed studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the subject’s rights and welfare are protected and that the potential benefits and/or the importance of the knowledge to 
be gained outweigh the risks to the individual. The IRB also reviews the informed consent 
document associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent document accur ately 
and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its associated risks and benefits.  
BC Risk Assessment  25 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 11.6.2  Protection of Privacy  
To ensure confidentiality, each participant is assigned an anonymous study ID, which is then used 
on all study forms that collect participant data. Study IDs are linked to participant names and other 
private identifiable information in only one location, on an encrypted, firewall protected, electronic 
document housed on MCW’s server. All study forms are to be kept on  an MCW password-
protected computer, server , or HIPAA compliant data sharing platform, with access restricted to 
authorized study personnel.  
11.7 Changes in the Protocol  
Once the protocol has been approved by the MCW IRB, any changes to the protocol must be documented in the form of an amendment. The amendment must be signed by the investigator 
and approved by  the IRB prior to implementation.  
If it b ecomes necessary to alter the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to subject s, an 
amendment may be implemented prior to IRB approval. In this circumstance, however, the investigator must then notify the IRB in writing within five working days after i mplementation.   
The IRB may provide, if applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the approval 
/favorable opinion of the IRB. The investigator will submit all protocol modifications to the sponsor 
and the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
Changes to the protocol may require approval from the sponsor.  
Any deviations  from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents  and reported 
to the IRB per institutional guidelines.  
11.8 Investigator Compliance 
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  
Onsit e Audits : Auditing is essential to ensure that research conducted at the Medical College of 
Wisconsin (MCW) Cancer Center is of the highest quality and meets MCW and regulatory agency 
standards.  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB , and/or sponsor may request access to all source documents, 
data capture records and other study documentation for onsite audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times 
for these activities.  
The PI will follow the procedures  as outlined above, which will serve as part of the quality control 
procedure. The PI will also meet with the mentorship team and CRC regularly to ensure data 
accuracy, appropriate data analysis, and protocol adherence. To ensure the validity and integrity 
of study data, the PI will discuss data management with the research team and CRC on a regular 
basis . 
BC Risk Assessment  26 Version No. : 1.0  
Before Top Surgery   Version Date: 01 /30/23 12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT 
12.1 Data Management Plan  
Study electronic data will be stored on a password -protected Microsoft Excel file using password-
protected computers on encrypted networks  that are backed up nightly. In addition to protected 
health information ( PHI) data (name, date of birth and medical record number), other data to be 
collected include participant demographic information (race, ethnicity, age, sex assigned at birth, 
gender, etc.), initial VAS personal estimate, results from the personalized BC risk assessment, 
possible genetic testing results, and the type of gender -affirming chest  masculinization su rgery 
the participa nt undergoes. Initial intake data will be entered into Qualtrics, a secure online survey 
platform, at the time of personalized BC risk assessment, and then converted to a Microsoft Excel file where subsequent patient data (genetic test r esults, decision for surgery) will be directly 
entered by the PI and Co- I. All data will be de -identified prior to statistical analysis. All consent 
forms will be kept in locked file cabinets in locked offices.  
12.2 Disseminating and Publishing Data  
All raw dat a, data figures, data interpretation, models, and conclusions drawn from this study will 
be managed by the principal investigator and co- investigators listed in this protocol. The findings 
from this study may be presented at relevant conferences/meetings , published in a respectable 
peer-reviewed journal, or used as preliminary data in a grant application to justify extramural 
funding.   
For any manuscript that is to be published in a journal, the role of authors/contributors, the disclosure of financial/non- financial relationships and activities, and the report of perceived 
conflicts of interest will largely adhere to the recommended guidelines set forth by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE; Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors
, 
Disclosure of Financial and Non- Financial Relationship and Activities and Conflicts of Interest ). 
The PI, in consultation with the study co -investigators,  will determine who will be listed as first, 
senior, and corresponding author(s). Study team members who have made substantial and 
significant intellectual contributions to the study and its findings will be listed as contributing 
authors or, in certain circumstances, acknowledged. Funding sources and any conflict of interests, 
perceived or actual, will be disclosed and stated within the appropriate section of the manuscript 
at submission.

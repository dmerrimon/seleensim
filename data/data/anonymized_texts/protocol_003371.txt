INTRODUCTION:
BACKGROUND
INFORMATION
AND
SCIENTIFIC
RATIONALE
2.1
B
ACKGROUND
I
NFORMATION
Cognitive
impairment,
specifically
dementia
and
Alzheimer’s
Disease,
is
one
of
the
largest
health 
problems
in
the
United
States.
There
are
6
million
individuals
in
the
U.S.
with
some
form
of
dementia, 
representing
an
annual
cost
to
the
healthcare
system
of
$225
billion.
5.3
million
of
these
people
have 
Alzheimer’s
Disease,
the
6th
leading
cause
of
death
in
the
U.S.
By
2050,
these
numbers
are
expected
to 
triple
to
nearly
16
million
Americans
diagnosed
with
dementia,
with
an
annual
cost
of
more
than
$1
trillion 
(10)
.
Current
standard
of
care
to
address
this
enormous
health
problem
is
lengthy
for
both
practitioners 
and
patients,
potentially
invasive,
expensive,
and
cannot
detect
impairment
early
enough
to
intervene
and 
potentially
change
the
course
of
disease.
There
is
an
enormous
market
need
for
a
cost
effective,
reliable, 
objective,
noninvasive,
accurate,
way
to
identify
cognitive
impairment
at
its
earliest
stages.
DCTclock
TM
DCTclock
TM
is
a
neuropsychological
test
based
on
the
traditional
Clock
Drawing
Test
that
may
provide
a 
more
sensitive
measure
of
cognitive
state
(11).
The
DCTclock
test,
offered
by
Linus
Health,
capitalizes
on 
the
clever
design
of
the
traditional
Clock
Drawing
Test
but
uses
patented
advanced
analytics
and 
technology
to
evaluate
both
the
final
drawing
and
the
process
that
created
it,
producing
a
more
robust 
assessment.
The
DCTclock
test,
is
cleared
to
market
and
uses
a
digitizing
ballpoint
pen
that,
while 
drawing,
also
digitally
records
its
position
on
the
paper
75
times
a
second
with
a
spatial
resolution
of
two 
one-thousandths
of
an
inch.
DCTclock
software
detects
and
measures
changes
in
pen
position
that 
cannot
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye,
and
because
the
data
is
time-stamped,
the
system
captures
the
entire 
sequence
of
behaviors
(e.g.,
every
stroke,
pause
or
hesitation),
rather
than
just
the
final
result.
This 
enables
the
capture
and
analysis
of
very
subtle
behaviors
that
have
been
found
to
correlate
with
changes 
in
cognitive
function
.
These
measurements
are
all
operationally
defined
in
code
(hence
free
of
user
bias) 
and
carried
out
in
real
time.
To
distinguish
this
version
of
the
product,
it
will
be
referred
to
as 
DCTclock-pen.
DCTclock-pen
hardware
includes
the
digitizing
pen,
pen
dock,
and
printed
test
form.
As
a 
participant
draws,
the
pen
captures
and
encrypts
the
test
data.
While
DCTclock-pen
is
an
easy-to-use
and
accurate
cognitive
test,
enabling
its
administration
using
a 
tablet
(DCTclock-tablet)
will
ease
deployment
by
leveraging
equipment
more
commonly
found
in
clinical 
settings
and
that
require
less
maintenance,
with
a
concomitant
decrease
of
cost
and
administrator 
burden.
Hardware
for
DCTclock-tablet
includes
an
Apple
iPad
and
an
Apple
Pencil.
Like
the
digital
pen, 
the
iPad
captures
and
encrypts
data
as
the
participant
draws
with
the
Apple
Pencil.
In
both
cases
–
pen 
and
tablet
-
the
data
from
the
DCTclock
test
is
securely
transmitted
to
Linus’s
HIPAA
compliant
servers 
where
it
is
decrypted,
then
analyzed
using
advanced
analytics
including
proprietary
state-of-the-art 
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learning
techniques.
Following
test
analysis,
a
report
is
instantly 
generated
and
immediately
available
for
review
by
the
investigator
via
a
secure
website.
In
addition
to 
facilitating
deployment
by
eliminating
the
need
for
unique
hardware
(the
digitizing
ballpoint
pen), 
transitioning
DCTclock
to
a
tablet
can
also
enable
harmonization
with
other
tablet-based
cognitive 
assessment
platforms
such
as
the
NIH
Toolbox
and
tests
under
development
in
the
Linus
Platform.
The
primary
endpoint
of
this
study
is
to
determine
the
equivalence
of
DCTclock-pen
and
DCTclock-tablet 
in
assessing
cognitive
impairment.

‘Linus’
is
a
multimodal,
remote
brain
health
monitoring
platform
designed
to
integrate
scientifically
validated,
best-in-class
technologies
into
a
single
‘plug-and-play’
solution
for
longitudinal,
in
situ
data
collection.
The
platform
brings
together,
into
one
mobile
application,
end-point
solutions
that
rely
mainly
on
smartphone
or
tablet
sensors
to
collect
various
measures
of
patients’
cognitive
and
motor
functions.
Linus
Platform
Tests
will
be
included
in
this
study
to
gather
preliminary
data.
Ultimately,
a
battery
of
tests
including
DCTclock
and
others
in
the
Linus
Platform
could
be
used
clinically
for
a
more
accurate
assessment
of
cognitive
function,
but
it
is
first
essential
to
determine
how
these
tests
correlate
and
complement
each
other
by
administering
them
in
parallel
in
a
defined
cohort.
An
additional
aim
of
this
protocol
is
to
obtain
data
to
develop
and
validate
tests
on
the
Linus
Platform.
Linus

adverse
events
(AE)
were
recorded
in
this
population.
The
percentage
of
participants
experiencing
an
AE
during
the
study
window
(1-4
weeks)
is
not
unexpected
given
that
the
study
included
an
older
population
aged
55
to
95
years
old.
Of
the
total
37
AEs,
only
1
was
a
serious
adverse
event
(SAE).
The
SAE
was
reviewed
by
the
study
medical
monitor
and
found
to
be
unrelated
to
the
protocol
or
study
device.
There
were
no
reported
unanticipated
adverse
device
effects
and
no
reported
serious
device
related
AEs.
The
36
non-serious
AEs
were
reviewed
by
the
study
Adverse
Event
Review
Team
and
found
to
be
unrelated
to
the
study
device.
The
most
frequent
AEs
reported
were
colds
and
gastrointestinal
upset
and
both
occurred
in
less
than
1
percent
of
participants
(4
in
435).
DCTclock-tablet
differs
from
DCTclock-pen
predominantly
in
the
use
of
an
Apple
iPad
and
Apple
Pencil 
instead
of
the
digitizing
ballpoint
pen
and
paper.
It
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
risk
level
for 
DCTclock-tablet
will
be
minimal
and
the
risk
profile
will
be
similar
to
that
seen
with

will
be
allowed
breaks
between 
tests,
as

are
required
for
this
study.
Should
a
participant
become 
uncomfortable
completing
the
standing
and
walking
tasks
due
to
physical
challenges
or
fatigue, 
they
will
be
instructed
to
stop
the

immediately. 
●
Should
a
participant
express
any
concern
with
their
performance
on
cognitive
tests,
they
will
be 
directed
to
discuss
those
concerns
with
their
Primary
Care
Physician.
No
results
from
the
testing 
conducted
in
this

or
used
to
guide
their
clinical

●
Federal
and
local

will
be
followed
to
minimize
exposure 
of

●
While
there
is
always
a
risk
of

As
the
risks

(4)
Participants
will
be
asked
to
complete
three
short

Linus
utilizes
a
clinical-grade
speech
elicitation
and
analytics
system
designed
to
extract
outcome
measures
as
indicators
of
neurological
system
function
from
research
participants.
Tests
will
be
administered,
and
voice
recordings
captured
and
encrypted
on
a
study
provided
tablet.
Voice
recordings
are
then
uploaded
to
a
secure,
HIPAA
compliant
cloud
server
managed
by
the
test
manufacturer,
Aural
Analytics,
Inc.
Transcripts
of
the
voice
recordings
are
created,
and
an
AI
engine
analyzes
for
finite
but
clinically
relevant
information.
Algorithms
apply
signal
processing
and
cognitive
linguistic
analysis
to
assess
speech
and
fine
motor
skills
and
detect
subtle
changes
in
cognitive
function.
Extraction
of

have
been
previously
shown
to
correlate
to

tracking-based
memory
assessments
(9)
VisMET
(Visuospatial
Memory
Eye-Tracking
Task)
is
a
tablet-based
application,
developed
by
Emory
University,
that
passively
assesses
visuospatial
memory
by
tracking
eye
movements
rather
than
memory
judgements.
VisMET
offers
a
sensitive,
and
efficient
memory
paradigm
capable
of
detecting
objective
memory
impairment
and
predicting
cognitive
and
disease
status.
This
task
is
conducted
on
an
iPad
and
monitors
a
participant’s
gaze
location
and
gaze
patterns
as
they
view
repeated
images
that
have
been
subtly
changed
between
the
first
and
second
viewing
of
the
image
(for
example,
an
item
in
the
first
image
may
have
been
deleted
in
the
repeated
image).
This
testing
captures
full
face
video
recordings
which
will
be
kept
and
de-identified
locally
at
the
trial
site.
De-identified,
coordinate
level
data
will
then
be
uploaded
and
a
computerized
algorithm
will
generate
gaze
position
to
approximate
eye
position.
No
other
feedback
from
the
participant
is
recorded.
Cumulative
gaze
times,
dwell
times
and
other
eye
movement
parameters
serve
as
the
study
measures.
Linus
Platform
gait
and
balance
assessment
Cognitive
decline
and
neurodegenerative
diseases
have
been
implicated
in
gait
dysfunction
via
disturbance
of
top-down
mechanisms
and
frontal-systems’
resource
allocation
and
linked
to
executive
dysfunction
(14).
Gait
velocity
decreases,
variability
increases,
and
the
ability
to
multitask
while
walking
(dual-tasking)
is
impaired
as
cognition
declines
and
can
be
risk
indicators
of
dementia
progression
(15).
These
features
can
be
captured
using
motion
sensors,
such
as
accelerometers
and
gyroscopes
on
smart
devices,
and
such
approaches
have
been
validated
against
in-lab
measures
(5).
Dual
tasking
(e.g.,
walking
or
standing
while
performing
a
cognitive
task)
disrupts
performance
in
one
or
both
tasks,
and
resulting
dual-task
costs
have
been
shown
to
increase
with
aging
and
be
reliable
indicators
of
loss
of
cognitive
reserve
and
development
of
cognitive
dysfunction
and
early
dementia
(16)
(17).
Specifically,
dual
tasking
activates
a
network
of
brain
regions,
including
prefrontal
cortex,
and
is
associated
with
degeneration
of
the
entorhinal
cortex
(18).
It
offers
a
sensitive
quantitative
metric
of
integrity
of
frontal
systems
that
correlate
with
executive
function
and
serve
as
early
biomarkers
of
meso-temporal
memory
systems.
This
task
is
conducted
using
a
study
provided
smartphone
carried
in
a
pocket
or
phone
carrier
attached
to
the
subject’s
waist.
In
the
gait
assessment,
the
subject
will
be
asked
to
walk
at
a
comfortable
pace
of
their
choosing
for
45
seconds.
They
will
then
be
asked
to
repeat
that
walking
exercise
while
performing
a
serial
subtraction
task.
The
total
time
walking
is
<
2

The𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟𝐿𝑜𝐴
conclusion
that

of
the

1.
Calculate
the
paired

Informed
consent
is
a
process
that
is
initiated
prior
to
the
individual’s
agreeing
to
participate
in
the
study 
and
continues
throughout
the
individual’s
study
participation.
Extensive
discussion
of
risks
and
possible 
benefits
of
participation
will
be
provided
to
the
participants.
Consent
forms
will
be
IRB-approved,
and
the 
participant
will
be
asked
to
read
and
review
the
document.
The
study
staff
will
explain
the
research
study 
to
the
participant
and
answer
any
questions
that
may
arise.
All
participants
will
receive
a
verbal 
explanation
in
terms
suited
to
their
comprehension
of
the
purposes,
procedures,
and
potential
risks
of
the 
study
and
of
their
rights
as
research
participants.
Participants
will
have
the
opportunity
to
carefully
review 
the
written
consent
form
and
ask
questions
prior
to
signing.
The
participants
should
have
the
opportunity 
to
discuss
the
study
with
their
surrogates
or
think
about
it
prior
to
agreeing
to
participate.
The
participant 
will
sign
the
informed
consent
document
prior
to
any
procedures
being
done
specifically
for
the 
study.
The
participants
may
withdraw
consent
at
any
time
throughout
the
course
of
the
trial.
A
copy
of
the 
informed
consent
document
will
be
given
to
the
participants
for
their
records.
The
rights
and
welfare
of
the 
participants
will
be
protected
by
the
site
emphasizing
to
them
that
the
quality
of
their
medical
care
will
not 
be
adversely
affected
if
they
decline
to
participate
in
this
study.
As
subjects
with
varying
levels
of
cognitive
impairment
will
be
recruited
for
this
trial,
steps
will
be
taken
to 
ensure
that
a
subject’s
cognitive
status
does
not
impact
their
ability
to
consent.
Several
studies
have 
considered
and
discussed
competency
and
capacity
to
consent
to
research
among
older
persons
and 
those
with
dementia
(19)
(20).
In
agreement
with
those
studies,
patients
with
a
previously
documented 
MMSE
or
Montreal
Cognitive
Assessment
(MoCA)
score
<
18
or
who
receive
a
score
of
18
or
less
on
the 
MMSE
given
during
screening
will
be
excluded
from
the
study
or
required
to
have
a
legally
authorized 
representative
consent
to
the
study.
For
participants
with
a
previously
documented
MMSE
or
MoCA
score
>18
or
without
a
historical
score,
all 
attempts
will
be
made
to
ensure
that
the
participant
understands
the
study
including
asking
them
three 
questions
about
the
study
after
the
consent
discussion
(how
many
visits
are
there,
how
long
do
the
study 
visits
last,
and
how
much
will
you
be
paid).
A
screening
MMSE
will
also
be
conducted.
If,
based
on
an 
inability
to
correctly
answer
these
questions,
a
subject
is
not
capable
of
providing
consent
due
to
their 
lack
of
understanding
of
the
study
details,
they
will
be
excluded
from
the
study
unless
consent
can
be 
obtained
from
a
legally
authorized
representative.
As
noted
above
for
those
who
do
consent
and
progress 
to
screening,
an
MMSE
score
<
18
on
the
screening
MMSE
administered
during
the
study
is
also 
exclusionary.
Any
subject
excluded
due
to
the
screening
MMSE,
can
be
re-enrolled
in
the
study
if
a 
legally
authorized
representative
consents.

(ii)
does
not
require
an 
invasive
sampling
procedure
that
presents
significant
risk;
(iii)
does
not
by
design
or
intention
introduce 
energy
into
a
subject;
and
(iv)
is
not
used
as
a
diagnostic
procedure
without
confirmation
of
the
diagnosis 
by
another,
medically
established
diagnostic

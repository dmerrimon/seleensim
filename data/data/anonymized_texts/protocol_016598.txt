Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
Phase 3 trial to investigate the safety  and efficacy  of mesalamine 2 g extended release granules 
(sachet) for maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission in subj ects with UC. Subjects who 
are in remission can be enrolled in the current trial via 
1of 3pathway s. 
Pathway  1:  Subjects who are in remission following 8 weeks of double-blind treatment in 
Study  000174 can be randomized into Study  000175. The clinical and endoscopic remission 
criteria for Study  000174 include a Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score as a score of 0 
for rectal bleeding and 0 or 1 with at lea st 1 point decrease from baseline for stool 
frequency , with an endoscopic score of 0 or 1.
Pathway  2:  Subjects in remission at the end of the 8- week open- label treatment period in 
Study  000174 will be allowed to be randomized into Study  000175. 
Pathway  3
–de novo:  Subjects who did not participate in Study  000174 can also be 
enrolled; these subjects will have been treated with various medications for UC (excluding 
biologics and long -term [ ≥6weeks ] immunosuppressants) and will have been in remission 
for <1 year. These de novo subjects will undergo a 72- hour mesalamine washout prior to 
entering the current trial and will have a Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score 
assessment to ensure eligibility .
All eligible subjects will be randomized during Visit 1/D ay 0 (start of maintenance) to 1of the 
following treatments:  
one mesalamine 2 g extended release granules (sachet) QD (2 g/day ) OR
one 2 g placebo sachet to match 
mesalamine extended release granules (sachet)
Dose will be administered QD at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal at 
approximately  the same time each day . The sachet will be emptied on the tongue and swallowed 
with at least 8 ounces (240 mL ) of water. For all subjects, the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product 
(IMP) will be administered the day  following randomization/Visit 1.
During the 6- month trial period, all subjects will visit the trial site 5 times for safety and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline, Week 2, and Months 2, 4, and 6 . On a dail y basis, subjects w ill record 
clinical sy mptoms ( stool frequency  and rectal bleeding) in an electronic diary . The Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score assessments will be performed at baseline and Month 6. After 
6 months of treatment, subjects will be evaluated for remission, defined as a Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score of rectal bleeding score of 0 and stool frequency  score of 0 or 1, with 
an endoscopic score of 0 or 1. Whereas, s ubjects will only have a Clinical Response Score 
assessment at 
Week 2 and Months 2 and 4. De novo subjects will have a complete screening visit,
and if they  arejudged to be in clinical and endoscopic remission based on their Clinical and 
Endoscopic Score at baseline/randomization, t hey 
will continue with the 6- month assessment for 
safet y and efficacy evaluations.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY ( Continued )
Flexible sigmoidoscopy /colon oscop y will be video recorded and transferred to the independent 
central reader. The details of the tools, recording, data transfer, and assessment will be documented 
in an Imaging Charter .If the local site ’sendoscopic reading determines the subject is ineligi ble, the 
subject will be screen failed (Pathway  3 –de novo ).If the local site’s endoscopic reading 
determines that the subject is eligible, the flexible sigmoidoscopy /colon oscopy recording will be 
sent to the independent central reader for final determination of eligibility (Pathway  3 –de novo ). 
For subjects rolling over from the 000174 trial (Pathway  1 and 2) ,000175 eligibility  will be derived 
from the final end-
of-treatment ( EOT) independent central read. A flexible 
sigmoidoscop y/colon oscopy will also be performed at Month 6, which will also be sent to the 
independent central reader for endoscopic endpoint scoring for all subjects . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS
Approximately 260 subjects with UC in clinical and endoscopic remission will be randomized 
(130/treatment regimen).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALDURATION OF TREATMENT
The duration of treatment for each subject will be 6 months.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample size : The true remission rates at Month 6 for mesalamine 2 g extended release granules 
(sachet) and placebo regimens were assumed as 68% and 49%, respectively, based on The 
mesalamine Study  Group (1996) ,(3)Hawkey  et al ( 1997), (4)and Apriso™ package insert
(2009).( 5)Under these assumptions, a sample size of 120 randomized subjects per group will 
provide at least 85% power to detect a statistically  significant treatment group difference in the 
remission rate at a two -sided 0.05 significance level using the chi-square test. To maintain the 
power for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis that excludes subjects who are rolled over from the placebo 
group in the 000174 trial via Pathway  1, approximately  260 subjects will be randomized. 
Efficacy
: The prima ry efficacy  anal ysis will be based on all randomized subjects who were
assigned to mesalamine 4 g extended release granules in the 000174 trial or randomized via 
Pathway  2 or 3(ITT; intent -to-treat) . The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the proportion of
subjects inremission, defined as rectal bleeding score of 0 
and stool frequency  score of 0 or 1, with 
an endoscopic score of 0 or 1 in Clinical andEndoscopic Response Score at Month 6.
The treatment group difference in the proportion of subjects inremission at Month 6 will be 
assessed b y the Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by the randomization strata at a two-sided 0.05 
significance level. Subjects who discontinue the double
-blind regimen before Month 6, as well as 
subjects with missing remission assessment at Month 6, will be considered not having met the 
remission criteria . The odds ratio will be estimated and its 95% confidence interval will be 
provided.
Safety : The safet y anal yses will be based on all subjects who receive at least 1dose of IMP . All 
adverse events will be coded by  system organ class and preferred term using the most current 
version of the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) . A treatment-emergent 
adverse event will be defined as an y adverse event occurring after t
he start of IMP or pre -existing 
medical condition that worsens in intensity  after the start of IMP.
Clinical laboratory  variables will be presented in 2ways. First, mean change from baseline to the 
end of the double -blind treatment visit will be summarize d. Baseline will be defined as the last 
assessment before the first dose of IMP . Second, the number and percentage of subjects with 
treatment -emergent potentially  clinicall
y significant laboratory values on or before the end of the 
double -blind treatment v isit will be tabulated . 
Other safety  assessments will also be summarized descr iptivel y.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Backgroun d
Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory  bowel disease, is a chronic condition of unknown origin. 
Ulcerative colitis is a relapsing and remitting disease characterized by  acute non -infectious 
inflammation of the colorectal mucosa. (6)  In the United State s (US), about 1 million people are 
affected with UC. (7,8) The annual incidence of UC per 100,000 people is 10.4 to 12cases in the 
US and 8 cases in Europe . The prevalence rate per 100,000 people is 35 to 100 cases in the US and 
21 to 243 in Europe. UC is slightly  more common in women than in men. Although the disease can 
occur at an y age, the age of onset follows a bimodal pattern, with a peak at 15 to 25 years and a 
smaller peak at 55 to 65years.(9)
Active episodes of UC are marked b y passing of blood a nd mucus, diarrhea, and abdominal pain 
frequentl y accompanied by  urgency  and tenesmus. (10)In the most severe forms, sy stemic signs 
comprising fever, anorexia, and weight loss may  occur. 
Approximately  60% of patients have a mild 
form, 25% a moderate form, and 15% a severe disease. Despite treatment, it is estimated that 
approximately  1 of every 2 patients with UC will experience a relapse within 1 y ear;the cumulative 
probability  of relapse is 80% within 2 y ears and 95% within 10 y ears.( 11)
Involvement of th e rectal mucosa is a constant feature while the inflammation spreads to higher 
levels in continuous and retrograde fashion, with no sparing of mucosa from the anorectal junction. 
Hence, UC may  be divided in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left -sided colitis (the proximal limit 
being below the splenic flexure), extensive colitis (involving the transverse colon), andpancolitis
(involving the entire colon).
The aim of treatment of UC is theinduc tionof remission and maintenance of remission
, and the 
prevention of  complication of long -term UC . 
Several therapeutic drug classes are used in UC: 5 -aminosalicy lic acid ( 5-ASA )derivatives, 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and anti- tumor necrosis factor -αagents. At present, 
aminosalicy late derivatives are the main and first-line therapy  for mild to moderate episodes of UC 
and for maintenance treatment.( 12)Rectal administration of salicy late-type drugs constitutes the 
treatment of choice in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and left
-sided UC.( 13,14,15) The extended
release mesalamine granules are purposed to treat all forms of active mild -to-moderate UC in all 
segments of the colon.
Ferring recently  developed a prolonged release granule formulation with a higher drug load (95% 
load) to provide a bett
er alternative for patients that have difficulty  swallowing the tablet or capsule 
forms, and thereb y ma y help increase treatment compliance.

Prolonged Release Granules -2 g
Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALThe safet y and tolerability of various mesalamine dosing regimens have been demonstrated. (16,17)
The optimum dose of oral mesalamine for induction therap y in order to achieve remission is 
between 2 and 4 g/day .(18)  
1.2
Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
The mesalamine 2 g extended release granules ( sachet) is approved in 71 countries worldwide for 
treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis .The indications may  differ from country  to country .
This dosage form was developed as a true QD regimen to provide an alternative for patients who 
have difficult y swallowing the tablets or large capsules forms. The re are no sachet granular forms 
available for both induction and maintenance of remission in some countries . The availability  of 
this easier -to-take formulation might potentially  help increase compliance, and would be an overall 
useful tool in the care of these patients. 
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects
The 95% granules allows for a true once a day  convenient dosing with the highest unit dosage form 
available for induction and maintenance of UC . In addition the granules are easier to swallow than 
the tablets and capsules currentl y available in the US .
The most common adverse events ( AEs) considered related to treatment with mesalamine 
formulations up to 2g per day  have been diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, 
andrash. Hy persensitivity  reaction s and drug fever may  occasionally  occur.

3.1 Overall Trial Design
3.1.1 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
Phase 3 trial to investigate the safety  and efficacy  of therap y with mesalamine 2 g extended release 
granules (sachet) for maintenance of clinical and endos copic remission in subje cts with UC. 
Subjects who are in remission can be enrolled in the current trial via 1 of 3 pathway s. 
Pathway  1:  Subjects who are in remission following 8 weeks of double-blind treatment in 
Study  000174 can be randomized into Study 000175 . The clinical and endoscopic remission 
criteria for Study  000174 include a 
Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score as a score of 
0for rectal bleeding and 0 or 1 with at least 1 point decrease from baseline for stool 
frequency , with an endoscopic sc ore of 0 or 1.
Pathway  2:  Subjects in remission at the end of the 8- week open- label treatment period in 
Study  000174 will be allowed to be randomized into Study  000175. 
Pathway  3
–de novo:  Subjects who did not participate in Study  000174 can also be 
enrolled; these subjects will have been treated with various medications for UC (excluding 
biologics and long -term [ ≥6weeks ] immunosuppressants) and will have been in remission 
for <1 year. These de novo subjects will undergo a 72- hour mesalamine washout prior to 
entering the current trialand will have a Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score 
assessment to ensure eligibility . Refer to Section 4.3.1 for a complete listing of restrictions.
All eligible subjects will be randomized during Visit 1/Day  0 (start of maintenance) to 1 of the 
following treatments:  
one mesalamine 2 g extended release granul es (sachet) QD (2 g/day ) OR
one 2 g placebo sachet to match mesalamine extended release granules (sachet)
Dose will be administered QD at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal at 
approximately  the same time each day . The sachet will be emptied on the tongue and swallowed 
with at least 8 ounces (240 mL ) of water. For all subjects, the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) will be administered the day  following randomization/Visit 1.
During the 6
-month trialperiod, all subjects will visit the trialsite 5 times for safety and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline, Week 2, and Months 2, 4, and 6. On a daily basis, subjects will record 
clinical sy mptoms ( stool frequency  and rectal bleeding) in an electronic dia ry. The Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score assessments will be performed at baseline and Month 6. After 
6 months of treatment, subjects will be evaluated for remission, defined as a Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score of rectal bleeding score of 0 a nd stool frequency  score of 0 or 1, with 
an endoscopic score of 0 or 1. Whereas ,subjects will only have a Clinical Response Score

and if they  are 
judged to be in clinical and endoscopic remission based on their Clinical and 
Endoscopic Scor eat baseline/randomization, they  will continue with the 6- month assessment for 
safet y and efficacy evaluations.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscop y
will be video recorded and transferred to the independent 
central reader. The details of the tools, recording, data transfer, and assessment will be documented 
in an Imaging Charter .If the local site ’sendoscopic reading determines the subject is ineligi ble, the 
subject will be screen failed (Pathway  3 –de novo ).If the local site’s endoscopic reading 
determines that the subject is eligible, a flexible sigmoidoscop y/colonoscopy recording will be sent 
to the independent central reader for final determinat ion of eligibility (Pathway  3 –de novo ) . For 
subjects rolling over from the 000174 trial (Pathway  1 and 2), 000175 eligibility  will be derived 
from the final EOT independent central read. A flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy will also be 
performed at Mont h 6, which will also be sent to the independent central reader for endoscopic 
endpoint scoring for all subjects

4.4
Withdrawal Criteria
Subjects have the right to withdraw fro m the trial at any  time for an y reason, without the need to 
justify  their decision. However, the investigator should record the reason for the subject’s 
withdrawal. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects.
Subjects will be withdrawn in the following cases: 
pregnancy  at any  time during the trialwill be a reason for withdrawal
withdrawal of consent
worsening of UC 
with a need for an escalation of the therap y (i.e., surgical therapy , use of 
steroids, immunosuppressive or immunomodulating dru gs,biologics, increase dose of 
5-ASA in an y form)
request for termination of the trialby regulatory  authorities or sponsor
the subject develops an y AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants the subject’s 
withdrawal from treatment. An AE form will be completed as appropriate, and the subject 
will be followed until the event is clinically  stable.

AE and to assess the efficacy  criteria. 
For an y discontinuation, the investigator will obtain all the required details and document the date 
of the premature termination and the main reason in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Since 
an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the trialdevoid of meaning, the unnecessary  
withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.
Subjects who withdrew from the trial will not be replaced.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL5 TREATMENTS
5.1 Treatments Administered
5.1.1 Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
IMPs used in the trial are extended release gran ules in sachets of either :
mesalamine 2 g extended release granules ( sachet )
placebo 2 g sachet to match mesalamine extended release granules 
5.1.2 Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP)
No NIMPs will be supplied to subjects participating in the trial.
5.2 Characteristics and Source of Supply
All IMPsare provided b y Ferring Pharmaceuticals/Ferring Entit y and will be handled according to 
the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).
5.3
Packaging and Labelling
Packaging and label ling of the IMPs will be performed under the responsibility  of the IMP 
department at Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S in accordance with GMP and national regulatory 
requirements. 
The IMP will be supplied to the subjec ts in boxes containing 64 sachets, enough f or 2 months’ 
treatment including visit windows.
All IMP labelled with trial -specific labels and will contain an unique IMP number. 
The label of the IMP will also contain 1 self -adhesive tear -off portion to be affixed to the drug 
accountability  log. 
5.4 Condi tions for Storage and Use
The investigator will ensure that the IMPs will be stored in appropriate conditions as stated on the 
labels in a secure location with controlled access. The storage compartment shall be monitored 
regularl y and the temperature must be documented. Deviations in storage temperature must be 
reported without delay , and the I MP must not be used until further instructions from the sponsor are 
received.
5.5 Blinding / Unblinding
5.5.1 Blinding
The IMPs will be packaged according to a centralized computer -generated randomization list. The 
randomization list will not be available to an y person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the 
trial until the trial database is declared clean and released to the statistician.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALAll IMP will be identical in appearance to protect the blinded nature of the trial.
5.5.2 Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator and designated persons at Ferring via 
the IRT system. Breaking of the blind for individual subjects i n emergency  situations is only  
permitted in case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) or in case of an 
important AE where the knowledge of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for 
the management of the subject. Th e expectedness of events will be assessed by  Ferring according to 
the Investigator’s Brochure.
As the emergency  permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed upon by  the investigator and 
Ferring. It should be recorded in the eCRF that the code is broken and wh y, when, and b y whom. 
The investigator must record the event of unblinding in the sub ject’s medical record, including the 
reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation, if this can be avoided. 
In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency  unblinding must be 
obtained, and the event must also be recorde d in the subject’s medical record.
It may  be necessary  to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited 
reporting to the authorities and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) (IEC)(s)/I nstitutional Review 
Board(s) (I RB)(s). In that situation, every  effort will be made to maintain blinding of sponsor 
personnel involved in data anal ysis and interpretation. Other personnel may be unblinded for 
SUSARs, including trial site staff and staff acting on behalf of Ferring. 
Information on whether the blind has been broken for any  subjects must be collected before the 
database is declared clean and released to the statistician.
5.6 Treatment Compliance
5.6.1 Dispensing and Accountability
The IMP will only  be dispensed to subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria and are randomized to a 
treatment group in the trial. The investigator or coordinator will maintain a drug -dispensing log 
detailing the dates and quantities of I MPs dispensed to each subject. The monitor will verify  the 
drug accountability  during t he course of the trial.
5.6.2 Assessment of Compliance
At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 (or at early  withdrawal), subjects will bring their unused IMP back to the 
trialsite. Subject compliance will be assessed with a medication count b y the investigator or 
coordinator at the end of the visit and will be documented.

7.1.2 Flexible Sigmoidoscopy/ colonoscopy
In order to obtain the endoscopic response score ( Table 2), the objective evidence of inflammation 
in this trial, flexible sigmoidoscopy/ colonoscop y will be performed according to a standardized 
manner during 
screening ,at least 4 day s prior to randomization for Pathway 3 - de novo subjects  
and at the end of treatment (Month 6 or earl y withdrawal) for all subjects to allow sufficient time 
for the central reading .The EOT flexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscopy from Study  000174 will 
serve as the baseline /randomization assessment for Pathway s 1 and 2.
Theflexible sigmoidoscopy /colonoscop ywill be video recorded and transferred to the independent 
central reader. The details of the tools, recording, data transfer, and assessment will be documented 
in an Imaging Charter . Findings will be graded on a 4 -point scale ( Table 2), with 0 = normal or 
inactive disease, 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, granularity ), 2 = moderate

also be performed at Month 6, w hich will also be sent to the independent central reader for 
endoscopic endpoint scoring for all subjects.
Extent of colitis will be documented as proctosigmoiditis, left -
sided colitis, or extended colitis.
7.1.2.1 Independent Central Endoscopy Laboratory
All flexible sigmoidoscopies /colon oscop ieswill be performed in a standardized manner . The 
endoscop y completed during screening for Pathway  3 -de novo   (at least 4 day s prior to 
randomization to allow sufficient time for the central reading ), will be sent to 
anindependent 
central reader selected by the sponsor to qualify the image for use in randomization if the local 
site’s endoscopic reading determines that the subject is eligible . Image handling and instructions 
will be provided to all sites directl y from the central endoscopic laboratory . For Pathway s 1 and 2, 
screening assessment data will be taken from Study  000174 end of double -blind treatment/earl y 
withdrawal and end of open -label treatment/early  withdrawal visits. The EOT endoscopic readings 
for Pathw ays 1 and 2 will be used for randomization at Visit 1.   
The endoscopic qualify ing score will be reported to the investigator and sponsor (or the sponsor’s 
representative) and will automatically  be uploaded to the eCRF. 
Trial sites will be provided with endoscopic laboratory  recording equipment, supplies, and manuals. 
7.1.3 Subject Daily Diary 
The subject dail y diar y will be completed by the subject every evening starting at screening for 
Pathway  3 -de novo subjects and starting the day  ofrandomization Visit 1/Day  0for Pathway s 1 
and 2 . Subject diary  will consist of questions regarding IMP dail y intake, stool frequency , and 
prese nce of blood content. 
The score for stool frequency  and rectal bleeding will be calculated as an average based on scores 
collected 
from subject diary  data 5 day s prior to Visits 1, 2, 3, 4 , and 5 (see Appendix 2 ). If a 
subject recorded fewer than 3 day s of scores during this 5- day period, the average score will be 
considered missing .
The subject dail y diar y and questionnaire will be completed via a validated Interactive Voice

8.1 Adverse Eve nt Definition
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. I t includes:
any unfavorable and unintended sign, s ymptom or disease temporall y associated with the 
use of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP
AEs commonly  observed and 
AEs anticipated based on the ph armacological effect of the 
IMP
any laboratory  abnormality , vital sign ,or finding from phy sical (or gy necological )
examination assessed as clinically  significant b y the investigator (note: findings from 
assessments and examinations done during screening are not AEs, but are recorded as 
medical history )
accidental injuries, reasons for an y change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for an y 
medical, nursing or pharmacy  consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgical 
procedures
overdoses and medication errors with an d without clinical consequences
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
8.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events
The investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from the time of 
obtaining informed consent until the last visit.
The sources of AEs cover:
the subject ’s response to questions about his/her health (a standard non -leading question 
such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit)
symptoms spontaneously reported b y the subject
investigations and examinations where the findi ngs are assessed b y the investigator to be 
clinically  significant changes or abnormalities
other information relating to the subject’s health becoming known to the inve stigator (e.g. 
hospitali zation)
8.2.2 Recording of Adverse Events
The investigator must record all AE s in the AE logprovided in each subject’s eCRF with 
information about:
AE
date and time of onset (time can be omitted, if applicable)
intensity
causal relationship to I MP

other action taken
date and time of outcome (time can be omitted, if applicable)
outcome
seriousness
Each of the items in the AElog is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event s
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AEmore than once and the subject recovers between the events, 
the AE s should be recorded separatel y. If an AEchanges in intensity , a worst -case approach should 
be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity  and the longest duration of the event.a
A procedure is not an AE; the reason for conducting the procedure is. Hospitaliz ation is not an AE ; 
the reason for hospitali zation is. Death is not an AE, but the cause of death is (an exception is 
sudden death of unknown cause, which is an AE).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted. If the AEis an 
abnormal clinicall y significant labor atory  test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity  of an AEmust be classified using the following 3- point scale:
Mild: awareness of signs or s ymptoms, but no disruption of usual activity
Moderate: event 
sufficient to aff ect usual activity  (disturbing)
Severe: inability  to work or perform usual activiti es (unacceptable)
                                                
aException: if an AE with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre- treatment AE) changes in 
intensity, this must be recorded as 2 separate events. The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not yet 
recovered” and the date and time of outcom e are when the intensity changed. The second AE should be 
recorded w ith date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALCausal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the AE must be classifie d as 1of the following:
Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship 
between the IMP and the AE . The AE may occur as part of the 
pharmacological action of the IMP or may  be unpredictable in its 
occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strong ly associated 
with I MP exposure
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the 
event occurs in association with other factors strongl y suggesting 
causation, such as a strong temporal association or the event 
recurs on rechallenge
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
known consequences of the underl ying disease o r condition under 
investigation
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to 
occur with some frequency  during the course of the trial, 
regardless of IMP exposure
Action Taken with IMP
The action taken with the IMP in response to an AEmust be classified as 1of the following:
no change (medication schedule maintained or no actio n taken)
withdrawn
interrupted
Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therap y must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well-being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines 
must be avai lable to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency  situation.
If medication is administered to treat the AE, this medication should be entered in the concomitant 
medication log .

recovered (fully  recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of 
trial treatment)
recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity )
recovering
not recovered
fatal
8.3 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcome
Every  effort must be made to avoid pregnancy  during the trial. If a pregnanc y occurs, the IMP 
should be immediately  stopped and Global Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals must be 
informed using the Pregnancy  Report Form within 3 calendar day s. Note that pregnancy  itself is not 
a serious adverse event ( SAE ). The mother and the fetus must be followed at least until the birth of 
the infant and 1 month after the birth of the infant. In general, the follow -up will include the course, 
duration, and the outcome of the pregnancy  as well as neonatal health. If a pregnancy  results i n an 
abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly), this must be reported as an SAE to Global 
Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals as described in Section 8.4.2. Any abnormal 
pregnancy  outcome which the investigator and/or sponsor consider to be related to the IMP will be 
treated as an expedited report .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL8.4 Serious Adverse Events
8.4.1 Serious Adverse Event D efinition
Serious AE s are defined as follows:
An event is defined a serious 
adverse event if it:Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within 4 weeks after the treatment ends and 
irrespective of the causal relationship to the IMP. The death of a subject 
enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but an outcome.
is life-threatening The term life -threatening refers to an AE in which the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which may have caused death if it were more severe.
requires in -patient hospitali zation or 
prolongation of existing 
hospitaliz ationThe term hospitaliz ation means that the subject w as admitted to hospital or 
that existing hospitalization was extended as a result of an event. 
Hospitalization describes a period of at least 24 hours. Overnight stay for 
observation, stay at emergency room ,or treatment on an outpatient basi s do 
not constitute a hospitaliz ation. How ever, medical judgment must always be 
exercised and ,when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. ,if 
case fulfils the criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalizations for 
administrative or social purposes do not constitute SAE s. Hospital admissions 
and/or surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered 
AEs, if the illness or disease existed before the subject w as enrolled in the 
trial, provided that the condition did n ot deteriorate during the trial.
results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical 
judgment by the investigator.
is a congenital anom aly/birth defect Congenital anomaly/birth defect observed in any offspring of the subject 
conceived during treatment with the IMP.
is an important m edical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitaliz ation but may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent 1of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. Examples of important medical events include AEs that 
suggest a significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of 
malignancy ,or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether even ts qualify as 
medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious 
agent via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g. ,
prion protein transmitting transm issible spongiform encephalopat hy), 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A 
transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms 
or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a subject exposed to a 
medicinal product.

eCRF information regarding demographics, AEs, medical history , and concomitant medication is 
mandatory for ini tial reports and for follow -up reports if any  changes have been made since the 
initial report.
Additional information relevant to the SAE, such as hospital records, results from investigations 
(e.g., laboratory  parameters that are not already  uploaded in the eCRF, invasive procedures, scans, 
x-rays, and autopsy  results) can be faxed or scanned and e -mailed to Ferring Global 
Pharmacovigilance using the contact details in the section above. In an y case this information must 
be supplied by  the investigator up on request from Ferring. On any  copies provided, such details 
such as subject’s name, address, and hospital ID number should be concealed, and subject number 
should be provided instead.
The investigator will supply  Ferring and the IEC/IRB with any  additional requested information ,
such as results of post -mortem examinations and hospital records.
Expedited Reporting by Ferring 
Ferring will report all AEs that are serious, unexpected ,and with a reasonable possible causality 
to the IMP as judged by  either the investigator or Ferring to the relevant parties within the 
stipulated timelines. The expectedness of events will be assessed by  Ferring according to the 
Investigator’s Brochure .
SAEs will be considered reportable regardless of wheth er the IMP was used in accordance with the

8.5.1 Follow -up of Adverse Events with Onset during the Trial
During the trial, the investigat or must follow each AE until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the subject is stable.
After the subject’s last visit, the investigator must follow- up on an y AEclassified as serious or 
considered to have a reasonable possible causalit y to the I MP until it is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the subject is stable. All such relevant follow -up information must be reported 
to Ferring. If the event is a chronic condition, the investigator and Ferring may agree that further 
follow -up is not required.
8.5.2 Collection of Serious Adverse Events with Onset after Last Trial Visit
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the subject’s last visit, and he/she assesses the 
SAE to have a reasonable possible causalit y to the IMP, the case will have to be reported to Ferring, 
regardless how long after the end of the trial this takes place.

All analy ses will be detailed in a subsequent statistical anal ysis plan.
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
The true remission rates at Month 6 for mesalamine 2 g extended release granules (sachet) and 
placebo regimens were assumed as 68% and 49%, respectivel y, based on The Mesalamine Stud y 
Group (1996) (3), Hawkey  et al (1997) (4), and Apriso™ package insert (2009) .(5)Under these 
assumptions, a sample size of 120 randomized subjects per group will provide at least 85% power 
to detect a statistically  significant treatment group difference in the remission rate at a two -sided 
0.05 s ignificance level using the chi-square test. To maintain the power for the primary  efficacy  
analysis that excludes subjects who are rolled over from the placebo group in the 000174 trial via 
Pathway  1, approximately
 260 subjects will be randomized.
9.2 Subject Disposition
The number of screened subjects will be summarized, and for subjects not randomized, the primary  
reason for exclusion from randomization will be summarized.
The number and percentage of subjects who are randomized, are treated with I MP, premat urely 
discontinued, and completed the trialwill be summarized with the reasons for premature 
discontinuations.
The time to discontinuation will be summarized by  the Kaplan -Meier estimates, and the treatment 
group difference will be tested by  the log -rank test. I n addition, reason- specific discontinuation will 
be summarized by  the cumulative incidence estimates.
9.3 Protocol Deviations
The following protocol deviations will be identified as major protocol deviations:
overall IMP compliance less than 80%
not taking the randomized I MP
taking prohibited medication s
The final definition of major and minor protocol violations will be determined prior to breaking the 
trialblind.  
The number and percentage of subjects with major protocol deviations will be summari zed.

A ‘pre -treatment’ AE will be defined as an AE that occurs between screening and the first dose of 
the IMP. A ‘treatment -emergent AE (TEAE)’ will be an AE that occurs in the time interval from 
initial dosing (IMP intake) to the end o f treatment visit. If an AE on Day 1 occurs before IMP 
intake, it will be recorded as a pre -treatment AE.

10.1 Source Data and Source Documents
Source Data – International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH )Definition
Source data are defined as all information in original records and certified copies of original records 
of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary  for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copies).
Sourc e Documents -ICH Definition
Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records (e.g. , hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory  notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy  dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions 
certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy , at the labora tories and at 
medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial).
Trial -specific Source Data Requirements – Ferring
The investigator must maintain subject records, including as a minimum: medical history ;data on 
the condition of the subject at t he time the subject is enrolled into the trial in order to document 
(and enable verification of) subject eligibility ;diagnosis ; subject’s participation in trial; subject’s 
trial identification ; date of informed consent and time, if applicable, for the trial ;visit dates and 
results of examinations and tests performed, especially
 results of examinations related to primary  
endpoints; details of I MP administration ;details of AE s, concomitant medication, and of an y 
follow -up and analy sis/tests/examinations done ; and reason for subject withdrawal from the trial.
10.2 eCRF
An eCRF s ystem provided by  an independent, third- party Contract Research Organization (CRO) 
will be used for data capture. The s ystem is validated and access at all levels to the sy stem is 
granted/ revoked following Ferring and vendor procedures, in accordance with regulatory  and 
system requirements.
The eCRF s ystem and the database will be hosted at the independent, third- party CRO. After the 
trial database is declared clean and released to the statistician, a final copy  of the database will be 
stored at Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S located in DK -2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark, within the 
SAS Drug Development sy stem . The investigator will also receive a cop y of the trial site’s final 
and locked data (including audit trail, electronic signature and queries) as write -protected PDF files 
produced b
y the indepe ndent, third -party CRO. The PDF files will be stored on a CD and will be 
provided to the investigator before access to the eCRF is revoked. The Investigator will 
approve/authorise the eCRF entries for each subject with an electronic signature which equals a 
handwritten signature. Trial data will be entered into the sy stem in a timely  manner.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL11 MONITORING PROCEDURES
11.1 Periodic Monitoring
The monitor will contact and visit the investigator periodicall y to ensure adherence to the protocol, 
ICH-Good Clinical Practice (ICH- GCP), standard operating procedures and applicable regulatory  
requirements, maintenance of trial- related source records, c ompleteness, accuracy  and verifiability  
of eCRF entries compared to source data, verification of drug accountability , and compliance with 
safet y reporting instructions. 
The investigator will permit the monitor direct access to all source data, including electronic 
medical records, and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification. The investigator will 
cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may  be identified are resolved. The 
investigator is expected to meet the monitor during these visits. 
When the first subject is randomized at the trial site, a monitoring visit will take place shortly  
thereafter . For this trial, the frequency  of the in terim monitoring visits will be determined b y the 
enrollment rate and will be detailed in the monitoring plan .
11.2 Audit and Inspection
The investigator will make all the trial -related source data and records available at any  time to 
quality  assurance auditor( s) mandated b y Ferring or to domestic/foreign regulatory  inspectors or 
representatives from IEC (s)/IRB(s)who may  audit/inspect the trial. The main purposes of an audit 
or inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the principles of I CH-GCP ,
including the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations.
The subjects must be informed by  the investigator and in the informed consent documents that 
authorized Ferring representatives and representatives from regulatory  authorities and 
IEC(s)/IRB(s)may wish to inspect their medical records. During audits/inspections ,the 
auditors/inspectors may  copy  relevant parts of the medical records. No personal identification other 
than the screening/ randomization number will appear on these c opies.
The investigator should notify  Ferring without any delay  of an y inspection by a regulatory authority 
or IEC/I RB.
11.3 Confidentiality of Subject Data
The investigator will ensure that the confidentiality  of the subjects’ data will be preserved. In the 
eCRF or an y other documents submitted to Ferring, the subjects will not be identified b y their 
names, but by  an identification sy stem thatconsists of an assigned number in the trial. Documents 
that are not for submission to Ferring, e.g., the confidential subject identification code and the 
signed informed consent documents will be maintained b y the investigator in strict confidence.

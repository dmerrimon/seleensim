LY2062430  2. Synopsis  
Study Rationale  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age -related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
progressive decline in cognitive function and the ability to perform activities of daily living , 
ultimately resulting in dementia with fatal complications .  The amyloid hypothesis of AD 
postulates that the accumulation  of amyloid - peptide  (A) is an early and necessary event in the 
pathogenesis of AD.  This hypothesis suggests that treatments that slow the accumulation of A 
in the brain  or increase clearance of A  may be able to slo w the progression of the AD clinical 
syndrome.  
Converging evidence from both genetic at -risk and age at -risk cohorts suggests that the 
pathophy siological process of AD begins well more than a decade before the  clinical stage now 
recognized as AD dementia , and that neurodegeneration is already apparent by the stage of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI)/prodromal AD .  Recent c linical trial results in mild -to-moderate AD 
dementia, as well as evidence from transgenic animal experiments, suggest that earlier 
interv ention may be most beneficial to fully impact the clinical progression of the disease , 
particularly with therapies targeted at  Aβ reduction.  
Data from autopsy cohorts and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography 
(PET) scan amyloid imaging  studies demonstrate that approximately 30% of individuals over the 
age of 65 have evidence of amyloid pathology.  Clinically “normal” older individuals with 
biomarker evidence of elevated amyloid pathology demonstrate AD -like abnormalities on 
functional a nd structural imaging, perform less well on cognitive test s compared to 
amyloid -negative older individuals , are more likely to report subjective memory concerns, and 
are at increased risk for cognitive decline and progression to MCI and AD .  Recent academi c 
consensus workgroups focused on developing guidelines for earlier diagnosis of AD and 
research diagnostic criteria have defined a stage of “preclinical AD ,” based on biomarker 
evidence of AD pathology before the stage of clinically evident symptoms of co gnitive 
impairment.  
The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease “ A4” study is a Phase 3, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled study in subjects with preclinical AD .  The A4 trial preclinical 
AD study population will be defined as subjects with evidence of brain amyloid pathology on 
PET amyloid imaging who are still clinically normal but at high risk for cognitive decline .  The 
A4 study is designed to test the hypoth esis that solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds 
A, will slow decline on a cognitive composite measure designed to be sensitive to early decline 
in the preclinical stages of AD.  This study will collect additional data on the long -term safety 
and e fficacy of solanezumab, including computerized cognitive outcomes, as well as self and 
study partner reports of daily -life cognitive function  outcomes, a brief resource utilization 
inventory , and biomarker and imaging measures .

LY2062430  Clinical Protocol Synopsis:   Study H8A -MC-LZAZ (A4 Study)  
Name of Investigational Product:   Solanezumab (LY2062430)  
Title of Study:   Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease (A4 ) Study  
Phase of Development :  3 
Study Design:   This is a m ulticenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study comparing 
solanezumab with placebo given as infusions once every 4 weeks over 4.5 years  in approximately 1150  subjects 
with preclin ical AD, defined as having evidence of elevated brain  amyloid pathology before the stage of clinically 
evident  cognitive impairment , with an optional open -label  extension  period . 
Objectives:   The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that solanezumab, administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for 4.5 years, will slow cognitive decline as compared with placebo in 
subjects with preclinical AD.  The primary objective will be assessed using a  natural cubic spline  (NCS ) analysis 
of the pri mary outcome measure, the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite ( PACC), a composite that is 
primarily  weighted on episodic memory and executive function tests, in which the specific hypothesis is that the 
cogni tive decline at Week  240 will be significantly less for solanezumab than for pla cebo.  
The secondary objectives of the placebo -controlled period of the study are:  
 To test the hypothesis that solanezumab  will slow the decline of perceived cognitive function and 
performance of everyday activities, as compared with placebo, using an NCS analysis of the Cognitive 
Function Index (CFI).  
 To assess whether decline in activities of daily living begins by the end of the treatment period, and if so, 
whether an effect of solanezumab, compared with placebo, can be detected using an NCS analysis of the 
ADCS -Activities of Daily Living  (ADCS -ADL) Prevention Questionnaire . 
 To assess the relationship between treatment  effect and time using the PACC.  
 To test the hypothesis that solanezumab reduces brain amyloid burden, as compared with placebo, as 
assesse d using florbetapir PET imaging.  
 To assess effects of solanezumab on CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphorylated  tau. 
 To assess effects of solanezumab on CSF concentrations of  Aβ 
 To investigate the effect of treatment with solanezumab on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI ). 
 To assess the safety of solanezumab versus placebo treatment including adverse events (AEs) and 
immunogenicity.  
The secondary objectives of the open -label  period of the study are:  
 To assess the persistence of effect of solanezumab treatment in participants with preclinical AD .  That is , 
to test the hypothesis that patients originally randomized to receive placebo and later switched to 
solanezumab at the start of the open -label  period do not “catch up” to patients originally  randomized to 
receive solanezumab in the placebo -controlled  period, using a randomized/delayed -start analysis.  The 
main efficacy objective of the open -label  period will be an interim randomized/delayed -start analysis of 
the PACC.  
 To test the hypothesis t hat solanezumab will continue to slow the decline associated with preclinical AD 
during open -label  treatment, comparing participants initially randomized to solanezumab with participants 
initially randomized to placebo in the double -blind treatment period,  using randomized/delayed -start 
analysis  of the Mini -Mental State Examination ( MMSE ), Clinical Dementia Rating -Sum of Boxes 
(CDR -SB), Computerized Cognitive Composite ( C3), CFI, and the ADCS -ADL Prevention 
Questionnaire .

LY2062430  The exploratory  objectives of the study are:  
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated using the MMSE.  
 To assess the utility of a novel computerized battery, the C3, in predicting and tracking clinical decline 
and response to solanezumab.  
 To asse ss the effects of treatment on healthcare resource utilization.  
 To determine the best predictors of clinical decline based on the PACC . 
 To develop novel sensitive outcome measures to improve the efficiency of future secondary prevention 
trials , including e xploratory measures of self -reported assessment of cognitive and interpersonal 
functioning  
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated using the CDR scale.  
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated using the C-Path Consortium’s 
Participant -Reported Outcome Questionnaire (C -Path PRO) . 
 To investigate the impact of solanezumab on markers of synaptic dysfunction on functional connectivity 
MRI.  
 To assess solanezumab -associated changes in levels of plasma Aβ species  and CSF Aβ species.  The 
hypothesis that solanezumab, unlike placebo, alters amyloid -plaque associated forms of Aβ will be 
assessed by 1) demonstrating presence of plaque -associated Aβ species in the plasma, and 2) confirming 
that concentrations of CSF -free (unbound to antibody) Aβ 1-42 are increased or unchanged and CSF -free 
Aβ 1-40 levels are decreased with solanezumab treatment.  
 To explore whether baseline markers of neurodegenerati on (volumetric MRI or CSF tau or P-tau or 
plasma P -tau) are related to  cognitive decline and response to treatment with solanezumab . 
 To explore the impact of disclosure of amyloid status on questionnaires probing perception of amyloid 
imaging and concern about developing AD.  
 To explore biomarker assessments collected at base line and at the end of the placebo -controlled period as 
potential predictors of treatment effect during the open -label period.  
 To assess preclinical AD during open -label  treatment  by comparing participants initially randomized to 
solanezumab  in the placebo -controlled  period  with participants initially randomized to placebo in the 
double -blind treatment period, using randomized/delayed -start analysis  of the Resource Use Inventory, 
Brief version ( RUI-B). 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusio ns:  Subjects will be males and females 65 to 85 years 
old with preclinical AD, defined as having an MMSE score between  25 and 30 , a Logical Memory test, part IIa 
score between  6 and 18 , and a global CDR of 0; and having screening florbetapir PET scan indicating brain 
amyloid pathology.   Subjects will be excluded if they have a screening MRI with results that show >4 ARIA -H or 
any ARIA -E, have any major or unstable illness, including unstable ischemic cardiovascular disease, or require use 
of excluded m edications.  
Number of Planned Subjects:   Approximately 1150  (575 solanezumab, 575 placebo ). 
Dose and Mode of Administration:   The study was initiated with s olanezumab 400 mg  or placebo, administered 
as an IV infusion once every 4 weeks.   Partway through the study, the dose was increased to 1600  mg every 
4 weeks.  Subjects will receive 400  mg solanezumab or placebo via IV infusion every 4  weeks for at least 2  doses, 
followed by 800  mg every 4  weeks for at least 2  doses, and then 1600  mg every 4  weeks until the conclusion of the 
study . 
Planned Duration of Treatment:    
Screening period:  Up to 90 days  
Placebo -controlled t reatment period:  240 weeks  
Open -label  treatment period:  Up to 204 weeks

LY2062430  Criteria for Evaluation:    
Efficacy :  PACC , MMSE, ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire , CDR -SB, CFI, C3 (including the C -Path PRO 
and the Memory Complaint Questionnaire), and the RUI-B. 
Disclosure of Amyloid Status :  Perception of amyloid imaging as well as impact of disclosure will be assessed 
using  the Views and Perceptions of Amyloid Imaging  Questionnaire , the Concerns about Alzheimer’s Disease 
Questionnaire, the Impact of Events Scale, and the Future Time Perspective Scale.  
Biomarkers and Imaging:   Plasma solanezumab and Aβ isoforms concentrations  and serum  anti-solanezumab 
antibodies (immunogenicity) will be measured from processed blood samples using validated immunoassay and/or 
mass spec trometry  methods.  Solanezumab treatment effects will be determined by measuring CSF A β isoforms 
and tau prote ins in those subjects who undergo lumbar puncture and by analyzing amyloid burden on PET scans, as 
well as volumetric and functional MRI metrics.  
Pharmacokinetics :  Observed concentrations will be graphically compared to model predicted concentrations.  The 
impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics (PK) will be investigated graphically.  Population PK and 
association with efficacy, biomarkers, and safety paramete rs may be reported.  
Safety :  Safety assessments will include routine physical and neurological examinations, AEs, vital signs  
(including temperature and  weight ), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) , and laboratory evaluations, including 
immunogenicity directed  towards solanezumab.  In addition,  the Assessment of Psychological Well Being will be 
used to monitor for anxiety and depression .  Suicide -related thoughts and behaviors will be evaluated using  the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS ).  Two typ es of amyloid -related imaging abnormalit ies 
(ARIA) —hemo siderin deposition  (ARIA -H, also known as microhemorrhage) and edema/effusions (ARIA -E, also 
known as vasogenic edema)  will also be assessed through scheduled MRIs.

LY2062430  Statistical Methods:    
General Cons iderations :  All analyses will follow the  intent -to-treat (ITT) principle unless otherwise specified.  
When change from baseline is assessed, subjects will be included in the analysis only if both a baseline and a 
postbaseline measure are available  (referred to as a modified ITT approach) .  Unless otherwise noted, all tests of 
treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of  0.05; 2 -sided confidence  intervals will be displayed 
with a 95% confidence level.   All tests of interactions be tween treatment and  other factors will be conducted at an 
alpha level of 0.05.  
Primary Analysis :  The prima ry endpoint of this study, PACC, will be analyzed using an NCS analysis.    
The original modified intent -to-treat (mITT ) analysis (that is, all participants as randomized to treatment who have 
a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measure) for the primary outcome will be retained and conducted at the end 
of the treatment period, although the dose will be increased during t he study; in other words, the primary analysis 
will include all data for the solanezumab group as the treatment group versus  placebo.  As with the original 
analysis plan, the hypothesis for this analysis will be tested against an alpha level of .05.  
The ch ange from baseline score at each visit when the composite score is assessed will be the dependent variable.  
Visit will be considered a categorical variable with values equal to the visit numbers at which the measure was 
scheduled .  The null hypothesis is that the treatment difference between the solanezumab group versus p lacebo at 
Week 240 equals zero.  
Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints :  Change from baseline will be assessed using NCS analyses  for the MMSE, 
CFI, ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire , CDR -SB, and C3.  Analysis will also be done on the RUI-B which 
will be used to assess health care resource utilization over the course of the study .  If a gatekeeping strategy is used 
for hypothesis testing involving a subset of efficacy endpoints , this strategy will be prespecified in the statistical 
analysis plan prior to database lock .  Additional subgroup analyses will be performed.  Imaging variables including 
PET amyloid imaging  and volumetric and functional MRI will be analyzed using both region of  interest methods 
and whole brain analyses.  Analyses of plasma Aβ and CS F biomarkers will be performed.   Additional sensitivity 
analyses will be performed to explore the effect of increasing the dose from 400  mg to 1600  mg partway through 
the study .  Thes e sensitivity analyses will include analyses conducted on the PACC and other clinical measures 
after censori ng all observations after the study -wide dose increase , and analyses  to estimate the potential 
differences in the treatment effect for the original dose and the higher dose by modeling the effects of a time -
varying dose indicator variable.  
Randomized/Delayed -Start Analysis :  The PACC , MMSE, CDR -SB, C3, CFI, and the ADCS -ADL Prevention 
Questionnaire  will be analyzed  to investigate the long -term effect of anti -amyloid treatment on cognitive decline in 
preclinical AD .  If the primary A4 results in the placebo -controlled period are positive, disease -modifying effects 
will be assessed  using a noninferiority hypothesis in an MMRM model, in which the specific  hypothesis is that the 
advantage of solanezumab treatment demonstrated in the placebo -controlled  period is sufficiently maintained in the 
open -label  period.  This randomized/delayed -start analysis will assess whether solanezumab has a persistent effect 
on disease course . 
Safety :  Safety will be assessed by summarizing AEs, laboratory analytes, vital signs  (including temperature and 
weight ), ECGs, MRIs, C -SSRS , immunogenicity, and Assessment of Psychological Well Being results.   
Comparisons will be made between the treatment groups.   Safety analyses of the open -label extension will span 
across both the placebo -controlled study period and the open -label study period in order to be able to compare 
early -start safety risks to early -start efficacy benefits.

Disease (A4 Study)  
5. Introduction  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age -related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a 
progressive decline in cognitive function and the ability to perform activities of daily living.  
Converging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins more than a 
decade before the  clinical stage now recognized as AD dementia ( Sperling et al. 2011a; Bateman 
et al. 2012; Villemagne  et al. 2013 ).  Even by the stage of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI)/prodromal AD, the neurodegeneration of AD is thought to be well established ( Gόmez-
Isla et al . 1996; Jack et al . 2010 ).  Clinical trial results in mild -to-moderate AD dementia, as well 
as evidence from transgenic animal experiments, suggest that earlier intervention may be needed 
to slow the progression of the clinical course of AD, particularly with therapies designed to 
decrease  amyloid - (Aβ) (Sperling et al. 2011b ).  Academic consensus  workgroups focused on 
developing guidelines for earlier diagnosis of AD and research diagnostic criteria have defined a 
stage of preclinical AD, based on biomarker evidence of AD pathology , before the stage of 
clinically evident cognitive impairment ( Dubo is et al. 2010 ; Sperling et al. 2011a ).  Recent 
evidence suggests that older individuals with biomarker evidence of brain amyloid accumulation 
demonstrate structural and functional imaging abnormalities consistent with those seen in AD 
dementia ( Hedden et al. 2009 ; Sperling et al. 2009 ; Schott et al. 2010 ; Chételat et al. 2012 ; 
Andrews et al. 2013 ).  Individuals with evidence of elevated brain amyloid (amyloid -positive) 
perform less well on cognitive tests compared to those without evidence of brain amyloid  
accumulation (amyloid -negative) and are at increased  risk for cognitive decline and progression 
to MCI and AD ( Morris et al. 2009; Rentz et al. 2010; Knopman et al. 2012; Lim et al. 2012a,  
2012 b, 2013; Ellis et al. 2013; Sperling et al. 2013 ; Vos et al. 2 013; Petersen et al . 2016 ; 
Donohue et al. 2017; Mormino et al. 2017 ). 
Alzheimer’s disease  has evolved to become conceptualized as a continuum of disease 
(Figure  A4.1).  The preclinical stage of AD is postulated to begin with an asymptomatic stage of 
accumulating brain pathology followed by very subtle cognitive decline, which can be detected 
with sensitiv e neuropsychological tests and cognitive complaint measures (Sperling et al . 2011a).

Abbreviation:  MCI = mild cognitive impairment.

Individuals in the precl inical stage of AD have evidence of amyloid pathology and often early 
signs of neurodegeneration (elevated cerebrospinal fluid [ CSF] tau, mild cortical thinning) but do 
not yet have widespread, irreversible neuronal loss.  This preclinical stage of AD may precede 
MCI by several years and represents an important stage for potential early intervention aimed at 
slowing the pathophysiological process and delaying the appearance of readily appreciated 
clinical manifestations of AD.  
In this context, a study in preclinical AD titled Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD 
(the “A4” study ) was designed and initiated by a collaboration between the Alzheimer Disease 
Cooperative Study (ADCS) and Lilly .  This large, multicenter, placebo -controlled study with an 
approx imately 4.5-year treatment duration is now enroll ing older individuals with evidence of 
brain amyloid  pathology  who are still clinically normal but performing in the lower end of the 
clinically normal range on memory measures and are at particularly high r isk for cognitive 
decline.   Partway through the study, the study management activities  of the ADCS were shifted 
to the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research  Institute (ATRI) , which serves as the Coordinating 
Center .  Some aspects of the study will involve conti nued collaboration between the ADCS, 
ATRI, and Lilly.  
Before initiation of the A4 study , the ADCS independently  evaluated several investigational anti-
Aβ antibodies as candidates for the study, and ultimately chose  solanezumab  based on its safety 
profile a nd cognitive effects in mild AD observed in the Phase 3 studies.  The A4  study is funded 
by Lilly, the National Institutes of Health,  and multiple philanthropic organizations.  The A4 
study is being  conducted under Lilly’s IND 11,631 for solanezumab (FDA c orrespondence, 
19 March 2013); thus Lilly is the regulatory sponsor.  The overall goal of the study is to test the

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  hypothesis that targeting  Aβ in the preclinical stage of AD will slow the pathophysiological 
process and cognitive decline  in the preclinical stages of AD, thus affecting the clinical course of 
the disease . 
Solanezumab is a humanized anti -Aβ peptide immunoglobulin G -1 (IgG) monoclonal antibody.  
The murine anti -Aβ monoclonal antibody from which solanezumab was derived is known as 
m266.2.  These antibodies recognize a mid -domain epito pe of the Aβ peptide (amino acid 
residues 16 -25).  Solanezumab was designed with the intent to increase central nerv ous system 
clearance of Aβ, slow or reverse Aβ deposition in brain parenchyma, and with chronic treatment, 
potentially slow the progression of AD.  
The clinical development program for solanezumab includes the completed  Phase 3 Studies 
H8A -MC-LZAM (LZAM) an d H8A -MC-LZAN (LZAN), also known as EXPEDITION and 
EXPEDITION2, respectively,  which compared  400 mg of solanezumab intravenously every 
4 weeks  (400 mg Q4W) and placebo treatments for 18  months in subjects with mild -to-moderate 
AD, as well as the concluded  Phase 3 open -label extension Study H8A -MC-LZAO (LZAO) in 
which all subjects are treated with solanezumab.   Although primary objectives were not met in 
either Study LZAM or LZAN, prespecified secondary analyses strongly suggested cognitive 
effects in the mild AD population using pooled data from the 2 studies.  
Based on these Phase 3 results  and discussions with FDA , an additional Phase 3 study of 
solanezumab 400 mg Q4W  in patients with mild AD  and evidence of amyloid pathology , Study 
H8A -MC-LZAX  (LZAX), wa s conducted .  The primary endpoint was not met in the concluded 
placebo -controlled period of Study LZAX.  Subject s treated with solanezumab 400 mg Q4W  did 
not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared with subject s 
treate d with placebo (p=.095), as measured by the 14 -item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment 
Scale -Cognitive subscale (ADAS -Cog 14).  The study results directionally favored solanezumab, 
but the magnitude of the treatment difference was small.   Several secondary anal yses, including 
the Clinical Dementia Rating —Sum of Boxes score (CDR -SB), ADCS -iADL, and Mini -Mental 
State Examination ( MMSE ), showed  small , nominally statistically significant benefits of 
solanezumab.  
To date, no safety issues have been identified that would create an unfavorable benefit -risk 
balance for solanezumab.  Few differences in the incidence of deaths, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), discontinuations due to  adverse events  (AEs), treatment -emerge nt adverse events 
(TEA Es), laboratory values, electrocardiograms (ECGs), treatment -emergent immunogenicity, 
treatment -emergent changes in amyloid -related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) , and infusion 
reactions were observed between placebo - and solanezumab -treated subjects in the Phase 3 
studies.   In Studies  LZAM and LZAN , a potential safety signal was identified for a 
heterogeneous set of cardiac -related events  that included atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and 
angina pectoris, reported in more than 1% but less than 2% of patients.   The cardiac safety  signal 
was not confirmed in Study LZAX and therefore is no  longer  considered a potential risk with 
solanezumab treatment.  As measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), 
suicidal ideation and behaviors were infrequent, but a greater prevalence  was observed among 
solanezumab - compared with placebo -treated mild AD dementia patients in Study LZAX.  This

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  safety signal has not been observed in other solanezumab studie s.  At this time, it cannot be 
determined whether the imbalance observed in Study LZAX is causally related to solanezumab 
treatment.  This safety signal will continue to be assessed in the ongoing A4 study.   More details 
are available in the Investigator’s  Brochure (IB). 
As described in the IB, 2 types of ARIA —hemosiderin deposition (ARIA -H, also known as 
cerebral microhemorrhage) and edema/effusions (ARIA -E, also known as vasogenic edema)  and 
serious hypersensitivity reactions (immediate and nonimmediate) including anaphylaxis and 
infusion -related reactions —have been identified as potential risks for Aβ -based AD therapies.  
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans  and AEs will be obtained in this study to assess these 
potential risk s. 
Study H8A -MC-LZAZ (LZAZ) , or the A4 study  (“Anti -Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic 
AD”),  will test the hypothesis that treatment with solanezumab administered as an intravenous  
(IV) infusion every 4 weeks will slow cognitive decline  in preclinical AD as compared with 
placebo.   This study will include the use of biomarkers to assess the impact of treatment with 
solanezumab on biomarkers of AD pathology.   The A 4 Study  was initially designed with a dose 
of 400  mg solanezumab given by IV infusion ever y 4 weeks over a period of appr oximately 
3 years.  Based on the new efficacy and safety results from Study LZAX described above, as 
well as safety and biomarker results with higher doses of solanezumab in Phase  1 and 2 studies, 
the solanezumab dose in the A4 Study  was escalated to 1600  mg Q4W  (Section  9.4).  In 
addition, the duration of treatment was increased to approximately 4.5  years, based on new 
information regarding the rate  of amyloid -related decline among clinically normal older 
individuals over time from ongoing observational studies  (Section  7.2). 
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs 
of solanezumab may be found in the IB.   Information on AEs expected to be related to the 
investigational product may be found in Section 7 (Development Core Safety Information) of  the 
IB.  Information on SAEs expected in the study population independent of drug exposure will be 
assessed in aggregate, periodically during the course of the study, may be found in Section 6 
(Effects in Humans) of the IB.

6.1. Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that solanezumab, administered as an 
IV infusion every 4 weeks for 4.5 years , will slow cognitive decline as compared with placebo in 
subjects with  preclinical AD. The primary objective will be assessed using a constrained 
longitudinal  data analysis (cLDA) natural cubic spline (NCS ) analysis (referred to as NCS 
henceforth)  of the primary outcome measure, the Preclinical Alzh eimer Cognitive Composite 
(PACC), a composi te that is primarily weighted on  episodic memory and executive function 
tests, in which the specific hypothesis is that the cognitive decline at Week  240 will be 
significantly less for solanezumab than for placebo.

The secondary objectives of the  placebo -controlled period of the  study are as follows:  
 To test the hypothesis that solanezumab will slow the decline of perceived  
cognitive function and performance of everyday activities, as compared with 
placebo, using an NCS  analysis o f the Cognitive Function Index ( CFI). 
 To assess whether decline in activities of daily living begins by the end of the 
treatment period, and if so, whether an effect of solanezumab, compared with 
placebo, can be detected using an NCS  analysis of the ADCS -Activities of 
Daily Living  (ADL) Prevention Questionnaire . 
 To assess the relationship between treatment effect and time using the PACC . 
 To test the hypothesis that solanezumab reduces brain amyloid burden, as 
compared with placebo, as assessed using florbet apir positron emission 
tomography ( PET) imaging.  
 To assess effects of solanezumab on CSF and plasma concentrations of total 
tau peptides and phosphorylated  tau peptides  (P-tau). 
 To assess effects of solanezumab on CSF concentrations of Aβ.  
 To investigate t he effect of treatment with solanezumab on volumetric MRI.  
 To assess the safety of solanezumab versus placebo treatment , including AEs 
and immunogenicity.  
The secondary objectives of the open -label period of the study are as follows:  
 To assess the persistence of effect of solanezumab treatment in participants 
with preclinical AD.  That is, to test the hypothesis that patients originally 
randomized to receive placebo and later switched to solanezumab at the start 
of the open -label perio d do not “catch up” to patients originally randomized to 
receive solanezumab in the placebo -controlled period, using a 
randomized/delayed -start analysis.  The main efficacy objective of the

LY2062430  open -label period will be an interim randomized/delayed -start anal ysis of the 
PACC.  
 To test the hypothesis that solanezumab will continue to slow the decline 
associated with preclinical AD during open -label  treatment, comparing 
participants initially randomized to solanezumab with participants initially 
randomized to pla cebo in the double -blind treatment period, using 
randomized/delayed -start analysis of the MMSE, CDR -SB, C3, CFI, and the 
ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire.  
6.3. Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives of the study are follows:  
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated using the 
MMSE . 
 To assess the utility of a novel computerized battery, the Computerized 
Cognitive Composite (C3),  in predicting and tracking clinical decline and 
response to solanezumab.  
 To assess the effects of t reatment on healthcare  resource utilization.  
 To determine the best predictors of clinical decline based on the PACC . 
 To develop novel sensitive outcome measures to improve the efficiency of 
future secondary prevention trials, includi ng exploratory measures  of 
self-reported assessment of cognitive and interpersonal functioning . 
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated using the 
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR ) scale. 
 To assess the effect of treatment with solanezumab as demonstrated u sing the 
C-Path Consortium’s Participant -Reported Outcome Questionnaire ( C-Path 
PRO ). 
 To investigate the impact of solanezumab on markers of synaptic dysfunction 
on functional connectivity MRI . 
 To assess solanezumab -associated changes in levels of plasma A β species and 
CSF Aβ species.  The hypothesis that solanezumab, unlike placebo, alters 
amyloid -plaque associated forms of Aβ will be assessed by 1) demonstrating 
presence of plaque -associated Aβ species in the plasma, and 2) confirming 
that concentrations of CSF free (unbound to antibody) Aβ 1-42 are increased or 
unchanged and CSF free Aβ 1-40 levels are decreased with solanezumab 
treatment.  
 To explore whether baseline markers of neurodegenerati on (volumetric MRI 
or CSF tau or p -tau) are related to cognitive decline and response to treatment 
with solanezumab.  
 To explore the impact of disclosure of amyloid status on questionnaires 
probing perception of amyloid imaging and concern about developing AD .

7.1. Summary of Study Desig n 
The A4 Study  is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study 
comparing solanezumab with placebo for 240 weeks in approximately 1150 subjects ages 65 to 
85 years old with preclinical AD, defined as having evidence of brain am yloid pathology without 
clinically evident cognitive impairment at screening.  Subjects who meet entry criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 575 per treatment arm) to solanezumab or placebo  once 
every 4  weeks .  Subjects will be randomized  at the site  by education – high (13 or more years) or 
low (12 or less years) and the presence of one or more apolipoprotein E gene ( APOE ) 4 alleles 
(yes, no).  The primary hypothesis being tested is that the cognitive decline at the end of the 
treatment phase will be significantly less for solanezumab than for placebo.   Subjects  completing 
the placebo -controlled  period of the study can opt to participate in the open -label  period of the 
study that will last for up to 204 weeks or until the primar y analyses of the placebo -controlled 
period of the study are completed and reviewed .

7.1.1.  Prescreening  
During the prescreen phase , potential subjects will be identified and assessed to determine if they 
may potentially qualify for the A4 study followin g the site’s standard practice.  
7.1.2.  Screening Phase (Visits 1 to 5)  
The entire screening period spans the time from Visit 1 to Visit 5.  Study assessments are shown 
in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).

LY2062430  Up to 90 days are permitted to allow for completion of all screening procedures, assessments, Aβ 
status disclosure, and evaluation of results from laboratory tests, ECGs, PET imaging, MRI, and 
optional lumbar puncture (LP).   A central read of the MRI sh ould be completed before an LP is 
performed.   
The subject can only pro ceed to baseline (Visit 6) once all  screening procedures as described in 
the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ) are complete d and the investigator or qualified designee and 
clinical monitor have confirmed that the subject is eligible to be randomized . 
Current or planned use of concomitant medications, the effects of vacations or absence s on 
protocol compliance, and general compliance with the protocol will be discussed during the 
screening phase.  Subjects who do not meet all inclusion criteria or who meet any exclusion 
criteria will not be allowed to participate  in the study.  
7.1.2.1.  Initial Sc reening Visit (Visit 1)  
At or before the first screening visit (Visit 1) , the full A4  study will be explained to the subject  
and study partner .  Informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA ) authorization must be obtained from the subject before any study procedures  are 
conducted.  
All subjects will be educated about amyloid imaging as part of the recruitment and informed 
consent process.  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) an d psychological 
well-being questionnaires will be administered.  This information will be used to help the 
clinician determine whether or not a subject is psychologically able to participate further in the 
study and to provide a pretest baseline for predisclosure comparison on these measures.  
Additionally, questionnaires to explore subjects’ views and perceptions of amyloid imaging, 
concerns about AD, and perception of time will be administered.  
During the initial screening visit (Visit 1) , the MMSE, Logic al Memory test part IIa ( LMIIa ), and 
CDR will be administered in order to determine the subject’s general eligibility for the study.   
Safety measures will be collected to further ensure the subject meets eligibility criteria:  medical 
history /concurrent me dications are reviewed,  and physical/ neurological exam, ECG s, and vital 
signs will be collected.  A  blood draw  and urinalysis  for screening labs, genotyping , and 
biomarker samples  will be performe d.  Screening labs results must be reviewed by the 
investiga tor or qualified designee for assessment of the subject’s eligibility.  
For a complete list of all Visit 1 procedures, please refer to the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  
Procedures for Visit 1 may be completed over multiple days but all Visit 1 procedures must be 
completed before the subject can proceed to the screening florbetapir PET scan (Visit 2).  
7.1.2.2.  Scre ening Florbetapir PET Scan (Visit 2)  
A florbetapir PET scan will be performed for eligibility purposes during the screening phase .  In 
order to best identify a population that is at risk of decline, a centr alized PET lab will be used to 
determine eligibili ty for the study based on both visual and quantitative metrics for elevated 
amyloid burden . 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT

LY2062430  Information regarding study eligibility for each subject will be conveyed to the site principal 
investigator.  All subjects will be scheduled for an in -clinic visit  to disclose the flor betapi r PET 
scan results  (Section  7.1.2.3 ). 
Specific instructions for the florbetapir PET scan will be pro vided in the Technica l Operations 
Manual.  
7.1.2.3.  Amyloid Status Disclosure (Visit 3)  
The C3 and C -Path PRO will be administered at this visit prior to disclosure.   The C3 will be 
optional  in Japan.  
All subjects that undergo a florbetapir PET scan will have their  results disclosed during an 
in-clinic visit  with a clinical investigator approved for this role by the Coordinating Center .  
Study partner attendance is not required, but may be permitted if the subject desires.  Each 
subject’s concern about developing AD  and his/her views and perceptions of amyloid imaging, 
as well as perception of time, will be assessed via questionnaires after the disclosure.  
Lastly, the Impact of Events Scale (IES) will be administered over the phone within 3 business 
days following the amyloid status disclosure visit.  
For a complete list of all Visit 3 procedures, please refer to the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). 
Subjects who meet florbetapir PET entry criteria will proceed to the next visit per the study 
schedule.  
7.1.2.4.  Screening MRI Scan  (Visit 4)  
All subjects who have elevated amyloid  as determined by the screening florbetapir PET scan and 
wish to, and are eligible to continue in the study after the amyloid eligibility disclosure visit will 
proceed to the MRI visit.  
There are core magnetic resonance sequences required for all subjects to determine eligibility for 
the study and to acquire baseline volumetric and functional data for subsequent comparison.  
There are additional magnetic resonance sequences that will be acquired depending on scanner 
type.  
Sites must submit the MRI scan without patient identifiable information to the Coordinating 
Center  in a timely fashion (preferably within 24 hours) after  acquisition to facilitate central read . 
A central read will be conducted to assist in determining eligibility for the study on the basis of 
MRI findings, particularly the presence of microhemorrhages.  In instances where more  than 
4 microhemorrhages  or any ARIA -E are identified, the scan will be flagged for review and the 
subject will be deemed ineligible for the study.  Other findings that are flagged during the central 
read will be reviewed by the Project Director and Medical Monitors  or designees to determine if 
the subject is eligible to continue.  For patients with mild to moderate AD, the presence of 
ARIA -E at baseline is extremely uncommon (<0.5%, Carlson et al. 2011); thus, in subjects with 
preclinical AD, the rate  of ARIA -E at b aseline is likely to be even less prevalent.

LY2062430  Eligible subjects will proceed to Visit 5 if they consented to the optional LP, otherwise they will  
proceed to baseline (Visit 6).  
For a complete list of all Visit 4 procedures, please refer to the Study Schedul e (Attachment 1 ). 
Specific instructions for the screening MRI scan will be provided in the relevant procedures 
manual.  
7.1.2.5.  Optional Lumbar Puncture (Visit 5)  
The optional LP study is available only in the US , Canada , and Japan .  Subjects who consent to 
the optional LP will have a n LP performed at Visit 5.  M agnetic resonance imaging , and central 
read of the MRI,  should occur prior to LP.  
Failure to perform an LP or obtain CSF will not constitute a protocol violat ion. 
Specific instructions for the LP will be provided in the relevant procedures manual.  
7.1.3.  Placebo -Controlled Period (Visits 6 to 66) 
The placebo -controlled  period is a double -blind treatment phase beginning at baseline (Visit 6).  
Subjects who meet entry c riteria will be enrolled and randomized to receive either solanezumab 
or placebo once every 4 weeks administered on site as an IV infusion .  Subjects should be 
observed for approximately 1 hour following the first infusion of study drug .  Infusions will be  
administered  and assessments will be performed according to the Study Schedule ( Attachment 
1).  Procedures for some visits may take more than 1 da y.  At the following visits  (known as 
“infusion -only” visits) , the only scheduled procedures are administration of the infusion and 
collection of AEs and concomitant medications :  Visits 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 
23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32,  34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47 , 49, 40, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 
62, 64, and 65 . 
All visits (in-clinic and infusions) after randomization (Visit 6) should be scheduled to occur  as 
close as possible to the target date, relative to baseline Day 1 .  A window of ±10 days will be 
permitted for all visits.  
Final assessments in the placebo -controlled period will be performed at Visit 66 (Week 240), 
4 weeks following the subject’s last dose of study medication (Week 236) in the 
placebo -controlled period.  
7.1.4.  Dose Escalation  
All subjects  will be escalated to a dose of 1600  mg Q4W  according to  amendment (d) .  After at 
least 2 infusions  of 400  mg Q4W, subjects  will be escalated to 800  mg Q4W for at least 
2 infusions , and then 1600  mg Q4W until the conclus ion of the treatment  (Section  9.1). 
At a minimum, the first  200 subjects (approximately 100 each in the solanezumab and placebo 
treatment groups)  who receive the increased dose will be included  in a dose escalation safety 
cohort  to receive additional safety assessments and monitoring  (described in Section  10.2.11 ) 
during dose escalation to monitor the safety of the higher doses .

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  Subjects who escalate dose after entry in  the dose escalation safety cohort  has been closed will 
receive safety monitoring as described  in the main Study Schedule . 
All subjects who are active in the study should be escalated to a dose of 1600  mg Q4W as 
described above.  Subjects may be permitted to delay dose escalation at the investigator’s 
discretion ; this will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
Additional site tr aining will be provided to ensure appropriate implementation of the protocol 
modifications.  
7.1.5.  Open -Label Extension  Period  
Subjects who complete the placebo -controlled period will be eligible to participate in the open -
label  extension  period .  Subjects participating in the open -label  period will  receive open -label 
solanezumab treatment for varying durations .  While all subjects will receive solanezumab 
treatment during the open -label  period, subjects, site personnel, and study teams will remain 
blinded to initial treatment assignment in the placebo -controlled period until the conclusion of 
the study.  
The open -label  period uses a common close design such that all subjects will complete the period 
at the same time:  when analyses of the placebo -controlled period are completed and reviewed.   
Given the common close design, the overall duration of treatment for each patient will differ.  If 
the study is positive, participants may be offered the opportunity to continue in the open -label 
period beyond th e common close.  Subjects  who opt to participate in the open -label  period 
should begin the open -label  period  at Visit 66 (Week 240) after completion of all V isit 66  tests 
and procedures .  However,  subjects  may enter the open -label period of the study and receive 
their first open -label infusion of study drug up to 12 weeks  following completion of the 
placebo -controlled  period Visit 66  assessments and procedures.  In extenuating circumstances, 
subjects may enter the open -label  period after 1 2 weeks with the approval of a Medical Monitor 
and/or Project Director.   See the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 ) for the timing of events and 
measures to be assessed.  Procedures for some visits may take more than 1 day.  
Subjects who cho ose not to participat e in the open -label period  will not receive any study 
medication  after the last infusion visit for the placebo -controlled period  (Week  236).  Sites must 
obtain approval from the Coordinating Center before engaging in open -label activities.  
If the open -label period is extended beyond Visit 117, partic ipants who complete Visit 117 
before implementation of the protocol amendment that includes additional visits will be allowed 
to resume study visits once available at their site.   
7.2. Discussion of Design and Control  
Study Population .  As AD is thought to represent a continuum of disease, discrete stages of AD 
will of necessity need to be operationally defined.  Entry criteria were chosen to maximize 
selection of individuals who are still considered clinically normal but who may be at hi gh risk of 
subsequent cognitive decline and the eventual onset of clinical signs and symptoms diagnostic of 
prodromal or mild AD.  Cut -points for screening memory tests will exclude individuals who are 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  performing >0.5 standard deviation  (SD)  above age - and education -adjusted normative means, as 
these individuals may be better able to compensate for imminent cognitive decline over the 
course of the study.  Instead, the study will enroll people who have memory performance down 
to 1.0 SD below education -adjust ed normative means, which overlaps the cognitive performance 
range of early MCI without meeting the definition for MCI (since CDR must be 0).  Recent 
evidence suggests that people with evidence of amyloid pathology are more likely to perform in 
the bottom of the “normal range” on sensitive neuropsychological tests and have a higher risk of 
cognitive decline and progression to MCI and AD dementia (Doraiswamy et al. 2012; Knopman 
et al. 2012; Sperling et al. 2013; Villemagne et al. 2013).  Furthermore, subjec ts are required to 
be ages 65 to 85 at the time of screening, to maximize the likelihood of identifying subjects that 
will meet the preclinical AD amyloid pathology inclusion criteria, as research in the field 
suggests that incidence/prevalence of amyloid pathology is highest in this group compared to 
those under age 65.  Measures will be in place to ensure sufficient enrollment of individuals at 
the higher end of this age range and to enroll under -represented minority populations.  
Selection of Primary Outc ome Measure.   The PACC composite measure, which comprise s the 
Total Recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), the Delayed 
Paragraph Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa test from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the 
Digit -Symbol Sub stitution test from the Wechsler Adult  Intelligence Scale -Revised, and the 
MMSE total score , was developed to be sensitive to change in preclinical AD, based on evidence 
that episodic memory, executive function, and orientation are domains that show change  early in 
the course of disease.  Several combinations of measures for these domains derived from well -
accepted clinical outcome measures were assessed using data from longitudinal studies in 
clinically normal populations, comparing patients who declined f rom normal to MCI to those 
who remained normal.  The combination of measures that showed the greatest power  was one 
that included episodic memory, timed executive function, and global measures (including 
orientation) and this combination became the PACC  (see Attachment 3  for more details).  
Study Duration.   Based on evidence from longitudinal studies  available when Study  LZAZ/A4 
was initially designed , a duration of 168 weeks (approximately 3 years)  was thought to be 
appropriate to evaluate the efficacy of solanezumab compared with placebo in slowing 
progression of preclinical AD .  However, new data regarding the amount of decline over time in 
the prec linical AD population became available from observational studies during the conduct of 
the A4 study, suggesting that extending the treatment duration may increase the likelihood of 
observing a treatment effect.  For example, data from ongoing observationa l studies, such as the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and 
Lifestyle (AIBL) study, and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) suggest that 
amyloid -related decline among clinically normal older individuals  accelerates between 3 and 6 
years of observation (Lim et al. 2016; Donohue et al. 2017; Mormino  et al. 2017; Papp et al. 
2017).  Differences in decline, as measured by the PACC, the primary outcome measure in the 
A4 study, between Aβ -negative and Aβ -posit ive clinically normal individuals increase over time, 
with the greatest increases at the 4 - and 5 -year time points (Section  11.1).  Therefore, the A 4 
study duration was increased to 240  weeks (approximately 4.5  years).

LY2062430  Open -Label Period.  An open -label period was added to the A4 study to determine whether 
effect s of solanezumab observed at the end of the placebo -controlled period , in participants 
originally assigned to solanezumab (early start), are  maintained  over a longer period of time, in 
comparison to the participants originally assigned to placebo who start during the open -label 
extension period (delayed start) .  If such maintenance is observed, that will indicate a persistent 
effect on disease course  that is not observed when  starting treatment later .  Specifically, it is 
hypothesized that the early -start group will show attenuated cognitive decline compared to 
delayed start, and that the delayed -start group will not “catch -up” to the early -start group that 
was continually treated with sola nezumab , consistent with disease  modification.   Secondary 
analyses to determine long -term effects of solanezumab on clinically  meaningful functional 
outcomes wi ll be investigated.  In addition, the influence of pathophysiologic disease stage, as 
assessed by biomarkers, on treatment response, will be explored in the open -label period.  The 
open -label period will extend up to 204 weeks, until the primary efficacy a nalyses from the 
placebo -controlled period are completed.

8.2.1.  Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates  
Inclusion Criteria [2]  through  [4] eliminate subjects who already have manifest dementia in favor 
of subjects likely to have preclinical AD.  Inclusion Criterion [5] ensures brain amyloid 
pathology to eliminate subjects at low risk of cognitive decline.  Inclusion Criteria [7] and [8] 
ensure that the subject and a study partner will be available and able to comply with protocol 
requirements.  Exclusion Criterion [1] eliminates subjects receiving common AD treatments 
since such subjects are likely to be at a later stage of AD.  Exclusion Criterion [ 2] prevents 
incomplete dosing of study drug.  Inclusion Cri terion [6] and  Exclusion Criteria [ 3] through [ 17], 
[21], and [2 4] protect subject safety or analysis of safety.  Exclusion Criteria [ 18] through [ 20] 
exclude subjects whose concomitant medication dosing could confound the results of the study 
in the analy sis of the PACC .  Exclusion Criteria [ 22] and [ 23] reduce both the possibility of 
coercion and the potential for bias that may be introduced at the study site.  Exclusion Criterion 
[25] protects safety for those participating in the optional LP.  
8.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:  Open -Label Extension Period  
All participants who complete the placebo -controlled period will be allowed to continue into the 
open -label period, even if they no longer meet the initial inclusion criteria.  Specifically, 
participants who have progressed to a Clinical Dementia Rating —Global score  (CDR -G) of >0, 
started anticholinergic medications or other treatment  for AD , or have accumulated ≥5 
microhemorrhages will be eligible to continue into the open -label period.  
8.4. Discont inuations  
8.4.1.  Discontinuation of  Subjects  
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly.  If the investigator site identifies a 
subject who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the Project 
Director must be notified.  I f the Monitor identifies a subject who did not meet enrollment 
criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the investigator site will be notified.  Inadvertently 
enrolled subjects may be maintained in the study and on investigational product when the Proj ect 
Director agrees with the investigator that it is medically appropriate for that subject.  The 
investigator must obtain documented approval from the Project Director to allow the 
inadvertently enrolled subject to continue in the study.

LY2062430  Subjects who do n ot meet entry criteria or who are excluded by exclusion criteria from screening 
tests and procedures should be discontinued from the study before randomization.  
Subjects who exhibit any of the following conditions during the study may be discontinued from 
the study . 
 Appearance of clinically significant new cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic 
events or symptomatic ARIA -E or greater than 4 new microhemorrhages 
detected on the central read on follow up MRI scans will be flagged for 
review by the central review.  Subject may be able to  continue to participate in 
the study depending on clinical significance as determined by the Project 
Director, Medical Monitor, and the Site I nvestigator.  
Note: while most cases of ARIA -E are asymptomatic, when symptoms do 
occur they  are reported to be most commonly headache, worsening of 
cognitive function, alteration of consciousness, seizures, unsteadiness, and 
vomiting.  Even when symptomatic ARIA -E is present, in most cases 
treatment is not required beyond discontinuation of the treatment until the 
symptoms are resolved.  If a subject simultaneously develops more than 1 of 
the symptoms suggestive of ARIA -E, that is, headache, worsening of 
cognitive function, alteration of consciousness, seizures, unsteadiness, or 
vomiting, then an  unscheduled MRI scan may be obtained.  A single symptom 
suggestive of ARIA -E of sufficient severity may also warrant an MRI  scan.  
The unscheduled MRI scan should be performed in the same manner as the 
currently scheduled MRI  scans in the protocol, which includes sending the 
images for central review.   For guidance, please refer to the instructions 
described in the relevant procedures manual.  
 Prolonged acute infusion reaction (that is, not rapidly responsive to 
medication such as antihistamines, nonsteroid al anti -inflammatory drugs, 
and/or narcotics and/or brief interruption of infusion).  
Note:  Acute infusion reactions may occur with any agent that causes cytokine 
release (for example, some monoclonal antibodies or other biological agents).  
Cytokine relea se may or may not be related to the mechanism of the infused 
biologic agent.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersen sitivity (including 
drug fever), arthralgia, bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, 
headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia, nausea, pruritus, rash, 
rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria, and vomiting.  
 Discontinuatio n of the study drug for abnormal liver tests should be 
considered by the investigator when a subject meet 1 of the following 
conditions after consultation with the medical monitor:  
o ALT or AST >8X ULN  
o ALT or AS T >5X ULN for more than 2 weeks

 Investigator Decision  
o The inve stigator decides that the subject should be discontinued from 
the study.  
o If the subject, for any reason, requires treatment with another 
therapeutic agent that has been demonstrated to be effective for 
treatment of the study indication, discontinuation fro m the study 
occurs prior to introduction of the new agent.  
 Subject Decision  
o The subject requests to be withdrawn from the study.  
 Sponsor Decision  
o ATRI  or Lilly or its designee stops the study . 
 Adverse Event  
o If the investigator and/or the subject decides th at the subject should be

LY2062430  9. Treatment  
9.1. Treatments Administered  
This study was initiated as a comparison of solanezumab 400  mg compared with placebo.   The 
active drug group was given an IV infusion of solanezumab 400  mg once every 4  weeks.  The 
study protocol was amended to increase the dose; subjects  will be escalated to  800 mg Q4W for 
at least 2 infusions , and then 1600  mg Q4W until the conclusion of the treatment,  as described 
below ( Table A4.1).  Dosing should be once every 4  weeks ; a minimum of 14  days between 
infusions is required.

may be mai ntained at that dose in the open -label  period.  
 
Changes in the escalation schedule may be made  at the investigator’s discretion  with the 
notification of a Medical Monitor . 
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for the following:  
 Explaining th e correct use of the investigational agent(s) to the site personnel  
 Verifying that ins tructions are followed properly  
 Maintaining accurate records of investigational product dispensing and collection

LY2062430  Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or problem with the investigational product so that the situation can be assessed.  
9.2. Materials and Supplies  
The site will be provided vials containing 400 mg/20 mL of solanezumab (or placebo).  The vials 
should be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF).  Normal sterile saline solution (0.9% sodium 
chloride) will be used for dilution.   Details  regarding preparation of the infusion  are provided in 
the procedures manual.    
Before infusion, the diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter or 
discoloration.   If particulate matter or discoloration is present, the solution should be discarded 
and a new solution should be made.  After each IV bag is prepared, it will be identified as a dose 
of study drug without identification of the drug or dose.  Once prepared , the infusate solution 
should be stored at room temperature for a total of no more than 6 hours.  
Clinical study materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.  
9.3. Method of Assignment t o Treatment  
Subjects who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to double -blind 
treatment at baseline (Visit 6).  For between -group comparability, subjects will be randomized  
within site by education – high (13 or more years) or low (12 or less years), and by the presenc e 
of one or more APOE 4 alleles (yes, no).  Assignment to treatment groups will be determined 
by a computer -generated random sequence . 
An interactive web response system ( IWRS) will be used to assign which vials are to be used for 
dosing for  each subject.   Site personnel will confirm that they have located the correct vial by 
entering a confirmation number found on the label into the I WRS. 
9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
The A4 study was initiated with active drug of solanezumab 400  mg given intravenously every 
4 weeks (400  mg Q4W).  Selection of the 400  mg Q4W dose was based largely but not entirely 
upon the peripheral sink hypothesis, which held that maximizing peripheral target engagement 
would change Aβ equilibria, resulting in altered amy loid deposition in the central compartment, 
ultimately leading to a slowing of disease progression.  The 400  mg Q4W dose was selected to 
lower free plasma Aβ concentrations by at least 90%, a level that exceeded what had been 
associated with slowing of amy loid plaque deposition in transgenic rodent species.  
The primary endpoint was not met in the recently concluded Phase  3 Study LZAX of 
solanezumab 400  mg Q4W in subject s with mild dementia due to AD, defined by a baseline 
MMSE score of 20 to 26.  Subject s treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically 
significant slowing in cognitive decline compared with subject s treated with placebo (p=.095), as 
measured by the 14 -item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive subscale (ADAS -
Cog14).  The study results, including several secondary clinical endpoints, directionally favored 
solanezumab, but the magnitudes of treatment differences were consistently small.  In general, 
safety findings were consistent with those observed previously in Studies  LZAM and LZAN .  
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  Safety analyses from Studies LZAM and LZAN individually and the pooled LZAM and LZAN 
data indicated a potential safety signal for a heterogeneous set of cardiac events , but th is signal 
was not confirmed based on data from Study LZAX.   As meas ured by the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), suicidal ideation and behaviors were infrequent, but greater 
frequency was observed among solanezumab - compared with placebo -treated patients in 
Study  LZAX.  This safety signal has not been obser ved in other solanezumab studies.  At this 
time, it cannot be determined whether the imbalance observed in Study LZAX is causally related 
to solanezumab treatment.  Lilly will continue to assess this safety signal in the A4 study .  The 
negative efficacy  outcome of Study LZAX suggests that an approach to dose selection based on 
peripheral target engagement may not predict clinical efficacy in Phase 3 trials.  Thus, central 
target engagement based on biomarkers may provide better predictive value for Phase 3 dose 
selection.  
Phase  2 solanezumab data suggest greater central target engagement may be achieved with 
dosing greater than 400  mg Q4W.  A dose of 400  mg every week (400  mg QW), which is 
equivalent to 1600  mg over a 4 -week period, was given in Phase  2 Studies LZAJ and LZAK, and 
showed  an increased CSF Aβ signal and an acceptable safety profile.  
Exposure –response analyses were conducted following the completion of Studies LZAM, 
LZAN, and LZAX, but given that only a single dose level was administered in  these studies, no 
compelling relationship between exposure and change in various cognitive endpoints could be 
discerned.  
Biomarker data from patients receiving LPs in Studies  LZAM, LZAN, and LZAX suggest that 
the effect of solanezumab on Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 species in the CNS (central target engagement) 
was present but relatively modest in those studies.  Total Aβ concentrations tended to increase 
with increasing solanezumab concentrations in the CSF, without reaching an apparent plateau, 
suggesting that hig her solanezumab exposures in the CNS would lead to higher levels of target 
engagement.  Indeed, total Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 concentrations were observed to be substantially 
higher , with a dose of 400  mg QW examined after 12  weeks of dosing in the Phase  2 Study  
LZAJ, as compared with the Q4W dosing regimen.  
To date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of solanezumab have been explored in single doses up to  
10 mg/kg (approximately 700  mg), or multiple doses of up to 400  mg QW.  The PK of 
solanezumab have been linear with respect to dose, and stationary with respect to time.  
Accordingly, the average plasma solanezumab concentration over 4  weeks at a dosing regimen 
of 1600  mg Q4W would be anticipated to be equivalent to the exposure ove r 4 weeks at the 
previously tested 400  mg QW dosing regimen.  This projected exposure is less than the no -
observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) exposure determined in monkeys as part of a 12 -month 
chronic toxicology study.  Assuming linear PK, the projecte d C max at 1600  mg Q4W is 
anticipated to provide an exposure multiple that is similar to that calculated for the projected 
average concentration.  
Solanezumab was well tolerated in monkeys, with no adverse effects observed at the maximum 
dose studied, 100  mg/kg.  Solanezumab exposures at 1600  mg Q4W were projected using 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  clinical data collected at 400  mg Q4W.  These exposure estimates provide a 5.8X multiple to the 
exposures in monkeys at the 100  mg/kg dose . 
The safety of higher doses than 400  mg Q4W has also been studied during the solanezumab 
development program.  Single ascending -dose Studies H8A -LC-LZAH (LZAH) and 
H8A -JE-LZAI (LZAI) investigated the safety and tolerability of solanezumab in AD patients at 
doses up to 10  mg/kg, which is approximately equival ent to 700  mg.  The safety findings from 
these studies (described below) suggested an acceptable safety profile for continued development  
of solanezumab.  Phase  2 Studies LZAJ (12 -week treatment duration) and LZAK (8 -week 
treatment duration) included doses  of 400  mg QW, the equivalent of 1600  mg of solanezumab in 
each 4 -week period; these studies (described below) also demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile for solanezumab.  
In Studies LZAH and LZAI, a total of 8 patients received single doses of solanezu mab 10  mg/kg.  
Three patients reported AEs that were related to solanezumab in the opinion of the investigator.  
Two of these patients experienced AEs, including feeling cold, mild tremor, chest pressure, and 
mild dizziness, that were judged by the investi gator to be most likely due to infusion reactions, 
similar to the infusion -type reactions described with other intravenously administered proteins.  
For these 2 patients, the symptoms were mild and resolved without specific treatment (for 
example, antihistamines).  A third report considered related to study drug, muscle spasms, 
occurred 0.1  hour after infusion and lasted 0.5  hours.  
In Studies LZAJ and LZAK, a total of 22  patients received solanezumab 400  mg QW for 8 to 
12 weeks.  The most commonly r eported AEs were back pain, confusional state, cough, 
hyperhidrosis, and nausea, reported in 2  patients each.  
Studies LZAH, LZAI, and LZAJ were completed before ARIA -H and ARIA -E were understood 
as potential risks for anti -amyloid therapies, and thus ARIA -H and ARIA -E were not specifically 
assessed on MRI.  However, subjects underwent baseline and follow -up MRI scans, and no 
changes in MRI were reported as AEs or SAEs.  Study LZAK was the first study of solanezumab 
that specifically assessed for ARIA -H and ARIA -E on MRI.  Magnetic resonance imaging  scans 
were obtained at Week  4 and Week  8 (after the final infusion).  No ARIA -E, ARIA -H, or 
infusion reactions were reported in this study.  There were no changes in MRI reported as AEs or 
SAEs.  
Taken together, th ese data suggest that increasing the dose to 1600  mg Q4W is appropriate to 
increase  the probability of observing a treatment effect in the study while maintaining subject  
safety.  
9.5. Administration  and Timing of Doses  
Details about infusion preparation and tim ing of administration are provided in the procedures 
manual.  If a subject demonstrates an infusion reaction to the study drug, the subject may be 
premedicated with antihistamine (such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride, 50 mg orally or 
intravenously), and t he infusion time may be extended for the remaining infusions.  An attempt 
should be made to complete the infusion within 2 hours of when first started.  Subjects should be

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  observed for approximately 1 hour following the first infusion of 400 mg in the 
placebo -controlled period.   Subjects on dose escalation safety cohorts will be monitored post 
infusion as mentioned in Section  10.2.11.1 . 
Note:  All clinical s cales  and specimen collections  are to be performed  before infusions . 
9.6. Blinding  
The placebo -controlled period is a double -blind study phase in which subjects and site personnel 
will be blinded to therapy.  In order to preserve blinding, a minimal number of study personnel  
that support interim analyses and safety review  will see the randomization table and treatment 
assignments before the study is complete.   In the open -label  period, treatment will remain 
blinded for up to the first 4 infusions to allow participants to dose escalate as described in 
Section 9.1 without unblinding  subjects and site personnel to the original treatment assignment in 
the placebo -controlled period.  After the 4 -visit dose escalation period, all subjects will receive 
open -label solanezumab treatment  and will remain blinded to the subject’s original treatment 
assignment.  In essence, all subjects are randomized at Visit 6 to early -start or delayed -start 
solanezumab treatment.   To maintain blinding , dose reductions are not a llowed during the dose 
escalation visits in the open -label period.  If a dose reduction is desired, the dose at that visit 
should be withheld; when dosing is reinstated, the participant should begin unblinded dose 
escalation at 400 mg Q4W.  
Emergency unblin ding for AEs may be performed through an I WRS.  This option may be used 
ONLY if the subject’s well -being requires knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment.  
Any unblinding event performed via the IWRS will be  recorded and reported by the I WRS. 
In ca se of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding 
of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted.  Subject safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination.  If the investigator dec ides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the Project Director prior to 
unblinding a subject’s treatment assignment.  If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, 
ATRI  and Lilly must be notified immediatel y. 
If an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject 
must be discontinued from the study.  In cases where there is ethical reason to have the subject 
remain in the study, the investigator must obtain specific a pproval from the Project Director  for 
the subject to continue in the study.  
9.7. Concomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded.  Subjects will be instructed 
to consult the investigator or other appropriate study personne l at the site before initiation of any 
new medications or supplements and before changing dose of any current concomitant 
medications or supplements.  
Prescription acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and/or memantine are exclusionary during 
initial scr eening.  Starting prescription AChEI s and/or memantine during the course of the study 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  will not be permitted with out explicit permission for an exemption for medical necessity .  Before 
a subject starts an AChEI and/or memantine or other treatments for cognitive impairment , a 
Medical Monitor  must  be contacted to determine whether or not the subject should continue in 
the study and whether or not clinical outcome measures should be performed .  Participants who 
begin treatment with AChEIs and/or memantine during the placebo -controlled period will be 
eligible to continue in the open -label extension  period.  
Use of benzodiazepines for treatment on an as -needed basis for insomnia or daily dosing as 
anxiolytics is permitted.   If they are being given chronically,  use of sedatives or hypnotics should 
be avoided for 8 hours before administration of cognitive tests.   If sedating medication is given 
for MRI at any visit or for any short -term use, then all cognitive assessments must be 
administered at least 24 hours af ter administration of the sedative.  
Stable use of pain medications will be permitted.  Short -term use of narcotics is allowable if not 
administered within 24 hours prior to cognitive assessments.  
Other concomitant medications that affect CNS function may b e given if the dose remains 
unchanged throughout the study.  Doses of these compounds should remain constant from 
6 weeks  before randomization (Visit 6). 
To avoid effects on cognitive measures:  
 subjects should not stop receiving any medications that affect  CNS function 
during the study,  
 subjects should not add any medications that affect CNS functio n to the 
treatment regimen, and  
 subjects should not change doses of medications that affect CNS function.  
If unforeseen starting, stopping, or changing of stable  doses of drugs  that affect CNS function  
occurs during the study, a Medical Monitor  must be contacted to determine whether or not the 
subject should continue in the study and whether or not outcome measures should be performed.  
Anticoagulants,  such as warf arin (Coumadin) and dabigatran (Pradaxa) are not permitted for 
subjects who undergo a LP.  Starting anticoagulants  during the course of the study , if deemed 
medically necessary, will be permitted; however, subsequent LP will not be conducted.  
9.8. Treatment Com pliance  
Because dosing occurs at study visits, subjects who attend all visits and successfully receive 
infusions are automatically compliant with treatment.  Any infusions at which 75% or more of 
the infusate is given will be considered a complete infusion . 
If a subject attends a visit but does not receive a complete infusion (for example, due to technical 
complications), every effort should be made to complete the infusion within 24 hours if possible.  
If less than 75% of the infusate is given, this must b e recorded as an incomplete infusion on the 
case report form ( CRF ).

LY2062430  10. Outcome Measurements  
Study procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the 
Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). 
10.1.  Clinical Measures  
Cognitive testing should always be performed before medical procedures that could be stressful 
for the subjects (for example, blood draws).   Additionally, cognitive testing for each subject 
should be performed at approximately the same time on each day that testing occurs and should 
be administered by the same rater to reduce potential variability.  More details are provided i n 
the relevant p rocedures manual.   If a clinical measure cannot be collected at the scheduled visit, 
that assessment may be collected at a subsequent visit, if that visit occurs within 8 weeks of the 
scheduled visit window.  
10.1.1.  Prima ry Efficacy Outcome Measure , Placebo -Controlled 
Period :  ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composit e 
The primary outcome measure , the PACC,  will be collected at the times shown in the Study 
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ; Mormino et al. 2017 ).  The PACC is a cognitive composite that is 
weighted towards episodic memory but also includes timed executive function tests and a global 
test.  Its development is described in Attachment 3 .  The components include:  
 Total Recall Score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test 
(FCSRT) .  The FCSRT (Grober et al. 1988, 2008; Ferris et al. 2006 ) is a 
16-item word list with visual and auditory presentation that uses semantic 
cuing to facilitate encoding and retrieval.  The test can be scored 3 ways:  a 
free recall score ranging from 0 to 48 assesses number of words recalled 
freely (withou t cuing), a free and cued score ranging from 0 to 48 assesses the 
number of words recalled freely as well as those recalled with cuing, and a 
third score ranging from 0 to 96 adds the previous 2 scores together.  
 Delayed Paragraph Recall score on the Logica l Memory IIa test from the 
Wechsler Memory Scale.   Logical Memory Test I and II (Delayed Paragraph 
Recall) is a modification of the episodic memory measure from the Wechsler 
Memory Scale -Revised (Wechsler 1987) .  In this modified version, free recall 
of 1 short story that consists of 25 bits of information will be elicited 
immediately after it is read aloud to the subject and again after approximately 
30-minute delay.  The total bits of information from the story that are recalled 
immediately (maximum score  = 25) and after the delay interval (maximum 
score = 25) are recorded.  The delay score (0 -25 story units) will be used in 
the composite.

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430   Digit -Symbol Substitution Test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -
Revised  (WAIS -R).  The Digit Symbol Substitu tion test (Wechsler 1981) is a 
subset from the WAIS -R.  The test consists of small blank squares presented 
in rows with one of 9 numbers (1 -9) randomly printed directly above each 
blank square.  A “key” is printed above the rows of blank squares.  The “key ” 
pairs numbers 1 through 9 with an unfamiliar symbol.  Following a short 
series of practice trials, the subject must use the key to fill in the blank squares 
in order (working from left to right across the rows) with the symbol that is 
paired with the num ber over the blank square.  The subject must work as fast 
as possible for 90 seconds.  The measure of interest is number of squares 
filled in correctly within the time limit (maximum raw score = 91).  This test 
engages multiple cognitive abilities includin g attention, psychomotor speed, 
complex scanning, visual tracking, and immediate memory.  
 MMSE Total Score.   The MMSE (Folstein et al. 1975)  is a brief, frequently 
used screening instrument for Alzheimer’s disease drug studies.  The MMSE 
scale evaluates ori entation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, 
repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy 
2 overlapping pentagons.  The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly 
completed items with a lower score indicative of poorer perf ormance and 
greater cognitive impairment.  The total sc ore ranges from 0 (worse) to 
30 (perfect performance).  
Each component score is divided by the baseline SD of that component, to form standardized 
Z-scores.  These Z -scores are summed to form the composite, so that a 4 -point change on the 
composite is approximately equivalent to a change of 1 baseline SD on each component.  
The administration of the PACC should be recorded  (audio only) for  quality review purposes  
according to locally applicable laws  and regulations . 
10.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Clinical Outcome  Measures , 
Placebo -Controlled Period  
Secondary clinical outcome measures will be collected at the times shown in the Study Schedule 
(Attachment 1 ). 
10.1.2.1.  ADCS Activities of Daily Living – Prevention Questionnaire  
The ADCS -ADL  Prevention Questionnaire  was developed in the ADCS -Prevention Instruments 
trial (ADCS -PI) and includes 18  questions related to activities of daily living (Galasko et al. 
2006 ).  Study subjects and their study partners independently rate the study subject’s level of 
ability.  Partners are additionally asked to evaluate whether activities were completed less oft en, 
required more time to complete, and if errors were made performing the task.  
10.1.2.2.  Clinical Dementia Rating Scale  
The CDR (Morris 1993) is a clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, 
questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (CDR score of 0 , 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively).  The score 
is based on interviews with the subject  and study partner, using a structured interview that 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  assesses 6 domains:  memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, 
home and hobbies, and perso nal care.  The ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of 
the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of dementia (ranging from 0 to 
3), with more refined measure of change available by use of the Sum of Boxes  (CDR -SB).  
Reliability and validity has been established, as ha s high inter -rater reliability.  
10.1.2.3.  Cognitive Function Index  
The CFI is a modified version of the Mail -in Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (Walsh et 
al. 2006 ; Amariglio et al. 2015 ), a subject - and study p artner -reported outcome ( patient -reported 
outcome ) measure developed by the ADCS.   This assessment includes 15 questions that assess 
the subject’s perceived ability to perform high level functional tasks in daily -life and their sense 
of overall cognitive f unctional ability.  Study subjects and their study partners independently rate 
the subject’s abilities.  
10.1.2.4.  Computerized Cognitive Composite  
The C3 will include tasks  from the CogState battery (Darby et al. 2011; Lim et al . 2012 a) aimed 
at measuring processing  speed, working memory, visual navigation, and executive function.  The 
C3 will also include 2  investigator -developed sensitive episodic memory probes of hippocampal 
function (Sperling et al. 2003; Rentz et al. 2010; Stark et al. 2010).  A composite score will be 
generated and secondary measures will include reaction time and measure subscores.  
The tablet computer iPad test session also incorporates questions about the subject’s assessments 
of their cognitive function based on the Memory Complaint Questionn aire (MAC -Q), the C -Path 
PRO, and a selection of self -report questions that may be helpful in developing novel tools for 
assessing subjective change over time in this population.  The MAC -Q (Reid et al. 2012) is  a 
brief measure  of subjective memory complai nt in people with normal cognitive function.  The C -
Path PRO Questionnaire is an exploratory instrument being developed by the Critical Path 
Institute for use in early AD trials .  It consist s of 26 questions asking for the participant’s  self-
assessment of current  ability to perform cognitive activities and interperso nal interaction.  
Subjects report the frequency that they experience difficulty performing these activities.    
The C3 will be optional  in Japan.  
10.1.2.5.  Resource Use In ventory —Brief Version  
The Resource  Use In ventory  (RUI)  is an instrument designed to assess changes associated with 
the transition from normal aging to dementia in (1) health -related resource use (medical care, 
nonmedical care, and informal care) and (2) elders’ participation in volunteer a nd paid work.  
Medical care includes questions on hospitalization, outpatient treatment and procedures, assistive 
devices, and medications.  Nonmedical care includes questions on home health aides, respite 
care, and adult day care.  Informal caregiving tim e participants received with instrumental and 
basic ADL.  Both participants and their study partners contribute to the reporting of the RUI to 
maximize information obtained.  The RUI has been used in trials of normal aging (Sano et al. 
2006), MCI (Zhu et a l. 2013), and dementia (Zhu et al. 2006), and items are included that are 
relevant to the specific stage of cognitive impairment and dementia.  For this trial, a brief version 
of the inventory will be used  (the RUI -B, where B stands for brief) , including only those items 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  that are relevant to this stage with a focus o n volunteer and paid work and items for medical and 
nonmedical resources.  
10.1.2.6.  Views and Perceptions  about  Amyloid Imaging  
Views and Perceptions  about  Amyloid Imaging  is an instrument  that assesses perceptions about 
amyloid imaging and reasons for obtaining an amyloid scan.  It is adapted from Roberts and 
Connell 2000.  
10.1.2.7.  Concerns about Alzheimer's Disease  
Concerns about Alzheimer ’s Disease  is a short self -report instrument about one’s concern  about 
developing Alzheimer’s disease dementia.  It is adapted from Roberts and Connell 2000.  
10.1.2.8.  Impact of Events Scale  
The IES  (Horowitz et al. 1979 ) is a 15 -item self -report measure that assesses two common 
responses related to a specific stressful life event: intrusion and avoidance.  It is a reliable scale 
that can be anchored to any specific life event  and permits the assessment of subject s over time, 
comparison of the degree of distress among subgroups, and comparison of the impact of various 
events.   The IES has been anchored to test -related distress in previous genetic testing studies and 
has been adapted for amyloid imaging related distress.  
10.1.2.9.  Future Time Perspective  Scale  
The Future Time Perspective s cale (Roberts 2000; Lang and Carstensen 2002) meas ures a 
person’s perception of his or he r remaining time which in turn has been shown to explain the 
priority of specific goals.  
10.1.2.10.  Research Satisfaction  Survey  
A Research Satisfaction  Survey will be administered  to the subject  in order to evaluate 
satisfactio n with the curre nt study .  The survey will also reveal specific aspects of the study that 
subject s may dislike, so that  improvements can be made in the design of future studies.  Past 
studies in multiple fields have also shown that consumer input and feedb ack is an important 
element in increasing re tention (for example, in psychotherapy; Miller et al. 2005; Duncan et al. 
2010) . 
10.1.3.  Biomarker Outcome  Measures , Placebo -Controlled Period  
Biomarker measures will be assessed as specified in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). 
10.1.3.1.  Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)  
Subjects who consent to the optional LP will have a baseline and endpoint LP performed in order 
to collect CSF.  Analyses include but are not limited to glucose, p rotein, cell count, Aβ species, 
and tau proteins .  CSF samples will also be sto red for future use in research.  
CSF collection, sample handling, and sample shipment will occur according to the procedures 
described in the relevant procedures manual.   All LPs  should be performed under fasting 
conditions (minimum 8 -hour fast) , preferably during the morning.  The postbaseline LP  should 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  be performed at the same time of the day as the baseline LP, and fasting status  must  be recorded  
for all LPs.  
Approximately 2 mL  (or more per local laboratory requirements) will be sent to a local 
laboratory for testing of glucose, protein, and cell count.  
Solanezumab - and placebo -treated associated effects on CSF AD biomarkers will be assessed 
and compared.  These AD biomarkers in clude, but are not limited to, total and free Aβ 1-40 and 
Aβ1-42, total tau, and P-tau.  CSF concentrations of biomarkers and solanezumab will be 
determined from  processed CSF samples using validated immunoassay and/or mass spec trometry  
methods.  Solanezumab - and placebo -treatment effects on CSF tau concentrations will be 
assessed and compared in this study.  CSF total tau and P-tau are both reported to be increased in 
individuals with AD.  Additional a nalyses are intended to  confirm previously obs erved treatment 
effects on CSF Aβ species , which suggest ed that solanezumab mobilizes Aβ  species from AD 
plaque.   Results from analysis of CSF for solanezumab and biomarkers to assess treatment 
effects will not be reported to investigative sites or other b linded personnel at a subject level.  
Bioanalytical samples collected to measure investigational product concentration and 
metabolism and/or protein binding will be retained for a maximum of 2  years following last 
patient visit for the study.  
Each subject w ill be contacted by phone 24 hours after the LP to confirm the subject’s 
well-being and to query about any new AEs. 
10.1.3.2.  Plasma Solanezumab  
Plasma will be collected from all subjects for determination of plasma solanezumab 
concentration.  Not all of these samples will be assayed for solanezumab concentration.   It is 
intended that plasma solanezumab concentrations will be determined for approximately the first 
200 subject s to complete the study.  In addition, plasma solanezumab concentrations will be 
determi ned for any subject who also has posit ive anti -solanezumab titers.  Plasma concentrations 
from other subjects may be determined as warranted.  
Plasma concentrations of solanezumab and Aβ species for pharmacodynamic analysis may be 
determined from processed blood samples using validated immunoassay and/or mass 
spectrometry  methods.  Analysis of Aβ species is intended to confirm the solanezumab 
pharmacodynamic effect (the “peripheral sink” effect) hypothesized to enhance Aβ clearance 
from the CNS to the periph eral circulation.  Other plasma Aβ species thought to be associated 
with amyloid plaque may also be analyzed.  
Samples from placebo -treated subjects will not be assayed for solanezumab.   Results that could 
unblind the study will not be reported to investiga tive sites or other blinded personnel.  
Sample collection, handling, and shipment will occur according to the procedures described in 
the relevant procedures manual.  
Bioanalytical samples collected to measure investigational product concentration will be re tained 
for a maximum of 1 year after all subjects complete the study (that is,  the last subject’s visit ).

LY2062430  10.1.3.3.  Genomic Samples  
There is growing evidence that genomic characteristics may impact a subject’s response to 
therapy.   Variable response to therapy may be due to genomic determinants that impact drug 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, the mechanism of action of the drug, the 
disease etiology and/or the molecular subtype of the disease being treated.   Therefore, blood 
samples will be coll ected for several types of genomic analysis . 
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping is a mandatory part of this study.  Neither subjects nor 
investigators will receive the genotyping results unless there is a country -specific law or 
regulation that requires no tification of the results.  
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observation of unusual response, the genomic samples 
may be tested and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genomic association with response.  
The genomic samples will only be used for investigations related to disease and drug or class of 
drugs under study in the context of this clinical program.   They will not be used for broad 
exploratory unspecified disease or population genetic analysis.  
The samples will be coded with the subject nu mber and stored for up to a maximum 15  years 
after the last subject visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor.   The samples and any 
data generated from them can only be linked back to the subject by investigator site personnel.  
The duratio n allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the investigational 
product.   Samples will be destroyed according to a process consistent with local regulation.  
10.1.3.4.  Samples for Biomar ker Long -Term Storage  
Collection of biomarker samples for long -term storage is also part of this study.  Plasma, serum, 
whole blood , and CSF samples will be collected.  Sample collection, handling, and shipment will 
occur according to the procedures described in the relevant pr ocedures manual.  
Analysis may be performed on biomarker variants thought to play a r ole in AD pathology to 
evaluate their association with observed clinical outcomes to solanezumab.  Other samples may 
be used for research to develop methods, assays, progno stics and/or companion diagnostics 
related to AD and/or determine mechanism of action of solanezumab.  Future research could 
include the evaluation of the effects of solanezumab on A  processing and trafficking, tau 
pathologies and neuronal degeneration (t au levels are known to be elevated in patients with AD 
[Trojanowski 1996; Green et al. 1999]), and possibly the effects of solanezumab on other 
analytes that have yet to be identified.  Analysis of these data could provide an important 
biomarker that would  guide future decisions by clinicians and researchers.  
The stored samples will be coded with the subject number and stored for up to a maximum 
15 years after the last subject visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor.  The samples 
and any d ata generated from them can only be linked back to the subject by investigator site 
personnel.  The duration allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the 
investigational product.  Samples will be destroyed according to a process cons istent with local 
regulation.  Because of the exploratory nature of these analyses and because the results should 
not change medical management, neither subject s nor investigators will receive the test results.

LY2062430  10.1.3.5.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Magnetic resonance  imaging of the brain will be performed according to the Study Schedule  and 
as clinically indicated.   Each site must be qualified to conduct MRI for the A4 study.  The 
procedures for site qualification and subject scanning will be described in the relevant  
procedures manual.  
All subjects will be scanned using the A4 MRI scanning protocol and must complete the A4 core 
sequences as described in the relevant procedures manual, to be eligible for randomization in the 
study.  There are additional magnetic resonance  sequences that will be acquired depending on 
scanner type.  
A central read will be performed on all MRI scans for subject safety and to assist in determining 
if the subject is eligible for the study.  In instances where more than 4 microhemorrhage s are 
identified or any ARIA -E at screening, it will be flagged for review and the subject will be 
deemed ineligible for the study.  Other findings that are flagged during the central read will be 
reviewed by the Project Director and Medical Monitors or de signees to determine if the subject 
is eligible to continue.  All follow -up MRIs will be reviewed centrally for new occurrence of 
ARIA -E and ARIA -H that will be flagged for review by the Project Director, Medical Monitors, 
and site principal investigator .  Subjects who devel op new ARIA -E or increased ARIA -H but 
remain asymptomatic may be eligible to continue treatment without interruption.  
Volumetric MRI (vMRI) analytic methods will be used to assess change in brain volume over 
the treatment period.  
Functio nal connectivity MRI methods will be used to assess the integrity of intrinsic brain 
networks over the treatment period.  
10.1.3.6.  Florbetapir PET Scan  
Florbetapir PET imaging of the brain will be performed using the A4 PET scanning protocol.   
Each site must be q ualified to conduct florbetapir PET for the A4 study.   The procedures for site 
qualification and subject scanning will be described in the relevant procedures manual.  
For each scan, the subject will  receive a single IV administration of approximately 370  MBq (10 
mCi) of florbetapir F 18 (fast IV push), approximately 50 minutes prior to imaging.  The 
injection of the imaging agent will be followed by a saline flush according to the injection 
procedure described in the relevant procedures manual.   The PET proced ure can last between 10 
and 30 minutes as specified in the relevant procedures manual.  
Change in brain amyloid burden (as assessed by florbetapir binding and measured by mean 
cortical standardized  uptake value ratio [ SUVr ]) will be compared in solanezumab - and placebo -
treated subjects for those subjects who undergo baseline and endpoint florbetapir scans.  
10.1.4.  Secondary Efficacy Clinical Outcome Measures, Open -Label 
Period  
The PACC, ADCS -ADL  Prevention Questionnaire, CDR -SB, C3, and CFI  described above for 
the placebo -controlled period of the study will also be evaluated in the open -label extension 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  period.  Additionally, a Clinician Diagnostic Impression (CDI) will be collected at Visit 66 and 
during the open -label extension period.  For the CDI, investigators will be asked to classify the 
participant’s current disease stage according to the following categories:  cognitively normal, 
MCI, or mild AD dementia.  Timing for collection of these outcome  measures is presented in the 
Study Schedule  (Attachment 1 ). 
10.2.  Safety Evaluations  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study 
and for alerting Lilly or its design ee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject.  
The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of subjects during the study.  
The investigator remains responsible for follow ing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
subject to discontinue before completing the study.  The subject should be followed until the 
event is resolved  or explained.  Frequency of follow -up evaluation is left to the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Attachment 1  lists the schedule of all safety asse ssments in this study.  Attachment 2  lists the 
laboratory  tests that wi ll be performed for this study.  
10.2.1.  Adverse Events  
10.2.1.1.  General Information  
A clinical study AE is any untoward medical event or unanticipated benefit associated with the 
use of a drug or drug delivery system in humans, whether or not it is considered related to a drug 
or drug delivery system.  
Reporting standards for reporting AEs  will be provided in the relevant procedures manual and 
must be followed regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish drug effect.  
Any symptomatic ARIA would be considered an AE.  Other findings on study -related MRI scans 
will be at the discretion of the site investigator to determine if it qualifies as an AE.  
Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, labs, vit al sign measurements, and other 
procedures must  be reported.  
Planned medical procedures should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical 
condition has worsened during the course of the study, in which case the worsening of the 
medical condition (not the procedure) should be reported.  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to investigational product 
should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory 
reporting and drug safety eval uation.  
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each subject’s preexisting 
conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in 
the study.  After the A4 study informed consent form (ICF) is  signed, site personnel will record 
any change in the condition(s) and the occ urrence and nature of any AEs.  
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE 
to items that include, but not limited to, prot ocol procedure, studied disease state  (preclinical AD, 
elevated brain amyloid) , investigational produc t, and/or drug delivery system.  
10.2.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse event collection begins after the subject has signed informed consent.  S erious 
adverse events  that occur after consent but before receipt of investigational product must be 
reported but data from such events will not be submitted to ERBs by the sponsor unless thought 
to have been possibly caused by a protocol procedure.  
Planned surgerie s should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has 
worsened during the course of the study.  
Study site personnel must report any serious  adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness of the event.  This 24 -hour not ification requirement refers to the initial SAE 
information and all follow -up SAE information.  
An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 Persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
 Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Considered significant by the investigator for any other reason  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definiti on. 
Serious adverse events occurring after a subject has been administered the last dose of study drug 
will be collected for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, regardless of the investigator’s 
opinion of causation.  Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the investigator 
feels the events were related to either study drug, drug delivery system, or a protocol procedure.  
Information on SAEs expected in the study population independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed b y the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may be 
found in the IB.

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  10.2.1.3.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure.  
United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
associated detailed guidances  or national regulatory requirements in participating countries 
require the reporting of SUSARs .  Lilly has procedures  that will be followed  for the recording 
and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated 
detailed guidances.  
10.2.2.  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating S cale 
Consistent with FDA regulatory guidance (FDA 2012), any occurrence of suicide -related 
thoughts and behaviors will be assessed.  The C -SSRS is a scale that captures the occurrence, 
severity, and frequency of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors durin g the corresponding 
assessment period.  The scale includes suggested questions to elicit the type of information 
needed to determine if a suicide -related thought or behavior occurred.  
The standard version of the scale will be used in this study.  The first  time the scale is 
administered  in this study  (Visit 1) , the C -SSRS “Screening/Baseline” version will be used and 
the findings will be used to assist the clinician in determining eligibility.  The C -SSRS will be 
administered at baseline (Visit 6) and at subsequent visits as outlined in the study schedule .  The 
C-SSRS “Since Last Visit” scale will be used for baseline and all subsequent assessments.  
If a suicide -related though t to behavior is identified at any time during the study, a  thorough 
evaluation wil l be performed by a study physician, and appropriate medical care will be 
provided.  
If, based on administration of the C -SSRS, it is determined that suicide -related behaviors have 
occurred, then the Lilly Self -Harm Follow -Up form will be used to collect ad ditional information 
to allow for a more complete assessment.  
10.2.3.  Electrocardiograms  
For each subject, a 12 -lead digital ECG will be collected as replicates ( triplicates).  Subjects 
must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and rem ain supine but 
awake during ECG collection.  
Consecutive replicate ECGs will be obtained at approximately 1 -minute intervals. 
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at additional times, when deemed clinically necessary.  
Collection of more ECGs (more replicates ) than expected at a particular time point is allowed 
when needed to ensure high -quality records.  
ECG will be collected in the placebo -controlled period per schedule of event s and in the open -
label period as  unscheduled ECG  per investigator  discretion . 
Electrocardiograms will initially be interpreted by a qualified physician (the investigator or 
qualified designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally 
while the subject is still present, to determine whether the su bject meets entry criteria at the

identified  at screening or during subsequent ECG visits as outlined in the Study Schedule . 
After enrollment, if a clinically signif icant increase in the QT/corrected QT inter val from 
baseline or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is 
identified, the subject will be assessed by the investigator for symptoms (for example, 
palpitations, near sync ope, syncope) and to determine whether the subject can continue in the 
study.  The investigator or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in 
subject  management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the ti me 
of evaluation from at least 1 of the replicate ECGs from each time point.  
All digital ECGs will be electronically transmitted to a designated central ECG laboratory.  A 
cardiologist a t the central ECG l aboratory will then conduct a fu ll overread on 1 of  the replicates 
(including all intervals).  A report based on data from this overread will be issued to the 
investigative site.  For each set of replicates, the cardiologist will determine the RR and QT 
intervals, QRS duration , and heart rate on the ECGs t hat were not fully overread.  These data are 
not routinely reported back to the investigative site.  However, any clinically significant finding 
that was not present on the fully overread ECG will be reported to the investigator , Lilly , and 
ATRI .  All data  from the overreads will be placed in the Lilly database  as well as transferred to 
ATRI  for analytical and study report purposes.  
When there are differences in the ECG interpretation between the investigator (or qualified 
designee) and the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory, the investigator’s (or qualified 
designee’s) interpretation will be used for study entry and immediate subject  management.  
Interpretations from the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will be used for data analysis 
and r eport -writing purposes.  
The investigator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of 1 of the replicate ECGs 
printed at the time of collection, the final overread ECG report issued by the central ECG 
laboratory, and any alert reports.  
10.2.4.  Immunogen icity 
Serum for immunogenicity testing will be prepared from blood drawn at designated visits.  
Serum immunogenicity results and any associated plasma Aβ peptide and solanezumab drug 
results used to interpret immunogenicity test results that could unblind the study will not be 
reported to investigative sites or other blinded personnel.  
Sample handling and shipment of the central laboratory will occur per instructions given to the 
investigative study site.  Samples may be stored for a maximum of 15 years fol lowing last 
subject visit for the A4 study at a facility selected by Lilly to enable further analysis of immune 
responses to solanezumab.   The duration allows Lilly to respond to regulatory requests related to 
solanezumab.

LY2062430  10.2.5.  Neurological Examination  
A medically qualified professional will perform a n eurological examination that include s an 
assessment of cranial nerves, strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation, tremor , and gait.   
Neurological examinations will be performed as clinically indicated, and  as indicated in the 
Study Schedule.  If necessary, given the training of the principal investigator, a neurologist will 
be consulted in the event of significant new findings.  
10.2.6.  Physical Examination  
A medically qualified professional will perform a brief phy sical examination that consists of a 
review of the major body systems ( that is,  skin, head/ears/eyes/nose/throat, cardiovascular, 
pulmonary, abdomen, musculoskeletal, neurological, and gastrointestinal).  Physical examination 
will be performed at clinicall y indicated, and as indicated in the Study Schedule . 
10.2.7.  Safety Laboratory Samples  
Blood and urine samples (Attachment 2 ) will be collected according to the Study Schedule and 
to determine whether subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and to monitor subject health.   
Redraws will be permitted if a sample is  not viable when received by the central laboratory or if 
sample collection is not possible during the visit.  
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.  
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed with in 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.   Tests are run and confirmed promptly whenever scientifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples  until the end of the study to confirm that the results 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations, or laboratory certification standards.  
10.2.8.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including te mperature  and weight , should  be measured at all clinic visits  and 
recorded in the eCRF according to the Study Schedule .  Blood pressure , respiration, and pulse 
will be measured in the sitting position.  Height will be measured at Screening Visit 1.  
10.2.9.  Subject  Medical History/Family History/Concomitant 
Medications  
Information regarding demographics, medical history , and family history will be gathered from 
the subject  and study partner  at Screening Visit 1.  C oncomitant  medications  will be assessed at 
every visit.  
10.2.10.  Assessment of Psychological Well -Being  
The Assessment of Psychological Well Being is composed of questions from a validated 
shortened version ( Marteau and Bekker 1992) of the “state anxiety” portion of the State -Trait 
Anxi ety In ventory  (Spielberger et al. 1983) and from the Geriatric Depression Scale (Sheikh and

LY2062430  Yesavage 1986).  It is a self -report assessment designed to identify symptoms of anxiety and 
depression in the elderly.  The anxiety portion of the assessment consi sts of 6 questions that the 
subject indicates on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) on how much of a given anxiety 
symptom they are currently experiencing to assess anxiety level.  The depression portion of the 
assessment has 15 questions that th e subject is asked to answer yes or no based on how they felt 
over the past week in an effort to assess depression symptoms.  The more benign items are asked 
first.  Answers to 5 of the items are negatively oriented for depression (for example, Do you feel  
full of energy?) and 10 positively oriented (for example, Do you often feel helpless?).  
10.2.11.  Dose Escalation Safety Cohort  
Subjects in t he dose escalation safety cohort  in the placebo -controlled period  (Section  7.1.4 ) will 
receive additional safety assessments and monitoring during dose escalation to monitor the safety 
of higher doses.  The additional study procedures and their timing are provided in the dose 
escalation safety cohort section of the Study Schedule (at the end of Attachment 1 ) and outlined 
below.  
10.2.11.1.  On-Site Post -Infusion Monitoring  
Each subject  will be observed for 1  hour after the first dose of 800  mg and the first dose of 
1600  mg. 
10.2.11.2.  Safety MRI  
An additional safety MR I will be conducted at least 7 days after the second dose of 800  mg and 
at least 7 days before escalating dose to 1600 mg so results of the central read can be reviewed 
by the site before the escalation .  If a study MRI is scheduled within ±2  months of the  dose 
escalation MRI, the MRI should be conducted according the dose escalation schedule as a 
substitute for the MRI specified in the main study schedule; an exception is the MRI at endpoint 
(Visit  66), which should be done according to the Study Schedule regardless of timing relative to 
dose escalation.  If a subject  experiences symptoms suggestive of ARIA -E at any time, the 
investigator may obtain an unscheduled MRI.  
10.2.11.3.  Electrocardiogram, Hematology, Chemistry, Urinalysis, and Vital 
Signs  
Additional ECGs wil l be obtained at the visits at which subjects receive their second dose of 
800 mg and second dose of 1600  mg. 
Additional safety blood draws (hematology, chemistry) and urinalysis  will be collected at the 
visits at which subjects receive their second dose of 800  mg and second dose of 1600  mg. 
Vital signs will be monitored before all infusions . 
10.2.11.4.  PK/PD and Anti -Drug Antibody Assessment  
Additional PK/PD and anti -drug antibod y samples will be collected at each of the 2 visits at 
which subjects receive 800 mg and at the first 2 visits and the fourth visit at which subjects 
receive  1600  mg during  the dose escalation period.

LY2062430  10.2.12.  Safety Monitoring  
In consultation with the regulatory sponsor, Medical Monitors or designees will monitor safety 
data throughout the course of the study.   Serious adverse events  will be reviewed within time 
frames mandated by procedures.  The Medical Monitors or designees will periodically review:  
 Trends in safety data  
 Laboratory analytes including blood hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis  
 AEs including monitoring of infusion reactions, ARIA -H, ARIA -E, 
hemorrhagic stroke, microhemorrhage (cerebral microhemorrhage, cerebellar 
microhemorrhage, brain stem microhemorrhage) as identified by investigator, 
cardiac ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, AEs potentially related to 
immunogenicity and suicide -related thoughts and behaviors  
If a study patient/subject experiences elevated ALT or AST >3X ULN or elevated total bilirubin 
>2X ULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the investigat or.  Details for 
hepatic monitoring depend upon the severity and persistence of observed laboratory test 
abnormalities.  
To ensure patient/subject safety and comply with regulatory guidance, the investigator is to 
consult with the medical monitor regarding collection of specific recommended clinical 
information, follow -up laboratory tests, and follow -up MRIs.  While most cases of ARIA -E are 
asymptomatic, when symptoms do occur they are reported to be most commonly headache, 
worsening of cognitive function, a lteration of consciousness, seizures, unsteadiness, and 
vomiting.  Even when symptomatic ARIA -E is present, in most cases treatment is not required 
beyond discontinuation of the treatment until the imaging abnormalities have resolved.  If a 
subject simulta neously develops more  than one of the symptoms suggestive of ARIA -E, then an 
unscheduled MRI should be performed.  A single symptom suggestive of ARIA -E of sufficient 
severity may also warrant an MRI.  The unscheduled MRI should be performed in the same 
manner as the currently scheduled MRIs in the protocol, which includes sending the images for 
central review.  
Please refer to Section 12.9 for informa tion on what occurs in the  event that an issue may need to 
be addressed by unblinding at the group level.  
10.2.13.  Complaint Handling  
Lilly collects product complaints on investigational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure  the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.  
For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by Lilly or delegate will be reported.  
The investig ator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study:

LY2062430   recording a complete description of the product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific complaint forms provided for this purpose  
 faxing the completed product complaint form within 24 hours to Lilly or its designee  
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of th e 
product complaint form with the product.  
10.3.  Appropriateness of Measurements  
Clinica l.  The PACC was developed specifically for use in this stud y (as described in Attachment 
3).  The measure was applied to data from several large longitudinal studies in clinically normal 
populations to determine whether it was sensitive to change among subjects who declined from 
normal to MCI.  Several datasets confirmed that the measure is able to detect cognitive decline in 
individuals who demonstrate clinical decline to the stage of MCI.  Although it is unknown how 
much progression will be observed  in the present study, the PACC is believed to be an 
appropriate measure for assessing change in preclinical AD.  
The CFI and ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire  are instruments to track early changes in 
clinical function such as abilities to perform high -level ADL and perception of their o wn ability 
to perform cognitively demanding functional tasks.  These measures demonstrated significant 
decline in individuals who progressed to MCI in the ADCS -PI trial. 
Other functional outcome measures, including the CDR are well -established in M CI and AD 
studies, although it is expected that only minimal change will be observed  in the CDR -SB over 
3 years in individuals who are not functionally impaired at baseline.  
Given the lack of trials in preclinical AD, many of the chosen scales do not have the same  depth 
of data and literature characterizing their use and/or responsiveness to treatments in this 
population that they do for populations with more pronounced AD.  Scales were therefore 
selected with an understanding that further validation and refinement  would occur as part of this 
trial. 
Biomarkers and Imagin g.  There is a large body of evidence supporting  CSF Aβ, CSF tau, 
amyloid imaging, and hippocampal and whole brain volume as biomarkers of  AD pathology.  
Pathologic hallmarks of AD identified at auto psy include the presence of neuritic  Aβ plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in brain regions important for cognition,  such as the 
hippocampus and temporal cortex (Jack et al. 2011).  Tau and phosphorylated forms  of tau 
(P-tau) as measured in CSF  and plasma  are known to be elevated in patients with AD  
(Trojanowski  1996; Green et al. 1999; Morris et al. 2005; Thal et al. 2006).  Cerebrospinal fluid 
Aβ1-42 concentrations are known to be reduced in patients with AD (Motter et al. 1995; Galasko 
et al.  1998, Jack et al. 2010).  Data will be collected in the A4 study to assess the impact of 
treatment  with solanezumab on these well -established biomarkers of AD pathology.  In addition, 
there is  growing evidence that those who are ‘cognitively normal’  but with brain amyloid 
accumulation  exhibit changes consistent with  abnormalities seen in AD dementia, including 
cortical thinning (Dickerson et al. 2009; Schott et  al. 2010; Chételat et al. 2012) and disruption of

markers will also be assessed in the A4 study.

LY2062430  11. Sample Size and Statistical Methods  
11.1.  Determination of Sample Size  
In order to develop an appropriate measure of cognitive decline in a preclinical population, we 
tested several combinations of measures using data from longitudinal studies in clinically normal 
populations, including the ADNI; the AIBL; the ADCS -PI trial; and the HABS  (Attachment 3 ).   
Sample size and power at 4.5  years (240  weeks) for the PACC were estimated using data from 
ADNI and HABS.  Estimates were obtained by applying appropriate assumptions regarding 
treatment difference, SD, and attrition for a 4.5 -year study in a preclinical AD population.  In 
ADNI, the difference in the composite change between subjects with and without elevated brain 
amyloid at 240  week s was 2.13 (SD=2.85).  Similarly, in HABS, the difference in the composite 
change between subjects with and without elevated brain amyloid at 240  weeks was 
2.66 (SD=3.08).  Given the ADNI -derived estimate of SD at 240  weeks of SD=2.85 and 30% 
attrition, the total N=1150 provides 80% power (5% 2 -sided alpha) to detect a treatment 
difference of 0.532  points or 0.532/2.13 = 24.9% of the amyloid group difference.  Similarly, 
based on the HABS estimate of SD at 240  weeks of SD=3.08 , the study has 80% power to de tect 
a treatment difference of 0.570  points or 0.570/2.66 = 21.4% of the amyloid group difference.  
For the open -label period, t he estimated mean PACC difference between cognitive ly normal 
subjects with and without elevated brain amyloid  at 336 weeks  is 2.95 (SD=3.77) based on 
ADNI and 4.74 (SD=3.99) based on HABS.  Accounting for the administrative censoring that 
will be induced by the common close design of the open -label period , and assuming an ov erall 
attrition rate of 30% , about 266 PACCs are exp ected to be available at 336 weeks .  The visit -to-
visit correlation is estimated  to be about 0.5.  Under these pilot estimates, 266 PACCs at 
336 weeks  would provide 80% power to detect a randomized group (early -start vs delayed -start 
treatment with solanezumab ) difference of about 0.9 PACC points.  This change of 0.9 PACC 
points reflects 30%  of the difference  between amyloid -positive and -negative participants based 
on ADNI, and 20% of that  difference based on  HABS.  
Sample size for the study was determined prior to  the interruption caused by the COVID -19 
pandemic. Applying the NCS approach in simulated trials with a COVID -19 pandemic 
interruption suggests the study has 94% power to detect an effect size of 0.75 PACC points at 
240 weeks.  
11.2.  Statistical and Analy tical Plans  
11.2.1.  General Considerations  
Unless otherwise noted, all tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 
0.05; 2 -sided confidence intervals (CIs) will be displayed with a 95% confidence level.   All tests 
of interactions between treatment and other factors will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.05.  
All analyses will follow the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) principle unless otherwise specified.  
An ITT analysis is an analysis of data by groups  to which the subjects are assigned by random

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  allocation, even if the subject does not take the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct 
treatment, or otherwise does not follow the protocol.   A mITT analysis is an ITT analysis for all 
subject s who have a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measure.  
Any change to the statistical analysis methods described in the protocol will require an 
amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to the 
statistical  analysis me thods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, 
will be described in the clinical study report.  Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be 
conducted as deemed appropriate.  
Complete details of the statistical methods to be used this study are contained in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
11.2.2.  Analysis Populations  
The primary and secondary efficacy measures will be analyzed using the mITT population unless 
otherwise specified.   
11.2.3.  Handling of Missing Items for Scales  
If any of the individual items for the clinical outcomes are missing, every effort will be made to 
obtain the score for the missing item or items.  The methodology for imputation will be provided 
in the SAP.  
11.2.4.  Subject  Disposition  
The reasons for discontinuation w ill be collected when the subject ’s participation in the study 
ends and will be summarized by treatment group .  The percentage of subjects discontinuing will 
be compared between groups .  The median time to discontinuation will also be compared 
between trea tment groups .  The comparisons will be done for the ove rall percentage of subjects 
who discontinue and also for specific reasons for discontinuation . 
11.2.5.  Subject  Characteristics  
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group and  overall.   
Summaries will be provided for continuous and categorical measures.  
11.2.6.  Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Prior medications are defined as those that stop before randomization.   Concomitant medications 
are defined as those being taken on or after random ization.   A summary of concomitant 
medications will be presented as frequencies and percentages for each treatment group.   Fisher’s 
exact test will be used to test for treatment differences between groups.  
If the start or stop dates of therapies are missing or partial to the degree that determination cannot 
be made of whether the therapy is prior or concomitant, the therapy will be deemed concomitant.  
Prior and concomitant medications will also be listed.  
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization drug dictionary.

LY2062430  11.2.7.  Protocol Violations  
Protocol violations will be analyzed as frequency tables between solanezumab and placebo.   
Listings of subjects with significant protocol violations will also be provided.  
11.2.8.  Analysis of Primary Outcome  (Placebo -Controlled Period)  
The primary objective of this study is t o test the hypothesis that  IV infusion of solanezumab will 
slow cognitive decline in preclinical AD as compared with placebo.  
The original mITT analysis (that is, all participants as rand omized to treatment who have a 
baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measure ) for the primary outcome  will be retained and 
conducted at the end of the treatment period, although the dose will be  increased during the 
study; in other words , the primary analys is will include all data for the solanezumab group as the 
treatment group versus  placebo.  As with the origin al analysis plan, the hypothesis for this 
analysis will be tested against an alpha level of .05.  
The details of this analysis including the analyti c method and model are presented below.  
An NCS  analysis will be used to assess the difference between treatment groups  in change from 
baseline for the PACC score at 4.5 years.   The composite sc ore at  baseline and each post-
baseline visit will be the dependent variable.  Time  will be treated as a  continuous  variable with 
values equal to years between baseline and follow -up exam dates .  We will assume an 
unstructured covariance structure.  The fixed  effects will include the fo llowing t erms: (i)  NCS  
basis expansion terms (two terms) , (ii) NCS basis expansion terms -by-treatment interaction  (two 
terms) , (iii)  PACC test version administered , (iv) age, (v) education , (vi) APOE 4 carrier  
(yes/ no), and (vii) baseline florbetapir cortical SUVr.   The model is constrained to not allow a 
difference between treatment group  means at baseline.  
The null hypothesis is that the treatment difference between solanezumab and placebo for the  
PACC score at 240 weeks  is equal to zero.  The primary analysis wil l be carried out in the  mITT  
population that is randomized and has a baseline score and at least 1 postbaseline assessment.  If 
the unstructured covariance structure matrix results in a lack of  convergence, the following 
structures  will be used in sequence :   
 heterogeneous Toeplitz  covariance structure  
 heterogeneous autoregressive  order 1  covariance structure  
 heterogeneous compound symmetry  covariance structure , and  
 compound symmetry covariance structure.  
The sensitivity analyses of the effect of dose change on clinical outcomes are included in 
Section  11.2.9.2 . 
11.2.9.  Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  (Placebo -Controlled Period)  
11.2.9.1.  Clinical Outcomes  
Similar t o the primary analysis, each of the secondary efficacy outcomes will be assessed using 
an NCS  analysis.   These secondary efficacy outcomes include  MMSE , ADCS -ADL Prevention 
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  Questionnaire , CDR -SB, CFI, and C3 .  For each secondary efficacy measure, the basel ine score 
and scores at each post -baseline visit during the treatment period will be analyzed using NCS . 
Also similar to the primary analysis, all data from all patients regardless of dose increase will be 
included for the solanezumab and placebo groups.  
Each of the secondary efficacy outcomes will be assessed using a n MMRM analysis.   These 
secondary efficacy outcomes include  MMSE , ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire, CDR -SB, 
CFI, and C3 .  For each secondary efficacy measure , scores at each post -baseline visi t during the 
treatment period will be analyzed using MMRM . 
An additional MMRM analysis, termed a slopes analysis, will be conducted examining the 
change from baseline score on the PACC at each scheduled postbaseline visit.   The slope 
analysis will treat time from randomization as a continuous variable.  
11.2.9.2.  Sensitivity Analyses   
Sensitivity analyses of the effect of dose change on clinical outcomes will be conducted  as noted 
in the SAP . 
1. An MMRM analysis will be performed separately on the PACC and other clinical 
measures after censoring all observations after the dose increase.  In other words, change 
from baseline for the clinical measure will be obtained only through the last available 
value prior to first dose escalation for each subject.  
 
The null hypothesis is that the treatment difference between  solanezumab and placebo for 
the PACC score is equal to zero.  Since the timing (visit) of dose escalation will vary for 
each subject, a specific endpoint for comparison between treatment groups will not be 
available.  Therefore , the hypothesis will be tested using the p -value obtained for the 
overall treatment effect . 
 
2. Additionally, we will implement a sensitivity analysis to estimate the potential 
differences in the treatment effect for the original dose and the higher dose by modeling 
the effects of a time -varying dose indicator variable (with values placebo, low, a nd high).  
The time -varying dose indicator variable will be fitted as a separate variable to the ITT 
model of change from baseline on the primary measure (PACC) and other secondary 
measures.  
 
The fixed effects in the model for the sensitivity analysis will  be constructed as follows:  
 
Change from baseline = baseline score + dose+ visit + dose-by-visit interaction + age + 
education + baseline cortical SUVr  
 
The coefficient for this new time -varying dose indicator variable will provide estimates to

CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  compare an d contrast all dose groups at the relevant time points at which the different 
doses were assigned.  
 
3. Another sensitivity analysis will include the mean dose for each subject as a separate 
co-variable.  The fixed effects in the model will be the following:  
 
Change from baseline = baseline score + treatment + visit + treatment -by-visit interaction 
+ age + education + baseline cortical SUVr + mean dose.  
 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be included in the SAP.  
11.2.9.3.  Biomarker Outcomes  
Analysis of Plasma  Change in plasma A  and P-tau, GFAP , and Neurofilament light chain  after 
treatment will be compared between treatment groups.  This analysis will be done separately for 
each plasma A  and P-tau parameter.  
Analysis of vMRI Data .  Change in vMRI data after treatment will be compared between 
treatment groups.  This analysis will be done separately for each vMRI parameter.  
Analysis of Amyloid PET Imaging.   To provide further supporting evidence that solanezumab 
attenuates the underlying pathologic process in A D, the change in brain amyloid burden obtained 
using florbetapir PET imaging will be assessed.   Parameters from various brain regions of 
interest as well as a composite brain measure will be compared between treatment groups.  
Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid.   To provide further supporting evidence that solanezumab 
attenuates the underlying pathologic process in AD, changes in CSF parameters, including total 
and free A 1-40 and A1-42 species and total tau and P-tau peptides, GFAP Neurofilament light 
chain, will be compared between treatment groups.  
11.2.10.  Open -Label Period  
When change from baseline is assessed, subjects will be included in the summary only if both a 
baseline and a postbaseline measure are available.  For efficacy analyses (noninferiority and 
superiority analyses), the baseline will be the last non -missing observation collected prior to the 
initiation of treatment in the placebo -controlled  period, generally, Visit 6. 
Treatment group comparisons used in the statistical analysis will be the treatme nt group to which 
the subjects  were randomized in the placebo -controlled  period ( subjects randomized to 
solanezumab [early start] versus patients randomized to placebo  [delayed  start] ). 
For analyses using MMRM, an unstructured covariance matrix will be use d to model the 
within -patient variance –covariance errors.  If the unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack 
of convergence, the heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance structure, followed by the heterogeneous 
autoregressive covariance structure, will be u sed.  The Kenward –Roger approximation will be 
used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.

LY2062430  In the event that the primary contrast for the placebo -controlled period  at 240 weeks is 
statistically significant, d elayed -start analyses will proceed  based on the methods described by 
Liu-Seifert and colleagues (2015).  Several efficacy measures ( PACC, ADCS -ADL  Prevention 
Questionnaire, CDR -SB, C3, and CFI) will be analyzed separately using a noninferiority 
hypothesis in an MMRM model, in which the spec ific hypothesis is that the advantage of 
solanezumab treatment demonstrated in the placebo -controlled period is sufficiently maintained 
in the open -label  period.  This randomized/delayed -start analysis will assess whether 
solanezumab has a persistent effec t on disease course .  That is , the hypothesis is that subjects 
originally randomized to receive placebo and later switched to solanezumab at the start of the 
open -label  period do not “catch up” to subjects originally randomized to receive solanezumab in 
the placebo -controlled period.  This may be understood as a com parison of the treatment 
difference at the end of the placebo -controlled period with the treatment difference at the end of 
the open -label  period.  
The noninferiority margin for this hypothesis is  specified as 50% of the treatment difference 
observed at the end of the placebo -controlled  period .  The hypothesis will be tested by 
constructing a 90% one -sided CI of the difference in LS means at the last visit in the open -label 
period.  If the lower limit of the CI rules out the difference that would have been obtained if 50% 
of the observed difference had been lost, the disease progression for the treatment groups will be 
considered par allel, indicating that the treatment effect is independent of symptomatic  effects.   
The interim noninferiority analysis of the PACC  up to Week 336 in the open -label period will be 
considered the main efficacy analysis for the open -label  period.   
In additi on to the noninferiority test, superiority of early -start subjects  compared with 
delayed -start subjects at the 336-week analysis in the open -label  period  will also be assessed .  
The PACC, ADCS -ADL Prevention Questionnaire, CDR -SB, C3, and CFI  will be analyzed.  
11.2.11.  Gatekeeping Strategy  
Given continuing evolution in the field regarding assessment of clinical meaningfulness in a 
preclinical AD population, a formal gatekeeping strategy is not currently planned.  If a 
gatekeeping strategy is used, it will be sp ecified in an SAP before database lock.  
11.2.12.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The distribution of observed plasma solanezumab concentrations will be graphically compared to 
simulated solanezumab concentrations generated by a population PK model developed with data 
from previous Phase 3 trials.   If warranted, the population PK model parameters may be updated 
by combining data from this study with that from previous Phase 3 studies and re -fitting the final 
model.   The population PK model may be u sed to estimate exposure parameters ( for example , 
plasma solanezumab area under the curve ), if appropriate .  As warranted, the relationship 
between exposure estimates and safety, biomarker, or efficacy outcomes may be investigated 
through graphical or othe r analyses.  
To evaluate the potential impact of immunogenicity on solanezumab PK, plasma solanezumab 
concentrations from subject s with treatment -emergent immunogenicity will be plotted as a

LY2062430  function of time, along with mean plasma solanezumab concentration s in all subject s.  The 
anti-solanezumab titer associated with each plasma solanezumab concentration will be indicated 
on the graph (for example, by assigning a different symbol to each titer level).  A region 
representing the middle 90% of observed plasma  solanezumab concentrations in all subject s will 
also be presented on the graph.   If this graphical analysis demonstrates a trend in plasma 
solanezumab concentrations in subject s with treatment -emergent immunogenicity relative to the 
overall trial populati on, additional work may be performed to characterize this trend.  
11.2.13.  Safety Analyses  
All analyses will depend on the analysis populations being specified.  For the analyses and 
summary statistics, the 2 analysis populations to be used are randomized subject  population and 
placebo -controlled population.  The randomized subject  population will include all randomized 
subjects in the A4 study  and will include observations across both the placebo -controlled  period 
and the open -label  period.  The placebo -controlled population will include all enrolled subjects 
who have entered the placebo -controlled period of  the A4 study  and will be limited to 
observations collected during the placebo -controlled period of the study.  
Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzin g AEs, laboratory analytes, vital  signs, MRI 
scans , ECGs, immunogenicity measures , and the C -SSRS during the treatment period .  Safety 
analyses of the open -label extension will span across both the placebo -controlled study period 
and the open -label study period in order to be able to compare early -start safety risks to 
early -start efficacy benefits.  
For safety assessments , 3 separate sets of analyses  will be conducted :  1 set of analyses  for all 
data when the subjects were on 400  mg Q4W, 1 set of analyses  for all data when the subjects 
were receiving doses higher than 400  mg Q4W,  and 1 set of analyses  for all data (regardless of 
dose).  
11.2.13.1.  Study Drug Infusion  
Summary statistics will be provided for the total number of subject s who received complete  
infusions, d uration of complete infusion , and volume of complete infusion by treatment group at

12.1.1.  Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the subject and study partner(s) understand the 
potential risks and benefits of participating in the study, including answering any questions the 
subject may have throughout the study and sharing in a timely ma nner any new information that 
may be relevant to the  subject’s willingness to continue his or her participation in the trial.  
The ICF will be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study participation to the 
subject in simple terms before the subject is entered into the study, and to document that the 
subject is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the 
study and desires to participate in the study.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring tha t informed consent is given by each subject before 
the performance of any protocol procedures and before the administration of investigational 
product .  The investigator is also responsible for ensuring t hat study partners provide  informed 
consen t. 
As used  in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent and assent given by 
subjects and study partners.  
12.2.  Ethical Review  
The ATRI  must approve all ICFs before they are submitted to the ERB and used at investigative 
sites.  All ICFs must be compl iant with the International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) 
guideline on GCP.  Standard ATRI  Regulatory Affairs procedures will be followed tracking, 
monitoring and assisting with ERB reviews at the sites.  
As part of study initiation, documentation of ERB approval of the protocol and the ICF must be 
provided to ATRI  as part of the regulatory packages before the study may be gin at the 
investigative sites .  The standard ATRI  Regulatory Approval process will be  followed.  The 
ERB(s) will review the protocol as required.  
Any member of the ERB who is directly affiliated with this study as an investigator or as site 
personnel must abstain from the ERB’s vote on the approval of the protocol.  
12.3.  Confidentiality  
An ident ification code assigned by the investigator to each subject will be used in lieu of the 
subject’s name in order to protect the subject’s identity when r eporting AEs and/or other 
trial-related data.  
Approved on 09 Aug 2022 GMT
CONFIDENTIAL  H8A -MC-LZAZ( f) 
LY2062430  In addition, information about study subjects will be kept  confidential and managed according to 
the requirements of HIPAA.  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informin g 
the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who wi ll have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their auth orization for use of their PHI  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigat or, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status ( that is,  that the subject is 
alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
12.4.  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Special effort s will be made  to encourage minority enrollment , with a requirement to screen at 
least one out of every 5 subjects  from an under -represented minority, and minority recruitment 
will be monitor ed throughout the study.  Minority enrollment will be facilitated through minority 
outreach effort coordinated by the Recruitment and Retention group at the ATRI .  Each site will 
be encouraged to employ specific efforts ( for example,  media and community outreach 
activities) to attract appropriate minority subject s to the trial.  Spanish translation is available for 
a variety of instruments deployed in this trial.  The success of mi nority recruitment is based on 
the specific efforts of each site ( for example,  media and community outreach efforts) as well as 
the criteria for entry.  This trial has been designed to maximize minority participat ion in both 
ways.  No subject  will be exclu ded due to their sex, race, or ethnic group.  
12.5.  Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with:  
[1] consensus ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, 
including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council  for International  
Organizations  of Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS ) International Ethical Guidelines  
[2] the ICH GCP Guideline [E6]

b If C-SSRS indicates suicide -related behavior has occurred, the Lil ly Self Harm Form is to be completed and follo w-up must occur by a site clinician.  
c If MRI is done on the same day as cognitive  and other  assessments, then it should be done after cognitive  and other  tests.  MRI may be done before other visit 
procedures, including cognitive and other tests, but in that case MRI must be done at least 1 day before other visit procedures.   The V66 MRI may be done up 
to 4 weeks before other V66 procedures, but must be done after t he completion of V65.  
d Every effort should be made to administer the PACC before all other procedures on the same day .  PACC version at early term visit should be the next 
version in series  (not including SC).

a Consent and HIPAA authorization can take place at time point 0 or any time before the first dose of 800  mg is given.  
b Additional safety MRI will be conducted at least 7 days after the second dose of 800  mg and at least 7 days before escalating dose to 1600 mg so results of the 
central read can be reviewed by the site  before the escalation.  If the MRI cannot be read before the first scheduled dose of 1600  mg, the subject  should 
continue to receive 800  mg until such time that the MRI central read is available, which will not be considered a protocol deviation.   If a st udy MRI is 
scheduled within ±2 months of the dose escalation MRI, the MRI should be conducted according the dose escalation schedule as a substitute for the MRI

LY2062430  Attachment 3.  Development of the PACC Measure  
Based on review of the literature from cohort studies data from “normal controls” who progressed to mild cognitive impairment  or AD 
dementia, we determined that a composite measure sensitive  to change in preclinical AD would likely require assessment of these key 
domains:  episodic memory, executive function, and orientation.  Previous studies have reported evidence that both list learn ing and 
paragraph recall measures of episodic memory decl ine 7  to 10 years prior to the diagnosis of MCI or AD dementia (Elias et al. 2000; 
Grober et al. 2008; Derby et al. 2013).  Recent data from amyloid imaging studies have reported decline in multiple cognitive  domains 
looking retrospectively at cognitive tr ajectories over 8  to 10 years prior to PET amyloid imaging (Resnick et al. 2010; Landau et al. 
2012; Snitz et al. 2013) and prospectively over 1 - to 3-year longitudinal follow -up (Morris et al. 2009; Doraiswamy et al. 2012; 
Knopman et al. 2012; Lim et al. 2012b; Kawas et al. 2013).  
In order to test the hypothesis that a composite measure including episodic memory measures, timed executive function and a g lobal 
measure would be sensitive to detect decline from clinically normal to the stage of mild cognitive  impairment, we tested several 
combinations of measures using data from longitudinal studies in clinically normal populations, including the Alzheimer’s Dis ease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study  of Ageing (AIBL); and the ADCS -
PI trial . 
Evidence Supporting Use of the Proposed Composite.  We examined whether the proposed combination of measures (memory, timed 
executive function, and global) would demonstrate greater decline in individuals progresse d to MCI (CDR 0.5) compared with those 
who remained normal (CDR 0) in two datasets: the ADCS -PI and ADNI.  
Figure  A4.3 illustrates the 3 -year change in the proposed composite (PACC) among those who declined from Normal (defined as 
CDR 0) to MCI (CDR 0.5 plus cognitive decline) as compared with those whose  CDR  score remained stable  at 0 in the ADCS -PI 
trial.  Figure  A4.4 shows ADNI data from a very similar composite cognitive measure for Normals who remaine d stable compared 
to those who progressed to a diagnosis of MCI over 3 years.  Both datasets demonstrate the sensitivity of a composite that in cluded 
episodic memory, timed executive function, and global measures (including orientation) to detect cognitive  decline in individuals 
who demonstrate clinical decline to the stage of MCI.

LY2062430  The Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) is a longitudinal study of aging and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.  The HABS is following 
approximately 300 clinically normal older (CDR=0; 73.5±6.0  years) individuals , characterized on the basis of baseline amyloid PET 
imaging.  In a recent study (Mormino et al. 2017), we investigated amyloid -beta (A β)-related longitudinal cognitive change, 
examining several variations of the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC).  Aβ+ CN  demonstrated longitudinal decline 
on all individual PACC components, and all PACC variations.  Aβ group differences emerged  after 1  to 2 years  when both Free and 
Total Recall FCSRT scores were included in the PACC (see  Figure  A4.6).  Decline in PACC was also associated with progression to 
CDR 0.5.  These results c onfirm the ability of the PACC to capture both early and late cognitive decline during the preclinical stages 
of AD, which may prove advantageous in prevention trial design.

LY2062430  Development of the PACC composite measure for the A4 trial has been publicly presented at an AlzForum webinar ( Developing 
Outcome Measures for Pre -Dementia Trials – 28 February  2013)  and published in 2014 (Donohue et al. 2014) .  This combination of 
tests measuring word list learning, paragraph recall, timed executive function and global cognition, including orientation to  time, is 
also strongly supported by work done for the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative (API) by Dr s. Suzanne Hendrix and Jessi ca Langbaum, 
using longitudinal cohorts from Rush University and the Colombian PS -1 kindred data (Langbaum et al. 2011).  These data were also 
presented by Dr. Hendrix in the AlzForum webinar ( Developing Outcome Measures for Pre -Dementia Trials – 28 Februa ry 2013) .  
Further description of development of the PACC has been reported by Mormino and colleagues (2017).  
Evidence Supporting Selection of Individual Components.  
 Episodic Memory.  Across multiple datasets (ADNI, AIBL, ADCS -PI, and summary data from Washington University), we 
found evidence that a combination of a list learning memory measure and paragraph recall consistently provided the greatest 
sensitivity to detect decline in ele vated brain amyloid (or APOE 4) individuals.  Although the available datasets used 
different list -learning measures, the results were quite consistent.  We chose to use the FCSRT for the list -learning test for the 
A4 study , as this measure was particularl y powerful in detecting decline in individuals who progressed to MCI during the 
ADCS -PI trial (Salmon et al. in press ), and in predicting dementia in previous cohort studies from the Baltimore Longitudinal 
Study of Aging (Grober et al. 2008) and the Einste in Study of Aging (Derby et al. 2013).  In addition, the FCSRT has 
previously demonstrated sensitivity in prediction of decline from MCI to AD dementia in other studies (Amieva et al. 2008 ; 
Dubois et al. 2010).  The Delayed Paragraph Recall score on the Lo gical Memory IIa was chosen as the paragraph recall test 
because there is extensive data using this measure in ADNI and other cohorts (Crane et al. 2012; Derby et al. 2013).  
 Executive Function.  We also found that the addition of a timed executive function  measure, such as Digit -Symbol, added 
power to detect decline, consistent with previous reports that slowing of processing speed and executive dysfunction are seen  
in very early AD (Albert 1996; Storandt et al. 2009).  
 Orientation/Other Cognitive Domains.  Although the MMSE has not been typically thought of as a sensitive measure for early 
detection, the MMSE score (or the Modified MMSE [Teng and Chui 1987]) consistently added power to detect decline in all 
of the c ohorts that have been examined.

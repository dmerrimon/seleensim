Title: REnal Sympatheti C denervation to sUpprEss Ventricular 
Tachyarrhythmias in ICD Recipients  (RESCUE) 
Objective:  The objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of 
adjunctive catheter -based renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN) in t he 
primary prevention of ICD therapy in patients with ischemic or non-
ischemic ventricular dysfunction, who are to receive an ICD for either i) 
secondary prevention, or ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by 
programmed ventricular stimulation at the time  of ICD implantation.  
These patients will be randomized to ICD alone or ICD + RSDN.  
Design: This study is a prospective, multicenter, single -blinded, randomized 
(1:1) control trial evaluating the effectiveness of RSDN in the primary 
prevention of ICD therapy in patients with ischemic or non- ischemic 
ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an ICD for either i) 
secondary prevention, or ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by 
programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation.  
These patients will be randomized to ICD alone or ICD + RSDN. 
Subjects will only be eligible for this study if they are ≥ 18 years of age 
and have a history of structural heart disease (post -MI, dilated 
cardiomyopathy, sarcoid myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, etc.), and are planned for ICD implantation for: i. Secondary prevention ( e.g.: 
VT/VF arrest, sustained VT, syncope/inducible VT) ii. Primary prevention + inducible MMVT during induction via ICD lead testing. In 
addition, eligible patients will have acc essible renal vasculature (as 
determined by renal angiography). 
The pati
ent will be blinded to the results of randomization. Once 
randomized, study group subjects will undergo a strategy of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation + ICD implantation ( if not already 
present). Control patients will receive standard ICD implantation alone 
(if not already present). Follow-up will be conducted in regular intervals 
over a 12-month period. 
Enrollment:  Total: 462 subjects ( 231 control group, 231 study group)  
An i
nterim safety analysis will be performed after the first  50 subjects 
(25 control group, 25 study group)  have completed their 6 -month 
follow-up visit.

2 STUDY  OBJECTIVE  
The 
goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive catheter -based renal 
sympathetic denervation (RSDN) in the primary prevention of ICD therapy in patients with 
ischemic or non -ischemic ventricular dysfunction, who are to receive an ICD for either i) 
secondary prevention, or ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation.  These patients will be randomized to ICD alone or 
ICD + RSDN. The proposed study is a prospective, multicenter,  single-blind, randomized control 
trial. 
3 INTRODUCTION , RATIONALE  
Sudd
en cardiac death (SCD), defined as an unexpected death from a cardiac cause occurring 
within ≤ 1 hour of the onset of symptoms, accounts for 300,000 to 400,000 deaths in the United States annually, or 5.6% of annual mortality .
1-3 SCD is most commonly caused by ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT).  Several therapies exist for the 
prevention of VT, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy (ICD), anti-arrhythmic 
drug therapy (AAD), and the use of catheter based ablation.  
Curr
ent guidelines recommend the use of implantable cardioverter -defibrillator (ICD) as therapy 
to prevent SCD in patients who have survived a prior cardiac arrest due to unstable VT or who have had a previous episode of spontaneous sustained VT.
4 Several trials have demonstrated the 
efficacy of ICD therapy in preventing SCD.5,6  The MADIT II trial, a randomized trial of patients 
with prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%, demonstrated a 31% 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 8 reduction in the relative risk of death in the defibrillator group. 6 However, ICD therapy does not 
prevent VT, and a significant proportion of patients may still expe rience appropriate shocks. In 
the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Trial, 60% of patients had ≥1 
appropriate ICD therapy for VT/VF during follow-up (31±13 months), and the first arrhythmia 
resulting in a shock during follow up was frequently identified as VT (63%) . Unfortunately, 
these ICD shocks are associated with both a significant reduction in quality of life and increased mortality. In a study examining quality of life in patients who had received ICD shocks, at 5.5 
years post ICD implantation 19% of patients demonstrated signs of post- traumatic stress 
disorder.
7 In the MADIT II trial, patients who experienced VT/VF had an increased risk of death, 
with a hazard ratio of 2.5.6  Thus, while ICDs have a clear overall mortality benefit in patients 
with a reduced ejection fraction, the ICD shocks themselves clearly reduce the quality -of-life of 
these patients and may have a negative impact on their longevity.  
Antia
rrhythmic drugs (AADs) are another therapy available for the prevention of VT, but 
unfortunately they have li ttle effect on ventricular arrhythmia recurrence, and may increase 
mortality when used in high-risk patients. In the OPTIC trial, 412 patients who had an ICD implanted within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring VT/VF were randomized to 
either amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta-blocker alone. Although patients in the 
amiodarone plus beta blocker group were less likely to receive shocks (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-
0.52; P<.001), shocks still occurred in 10.3% of these patients. In a ddition, serious adverse effects 
associated with amiodarone resulted in study drug discontinuation in 18.2% of patients at 1 year.
8 
More 
recently, catheter ablation has emerged as a new option for t he primary prevention of ICD 
shocks. Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation for symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT, including VT terminated by an ICD, that recurs despite AAD therapy or when AADs are not 
tolerated. In addition, ablation is indica ted for control of VT storm refractory to drug therapy 
when there is a suspected trigger than can be targeted for ablation.
9 The Substrate Mapping and 
Ablation in Sinus Rhythm to Halt Ventricular Tachycardia Study (SMASH- VT) randomized 
patients with a history of myocardial infarction who under went defibrillator implantation for 
spontaneous VT or VF, to either defibrillator implantation alone or defibrillator implantation plus substrate-based catheter ablation. In patients who underwent defibrillator implantation alone 33% 
received ICD therapies (anti-tachycardia pacing or shocks), compared to 12% in patients who 
received defibrillator implantation plus substrate -based catheter ablation (Hazard ratio in the 
ablation group, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.78, P=0.007).
10  Similar results were seen 
in another multicenter randomized trial of similar design, VTACH.  Despite the efficacy of VT ablation in these trials, this therapy is limited by: i) the complexity of the procedure requiring 
significant operator experience, ii) the duration of the procedure in these patients with ventricular 
dysfunction, iii) the potential risk of the procedure (despite the fact that no significant complications were seen in SMASH -VT and VTACH), and iv) SMASH-VT and VTACH only 
included the post -MI patient population since the substrate ablation approach is less applicable to 
patients with non- ischemic cardiomyopathy.  
Thus,
 anti-arrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation each have limitations as adjunctive therapy in 
patients at risk for ICD shocks; new strategies are needed. One strategy under investigation is renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN). Recently, RSDN has been developed as a therapy to treat hypertension in patients resistant to anti -hypertensive drug th erapy. In the Catheter- Based Renal 
Sympathetic Denervation for Resistant Hypertension (Symplicity HTN -1) Trial: a multicenter  
safety and proof-of- principle cohort study, 45 patients with a mean office blood pressure of 
177/101 mm Hg (SD 20/15), (mean 4.7 antihypertensive medications)  underwent renal sympathetic denervation with  radiofrequency based catheter ablation. After the procedure, these patients experienced a mean decrease in office blood pressure of -27/-17 mm Hg at 12 months, as 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 9 well as a 47% red uction in renal noradrenaline spillover.11 In the Renal Sympathetic Denervation 
in Patients with Treatment- Resistant Hypertension (Symplicity HTN -2) Trial, a multi -center 
prospective trial that randomized 106 patients to RSDN or medical management, at 6 months, 
84% of patients who underwent renal denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 
mm Hg or more, compared with 35% of controls (p<0·0001). 
RSDN
 is thought to decrease blood pressure by a number of mechanisms inc luding its ability to 
favorably affect whole body norepinephrine spillover and decrease central sympathetic tone. 
Indeed, RSDN has been shown to reduce whole body norepinephrine spillover by 42%, and 
efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity by 66%.12 Interestingly, increased catecholamine and 
sympathetic activity are both important factors in the development of ventricular arrhythmias.13-18 
In addition, chronic hypertension is believed to mediate pathogenesis and progression of cardiac 
arrhythmias via its remodeling effects on cardiac anatomy through the renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system.19    
Logic
ally, RSDN may be an effective therapy in the prevention of SCD from VT.  Interestingly, 
there are now several case report s examining the impact of RSDN for the tre atment of recurrent 
appropriate ICD shocks; two patients with ICDs for scar- related VT and CHF underwent RSDN 
for therapy resistant electrical storm. 20 One patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had 
recurrent monomorphic VT despite multiple endocardial and epicardial ablations, while the second patient with dilated non- ischemic cardiomyopathy suffered from recurrent polymorphic 
VT, and had declined catheter ablation therapy.  After undergoing RSDN, both patients experienced significantly less episodes of VT requiring ATP or shocks. Importantly, despite normal to low blood pressure at baseline, both patients ma intained a stable blood pressure at 6 
months of follow up post procedure. 
Rationale for RESCUE: 
Despit
e significant advances in the management of ventricular arrhythmias through the use of 
ICD therapy, AADs, and catheter-based ablation strategies, considerable challenges remain. The optimal method for the prevention of ICD shocks remains unclear. RSDN may be an effective 
tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and associated ICD therapies, by reducing central 
sympathetic tone, catecholamine levels, a nd the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although 
RSDN has been shown to reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of 2 patients suffering from electrical storm, to date no large prospective randomized study has evaluated the impact of RSDN in the p rimary prevention of ICD therapy in patients with ischemic or non- ischemic 
ventricular dysfunction. Also of note, there is data suggesting that RSDN may even decrease the rate of supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.  Thus, RESCUE will specifically 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of RSDN in the prevention of ICD therapy in patients with 
ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an ICD for either secondary prevention, or primary prevention if they have inducible VT by programmed ventric ular stimulation at the time of ICD 
implantation.  As an alternative to inducible VT, we will also utilize a non -invasive predictor of 
sudden cardiac death - fragmented QRS complex by 12- lead ECG  - as a criterion to identify 
candidates for RSDN. Fragmented  QRS, which is defined by the presence of notching in the R or 
S wave or the presence of a second R wave in two contiguous leads, has been recognized as a risk predictor for all -cause mortality with relative risk of 1.71 (95% CI 1.02- 2.85) and for sudden 
cardiac death with relative risk 2.20 (95% CI 1.05- 4.62) in a recent meta- analysis of studies 
involving patients with coronary disease or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.

3.1  INITIAL PILOT DATA: 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 10 In an initial pilot study, an irrigated radiofrequency catheter (Celsius Thermocool F- Curve  RF 
catheter, Biosense-Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, California) was used in 20 patients with ischemic 
or non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction, who were scheduled to r eceive an ICD for either i) 
secondary prevention, or ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation (V. Reddy, unpublished observation).  Although we 
have favorable single- operator, single- center safety data in another RSDN trial, preliminary 
review of the six -month renal ultrasound data provided a higher than expected event rate of renal 
artery stenosis.  As such, the protocol has been amended to allow for the use of a dedicated renal 
sympathetic denervation catheter system: the Vessix
TM Renal Denervation System (Boston 
Scientific, Quincy, Massachusetts).

implantation with a single renal sympathetic denervation p rocedure compared to patient s 
randomized to ICD implantation alone.

7. S TUDY PHASES:
This
 study is divided into two phases: the initial  phase (to include 50 patients) followed by the 
remaining 412 patients, for a total of 462 patients. The initial 50 subjects will be conducted at up 
to 10 sites (please see Section 1.1 for a listing of sites). An interim safety analysis for the primary 
endpoint will be conducted when the initial 50 subjects have completed the 6-month follow up 
visit. 
7.1  CLINICAL  CENTERS  
The st
udy will be conducted in up to 20 sites (with a maximum of 10 sites during the initial  
phase) in the United States and Europe.  Each clinical center will be required to obtain IRB approval for the protocol and consent (and their revisions) in a timely fashion, to recruit patients, 
to collect data and enter it accurately in the electronic data capture (EDC) system, to faithfully follow the protocol and adhere to the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  In addition, centers will be required to provide the DCC with the information necessary for interim, annual, 
and final reports, to provide source documents, data and regulatory documents for study monitors, 
provide prompt responses to DCC inquiries, and to participate in analyses and reporting of study 
results. 
7.1.1  INVESTIGATOR PROFILE 
All cardiologists, coordinators and other investigators in the study must complete the Investigator 
Profile form, including hospital affiliation, address, telephone, fax, beeper and email information. 
The cardiologist and coordinator must email or fax their CV, Conflict of Interest Statement and 
Financial Disclosure Certification, and Institutional Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Certificates to the DCC.  
7.1.2 Q UALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING 
Clinical investigators will be electrophysiologists with expertise in atrial fibrillation ablation.  The certified operator will either perform the ablation and renal denervation on their own patient, or participate in the ablation and renal denervation of an enrolled patient.  Sites will be limited to 
two operators per site.  The clinical site Principal Investigator will be responsible for overseeing 
the ongoing performance of the other participating investigator at that site over the course of the 
study.  
All 
clinical site investigators and coordinators will be trained by the DCC in the specifics of the 
protocol at a site initiation visit in advance of patient enrollment.  Each site will have technical 
support provided by Boston Scientific for each of its first five patients.  In addition, the 
investigators and coordinators will undergo a separate training session to gain familiarity with the 
electronic data capture system.

This statement verifies that all investigators have no conflict of interest with any institution that 
may influence their participation in this study.  All investigators need to complete this statement.  
Investigators will also submit a financial disclosure agreement.  
7.1.4 S ITE APPROVAL  
The following documents must be collected prior to site approval: 
•Clinical Study Agreement
•Clinical site IRB roster
•Clinical site IRB approval, version and date for protocol and consent
•Clinical Center Laboratory Certification
A signed agreement between the clinical site and the DCC ( Icahn School of Medicine at Mount 
Sinai) is required prior to site initiation.  Prior to enrolling a patient, representatives from the 
DCC will conduct a site initiation for  all investigators, coordinators, and any other health care 
professionals who may be involved in the study (e.g. engineers, social workers).  
8. P ATIENT ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL :
This 
will be a multicenter trial.  Patients meeting the study inclusion criteria will be identified in 
the outpatient or inpatient setting by one of the study sites’ primary or co-investigators.  In essence, patients will be followed by one of the study site primary or co -investigators.   Sites will 
be limited to enrollment of no more than 90 patients at their clinical site. 
The st
udy will typically be described (including the risks and benefits) during the initial clinic or 
hospital visit.  Consent will typically be obtained at the time of the initial assessment if it is clear  
that the patient truly understands the nature of the study.  Alternatively, the patient will be 
allowed to take a copy of the consent form home to contemplate whether they would like to be enrolled in the study.  A sample consent form can be found in Appendix 1.  Only patients who 
voluntarily provide consent will be included in this study.  Patients will be considered enrolled 
once they have signed informed consent.  Consent will be obtained prior to undergoing the 
ablation procedure. Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any point without 
compromising their medical care.   
Consen
t must be obtained either before, or within 24 hours of ICD placement. The patient may 
undergo ICD placement up to 1 month (30 days) before randomization. The patient must undergo 
either ICD placement and Renal Angiography (Control Group) or ICD placement and RSDN (Study/Experimental Group) within 1 month (30 days). 
8. 1 R
OLL-IN PHASE
Each s
ite has the option of enrolling one patient as part of a roll- in phase. Each roll -in patient will 
have renal angiography and renal sympathetic denervation performed.  Patient data on these roll-
in patients will not be used for the final analysis.  
•Roll-in 
patients will be required to sign the study ICF, but will not be randomized.
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 15 •Although the data will not be used for the primary analysis, patients will asked to adhere
to t
he same follow up schedule of visits as randomized patients.
•As per
 FDA, roll -in patients will count toward the enrol lment ceiling.
•The 
CRF must be adjusted to clearly reflect roll -in patients from randomized patients.

RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 17 9.1  PRE- AND ABLATION PROCEDURE  
9.1.1   PRE-PROCEDURE  
The 
following tests and procedures will occur before the ablation  (within 30 days prior to 
randomization unless stated below): 
•Recor
ding of patient medical history (including details of  VT both clinical/ICD)
•Recording medication history (including all AAD ever used, duration of use)
•Obtain β- HCG in females of child bearing age the morning of the procedure as per usual
clinical practice
•Baseline assessment of arrhythmia burden and type: Office/inpatient records , ICD
interrogation report
•If performed for any reason, collect any pre -procedural imaging: MRI/CT and Renal
Ultrasounds within 6 months of procedure
•Baseline laboratory, including complete blood count, standard electrolyte panel, renal
function, and bra in natriuretic peptide levels.
•Baseline Transthoracic Echocardiogram  within 3 months of procedure
•Baseline Office blood pressure.  Proper blood pressure measurement technique is
essential: i) patient should sit quietly in a chair with his/her back supported  for 5 minutes
before taking the measurement; ii) use of the correct cuff size with the air bladder
encircling at least 80% of the arm (the adult large cuff for the majority of patients); iii)
support the arm at heart level during the cuff measurement; iv)  a minimum of 2 readings
should be taken at intervals of at least 1 minute and the average of those readings should
be taken to represent the patient’s blood pressure; v) the blood pressure should be
measured
•Consent must be obtained either before, or with in 24 hours of ICD placement. The patient
may undergo ICD placement up to 1 month (30 days) before randomization. T he patient
must undergo ICD placement and Renal Angiography (Control Group) or  ICD placement
and RSDN (Study/Experimental Group)  within 1 month (30 days).  All ICDs must be
devices from Boston Scientific (either single- , dual-, subcutaneous, or biventricular
devices).
•Randomization into one of two groups will be performed by opening the Randomizationenvelope after Renal Angiography.
Study/Experimental Group:  These subjects will undergo catheter- based sympathetic renal 
denervation. 
Placebo Control Group : These subjects will receive no further intervention . 
            9.1.2    PRE-PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT  
Pati
ents should not  be taking any Class I or III anti -arrhythmic agents during this study unless 
required for atrial arrhythmia . After the ablation procedure, patients should receive either an 
antiplatelet agent (aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.) or anticoagulant (warfarin, dabiga tran, etc.) for at 
least 1 week.  Further decisions regarding the peri -procedural management of other 
cardiovascular (including anti- coagulant and anti -thrombotic agents) and non- cardiovascular 
medications should be as per clinical practice – but every eff ort should be made to maximize 
beta-blocker therapy, ACEI/ARB, and spironolactone therapy as per the guidelines.    
9.1.3 RENAL SYMPATHETIC ABLATION PROCEDURAL DETAILS  
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 18 •Pati
ents will be brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state
•Patien
t sedation or anesthesia will be administered according to standard EP lab protocol.
•Vascul
ar access will be achieved in standard fashion.
•IV h
eparinization will be instituted.  Full systemic anticoagulation will be instituted as per
standard hospital proced ures to a target ACT of 250 seconds or greater (or equivalent
level depending on testing system performed).
•Abdomina
l aortography will be performed to assess the renal arteries for the suitability of
catheter-based renal denervation  in all patients . For those patients in whom the
angiogram demonstrates that the renal anatomy is inappropriate for the RSDN procedure
(small renal arteries, extensive atherosclerosis, renal stenosis, etc.), the patient will be
excluded from the study as a screen failure. T he patient’s baseline information will be
collected but no further follow- up required (beyond assessing for any adverse events
related to the procedure).  If the renal arteries are deemed suitable for RSDN, the patient
will then undergo randomization.
•Randomi
zation will be done by permuted-block randomization centrally and will be
stratified by site. Allocation concealment shall be maintained at all sites by the use of a
web-based central randomization scheme. The operating physician controlling the
delivery of ablative energy will be aware of the outcome.  This approach has been
selected to minimize (1) study bias and (2) placebo effect. The randomization schema
will be blocked by size for each site.
•Cathe
ter-based sympathetic renal denervation will be performed  using the Vessix balloon
ablation catheter for denervation (see image below). The operating physician willmanipulate the ablation catheter into the renal arteries as per standard operating
procedures.

RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 19 •The Vessix catheter is available in various sizes, and can be used to treat arteries between
3 mm a
nd 7 mm in diameter and more than 20 mm in length.  Radiofrequency energy is
delivered via 8 electrodes to four distinct sites within the artery in a bipolar fashion.  As
with other renal denervation procedures, this catheter delivers four lesions in the artery
which are separated along the length of the artery and are also separated orthogonally in
different planes (anterior, inferior, posterior, and superior ).
•The Vessix generator is pre -programmed with a temperature- controlled treatment
algorithm.  Energy is delivered to achieve a temperature of 68oC.  Treatment time is 30
seconds.  Average power is approximately 1 watt per electrode and is displayed on thegenerator screen during treatment .  The system is designed to automatically deliver the
proper amount of energy to achieve the appropriate temperature.  The user does not need
to (nor can he/she) adjust or set any of the biophysical parameters when using t his
system. The generator uses a proprietary algorithm (including impedance measurement)
to determine appropriate apposition with the vessel wall.  Electrodes which do not haveappropriate apposition (such as those extending into the aorta) are automatically disabled
by the generator.
•Only one catheter placement is required in most renal arteries.   If the operator determines
that the initial placement is unsatisfactory to treat the full length of the artery, a secondactivation will be permitted in a different location. No more than two catheter activationswill be allowed in each renal artery.
•After delivery of a complete lesion (30 seconds), no further testing is required to ensure
renal denervation.  Physiologic endpoints for renal denervation have not been
standardized.
9.2 POST-PROCEDURE  
9.2.1 P OST-PROCEDURE FOLLOW UP 
•All 
patients will be monitored to verify vascular hemostasis prior to discharge from the
hospital.

month follow-up time point.  Once the final patient reaches the 18 month follow-up time point, all 
follow-ups will cease.  
9.2.2 P OST-PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT  
•Standa
rd cardiovascular medications are left up to the discretion of the investigator – but
BBLs, ACEI, ARBs and aldosterone antagonist use is recommended as per standardguidelines.

9.3 SAFETY 
We antici
pate no significant increase in adverse events as compared to the standard ICD 
implantation or renal angiography procedure. The local site primary investigator will oversee the 
safety of the study at his/her site.  All adverse events will be reported to the Data Coordinating 
Center (Icahn School of Medicine  at Mount Sinai). Adverse events will be monitored and tallied 
for each 50 patients enrolled in the study  and presented to the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
The PI will also be present at the meetings to relate any pertinent trial information.  However, 
recommendations are solely up to the discretion of the DSMB. 
9.3.1  I NTERIM ANALYSES  
An inter
im safety analysis will be performed after enrollment of the first 50 subjects ( 25 controls, 
25 study group) . This analysis will be presented to the DSMB, which has the authority to 
terminate the study prematurely if an increase in adverse events is encountered.  The trial will be 
terminated early if severe procedure -related adverse events occur in more than 15% of 
patients in the treatment arm.  If the DSMB determines the trial should be stopped early either 
because of safety concerns, or otherwise modified, the DSMB will prep are formal written 
recommendations to the PI to consider final action. Moreover, any pressing safety concerns that 
the DSMB identifies will be verbally communicated to the PI as soon as possible, prior to written 
documentation. 
9.3.2  C LINICAL EVENTS COMMITTEE 
A separate 
Clinical Events Committee (CEC) composed of 2 independent cardiologists / 
electrophysiologists  will adjudicate all ICD events in this study.  
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 22 9.3.3 D ATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD 
To m
eet the study's ethical responsibility to its subjects, an independent data safety monitoring 
board (DSMB) will monitor results during the study. The DSMB will act in a senior advisory 
capacity to the DCC regarding data and safety matters throughout the duration of the study. In 
addition, the DSMB will review interim summary results of the accumulating data from the Clinical Events Committee every 6 months or as needed. These data include adverse events (e.g., 
infection, bleeding, right heart failure) and mortality. They will communicate their findings 
directly with the DCC. The FDA will be provided a copy of any written communication from the 
DSMB to the study sponsor related to safety concerns, or changes to the study protocol, procedures or informed consent document. The DSMB will be provided a copy of any let ter from 
the FDA to the study sponsor related to safety concerns, or changes to the study protocol, 
procedures or informed consent document. The clinical centers will have no contact with the 
members of DSMB regarding this trial and no voting member of the committee may participate in 
the study as an investigator. Non-DSMB members will not be allowed during DSMB closed 
meetings. However, the PI will only be present at the open session of the meetings to clarify questions concerning the protocol and to provide updates to the DSMB regarding pertinent new 
trial information. However, recommendations and decisions regarding the study are solely up to 
the discretion of the DSMB. The DSMB will be composed of 2 cardiologists, 1 
electrophysiologist, 1 nephrologist and 1 biostatistician.  
9.4 RISKS 
ICD 
implantation will occur according to standard procedure, and therefore the risk includes that 
of a standard ICD implantation. In addition, the  risks of the renal sympathetic ablation and renal 
angiography procedure include:  
Common:  
•Discom
fort at the site of vascular access
•Groin hematoma
Uncommon:  
•Bleedi
ng
•Vascular injury
•Renal artery dissection
•Renal artery stenosis or occlusion
•Thromboembolism, including renal infarction and peripheral atheroembolism . This risk is
minimized considerably by the short duration of the procedure, as well as the use of asaline-irrigated ablation catheter.
•Risks associated with sedatives/anesthesia.
•Injury to adjacent structures (phrenic nerve, cardiac valves)
•Renal dysfunction potentially needing hemodialysis
•Vascular complications (including pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula requiring surgicalintervention)
•Radiation burns
•Pneumonia and/or sepsis
•Death
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 23 An adverse event is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a study patient, whether or not it is 
rela
ted to the study intervention.  Any condition that was recorded as pre- existing is not an AE 
unless there is a change in the nature, severity or degree of the condition.   
9.4.1 S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Serio
us adverse events are defined by FDA regulation as any experience that results in a fatality 
or is life threatening; results in significant or persistent disability; requires or prolongs a hospitalization; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or represents other signif icant 
hazards or potentially serious harm to research subjects or others, in the opinion of the investigators. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization. 
9.4.2 U NANTICIPATED SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
An unanti
cipated (unexpected) serious adverse event is any serious adverse event t hat is not 
protocol-defined or documented in the patient consent form.  Expedited reporting is required for serious adverse events that are unexpected.  
9.4.3 U NANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS 
An u
nanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
9.4.4  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
Accord
ing to the Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP), an Unanticipated Problem 
(UP) generally includes any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protoc ol-related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied; and (2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in 
this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
(3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Base
d on the definitions above and as illustrated below (per OHRP guidance), many adverse 
events are not unanticipated problems, and many unanticipa ted problems are not adverse events. 
However, some adverse events are also unanticipated problems. For example, a serious adverse event that is unexpected and at least possibly related to study participation is also by definition an 
unanticipated problem. As stated above, an unanticipated problem may not necessarily be an 
adverse event, which is the case when the problem does not cause actual physical harm to 
participants. For example, if a laptop computer with sensitive, identifiable study data is stolen, 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 24 this theft places the participants at greater risk of psychological or social harm; this is an 
unantic
ipated problem that is not an adverse event. Another example of an unanticipated problem 
that is not an adverse event is if the FDA announces that one of the study drugs is tainted (e.g., 
with paint chips), yet no participant experiences any adverse effects.  
9.4.5 E VENT RECORDING  
The fo
llowing adverse events will be captured throughout the period of trial participation: 
oProtocol-defined (as described above)
oSerious unanticipated events (serious “Other” adverse events)
9.4.6 C AUSALITY  
The 
investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the intervention.  The 
investigator should distinguish the relationship between the event and (a) ablation procedure (i.e. 
AF ablation procedure or other concomitant procedures), and (b) renal sympathetic denervation.  
Causality will be defined as follows:  
Probabl
e 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, are considered with a high degree 
of certainty to be related to the intervention (AF ablation ± renal sympathetic 
denervation). The following characteristics will apply:  
oA reasonable temporal relationship exists between the event and the intervention,and 
oThe event is a known reaction to the intervention, and cannot be explained by an
alternative etiology commonly occurring in the population/individual. 
Possible 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a 
probable relationship to the intervention, but for which a connection cannot be ruled out 
with certainty. The following cha racteristics will apply: 
oThe ev
ent occurs after intervention, and
oThe event is not a known reaction to intervention, but cannot be explained by a
commonly occurring alternative etiology
Unlikely 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a possible or probable relationship to the intervention and for which a connection is 
unlikely. The following characteristics will apply:  
oThe event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration ofthe intervent ion, or
oMay have been produced by environmental factors, and there is no apparent
pattern of response to the intervention.
9.4.7 R
EPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE 
EFFECTS  
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 25 All investigators must report both expected (protocol-defi ne d) and unexpected SAEs. All protocol 
defined SAEs must be reported directly to the clinical center’s IRB and the DCC within 10 
business days of knowledge of the event, or as dictated by the specif ic IRB policy, whichever is 
sooner.  All deaths, UADEs , and unexpected SAEs that are possibly or probably related to the 
renal sympathetic denervation must be reported to the DCC and the clinical center’s IRB within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event, or as dictated by the specific IRB policy, whichever is sooner.  All unexpected SAEs that are unlikely related to the study intervention must be reported 
to the DCC and the clinical center’s IRB within 5 business days of knowledge of the event, or as 
dictated by the specific IRB policy, whichever is sooner.  
The DC
C will report these events to the DSMB chair within 72 hours of notification.  All SAEs 
will be reported to the DSMB at least semi-annually, at the discretion of the DCC medical 
monitor.   
9.4.8 R EPORTING OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
All UPs th
at are also SAEs, which are at least possibly related to the study intervention, must be 
reported to the DCC within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  All UPs that are not SAEs must 
be reported to the DCC within 5 calendar days of knowledge of the event, or as dictated by the specific IRB policy, whichever is sooner.  
9.4.9 DCC REPORTING TO FDA 
The DC
C will report unexpected SAEs that are possibly or probably related to the investigational 
device or UADEs to FDA as appropriate. The DCC will send an initial IDE safety report communication to the FDA within 2 business days of notification from the site. The DCC will 
submit a follow-up safety communication to the FDA, based on source documentation or PI Report from the site, within 10 business days from notification of a UADE for this IDE trial.  
10. S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
10.1  S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, multi -center, parallel groups, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial.  
Patients with  ischemic or non -ischemic ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an ICD for 
either 1) secondary prevention, or 2) primary prevention + inducible VT by programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation will be randomly assigned using a 1:1 
allocation to treatment to ICD alone or ICD +  RSDN. Randomization will be stratified by center. 
Our study will include U.S. as well as European sites. We do not anticipate that the two populations will be different.  We expect the U.S. population to include 85% Caucasian and the 
EU population to be 100% Caucasian.  
Befor
e conducting the primary analysis we will compare the two populations with respect to 
baseline characteristics. If a difference is found, the region will be included in all our models as a 
covariate. We do not anticipate that the treatment effect will be differential in EU and the U.S. 
This hypothesis will be formally tested using an interaction term in our models. 
10.2  P RIMARY OBJECTIVES :   
The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of RSDN in the primary prevention of ICD 
therapy in patients with ischemic or non- ischemic ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 26 ICD for either i) secondary prevention, or ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by programmed 
ventr
icular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation.   
10.3  P RIMARY EFFECTIVENESS  ENDPOINT : 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is time to first event requiring any ICD therapy (appropriate or inappropriate) or Incessant VT (VT occurring below the ICD rate cut- off); this will be assessed 
in the on- treatment patient cohort. An event requiring ICD therapy is defined as an anti-
tachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock therapy.  The null hypothesis of interest is that there will be no difference between the two treatment arms in the time to first event requiring any ICD  therapy 
(appropriate or inappropriate) or Incessant VT in patients randomized to ICD implantation with a single renal sympathetic denervation procedure compared to patients randomized to ICD implantation alone.  
10.4  P
RIMARY SAFETY OBJECT IVE: 
The primary safety objective is to demonstrate that the incidence of serious adverse events (events that cause clinically relevant changes in patient’s health, or any event that is life-threatening, results in a fatality, results in permanent disability, requires hospitalization, or 
prolongs an existing hospital stay) is not increased with the use of the ICD + RSDN compared to 
ICD alone. 
10.5  S
ECONDARY ENDPOINTS : 
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed: 
•Appropriate ICD therapy assessed in the full intenti on-to-treat patient cohort
•Inappropriate ICD therapy
•Number of Hospitalizations for Cardiovascular Causes.
•Total VT burden (Number of episodes).
•All-Cause Mortality.
•The occurrence of ICD storm, defined as ≥3 appropriate shock therapies within 24 hours.
•Differences in BUN/creatinine measurements.
•Procedure related adverse events including, but not limited to hematomas,
pseudoanuerysms and renal artery stenosis.
•Development of orthostatic hypotension
•30-day Major Complication Rate defined as death, stroke, MI or any other serious
adverse events related to the treatment or procedure within the first 30 days or through
hospital discharge (whichever is longer).
10.6  P OWER AND SAMPLE SIZE 
Power for this study was determined based on the following operating characteristics: (a) two sided type I error fixed at 0.0492, assuming one interim analysis , (b) 85% power, (c) minimum 
follow-up of 18 months, (d) 18-months event rate in the ICD alone group of 19% (e) expected 18-
month relative rate reduction in the ICD + RSDN group of ≥ 40%, accrual period of 48 months 
and non-uniform accrual. 
Under the above assumptions it is estimated that 70 events (or 462 patients) will be required to 
detect a relative decrease in the relative event rate reduction requiring any ICD therapy ≥ 40% in 
the ICD + RSDN compared to the ICD alone group (19% vs. 11.4%) (Lachin, 1981).   Lost to Follow Up :  The term “lost to follow -up” is used to define an individual who has 
withdrawn consent to be in the study or who can no longer be located or assessed.  Such 
individuals represent those for whom primary outcome assessment is no longer possible.  Since the primary outcome will be assessed by interrogating the ICD and since patients come back to 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 27 the hospital for regular check we do not anticipa te a hig h rate of lost to follow-up. The estimated 
sample size accounts for 5% attrition due to withdrawal of consent.  
10.7  I NTERIM MONITORING GUIDELINES  
The objectives of interim monitoring are to (1) monitor for safety, (2) track participant accrual 
rates, and (3) monitor the primary and secondary outcomes for early evidence of efficacy, harm or futility.  To accomplish this, summaries of data quality, accrual, adherence, distribution of 
baseline factors, toxicity, study endpoints and other analyses as requested will be prepared for 
review by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMB).  
The primary outcome of the trial, rate of first event requiring any ICD therapy , is the basis for 
formal interim analysis plan that follows. One interim analysis and on e final analysis are planned 
for this trial, for a total of 2 analyses.  These analyses will be performed when 0.5 and 1.0 fraction 
of the total number of events will have been observed.  Since this study will have a target number 
of events of 70, we will have approximately 35 events observed between each analysis time.  
We will use an alpha-spending O’Brien-Fleming sequential procedure as a guideline for decision 
making.  At the interim analysis the value of the test statistic will be compared with the alpha 
spending function critical values. The two alpha values will be set at 0.0054 at the interim 
analysis and 0.0492 at the final analysis, which equate to critical values of 2.782 and 1.967 
respectively. This monitoring plan maintains the overall type I error at 0.05, given one interim 
analysis. 
10.8  S
TATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The primary analysis will be an intent -to-treat analysis that will include all randomized 
participants regardless of treatment actually received or follow -up schedule. 
Point Estimation and Interval Estimation : We will report maximum likelihood estimates for point 
estimation.  For routine reporting, two- sided 95% confidence intervals for all parameters will be 
prepared. 
Disposition of Participants and Baseline Comparisons:  Summaries of all pa rticipants randomized 
and the number who complete visits at 30-days, and every 6 months after the day of 
randomization will be provided for each treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared 
at baseline with respect to demographics, baseline measurements related to efficacy and baseline 
measurements related to safety.  
Univariate Analysis:   All outcome measures will be described in a univariate analysis.  For 
continuous variables means and standard deviations will be calculated.  For discrete and dichotomous variables we will use contingency tables.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:    The primary endpoint of this study is defined time to first event 
requiring any ICD therapy (appropriate or inappropriate) or Incessant VT (VT occurring below the ICD rate cut -off); this will be assessed in the on -treatment patient cohort. An event requiring 
ICD therapy is defined as an anti -tachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock therapy. Time to event will 
be estimated using Kaplan -Meier curves. Survival time will be defined as the time (in months) 
between randomization and the occurrence of first ICD therapy.  To compare the ICD+ RSDN 
arm with the ICD alone arm we will use a stratified log -rank statistic (using the stratification 
variables from the randomization procedure).  A Cox proportional hazards model with treatment 
and other important prognostic factors as covariates will be used for the multivariate analysis of 
the times to first ICD therapy.  Risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals will be computed.  
Patients wil l be included in the analysis as censored if they are alive and free of ICD events at the 
end of the 18-month follow-up period.  Although we do not anticipate interactions between 
treatment and stratification factors, formal tests for interactions will be assessed using 
proportional hazards models. A formal test of proportional hazards will assess the significance of 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 28 the interaction between the indicator for treatment group and log (t) in a Cox proportional hazards 
regr
ession model that also includes the main effect for the randomization group. The final 
analysis will be based on a two tailed 0.0492 level test.  
Analysis of Secondary End- points:  All continuous variables will be analyzed using mixed effects 
models (Bagiella et al. 2000; Diggle et al. 1994; Laird and Ware 1982).  Log- transformations will 
be used, if necessary to normalize the variables or stabilize the variance.  For binary and discrete outcomes we will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) (Liang and Zeger 1986; Miller et 
al. 1993; Zeger and Liang 1986) to fit logistic or log -linear models that account for the 
dependency of the repeated measures.  
Missing Data:  For participants who withdraw consent to participate we will use all the 
information available up to the time of withdrawal. For the purpose of the primary analysis these 
patients will be censored at the time of withdrawal if they have not experienced the primary event. For all other variables, if the data are missing at random (MAR), that is, the probability of 
being missing depends only on observed values (Little and Rubin 1987), then likelihood- based 
methods such as mixed -effects models will be used for analysis without bias.  If the fraction of 
missing data is small we expect that even non -ignorability can have only little effect on the final 
estimates.  If the extent of missingness is large compared to the effect size, we will use the 
multiple imputation procedure proposed by Rubin (1997) and Little (1996).  
10.9  P
RIMARY SAFETY ANALYSIS 
The primary assessment of safety will be based on the incidence of all serious adverse events over 
the total duration of study follow-up. The between group comparisons of incidence of serious 
adverse events will be estimated using the incidence rate ratio and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals based on Poisson regression.    
11.0 STUDY 
MANAGEMENT  
11.1  S TUDY DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
The C
ase Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF 
must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must be 
kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study.  Patients will be identified by a 
5 digit number and their initials.  The investigator must keep a sep arate log of patient names and 
medical record numbers (or other personal identifiers) for their own reference. All study -related 
documents (CRFs, source medical records, regulatory binder must be kept in a secure, locked environment with access limited to study personnel only.  
The PI is responsible for ensuring the following at his/her site: 1) adherence to the protocol; 2) verifying adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research; and 3) ensuring completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  
Final CRFs in human readable format must be reviewed and verified for accuracy by the study site Principal Investigator and signed -off.  A copy of the final CRF will remain at the 
investigator’s site at the completion of the study. 
The CRF numbering convention is as follows: 
_01_-_2_ _3__4_ A - B -A 
_01_: Site # must be 2 digits (use leading zero) --- (sites 01 -10) 
_2_ _3__4_: patient  screening/enrollment # (001 – 500) — must be 3 digits 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 29 A-B-A: Patient initials (if no middle initial, use dash) 
Total 5 digits and initials for enrolled patients.  
11.2 C ONFIDENTIALITY  
Pati
ent information will be kept confidential and managed according to the 1996 HIPAA 
guidelines. All patient information will be de -identified and stored in a secure, locked 
environment. Each patient will be given a unique subject number and will be identified by this 
number and their initials. All data used in the analysis and reporting of this evaluation will be 
without identifiable reference to the patient. D ata relating to the study might be made available to 
third parties (for example in case of an audit performed by regulatory authorities) provided the 
data are treated confidential and that the patient’s privacy is protected.   
11.3 D EVIATIONS FROM PROTOCOL  
The 
investigator will not deviate from the protocol except in medical emergencies or in 
unforeseen, isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase the patient’s risk or affect the validity of the trial.  In medical emergencies, p rior approval for protocol 
deviations will not be required, but the IRB/EC must be notified within five days of the incident. 
11.4  W
ITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS 
A subj
ect may withdraw from the study at any time should they choose to do so.  Additionally, 
subjects may be withdrawn by the investigator if deemed appropriate due to safety or compliance 
issues. 
11.5  E CONOMIC IMPACT ON SUBJECTS 
The c
atheter-based renal sympathetic denervation procedure is part of a research study and is 
investigational . The cost of the renal sympathetic denervation procedure and follow-up will be the 
responsibility of the subject or the subject’s insurance carrier.  No payment will be made to the subject for taking part in this study.  
12.0  ET
HICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1  R ISK TO SUBJECTS : 
Althou
gh it is unlikely, it is possible there may be loss of confidentially.  This is a typical risk of 
any research study.  Stenosis, dissection, and groin complications are possible clinical risks however they are not anticipated risks in this trial.  
12.2  P OTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS: 
Afte
r undergoing RSDN, patients may experience less episodes of VT requiring ATP or shocks a 
result of the expected reduction  in whole body norepinephrine spillover  and sympathetic nerve 
activity. 
12.3  R OLE OF THE DATA COORDINATING CENTER 
As pr
incipal investigator and study sponsor of this clinical study, Vivek Y. Reddy, MD assumes 
the overall responsibility for the conduct of the study, including assurance that t he study meets 
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 30 national and institutional guidelines for study conduct.  In this study, Vivek Y. Reddy, MD will 
have cer
tain direct responsibilities and will delegate other responsibilities to his staff at the Data 
Coordinating Center  at Icahn School of Me dicine at  Mount Sinai. Together, the Data 
Coordinating C enter will: 1) ensure adherence to the national and institutional regulations; 2) 
develop and distribute protocols and case report forms; 3) coordinate data organization; 4) perform statistical analys es. 
12.4  O NSITE MONITORING  
The pri
mary objectives of the DCC in monitoring clinical sites are to educate, support, identify 
and resolve issues related to the clinical trial.   The monitors will discuss the protocol in detail, 
and clarify any areas of uncertainty.   At initiation of the study, the monitors will conduct a 
tutorial on the EDC system.   The coordinators will practice entering data so that the monitors can 
confirm that the coordinators are proficient in all aspects of data entry, query response, and 
communication with the data management team.  
The 
DCC will employ a risk -based approach to monitoring for this study.  This will be 
accomplished via centralized or remote monitoring of data via the EDC with a focus on safety, 
study endpoints, data completion and data outliers.  The DCC will also centrally monitor study 
logs including the Informed Consent Log, the Protocol Violation/Deviation Log and the Serious Adverse Event Log periodically to ensure that the sites are adhering to the study protoco l and 
procedures. The DCC will generate performance metrics to analyze site characteristics such as recruitment rates and timeliness of data entry.   This will allow the DCC to identify trends across 
sites and to address low -performing sites appropriately.  
The DC
C will also conduct one on- site monitoring visit each year for every clinical site for the 
duration of the study.  In addition, interim monitoring will be conducted on an ongoing basis using the EDC system.   During the annual on- site monitoring visits, the monitor will collect 
copies of any source documents (de- identified) for all deaths and AEs.   Prior to each EAC 
meeting copies of any source documents (de- identified) requested by the DCC must be sent via 
FedEx or secure fax line to the DCC.  
The mon
itors will review the source documents to determine whether the data reported in the 
EDC system are complete and accurate.   They will also verify that all serious and protocol -
defined adverse events exist on the source documents, are consistent with t he protocol and are 
documented in the appropriate format.  Source documents include medical charts, initial hospital 
admission reports, operative procedure records, discharge and re-admission reports, consult notes, 
radiology reports, lab reports, clinic r ecords, and other study-related notes. The study monitors 
reserve the right to copy de- identified records in support of all adverse events and outcomes.  
The 
monitors will also confirm that the regulatory (administrative) binder is complete and that all 
associated documents are up to date.  The regulatory binder should include all revisions of the 
protocol and informed consent, IRB roster, IRB approvals for all of the above documents, IRB 
correspondence, investigator’s agreements, CVs of all study personne l, institutional HIPAA 
certificates, monitor site visit log, telephone contact log, a study device log and correspondence 
with the DCC.  
If a pr
oblem is identified during the visit (i.e., poor communication with the DCC, inadequate or 
insufficient staff to  conduct the study, missing study documents, etc.), then the monitor will assist 
the site in resolving the issue.   Some issues may require input from the Steering Committee or the 
Principal Investigator, as well as the sponsor.  
RESCUE Version 3.1, October 20 , 2016 31 The com
bination of yearly on-site monitoring and ongoing monitoring using the EDC system that 
includes instantaneous electronic validation, and visual cross-validation to detect complex errors, 
it is anticipated that the best possible quality and most complete data will be collected .  
The 
monitor will verify a minimum of the following variables for all patients: initials, date of 
birth, sex, signed informed consent, eligibility criteria, date of randomization, anticoagulation, 
serious and protocol -defined adverse events, and mortali ty.  These data will be 100% source data 
verified.  All other data collection will be monitored as indicated by the data completeness and 
accuracy at each clinical site.  
12.5  M AINTAINING RECORDS (21 CFR 812. 140 (B)) 
The Dat
a Coordinating C enter will maintain copies of correspondence, data, shipment of devices, 
adverse device effects and other records related to the clinical trial.   
12.6  S ITE RECORD RETENTION POLICY 
All clinic
al sites will maintain study records for two years after  research termination. 
12.7  I NSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) / ETHICS COMMITTEE (EC) INFORMATION  
This
 protocol and the informed consent must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
IRB/EC where the trial is to be conducted before enrollment of patients.  Changes to the protocol 
that may increase the risk or present new risks to the patient, or may adversely affect the validity 
of the trial, must be approved in writing by the IRB/EC before the change is made.  
The 
study site Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for submitting and obtaining initial and 
continuing review (at intervals not greater than once a year) of the trial by their IRB/EC.  
13.0  DATA HANDLING  
Inform
ation about patients will be kept confidential and managed according to the requir ements 
of the United States of American Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed patient authorization informing the patient of the 
following:  
1. What p
rotected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients.
2. Who will have access to that information and why.
3. Who w
il
l use or disclose that information.
4. Th
e r
ights of a research patient to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.
In t
he event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization. For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the patient is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled registry period.

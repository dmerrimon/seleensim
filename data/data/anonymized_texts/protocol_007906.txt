Brief Summary:  9 
This trial , part of a multi -year comprehensive intervention,  is located in pediatric practices and 10 
health systems within the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatric Research in Office Settings 11 
(PROS) Network . Most adolescents who receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are 12 
vaccinated in pediatric practices, yet missed opportunities (MOs) for HPV vaccination occur 13 
often and lead to low HPV vaccination rates. This cluster randomized cl inical trial (RCT) will test 14 
the effectiveness (and cost -effectiveness) of training providers on HPV vaccine communication 15 
to reduce MOs and increase HPV vaccination rates.  16 
 17 
Methods and Procedures  18 
 For this first part of the intervention, there are 2 study  periods. We will randomize by practice 19 
(not provider) to avoid contamination. We will assess missed opportunities (MOs) and HPV 20 
vaccine rates using monthly  and period -aggregate  data, excluding the periods of ramping up of 21 
each intervention.   22 
Period 0 : This is the 12 -month baseline period.     23 
Period 1 : Arm -1 practices will receive communication skills training. Arm -2 control practices 24 
will receive standard of care.  The duration of the communication intervention period will be 6 25 
months.    26 
  27 
All analyses will be stratified by visit type (well or sick) and dose (initial vs subsequent).  We 28 
consider MOs by visit type and dose separately as we hypothesized that MOs for different visit 29 
types and doses are driven by different factors. For the test of this commun ication intervention, 30 
we hypothesized that since almost all HPV vaccinations (and nearly 100% of initial doses) are 31 
provided during well -child care visits, an intervention focused upon communication may be 32 
potentially effective especially during well -child care visits.  33 
 34 
Future interventions that focus upon changing practice procedures (e.g., providing feedback to 35 
providers with suggestions for utilizing sick/chronic visits, or prompts to remind providers to to 36 
consider  HPV vaccinations) may have more of an  impact at sick/chronic visits  and for 37 
subsequent doses.   38

Intervention Model Description: This study will use a cluster RCT study design to test the impact 51 
of the communi cation intervention to reduce missed opportunities (MOs) and raise HPV vaccine 52 
rates.   53 
 54 
Arms and Interventions:  55 
 Arm 1 will receive the STOP -HPV communication intervention  56 
 Arm 2 will receive standard of care  57

Inclusion and Exclusion criteria  61 
Practice Inclusion Criteria : 62 
 The practice provides HPV vaccination services to adolescents.  63 
 The practice is part of Physician's Computer Company (PCC), Office Practicum (OP) or 64 
(a) yet -to-be selected health system(s).  65 
 The practice has had the same EHR system in pla ce for a year or more (with special 66 
consideration on a case by case basis if they are close to but not do not reach a year).  67 
 The practice agrees to not participate in other HPV -related QI projects or research 68 
interventions during the study period (with spe cial consideration on a case by case 69 
basis).  70 
 71 
Practice Exclusion Criteria : 72 
 The practice plans to change EHR systems in the next three years.  73 
 The practice participated in the last year, is currently engaged in, or plans to participate 74 
in an office -based HPV-related quality improvement (QI) project or research intervention 75 
during the study period (with special consideration on a case by case basis).  76 
 Estimated 20% or more of adolescents at the practice receive HPV vaccinations at 77 
schools or health departmen t clinics (given standard practice and published data, the 78 
investigators expect that few to no practices will need to be excluded based on this 79 
restriction).  80 
 81 
Patient inclusion criteria : 82 
 All patients of participating practices (intervention and comparison)  aged 11 -17 years 83 
who have at least 1 visit to the practice within the past two years.  84 
 85 
Patient exclusion criteria : 86 
 None apart from age of patients (above).  87

Main Outcomes and Measures  90 
Primary Outcome Measures : 91 
1. Rate and change in the rate of missed vacci nation opportunities among all clinicians 92 
[ Time  Frame:  Monthly from months 0 (baseline) to month 6, and also aggregated over 93 
the 6 -month period from month 0, where month 0 is site specific and depends on 94 
completion of site staff training and readiness to proceed.  ] 95 
Change in the rate of missed vaccination opportunities from baseline through the end 96 
of the communication intervention period among all clinicians.  97 
2. Rate and change in the rate of missed vaccination opportunities among consenting 98 
clinicians [ Time  Frame:  Monthly from months 0 (baseline) to month 6, and also 99 
aggregated over the 6 -month period from month 0, where month 0 is site specific and 100 
depends on completion of site staff training and readiness to proceed.  ] 101 
Change in the rate of missed va ccination opportunities from baseline through the end 102 
of the communication intervention period among consenting clinicians.  103 
Analysis  104 
Primary Analysis  105 
All analyses will be stratified by visit type (well or sick) and dose (initial vs subsequent). Visit- 106 
level analyses will implement marginal models (such as estimated with generalized estimating 107 
equations (GEE) (Fitzmaurice 2011) to estimate relative and absolute changes in rates between 108 
intervention and control practices, and over time. These method s facilitate estimation of 109 
standardized (for patient -level characteristics)  (Korn and Graubard 1999) rates of MOs over 110 
time. Assumptions include a large number of practice sites (Hayes and Moulton 2017), an 111 
assumption that our study satisfies for comparis ons of all 48 sites.  With fewer than 40 clusters, 112 
however, some form of correction is warranted to correct confidence bounds.  (Huang 2016).  113 
GEE methods will use marginal mean models with a logit link (binary family) as is appropriate 114 
for binary outcomes  for missed opportunities.  The clustering level will be the practice site for all 115 
analyses.   This approach will not consider clustering of clinicians within practice site.   This 116 
approach will also not consider the repeated measures of visits within child .    Children are not 117 
nested within clinician, as a child can be seen by more than one clinician.    118 
 119 
GEE methods will produce robust standard errors and respective confidence bounds directly for 120 
odds ratios. Odds ratios, however, are not easy to interpret  for even rates that are common.  For 121 
that reason , we will transform log odds estimates and their ratios into risk ratios and risk 122 
differences, and then use the delta method to estimate robust confidence bounds on the risk 123 
difference scale.  Secondary analyses will include standardization by visit and pat ient-level 124 
factors prior to transformation.  125 
 126 
Survey methods provide a computational alternative to GEE methods , which can fail with large 127 
cluster sizes, and assume independence working correlation structures.   Survey methods will 128 
be used to replace GEE al gorithms if the GEE algorithms fail.   Such failure can occur when 129 
clusters (practice sites) are large.   SAS, Stata, and R all have survey algorithms for logit link 130 
model.      131 
 132 
Confidence bounds , alternatively,  will be generated using percentile -based, b ootstrap 133 
resampling of the practices to account for correlation of visit -level measures within practices  to 134 
verify the validity of robust standard errors output by standard GEE procedures (Davison 1997)  135 
at our sample size  of practices.  Confidence bounds ba sed on resampling will protect again st 136 
large -sample assumption s made by standard implementations of GEE (Goodman 1994).   137 
 138 
Programs for resampling are well described in R (Cluster.Bootstrap (2018), Stata, and in SAS 139 
(PROC SURVEY SELECT).   We will use which ever one is easiest.   140 
 141 
Secondary Analysis  142 
Person -level analyses (vaccination rates) will employ the same marginal model methods as 143 
visit-level analyses.  144

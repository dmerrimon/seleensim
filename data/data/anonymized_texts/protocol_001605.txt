2.1 Background and Rationale  
 
Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy : are they success ful? There have been numerous rando mized 
clinical trials (RCT) examining lifestyle interventions for obese women during pregnancy . These RCTs had 
primary outcomes that included avoiding excess ive gestational weight gain (GWG), and decreasing 
adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational diabetes (GDM), preeclampsia and large for 
gestational age (LGA) neonates (17,18,19,20,21). A recent Danish RCT  on lifestyle intervention

 consisting of dietary guidance , free fitness club membership, and personal coach ing initiated between 10-14 
weeks’ gestation (18) reported that althoug h there was a decrease in GWG in the intervention group (7.0 
vs. 8.6 kg, p=0.01), paradox ically infants in the lifestyle intervention group had higher birth weight (3,742 
vs. 3,593 g, p=0.04) compared to controls. Other recen t RCTs (UPBEA T and the Norwegian Fit for 
Delivery Trial) suggest that behav ioral lifestyle interventions do not preven t GDM or reduc e the incidenc e 
of LGA babies desp ite reduc ing maternal dietary glycemic load, GWG, and maternal skinfold measures, and 
increasing phys ical activity (22,23).  At least five meta-analyses published in the past four years, all conc luded 
that lifestyle interventions initiated during pregnancy , while having some succes s in reduc ing excess ive 
GWG, had minimal positive effects on adve rse pregnanc y outcomes including decreasing fetal overgrowth 
(24, 25, 26, 27, 28 ). Althoug h some advoca te weight loss in obese women during pregnan cy, these 
recommenda tions are based on extrapolation of epidemiological data (29, 30, 31 ). Inves tigators in the 
UPBEA T trial noted that increasing the intensity and duration of the lifestyle intervention was likely to 
be impractical for most obese women (22) Further, we reported an increased risk of small for gestational 
age (SGA ) neona tes and decreased lean body mass (head circumference and length) in neona tes of 
overweight/obese women with inadequa te GWG (32). 
 
Post-delivery weight loss: is it possible and safe, and what is the effect on subsequen t pregnanc ies? 
Publications related to postpartum weight loss have been primarily retrospec tive coho rt studies reporting 
that ~10-20% of overweight/obese women had a decrease in weight between pregnanc ies (33, 34, 35, 36 ).  
The interval between pregnanc ies was 12 months in 30% and 24-36 months in 40-57% of subjects (34, 
37). Inter-pregnanc y weight loss in overweight/obese women was assoc iated with a decreased risk of GDM 
or preeclampsia (35, 36, 38, 39 ) in a subsequen t pregnancy . Three studies reported a decreased incidenc e 
of LGA in overweight/obese women who had an inter-pregnanc y decrease of as little as 1-2 BMI units 
(34, 37, 38 ). The inter-pregnanc y decrease in weight was not assoc iated with an increased risk of SGA 
infants (34). 
 
Four RCT s reported that postpartum lifestyle intervention was effective in facilitating weight loss compared 
to a control group. Love lady reported weight loss of 0.5 kg/week between 4-14 weeks postpartum in 
overweight women who were breastfeeding. Weight loss did not affect infant growth (40). Similarly, 
Colleran reported that a 16-week diet and exercise intervention resulted in a 5.8 kg weight loss in 
overweight and obese lactating women without adve rse effects on infant growth (41). Stenda ll-Hollis 
showed that overweight women, most of whom were exclusively breastfeeding, lost 3-4% of body weight 
and significantly decreased biomarkers of inflammation (42). O’Toole reported a mean 5.6 kg weight loss 
at 12 weeks; weight loss was primarily fat mass (43). A recent meta-analysis of 11 studies with 769 subjects 
reported a significant mean -2.57 kg (95% CI -3.6 to -1.5) weight loss in the intervention group. In a 
subg roup analysis, the most effective interventions were those with objective goals; use of heart rate 
monitors, pedo meters, and exercise combined with intensive dietary intervention, and these interventions 
produce d a -4.1 kg (95% CI -5.2 to -3.5) weight loss (44). Therefore, supervised intensive lifestyle 
intervention in overweight and obese postpartum women is feasible, efficacious, and safe, in lactating 
women. The concep t that lifestyle intervention before pregnanc y is necessa ry to improve placen tal function 
and fetal deve lopment is strongly suppo rted by scientific and clinical observations, and is gaining traction as 
a viable paradigm to improve perinatal metabolic outcomes (45). 
 
Summary: Lifestyle intervention initiated during pregnan cy helps reduc e excess ive GWG; however, it 
has not been success ful in reduc ing fetal overgrowth. Based on our research we conc lude that lifestyle 
intervention needs  to be initiated prior to concep tion. Just as women with pre-existing diabetes need to 
normalize glucose before pregnanc y to decrease the risk of congen ital anomalies, obese women must improve 
metabolic cond itioning before pregnanc y to decrease complications of fetal overgrowth during pregnanc y 
(46).  We reported an increased expression of lipogen ic and inflammatory gene s in placen ta of obese women 
in the early first trimester, before any pheno typic chang e beco mes appa rent (47). The intervention propose d 
in this application includes an established exercise, diet and behav ioral modification program that have 
proven, through prospec tive RCTs, to be success ful in improving overall metabolic function by decreasing

 body weight/adiposity in obese non-pregnan t individuals (48). Collectively these data provide evidenc e 
that lifestyle intervention initiated prior to concep tion will have short- and long-term bene fit for the mother 
and her baby . 
Relevant Preliminary Data  by PI and Co -Is 
Maternal obesity/hyperinsulinemia affects placental growth and gene expression in early 
pregnancy.  Lean and obese women were recruited prior to a planned pregnancy and underwent 
longitudinal clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT). There was a 3.7 -fold 
increase in insulin response to the IVGTT in obese vs. lean women. The increase in in sulin 
response in early pregnancy correlated with placental growth and fetal adiposity at term (r=0.64, 
p=0.0001) (59).  
Increased insulin response in obese women results in altered expression of placental lipid 
metabolism genes. We recruited 48 lean and obese women scheduled for elective first trimester 
termination. After metabolic evaluations placentas were obtained for mo lecular analysis. At 9 
weeks gestation, insulin resistance, leptin, IL -6 and C -reactive protein (CRP) were increased in 
obese vs. lean subjects. CRP correlated with maternal BMI and insulin sensitivity. Using global 
gene profiling analysis of trophoblast c ells, we identified 355 genes differentially regulated in 
obese vs. normal weight women. Pathway analysis revealed a significant decrease in the 
expression of genes regulating β - oxidation, cho lesterol and steroid synthesis.  
Since β -oxidation and initial steps of steroid biosynthesis occur in mitochondria, these data 
suggest impairment of trophoblast mitochondrial function during early pregnancy in insulin 
resistant ob ese women. We further postulate  that in obese women, hyperinsulinemia and/or 
defective insulin action alter placental gene expression. We cultured first trimester human 
trophoblast cells, with and without insulin (100 nM), to investigate insulin effects. In trophoblasts 
derived from lea n women, 2,875 genes were di fferentially regulated by insulin, whereas only 87 
genes  were regulated in obese women. These data suggest that the effect of insulin on trophoblast 
cells is less robust in obese women (60). By improving maternal insulin sensitivity and 
decreasing β -cell response through lifestyle intervention before conception, the decrease in 
insulin respon se will affect placental programming of genes related to lipid metabolism and 
mitochondrial function. This will result in decreased placental lipid accumulation and nut rient 
availability to limit neonatal adiposity. Thus, interventions aimed at improving maternal 
metabolic function should begin before initiation of molecular changes. These data are highly 
supportive of our hypothesis that when lifestyle intervention is i nitiated after placental gene 
expression has been programmed the effects are not reversed.  
 
Potent ial subjects for recruitment : We have a track record of successfully recruiting and 
retaining women prior to a planned pregnancy for longitudinal metabolic studies 
(15,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58).  While the number of subjects in the individual protocols were 
in the range of 20 -25, th ere were multiple protocols over 20 years that were funded by 6 different 
R01 or Program Project mechanisms, (total n > 200). Note ; these longitudinal studies involved 
clamps, muscle and fat biopsies as well as estimates of energy expenditure and body composition.   
In this protocol we will initiate recruitment in our postpartum unit after the index or 
subsequent delivery . Using our perinatal database of all obese women (for the purposes of this 
proposal defined as a BMI 25 -35 kg/m2 for the general population, and 23 -32.5 kg/m2 for Asian 
populations as defined by the WHO guidelines, 95), we estimated the time from delivery  of their 
first infant to their next pregnancy. Approximately 1,665 women (32%) became pregnant within 
18 months and 2328 (45%) within 24 months of their first delivery. We anticipate the time 
interval will be considerably less if we recruit women planning  to conceive, who do not have a 
history of infertility and because the number of unplanned pregnancies is decreasing (3). Further, 
we have a record of excellent success with retention in previous postpartum women (pre -
pregnancy relative to the LIPP). We al so have follow -up of women and their children at 4, 8 and 
12 months postpartum for body composition studies (61). To date, we have recruited over 250

 women (>85% of eligible subjects) and their offspring from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse 
Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) follow -up study 8 -12 years after delivery.  
 
Inter -pregnancy weight loss or gain : In a sub -cohort of our population (n=126), we examined 
the effect of maternal weight change from  the first to second pregnancy. Of the 126 women, 20 
(16%) lost weight and 106 (84%) gained weight between pregnancies. In the subsequent 
pregnancy, women who lost weight delivered infants with a minimal change in mean birth 
weight, whereas women with an increase in inter -pregnancy weigh t delivered infants that were on 
average 107g heavier at birth.  These data are consistent with a report (34) from more than 10,000 
births in obese women. Inter - pregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of LGA 
infants (OR: 0.61; 0.52 -0.73), whereas weight gain was associated with an increased risk of LGA.  
We examined body composition of neonates in successive pregnancies where mothers (BMI -25-
35 kg/m2) had either gained (n=10) or lost weight (n=5). Women with an inter -pregnancy weight 
loss had a mean decrease in birth weight of 349 g (183 g fat and 40 g lea n mass). In those with an 
inter-pregnancy weight gain, there was a mean 63 g increase in birth weight, which was 
comprised of 33 g body fat and 11 g lean mass. There was a net 216 g difference in fat, but only a 
51g difference in lean mass between women wh o lost and gained weight. The effect of weight 
loss between pregnancies was primarily due to a change in neonatal fat . We have also reported 
that neonatal fat mass is significantly correlated with childhood adiposity (15).  
 
Importance of weight loss for restoration of insulin sensitivity postpartum : We used 
euglycemic clamps and molecular approaches to identify mechanisms that regulate insulin 
sensitivity in obese women during late pregnancy and one year postpartum (62). Women who did 
not lose weight within one year after delivery did not reverse preg nancy -related insulin resistance, 
and fasting glucose and plasma TNF -α remained elevated.  Further, in the absence of weight loss, 
skeletal muscle TNF -α gene expression and 312Ser ine-IRS-1 phosphorylation did not recover to 
pre-pregnancy levels. These data suggest that women who fail to lose weight postpartum are at 
greater risk of increased insulin resistance in a subsequent pregnancy. The progressive insulin 
resistance may accele rate the decline in β -cell function and development of type 2 diabetes. In 
contrast, women who were followed for one year postpartum, but lost significant weight (63), 
experienced normalization of fasting glucose and insulin, insulin sensitivity, and insul in signaling 
in skeletal muscle. These data highlight the importance of postpartum weight loss to the 
metabolic health of the mother.  
 
Lifestyle intervention induces weight loss and improved metabolic function: exercise and 
caloric restriction in obesity - a randomized clinical trial.  We conducted a prospective study in 
24 obese (BMI: 34.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2) adults randomized to exercise alone, or exercise combined 
with moderate caloric restriction ( -500 kcal/d (48). Both interventions improved insulin 
sensitivity (p<0.001), and cardiovascul ar risk factors (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, waist 
circumference, glucose and triglycerides; p<0.05 ).  Total abdominal, subcutaneous, and visceral 
fat, aerobic capacity, total and LDL cholesterol also improved. These data support the efficacy of 
our weight loss intervention in reducing body weight and improving insulin sensitivity in obese 
individuals.  
 
Mechanisms related to pancreatic β -cell function:  effects of lifestyle induced weight loss on 
β-cell function and the GLP -1 response to glucose. We examined the effect of exercise/diet 
induced weight loss on β -cell function, insulin secretion, and the incretin (GLP -1 and GIP) 
response to nutrient stimulation as part of NIH funded obesity and insulin resistance studies.  In 
obese adults, a low glyce mic diet combined with exercise induced weight -loss and reduced 
postprandial hyperinsulinemia (48, 64, 65). In contrast, a high glycemic diet impaired pancreatic 
β-cell and intestinal K -cell function, despite weight loss.  Our research nutritionist will counsel 
participants to eat a Mediterranean -style diet  during the lifestyle intervention.  Counseling will be

 consistent with the subject’s metabolic status, food availability, and cultural needs. We have also 
shown (data in review) that lifestyle -induced weight loss decreases the GLP -1 response to 
glucose . There are no published data on the effects of lifestyle -induced   weight   loss   on   GLP -
1   responses   to   nutrient   stimulation   in pregnancy. The current application will address this 
knowledge gap.  
 
Preliminary Data  
 
Placen tal lipid metabolism pathways are altered in obes e women at term. We measured fatty acid 
metabolism gene profiles in placen tas of 40 lean and 40 obese women as part of our NIH-funde d 
placental lipid studies. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1B, the rate-limiting enzy me in the 
mitochond rial fatty acid oxidation pathway, is lower in term placen tas of obese women, while key 
gene s in fatty acid esterification and accu mulation (acetylCoA carboxy lase (ACC ), steroyl CoA-
desaturase (SCD ) 1, and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP 4) are higher. Consistent with these gene 
pathways, 3H-palmitate esterification was higher in primary trophob lasts isolated from 11 obes e 
women compared to 5 lean women. Thes e data provide a potential mechanism for our finding that 
placental lipid content is 17% higher in obese (N=15) vs.   lean (N=14) women. In a RCT (PMC), we 
found that overweight and obese women randomized to omega -3 fatty acid supplementation starting in 
the early 2nd tr imester had lower expression of lipid esterification genes (i.e. DGAT1 by 22%, 
adipophilin (PLIN2) by 33%) and lower placenta esterified fatty acid content compared to placebo 
(32±8 vs. 43±12 nmol/mg), but fatty acid oxidation genes and neonatal fat mas s were not improved 
(66). In fact, birthweight increased 25% with omega -3 supplementation.  Further, omega -3 did not alter 
3H-palmitate oxidation in vitro, but decreased 3H -palmitate esterification ~50% in trophoblasts isolated 
from obese women (N=11). The se data suggest that:  
1) Intervention  initiated during pregnanc y in obese women does not improve placental mitochond rial 
function or neona tal adiposity, and 2) lowering lipid esterification and storage in placentas of obese 
women without improving mitochond rial function (i.e. β-oxidation) increases neona tal adiposity, 
potentially due to greater lipid flux to the fetus. Thes e data are consistent with our premise that 
lifestyle intervention pre-pregnanc y can alter the progression of impaired β-oxidation to lipid 
accumulation and increased fat depos ition, becaus e change s in mitochond rial function may begin 
early in pregnancy . We expec t that pregravid lifestyle intervention will result in improved placen tal 
mitochond rial function (i.e. β-oxidation), which will be measurable at term and assoc iated with 
reduce d fatty acid esterification and lipid accumulation, and result in lower neona tal fat mass 
accretion. 
 
Summary:  These preliminary studies: 1) confirm our experience and expertise in conducting RCTs in 
pregnant women and their offspring; 2) show that the proposed lifestyle intervention approach achieves 
weight loss in obese adults and is feasible and successful in o ur hands; 3) provide strong clues as to which 
mechanisms of action  (including  placental  programming,  improved  β -cell  function,  and  reduced  
insulin  resistance)  are responsible for the improved glucose and lipid homeostasis in obese patients after  
weight loss interventions. Collectively, these data offer strong supportive evidence for the studies outlined 
next.  
 
Background and Significance  
 
Obesity during pregnancy: Obesity is a major health concern during pregnancy (4). In the United States 
55.8% of the female population aged 20 -39 years is overweight or obese, based on body mass index 
(BMI, kg/m2) criteria (4). Further, 7.5% in this age gro up have a BMI >40 kg/m2 (5). Equally 
concerning, 17% of U.S. children and adolescents are obese (6) and mean term birth weight is increasing 
in developed nations (7, 8). We have reported a significant increase of 116 g in mean term birth weight in 
Clevelan d since 1975 (9). High maternal pregravid BMI, and not gestational weight gain (GWG), was the 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 7 of 54  
 strongest correlate for a high birth weight. Although some have suggested that the increase in birth weight 
may have reached a plateau (10), we have found that this is secondary to factors such as earlier 
gestational age of delivery (11). Of greater concer n is the significant increase in the Ponderal Index 
(weight/length3) in our neonatal population over the last decade (11).  
 
Pre-pregnanc y obes ity or excess ive gestational weight gain - relationsh ip to fetal overgro wth: 
In 2009 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reexamined the 1990 GWG guidelines. Thirty-eight 
percent of normal weight, 63% of overweight, and 46% of obese women gained weight in exces s 
of IOM guidelines (12). In Cleveland, 59% of overweight and 52% of obese women had excess ive 
GWG. These percentages are higher in African American and Hispanic women. In obese women 
excess ive GWG was a significant risk factor for cesarean delivery and postpartum weight retention, 
and not related to deve lopment of preeclampsia or gestational diabetes (GDM ). High GWG was 
assoc iated with an increased risk of preterm birth but was not related to increased risk of fetal 
overgrowth (12). Thus , excess ive GWG is a primary risk factor for maternal post- partum weight 
retention, which increases the risk of maternal pregravid obesity in a subsequen t pregnancy . 
 
Maternal obesity in early pregnanc y more than doub les the risk of obesity in offspring between the 
ages of 2 to 4 (13). Boney reported that (LGA) neona tes of mothers who were obese, and/or 
deve loped GDM , were at increased risk for deve loping the metabolic synd rome between ages 6 to 11 
(14). Maternal obesity but not GDM had a 2-fold greater risk for metabolic synd rome in the 
offspring. In our 8-10-year follow-up studies, maternal pregravid BMI, independen t of GDM or 
GWG, was the stronges t predictor of childhoo d obesity and metabolic dysfunction (15). In a meta-
analysis, Philipps reported that althoug h maternal diabetes is assoc iated with increased childhoo d 
BMI z-score, this was no longe r significant when adjusted for maternal pre-pregnanc y BMI (16). 
Hence, maternal pregravid obes ity is not only a risk factor for offspring adiposity at birth , but 
also  for the long -term r i s k  of obesity  a nd metabolic  d y s f u n c t i o n  in the offspring  
independen t of maternal GDM or excess ive GWG. 
 
RELEVANCE AND USEFULNESS OF THE OBJECTIVES  
 
Clinically, the proposed study provides feasible methods to improve the short and possibly long -term 
metabolic health of obese women and their offspring. Scientifically, this study will provide fundamental 
insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying maternal metabolism before 
pregnancy and effects on maternal/placental physiology.  
The actual lifestyle interventions (healthy eating and increased physical activity are not in 
themselves unique techniques in pregnancy. The uniqueness or innovation is the use of these 
techniques in order to affect an improvement in fetal adiposity in a s ubsequent pregnancy. S tudies 
are not unique in pregnancy . The innovative aspects of this proposal are the following:  
1) The lifestyle intervention will begin prior to a subsequent pregnancy. We are uniquely 
positioned to recruit overweight/obese women immediately after  index pregnancy. This 
allows us to conduct a “run -in period” of actual recruitment and randomization by ~3 
calendar months (±27 days) postpartum. Our experienced research team is one of the few 
to successfully recruit large numbers of women prior to a planned pregnancy for 
metabolic studies.  
2) The period between pregnancies will allow sufficient time for the lifestyle intervention 
to decrease weight and result in improved insulin sensitivity, β -cell function, adiponectin   
concentrations   and   decreased inflammation, in contrast to lifestyl e intervention 
initiated during the second trimester of pregnancy.  
3) This proposal has the potential to fulfill, by providing level 1 evidence one of the 
objectives of the 2009 IOM report. Research recommendation S -7 suggests that by 
providing pre -conceptual services to obese women, such as diet and physical activity, 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)

 with the goal of achieving a healthy weight before conceiving, will represent “a radical 
change to the care provided to obese women of childbearing age” (49).  
4)  Our proposal incorporates a trans -disciplinary team (nutrition, exercise physiology, 
molecular biology, obstetrics, and endocrinology). We will test our hypothesis that the 
intervention translates into cellular and molecular modifications relating to i nsulin action 
pathways. Only by employing a well -disciplined longitudinal program, based in the 
community with sufficient support, will our subjects recognize that lifestyle intervention 
represents a life course alteration that will have long -term benefits  for both mother and 
child.  
Rationale: We conclude, based on our previous research (15, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 
57, 58), that maximum metabolic benefits relating to fetal body composition and 
metabolism can only be achieved by improving the pregravid metabolic condition of 
obese women. Therefore, Specific Aim 1a will examine how maternal lifestyle 
intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy results in improvements in maternal 
insulin sensitivity, β -cell function, adiponectin concentrations and a decreased 
inflammatory mili eu.  Specific Aim 1b provides a physiological translational link 
between improved maternal metabolism and neonatal adiposity and metabolic condition.  
Specific Aim 2 will provide evidence that lifestyle intervention improves placental 
mitochondrial functio n and lipid oxidation, and decreases lipid esterification/storage 
thereby providing a mechanism whereby the maternal pre -pregnancy metabolic milieu 
regulates placental nutrient function and subsequent fetal growth.     
Is there an active control group?   
  
If Yes, describe the following:  
o The control group will be provided with current recommendations for healthy eating 
(myplate.gov) and exercise recommendations (American College of Sports Medicine; ACSM) to 
achieve a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, the control group will receive healthy pre -pregnancy and 
pregnancy guidelines from the American College of OB/GYN (ACOG) . In brief, t he control 
group will be asked to consume a balanced diet, limit added sugar and saturated fat and increase 
physical activity for 30 minutes a day for at least 5 days per week.  
o The lifestyle data to date during pregnancy has not shown any benefit of lifestyle interventions 
during pregnancy as compared to the control group. The hypothesis to be tested is that a lifestyle 
intervention BEFORE pregnancy will have benefit in a subsequ ent pregnancy. The information 
provided to the control subjects will in the vast majority of situations be of greater content, 
specifics and recommendations tha n are currently provided to overweight and obese women in 
clinical practice . 
o The control group will not be exposed to any risks beyond what is currently recommended by the 
ACOG for overweight and obese women planning a pregnancy, i.e. eating healthy food, 
increasing physical activity and return to pre -pregnancy weight.  
 
2.2 Risks to Subjects  
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
Risks include the following:  
 
Subjects  will be asked to use an acceptable means of birth control at least until they have completed the 6 -
month post -partum follow -up visit. The type of birth control they choose will be determined by them and 
their health care provider. There are no risks in performing the metabolic studies when pregnant; they will 
be performed at 12 -16 and 32 -36 weeks of pregnancy. We would not wish to perform them outside the 
defined study windows to avoid extra visits or obtaini ng blood that cannot be used as part of the research.  
 
Yes
No

  When blood is drawn from a vein there will be some temporary discomfort and the minimal risk of local 
bruising, infection or blockage of the vein.  We will take suitable precautions including trained staff 
who are certified to draw blood in volunteer subjects using an indwelling catheter, and minimal size 
needles to obtain the samples will help to minimize these risks.  
 There are no risks to performing the Indirect Calorimetry to estimate resting energy expenditure.  
 The possible risks of the oral glucose tolerance test consist of occasional nausea and very rarely vomiting 
or lightheadedness.   
 There are no known risks from using the Bod Pod method to measure body fat composition.  
 For those randomized to the Lifestyle Intervention group, risks include possible injury such as muscle 
and joint sprains during the exercise sessions.  
 While exercising or performing the VO 2 max test, subjects  might experience fatigue or shortness of breath.  
They  might also feel like their heart is pounding very fast or very hard and experience dizziness, heart 
rhythm abnormalities, chest pain, or very rarely a heart attack or death.  They  could stumble and fall off 
the treadmill.  If subjects  have any of these experiences, they are instructed to tell the research team.  
Also, when the mask is on their face, this might feel uncomfortable.  
 There are no known additional risks from performing the metabolic tests.  
 There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality of the results of metabolic testing. We make every 
effort to minimize these risks by keeping paper records in a locked cabinet in a locked office. Any 
information held in electronic form will be kept o n a secure computer in the research area of the 
hospital. Information containing personal data, for example birthday will be de -identified using a 
research hospital code number.  
 
Delivery:  
 Taking blood from the placenta and the umbilical cord will not harm subjects  or their baby.  
 Measuring baby's length, weight and fat thickness will not hurt the baby.  
 There are no known risks to measuring baby’s body composition with the Pea Pod device.  It is possible 
that the baby will become upset while lying in the chamber of the Pea Pod during the 2 -minute 
measurement period; however, the baby at no time will be subjected to any type of discomfort.  The 
baby is placed in a warm, molded plastic “infant seat” type structure.  The clear acrylic enclosure allows 
the infant to always be in the view of the operator.   
 There are no risks to mother or infant related to completing these questionnaires. We will instruct 
subjects that “ Some questions on the questionnaires are of a sensitive nature and you may feel 
uncomfortable answering these questions. You can choose not to answer any questions you are not 
comfortable completing”.    
 
We will maintain contact with the subjects, via phone, email or text messaging and plan to 
meet with her at any of her postpartum visit s to her obstetrical care provider. At that time 
study staff will review inclusion/exclusion criteria and review factors such as blood pressure 
and clinical OGTT if the patient had GDM. The study coordinator will also make sure that 
subjects who required a cesarean delivery will be able to partake in the lifestyle regimen if 
they are randomized into that group. The PI at eac h site will make final decision about 
eligibility. At this time , the potential subjects who agree to participate in the study will be 
scheduled for a metabolic evaluation visit at the  Tufts CTRC and HNRCA , or the Brigham & 
Women’s Hospital (BWH) Research Facility at 221 Longwood  prior to randomization.  
The consent document for this protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) at Tufts Medical Center. Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects 
participating in the project.  
 
b. Protection Against Risk  
The exercise component of the intervention at Tufts will be under the direction of Dr. Roger 
Fielding, a Co -I on this project. The exercise component of the intervention at BWH will be 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 10 of 54  
 under the direction of Dr. Kieran Reid. Methods to ensure safety with the exercise include 
screening for abnormalities on EKG  and supervision by a certified lifestyle coach. At the time 
of the exercise testing in the HNRCA (VO2 testing), Dr . Fielding  or Dr. Catalano  will have 
available Dr. Lisa Ceglia  to review any EKGs that he deems questionable. If there is an acute 
problem the subjects will be brought to the emergency Dept. at Tufts Medical Center. If there 
is a non -acute finding on the EKG the subject w ill be referred to her own PCP or if the 
subject does not have a PCP Dr. Ceglia  will provide the name of a cardiologist. Subjects with 
a questionable cardiac history will either be excluded based on exclusion criteria of if 
questionable history at the time of explaining the protocol to the subject, we will ask that the 
subject be cle ared by her own physician before being allowed to be included in the LIPP 
study.  Similar precautions will be taken at BWH.  
 
In order to ensure safety with the nutrition intervention, all food provided to subjects as part 
of this study will be prepared by the HNRCA  or BWH Research Facility  research nutrition 
team in the metabolic kitchen of the HNRCA  or Research Facility or if the visits are taking 
place at the CTRC , food provided will be prepared by the nutrition team in the Tufts Medical 
Center kitchen . The diet will be based upon the Mediterranean diet, which is an eating pattern 
that focuses on fruits, vegetables, legumes, nu ts, lean proteins and fish, while limiting red 
meats and sweets high in added sugar. Additionally, olive oil is used as the main fat in the 
diet. The caloric needs of the participants in the lifestyle modification program will be 
calculated from resting metabolic rate, which will be measured by indirect calorimetry, 
adjusted initially by a factor of 1.3 to account for the exercise program. Further  adjustment in 
caloric content will be made to attain a weight loss of >5% of pre -pregnancy weight  or 
closest we ight to pre -pregnancy based on best clinical data . This will be achieved by a 
negative caloric balance of 500 Kcal/day to attain a rate of weight loss of 1 lb/week. 
Participants will be instructed by the LIPP team so dietary intake includes healthy choices for 
fat (mono and polyunsaturated) and protein ( fish, nuts, legumes, and poultry) and substitution 
of dietary fat and simple sugars by healthy carbohydrates (fruits, vegetables, whole grains). If 
weight loss is not being achieved, participants will be rec ommended to use meal 
replacements (commercially available) to facilitate caloric restriction as was used with great 
success in the Look AHEAD trial. Once the weight loss target is attained, subjects will enter 
into a maintenance dietary phase, the aim of w hich will be to maintain or reduce further 
weight (up to 15% of baseline weight).  
 
During pregnancy , subjects randomized to the lifestyle intervention program will be advised 
to maintain their exercise regimen as tolerated per ACSM and ACOG guidelines . During 
pregnancy , all subjects will have dietary recommendations based upon the ACOG guidelines 
and delivered by the clinical nutrition program at Tufts Medical Center and Brigham & 
Women’s Hospital in order to gain weight as recommended by the 2009 IOM guidelines. Drs. 
Catalano and Fielding will oversee the studies in the HNRCA  and Dr. Rei d and Dr. Sen will 
oversee the studies in the BWH Research Facility . 
 
The Specific Aims of this proposal require that we only include women who plan to become 
pregnant. We will include assessment of growth/body composition of their neonates as the 
primary outcome measure. As such , we anticipate that approximately 50% of the neonates 
will be male. We believe that because the investigators have broad experience with lifestyle 
interventions in non -pregnant women, metabolic studies during pregnancies and experience 
with neonatal measur ements, that there will be minimal risk to th e women and infants 
participating in this study. The PIs and CO -Is are all experienced clinicians and NIH funded 
investigators. The facilities of Brigham & Women’s Hospital, the HNRCA and Tufts Medical 
Center are located next to and within  hospital s. The outpatient facilities where the lifestyle

 Page 11 of 54  
 interventions take place will be in the HNRCA , BWH Research Facility  or community where 
the participants work and live.  
 
Medical intervention will be available for all subjects enrolled in this program for medical 
emergencies related to adverse events. If there is a chronic medical condition resulting from 
participation in this study, the subject will be responsible per Tufts MC  IRB regulations. We have 
conducted randomized control trials in the past and have experience with using DSMBs. We have had 
no issue with either data entry or reporting of adverse events.  
 
• Subject identifier number will identify all of the material collected as part of the study. The 
information will be kept on the REDCap database. Any paper records will be kept in the study 
coordinator’s office in a locked cabinet.  
• There are no unknown risks to this study. The metabolic testing has been conducted by the PIs 
(Catalano at Tufts, Kirwan at the Pennington and Calles at Case Western) at each of the sites for a 
number of years with no adverse effects. The lifestyle intervention group will be under the 
supervision of trainers who will have emplo yed healthy eating and exercise as a component of their 
research for a number of years. The intervention groups will be overseen by Kirwan (Case Western 
and the Pennington) , Fielding (Tufts ) and Reid  (BWH and MGH ). 
• The research nutritionist reviews the diets of each subject in the intervention arm and makes 
adjustments regarding the Mediterranean diet based on the individual’s specific food allergy . 
• There are no risks to the fetus or embryo for healthy eating and exercise during pregnancy as these 
are the current recommendations of the ACOG.  If a woman becomes severely dehydrated, this could 
decrease blood flow and oxygen to the fetus. This situation is often accompanied by symptoms as 
noted above in the mother. Care will be taken to avoid these conditions because of the presence of 
certified  trainers in the intervention group.  
• If applicable, describe risks to people other than the participating subject, e.g., risks to family 
members, friends, others or risks to the community. NA  
There may be benefit to the family because of women most commonly doing the greatest share of 
meal planning for the family . 
• If applicable, describe risks to study investigators or staff performing the study procedures due to 
research with high risk populations (e.g. prisoners, intravenous drug users, patients with major 
psychiatric issues, etc.). NA 
 
2.3 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
 
There are potential benefits to subjects and others from this proposed research. The potential 
benefits to subjects in the lifestyle intervention arm are that they will be able to participate in 
a supervised diet and exercise program to decrease weight and improve metabolic function in 
preparation for a future pregnancy. If indeed the intervention proves successful , not only will 
there be immediate benefit to the subject herself, but there is the real possibility the 
intervention will have long term benefit  for the prevention of obesity and metabolic 
complications for both the mother and her offspring. Even subjects assigned to the usual care 
or control arm of the study will have the benefit of being given specific advice as to an 
optimal diet and exercise r egimen before pregnancy based on the metabolic evaluation in the 
HNRCA  or CTRC in TMC  and the Research Facility at 221 Longwood in BWH . While we 
call this usual care , the information the usual care subjects receive from their OB provider on 
lifestyle inter ventions for overweight and obese women is not nearly as detailed as the usual 
care subjects receive in the LIPP study. The metabolic results from testing will be available to 
the nutritionist and lifestyle coach. In routine clinical care neither this info rmation nor a

 Page 12 of 54  
 detailed meeting with a nutritionist and lifestyle coach are available in the course of a routine 
postpartum visit.  
 
 
There are direct benefits to both the intervention and usual care groups as described previously.  
There will be a benefit to all subjects who are recruited from this study, i.e. women delivering at Tufts 
MC, Pennington , BWH  or any other affiliated institutions participating in the LIPP study.  
 
Importance of the Knowledge Gained  
 
The importance of the knowledge to be gained by this proposal is the ability to determine if Lifestyle 
Interventions in Preparation for Pregnancy can achieve concrete (real) results in the efforts to stem the 
epidemic of obesity in women and their offsprin g. This study will also provide information as to the 
mechanisms of why lifestyle intervention before rather than only during pregnancy results in improved 
outcomes. Although the concept of pre -pregnancy lifestyle intervention has been recognized previousl y as 
potentially worthwhile, there have been few if any studies employing such a study design, because of the 
perceived difficulty in recruiting women prior to pregnancy. Based on our history of conducting research 
studies in women before during and after pregnancy, a study design of recruiting obese women 
immediately after their index pregnancy and incorporating the community into the lifestyle interventions, 
we believe that this approach will have applicability in many other populations.  
 
The risks to subjects are minimal. They are the standard of care we should provide to all our obese 
patients considering future pregnancy. Our ability to provide more than a minimal amount of information 
is hampered by the lack of resources particularly for women seeki ng care. If successful, as proof of 
principle, we believe this protocol can serve as a paradigm for a wider initiation of lifestyle interventions 
before pregnancy.  
 
We believe that the minimal risks associated with this proposal are reasonable in relation to the 
anticipated benefits, because to date much of the medical efforts relating to obesity have been 
focused on treatment ; whereas , the goal of this proposal is not only treatment of the mother but 
prevention of obesity in her offspring. If successful this program will be expanded to include a 
much larger population; for example, potentially involving a larger multi -center approach or 
possibly involving the Maternal  Fetal Medicine Networks. Last, we will also plan long -term 
follow -up studies of the mothers and their children to test the hypothesis that there are long -term 
benefits to lifestyle interventions in preparation for pregnancy.  
 
 
2.4 Alternatives  
• The alternatives to participating in this study are the routine information provided to overweight and 
obese women by their obstetrical health care provider at the time of their postpartum visit.  
• Overweight and obese women MAY be advised to increase physical activity and eat healthy but 
rarely see a nutritionist or a trainer about the specific lifestyle activity based on their baseline 
metabolic status.  
• Subjects could go to a reputable health club in the area and ask for a personal trainer and nutritionist 
for either a 1 -time session (usual care) or sign up for personal training Intervention group).  
 
3 Objectives  
• Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of the study (i.e. the reason for performing the 
study in terms of the scientific question to be answered).  
Studies evaluating lifestyle intervention in obese women during pregnancy have reported 
limited success in decreasing excessive gestational weight gain, and have failed to achieve 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 13 of 54  
 the key outcome of breaking the obesity cycle and reducing neonatal adiposity or birth 
weight. Although some investigators advocate weight loss during pregnancy in obese women, 
these recommendations were based on extrapolation of retrospective epidemiologi cal data. Of 
concern, we reported increased small for gestational age babies and decreased lean body mass 
in neonates of obese women with weight loss or inadequate gestational weight gain. Based on 
our research, optimal outcomes from lifestyle intervention s are likely to be temporal and 
therefore must be initiated prior to conception to first improve maternal metabolic function, 
and subsequently, placental/fetal growth. Several large retrospective cohort studies support 
our hypothesis.  For example, women w ho lost weight between pregnancies had fewer large 
for gestational age babies in contrast to women who increased inter -pregnancy weight. In 
addition, prospective randomized controlled trials have shown that postpartum weight loss is 
achievable without adve rse maternal or neonatal outcomes, these studies include women who 
breastfed. Based on these observations, we propose a randomized control trial to determine 
the effect of lifestyle intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy on improving 
neonatal metabolism and adiposity.  
 
Our over -arching hypothesis is that the maternal pre -pregnancy metabolic condition   
determines the obesogenic in -utero environment, which affects programming of placental 
mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways, promoting lipid accumulation and neon atal 
adiposity. Our rationale is based on the need to establish the most effective time to introduce 
an intervention that will break the obesity cycle in mothers and their children. Understanding 
how pregravid metabolic conditioning improves maternal physi ology and cellular and 
molecular function in pregnancy will provide the empirical data to support the intervention. 
We have a highly successful record of - recruiting women who are planning a pregnancy, 
obtaining compliance in longitudinal studies, and in long-term follow -up of mothers and their 
offspring. Lifestyle intervention will be initiated prior to conception to decrease maternal 
body fat, inflammation, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction. Our trans - disciplinary 
team has the required expertis e in lifestyle interventions, management of obesity, and in 
human physiology that is needed to determine the effects of these interventions on maternal 
metabolism and fetal - placental growth and function. We will recruit 200 women to pursue 
the following specific aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1: To investigate the physiological significance of lifestyle intervention in 
preparation for pregnancy (LIPP) on maternal and neonatal metabolism and adiposity.  
 
Sub-Aim 1a. The working hypothesis is that a lifestyle intervention, initiated after the index 
pregnancy, will facilitate lower maternal insulin resistance, inflammation, weight, adiposity, 
incretin response, and energy expenditure compared to usual care. We will perform 
longitudinal measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity and secretion   and blood 
markers of inflammation. We will link these changes to improvements in neonatal adiposity 
and insulin sensitivity.  
 
Sub-Aim 1b. The working hypothesis is that women who initiate a lifestyle intervention 
before the subsequent  pregnancy will deliver a baby with lower birth weight and fat 
accretion; insulin resistance; and cord blood markers of inflammation. We will measure body 
composition using anthropometrics and air displacement plethysmography (Pea Pod), 
umbilical cord gluc ose, insulin, leptin, IL -6, hsCRP, and adiponectin.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  To determine the molecular effects whereby lifestyle intervention initiated 
before pregnancy can improve placental mitochondrial lipid oxidation and accumulation.  
The working hypothesis is that lifestyle intervention before pregnancy will increase placental 
mitochondrial lipid oxidation and decrease lipid esterification/storage (Fig. 2). Isotope -

 Page 14 of 54  
 labeled fatty acid oxidation and esterification will be quantified in vitro in placental explants.  
We will measure markers of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and content using qRT -PCR and 
ELISA approaches. Placental lipids will be quantified and correlated  with neonatal adiposity 
and maternal metabolism.  
 
Impact of the study:  Clinically, the proposal provides feasible methods to improve short and long -
term metabolic health of obese women and their offspring. Scientifically, this study will provide 
fundamental insights into the physiological and molecular m echanisms underlying maternal pregravid 
metabolism and effects on maternal/placental physiology.  
 
Specify which are the primary or secondary aims or objectives of this study as applicable.  
The primary objective is the main question. Secondary objectives are goals that will provide further 
information for the study  
We have not developed secondary aims for the study.  These will be considered once the primary 
study is underway and secondary funding is sought. For example, we are in preliminary discussions 
with Dr. Economos in the school of nutrition to look at any spillover effect of the LIPP study on other 
family memb ers. These discussions are at the initial stages and have not yet been fully developed or 
sought additional research funds.

• Specify whether a study subject may participate in another research study while participating in this 
research study.  
Yes as long as there is no conflict  with LIPP as the primary research study.  
 
4.3 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects who do not become pregnant at the end of the intervention or usual care component (21 months 
postpartum) are still included in the study. They will not undergo further ev aluation but will continue to 
be followed until either they become pregnant or the study terminates.  Contact will be maintained through 
a brief monthly check -in phone call from study staff. For the intervention arm, this will include a 
reminder of body weight goal and strategies to sustain weight loss.  Testing will resume during pr egnancy 
at the specified intervals of 12 -16 and 32 to 36 weeks of pregnancy.  
• Describe anticipated circumstances under whic h subjects will be withdrawn from the research 
without their consent.  
We have had subjects we asked to withdraw from the study because of their not returning for their 
metabolic assessments in the metabolic research centers, no shows at scheduled training sessions, 
smoking (which is an exclusion criteria).  
If a LIPP subject becomes pregnant prior to 16 weeks after randomization or becomes pregnant before the 
3-month postpartum randomization, i.e. no baseline measurement , they would be asked to withdraw.  
• Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw or are withdrawn from the 
research, including the possibility of partial withdrawal from study intervention with continued data 
collection.  
We will plan to maintain demographic data for subjects who have withdrawn from the study in order 
to compare with subjects who have been compliant with the study protocol in order to determine if 
there was bias in subject compliance.  
• Include any necessary safety precautions to be applied to subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn 
(tapering drug doses, evaluative x -ray, etc.).  NA 
 
4.4 Recruitment and Retention  
4.4.1 Local Recruitment Methods  
Describe the following attributes of the recruitment plan for the local Tufts site:  
• When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.  
• We plan to approach subjects, assuming they and their newborn are stable, on the 
postpartum unit of Tufts Medical Center  (Tufts MC) after their delivery. The PI and/or 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 16 of 54  
 the study coordinator will inform the subjects about the s tudy.  Subjects will be identified 
as being eligible based on information obtained at the time of their delivery. Potential 
subjects will be interviewed by the PI and/or the study coordinator to determine 
eligibility and potential interest in the LIPP project. Th ey will be given a brochure 
describing the study. If potentially interested we will obtain contact information, such as 
email and phone numbers and contact potential subjects prior to their 4 -6 week 
postpartum visit. Before their postpartum visit with their OB health care provider , study 
staff will contact them to determine if they might be interested in participating in the 
LIPP study. If they are, one of the recruiters will meet the subject at their postpartum 
visit, explain the study in more detail, and provide the potential subject with a copy of the 
consent form. The subjects will have until 3  calendar  months (+/ - 3 full weeks) to decide 
to join the study and be scheduled for metabolic tes ting. We created an IRB -approved 
informational website that is linked to on the MIRI lab page at Tufts MC and distributes 
ads via social media and print linking to the informational website. If a potential 
participant would like to ask questions related to the study to a current or former 
participant, LIPP study staff will initiate this communication (via email, text or phone 
call) with the approval of both individuals.   
• Source of subjects (for example, patient population, local community, etc.).  
Postpartum patients at TMC.  
• Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects.  
Review of EMR charts . Patients who are found to meet exclusion criteria  during screening , such 
as history of HIV, or hepatitis B or C, will not be recrui ted and their PHI will not be recorded.  
• Materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
Primarily b rochures and speaking with potential subject s, as well as sharing the study website 
page with those who are interested . The brochure will be given to all potential subjects until we 
have reached our recruitment goals.  
• When subjects respond to recruitment material, describe the information that will be provided to 
them about the study and the information that will be collected from subjects (e.g. name, 
telephone number, etc.) or submit a telephone/email script that will be used.  
We do not use a script. Subjects will be given a copy of the brochure and if interested will be 
given a copy of the consent form to be reviewed with the study coordinator.  
o If data will be retained for subjects that are determined to be ineligible, specify how 
privacy and confidentiality of these potential subjects will be maintained. Data will be 
retained until the primary manuscript is written noting differences in the study population 
that have determined to be ineligible for whatever reason based on inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.

 4.4.2 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
Is this is a multicenter study where subjects will be recruited by methods not under the control of 
the local Tufts site (e.g., call centers, national advertisements)?  
 
If Yes, describe the following:  
• Methods of recruitment not under the control of the local Tufts site.  
There will be no further recruitment at  the Pennington site in Baton Rouge ; we will continue to follow 
subjects until they deliver at the PBRC (please see section 11.1  for site specific information ). There will 
also be no further recruitment  at Massachusetts General  Hospital (MGH)  but recruitment will occur at  
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in Boston in coordination with TMC.  Potential participants in 
the Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP) study will be recruited from eligible 
women who have deli vered infants at BWH . Women will be approached on the Labor and Delivery and 
Postpartum units of BWH following delivery of their infant  following a screening of medical records for 
exclusions including entering restrictive charts (‘breaking the glass’) . Women who express interest will be 
given a n IRB approved flyer and contact information will be collected . Contact information will be 
transferred to Tufts s tudy staff via a Mass General Brigham maintained secure Dropbox. Tufts study staff 
will reach out by email, phone , or mail to women who agree to be contacted and will offer study 
participation. As an alternative to in -person recruitment,  women who are missed in -person will receive a 
letter via the Mass General Brigham patient portal with an opt -out option. If women do not opt -out, the 
LIPP study staff will contact them in 3 -4 weeks via email or phone number by way of the listed contact 
information in their medical records. All subsequent study procedures will be conducted at TMC and 
BWH  for those women who elect to participate.  For women who deliver at MGH  or BWH , delivery 
protocol will be followed accordingly for each site. At the time of  delivery, LIPP study staff from all 
Boston -area sites (MGH, BWH and TMC) will collect study sample data, maternal and infant data from 
medical charts, and conduct maternal questionnaires . 
 
• When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.  
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in Boston, MA.  
• Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects.  
Similar to what we will use at Tufts. Data will be provided if requested  and have IRB approval.  
• Materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
Submit a copy of each recruitment -related document with the application. For advertisements, 
attach the final copy of the print advertisement. When advertisements are audiotaped or 
videotaped for broadcast, attach the final audio/video. You may submit a sc ript of the proposed 
audio or video advertisement for IRB review before taping the final version in case revisions are 
requested. Once recommended changes are made, the final version is to be submitted to the IRB 
for review and final approval.  
 
4.4.3 Payment  
Will subjects receive money, gifts, or any other incentive for participating in this study?  
This does not include reimbursement for expenses, which is considered in the next section.                    
     
If Yes, describe the following : 
• Any proposed payment or incentive for subjects (e.g., a specific description of the incentive, its 
value both in US and local currency [if international], local household income information, 
provided to whom). State if the payment/incentive value could pos e undue influence on the subject’s 
decision to participate. Subjects in the intervention group

Subjects randomized to the LIPP group, will receive up to approximately $2500 of value as follows:  
• $40 for the first study metabolic  visit, $50 for the second study visit, and each study visit will then increase by 
$10. The total compensation of the seven study visits is $490 for participation in this study.   
• The study will provide 750 ml bottles of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) throughout the study.  
• If a subject withdraws from the study, they will be paid for the portion of the study that they have completed.  
• After delivery and the measurements of the baby have been completed, subjects will receive a $50 gift card for 
completing the study.  
• Subjects will be compensated for the cost of parking while at the research visit.  
• Taxi or public transportation services to and from the study visit can be arranged at no expense to subjects, if 
needed. Costs for childcare may be reimbursed during LIPP visits or training if needed.   
• A FitBit system to track step count, exercise time, and body weight throughout the study will be provided.  
• Subjects will receive free access to the exercise facilities used in the study or we will provide a membership to 
an exercise facility  until subjects become pregnant or for a period of up to 24 months.  
 
Subjects randomized to the usual care (control) group, will also receive up to approximately $2 250:  
• $250.00 per each of the 7 metabolic  visits, with a $500.00 study completion bonus at the end of the study.  The 
maximum number of visits is seven (5 postpartum and 2 during pregnancy) for a total payment of up to $2,250.  
• Subjects will be compensated for the cost of parking while at the research visit.  
• Taxi or public transportation services to and from the study visit can be arranged at no expense if needed. Costs 
for childcare may be reimbursed during LIPP visits or training if needed  in accordance with the local site 
average amount per hour for the duration of the visit (see below - LIPP Childcare).   
• How payment will be made (e.g., cash, check, Greenphire ClinCard).  
Payment will be made using a pre -paid debit card, i.e. Greenphire ClinCard.  Subjects who are legally unable 
to accept payment from Tufts Medical Center (e.g. subjects on a  student or work  visa)  will receive  store or 
credit card  gift cards  as tokens of appreciation . 
• To whom payment will be made (subject, parent [which one], LAR).  
Payment will be made to the study participant.  
• When payment will occur.  
Payment will occur after each study visit and after delivery and measurement of the baby.  
• The payment schedule to be used, including the payment schedule and amount for subjects who withdraw or 
are withdrawn from the study.

4.4.4 Reimbursement   
Will subjects be reimbursed for their expenses, such as travel, parking, meals, or any other study related 
costs?  
   
                                  
If Yes, describe the reimbursement plan and procedures, including : 
• What qualifies for reimbursement and whether pre -approval is needed.  
All subjects will be reimbursed for parking or transportation for study visits.  Subjects in the 
intervention arm of the study will be reimbursed for a membership in an exercise facility, 
transportation to the exercise facility and childcare if needed.  
• How subjects will be required to document expenses for reimbursement (e.g., provide receipts).  
Expenses will be paid either through providing receipts or through arrangements with the exercise  
facilities directly to the LIPP grant through Research administration.  
• How and how often subjects will request reimbursement.  
Subjects can request after each study visit. Subjects in the intervention arm can request 
reimbursement on a monthly basis for transportation to exercise facilities, travel to the exercise 
facility or childcare if needed.

LIPP Childcare  
In order to support the LIPP research and create ease for participating mothers, the LIPP Study will  offer  support 
to mothers with childcare costs for the duration of a visit. This will be done when requested by participants. 
Participants will be required to show a form of evidence of cost (i.e., receipt, Venmo screenshot, etc.) for the 
study records. Upon approval by coordinator and/or principal investigator, participants will be reimbursed through 
their ClinCard. In accordance with the 2020 regional avera ge of babysitting childcare in the Boston area, the study 
will reimburse up to $19/hour during the allotted visit time. Below are the expected visit durations and extent of 
coverage possible:  
Visit 1 -5: 6 hours → childcare covered up to 7 hours x $19 = $133.00   
 
 
5 Study Design  
5.1 Study Timelines  
• Describe the duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study.  
The time that the subject will be in the study  is variable. The minimum time is 1 3 months ( 4 months 
in study  and 9 months of pregnancy). The maximum time is 28+ months. The pre -pregnancy 
component of the study is variable. We list 18 months  in study/21 months post -partum  but if the 
subject becomes pregnant after 21 months  post-partum , she will be followed in the pregnancy 
component. Hence, we list 28+ months.  
• Describe the duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects at the Tufts study site.  
Subjects will have their initial testing and randomization 3 calendar months (+/ - 3 full weeks ) after 
their delivery.  Enrollment begins when the Informed Consent is signed.  
• Describe the estimated date for investigators to complete this study (complete primary analyses).  
The initial grant end ed on 11/ 30/202 2 and we are on an approved no -cost extension until 11/30/2023 . 
• Describe the study procedures that will be accomplished at each study visit.  
At the HNRC A, CTRC  or BWH Research Facility, the following metabolic testing/procedures will be 
performed : 
Metabolic evaluations will be performed at baseline (3 months ± 3 full weeks 
postpartum ). Follow -up evaluations will be performed after 6 (± 3 full weeks) and 9 
months (± 3 full weeks), 15 ( ± 3 full weeks) and 21 months ( ± 3 full weeks)  prior to 
pregnancy (Figure at the top of the protocol form) up to a maximum of 18 months. Once 
a subject becomes pregnant and has dating and viability confirmed by ultrasound, 
metabolic evaluations will continue at 12 -16 and 32 -36 weeks of gestation.  However, if 
an individual participant has scheduling issues  or there are extenuating circumstances  
with scheduling  visits, we may schedule outside of the above windows.   
 
Maternal Body Composition: Anthropometry measurements will include height, weight, 
and hip and waist circumferences. Total body fat will be measured by whole body 
plethysmography (Bod Pod; Cosmed, Rome, Italy), (70). We will use a hydration 
constant of 76%  for fat free mass during late pregnancy (71).  If a BodPod is not available 
we will use skin calipers to take skinfold measurements of the triceps and mid -axillary 
skinfold to estimate body fat .  
 
Resting Energy Expenditure: Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) will be determined after an 
overnight fast using the Cosmed OMNIA metabolic cart (Cosmed, Rome Italy) with a 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 20 of 54  
 canopy system. Participants will relax in a quiet low -light metabolic room for 30 min 
prior to obtaining a 30 -min measure of exhaled breath. Oxidative glucose metabolism 
will be estimated and urine samples will be obtained before and after the measure in 
order to calculate non -protein RQ (NPRQ). Th ese data will be used in conjunction with 
Specific Aim 2 and will be correlated with placental  mitochondrial function during 
pregnancy.  
 
Exercise Capacity: An incremental graded treadmill test will be performed at baseline  
(3), 6, 9, 15, & 21 months postpartum  time points in both groups. In addition, for the 
intervention group additional VO 2 max testing will be performed at approximately 4 & 5 
months postpartum. Oxygen consumption , heart rate, and ratings of perceived exertion 
will be performed as previously described (48, 64, 65, 72).  
 
Insulin Sensitivity and β-Cell Function: A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will 
be used to assess postprandial glycemia, and insulin sensitivity and secretion. After an 
overnight fast, blood samples will be drawn at  -10, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, & 180 minute time 
points . C-peptide data will be analyzed using a combined model approach to provide pre -
hepatic insulin secretion rates, insulin sensitivity, disposition index, and relate insulin and 
C-peptide kinetics (73). Plasma glucose will be measured using the glucose oxid ase 
method (YSI; Yellow Springs, OH). Insulin will be assayed by RIA (Millipore, Billerica, 
MA). A fasting  blood sample  will be co llected  in lieu of the OGTT during pregnancy 
visits  when  there is  a lack of fund ing. The OGTT will be collected during pregnancy 
again if additional funding is secured.  
 
Enteroinsular Axis Responses:  Plasma samples (with appropriate additives) will be 
obtained to measure incretin hormones (glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1), and glucose -
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and satiety -related gut peptides 
(cholecystok inin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Measurements will be made under 
static (fasting) and dynamic (glucose -stimulated) conditions.  Blood s ample s for these  
incretin measurements  will not be collected when there is  a lack of fund ing, but may be 
collected again if additional funding is secured . 
 
Metabolic and Inflammatory Biomarkers:  Fasting blood samples will be obtained to 
measure CBC, TSH, HbA1c, lipid panel, and total free fatty acids (FFA). Adipocytokines 
(adiponectin, leptin interleukin -6, interleukin -8, TNF -α and hsCRP) will be measured 
using ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All samples from each subject will be 
stored at -80ºC and run in the same assay at completion to decrease variability.  
 
Questionnaire s: IRB approved questionnaires will be administered  at each visit that capture 
changes in lifestyle, mood, breastfeeding status, diet and exercise. These data will provide a 
generic measure of physical and mental health through assessment of physical functioning, bodily 
pain, limitations due to physical, personal, or emotional problems and well -being, energy/fatigue, 
and general health perceptions. During pregnancy the questionnaire s will be administered at 12 -
16 and 32 -36 weeks  gestational age , either at visits or over the phone . Diet information may be 
collected via an electronic interface, the ASA24 (see “Electronic Diet Data Collection” below).  
 
For women who deliver at MGH or BWH, delivery protocol will be followed accordingly for 
each site. At the time of delivery, LIPP study staff from all Boston -area sites (MGH, BWH and 
TMC) will collect study sample data, maternal and infant data from medical  charts, and conduct 
maternal questionnaires.

 Addendum: In cases where there are adverse conditions in which samples cannot be obtained for 
lab results or in instances where there is equipment failure, measures may be repeated for 
accurate time point data with the participant’s consent.  
 
Neonatal measures  
Measuring Fat Mass in the Infant:  We have extensive experience in estimating body composition 
in neonates (77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88), and were one of the first centers to procure a 
Pea Pod (pediatric air densitometry), which is housed in the ne onatal  intensive care  nursery at 
TMC.  
 
Insulin Resistance at Birth: At birth we will obtain umbilical cord blood for insulin , C-peptide  
and glucose to estimate insulin resistance using HOMA (89). Full lipid profile, CRP, and the 
adipokines IL -6 and leptin (an excellent marker of neonatal fat mass) will be measured in cord 
blood as described above.  
 
Usual Care Group  
• Subjects assigned to this group, will receive normal standard of care that includes advice 
and recommendations to improve their health and will be monitored by the study staff. 
This will be provided via electronic communication or at the time of the exercise capacity 
test at the HNRCA  or BWH Research Facility . 
• Subjects  receive information on post -pregnancy diet/weight loss from our research staff.  
 
Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy Group (LIPP)  
• Subjects randomized to this  group will participate in a supervised diet and exercise 
program. They will work with personal trainers and Lifestyle Coaches to assure safety 
and compliance to the intervention.  
• Dietary Intervention  (Weight Loss) : During the first 12 -week s of lifestyle intervention, 
we will lower the amount of food subjects  eat daily with an emphasis on eating healthy 
foods, and replacing those unhealthy foods with healthy fats, like the fats found in extra 
virgin olive oil  (i.e., a Mediterranean dietary pattern) .  To help with this change, subjects  
will be provided with 750 ml bottles of extra virgin olive oil as needed throughout the 
study.  Every 2 weeks, subjects will record their food intake f or 24 hours using a phone 
app. Nutrition counseling will also be performed utilizing an app. The app is called 
MyFitnessPal. It is free and will be provided with instructions on how to download it 
(from the App Store). It consumes approximately 160 megabyt es, which is a fraction of a 
percent of a typical 15 GB phone and will sync with the FitBit . For subjects who have 
difficulty in tracking meals, a variety of behavioral techniques (goal setting, self -
monitoring, and general nutrition education)  as administ ered by the lifestyle 
interventionist will be used to increase compliance.  
• Supervised Exercise Intervention : During the first 12 -weeks of the program , subjects 
will exercise 3 -5 days each week for up to 60 minutes each day. The exercise will consist 
of walking/jogging on a treadmill, cycle and/or elliptical. Sessions will be conducted at 
the HNRCA , BWH Research Facility  or an exercise/fitness facility in their area. Subjects 
will not be required to have a pregnancy test for each of their supervised exercise 
sessions. However, if they think they may be pregnant they will be told to inform their 
trainer. Subjects will be i nstructed to keep their heart rate within a prescribed limit (80 -
85% of maximum) and will be provided with a heart rate monitor and watch to make it 
easy to check their heart rate. They will also be provided with a FitBit system (including  
an Aria electronic scale) to track step count and metabolic functions (e.g. heart rate, body 
weight). They will be allowed to keep the FitBit at the conclusion of the study. Subjects 
will be instructed to wear the FitBit throughout the day and a heart rat e monitor when 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)

 Page 22 of 54  
 exercising and to notify the investigators if there is any change in their medications 
(prescription, over -the-counter, herbals) during the period of this study. All exercise 
sessions will be recorded in an exercise training log and supervised by a certifi ed exercise 
physiologist/trainer.  There are cases where this supervision may occur remotely if 
necessary.  
• Dietary Intervention ( Weight Maintenance ): During the first phase of weight 
maintenance ( 2A) subjects  will attend approximately 2 supervised group sessions per 
week. Each session will last approximately 60 minutes. These sessions will include 
structured exercise (e.g., Zumba, jazzercise, stroller walking) and we will review 
subjects’  diet records.  
• After 3 months and the desired weight loss, subjects  will move to the next Phase ( 2B). 
During this phase, subjects will be required to attend approximately 1 supervised session 
per week. If they do not maintain their weight loss, they will return to the previous phase 
for more supervised weight management. Alternatively, if they maintain their weight loss 
after 3 months, they will progress to the third Phase ( 2C) of the program  until they 
become pregnant.  
• The third phase ( 2C) consists of no supervised exercise sessions. However, subjects and 
their Lifestyle Coach will talk on the phone weekly to review their progress, including 
FitBit exercise data, weight, and diet. Each telephone call is expected to  last 
approximately 5 minutes.  
• Electronic Diet Data Collection : Dietary assessment is a standard -of-practice for 
clinical trials. The ASA24, or Automated Self -Administered 24 -hour (ASA24) Dietary 
Assessment Tool, is a web -based tool that enables multiple, automatically coded, self -
administered 24 -hour dietary recalls. The ASA24 guides participants through steps to 
record all foods and beverages they have consumed over 24 -72 hours.  The ASA24 was 
developed by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and has 
been validated for accuracy.  
• Participants will be assigned an ASA24 ID, Username and Password from each study 
site. 
• The 24 -hour recall usually takes 20 –30 minutes, a similar length of time if an in -person 
24-hour recall was conducted.  
• The format and design of the ASA24 are modeled on the interviewer -administered 
Automated Multiple Pass Method 24 -hour recall developed by the US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA). This recall requires multi -level food probes to accurately assess 
food types and amounts.  
• The ASA24 software (most recent version ASA24 -2020) is programmed with a food 
database which includes all foods available from USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for 
Dietary Studies (FNDDS) database. In addition, the software includes pictures of foods in 
multiple portion sizes to help respondents estimate portion size.  
• Data files include nutrients, foods, pyramid food groups, and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 
variables. The software can quickly compute nutrient and food group estimates for each 
recall day. The software also has the capacity to accommodate languages other th an 
English.  
 
 Respondent confidentiality is maintained within ASA24  
• ASA2 does not collect any identifying data about Respondents, either from Researchers 
or directly from Respondents.  
• Respondent data are protected by industry standard security controls. All data entered 
into ASA2 at the Respondent’s computer are encrypted by the Internet browser (e.g., 
Internet Explorer, Firefox) before they are transmitted to ASA24 servers using Secure 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 23 of 54  
 Socket Layer protocol, or SSL. SSL allows for the authentication of the sending and 
receiving computers.  
• Only a particular study’s investigator (study PIs, intervention staff) and the ASA24 
operations team can access response data using usernames and strong passwords.  
• IP address information is accessed for the purpose of routing information between the 
server and the Respondent’s computer. Often, the IP address is that of the user’s Internet 
Service Provider (ISP). IP addresses are not stored or tracked by ASA24.  
 
Virtual Sessions  
• Counseling sessions for either the control or intervention groups may be conducted via a virtual 
format (Zoom, etc).  
• These sessions may be one -on-one or group sessions discussing the control/intervention counseling 
information described above.  
• Participants will be provided a secure link and, if it is a group session, advised on the group nature of 
the sessions. Participants are asked NOT to share the personalized, secure link to anyone else to 
protect the privacy of each participant.  
 
For both groups, once  healthy pregnancy is confirmed, we will notify subjects’ obstetrical 
healthcare provider regarding their participation in the study. Subjects will be asked to follow a 
diet for healthy weight gain during pregnancy  and to maintain moderate physical activity based 
upon their level of physical activity before pregnancy  based on ACOG guidelines and their 
primary obstetrical care provider . All subjects will be provided with the ACOG patient 
information guides on healthy eating and exercise during pregnancy.  They will have a repeat of 
all the studies  excluding VO2 max testing at TMC , the HNRCA  or BWH Research Facility  as 
described previously at 12 -16 weeks and 32 -36 weeks of pregnancy.

5.2 Procedures  
• Is there a placebo control arm?  
  
If Yes, describe the following:  
o The scientific, methodological, and medical reasons to use a placebo.  
There is no placebo per se. We are using the te rm usual care.  
o The care that will be given to subjects who receive placebo. If this is local standard of care, 
specify that.  
Local standard of care plus more detailed information about healthy eating and exercise from 
study staff at the time of the visits  or via electronic communication . 
o All potential risks to the placebo group and how the risks will be minimized.  NA 
• Provide a description of all research procedures being performed as follows:  
o How individuals will be screened for eligibility. Specify screening that will take place prior to 
informed consent and screening that will take place after informed consent.  
Screening before consent will be performed by a review of the delivery logs on Labor and 
Delivery on a daily basis using the screening log form. Contact information with be obtained and 
the subjects who express interest before their  postpartum visit will be met by study staff to review 
in detail the study objectives, protocol and procedures.   
o Procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety or to minimize risks.  
Study subjects in the intervention arm will have frequent contact with lifestyle trainers and 
nutritionist s initially approximately 3 times/ week, then approximately  2 times , then 
approximately one time per week in person. Assuming the subject is maintaining her weight 
contact will then be continued with  frequent phone calls and via email, text or downloading of 
data from Fit Bit.   
o All drugs and devices used in the research, their regulatory approval status, and the purpose of 
their use.  NA 
o The source records that will be used to collect data about subjects. (Attach all surveys, scripts, 
and data collection forms.)  
Please see attached documents.  
• Describe the following concerning pregnancy testing and birth control:  
o Whether pregnancy testing will be conducted on women of reproductive potential?  If testing 
will not be conducted, provide the reason.  
Pregnancy testing will be determined on all pregnant women at the time of metabolic visits . 
Additionally, a POC test will be performed by LIPP staff when a VO 2max test is done outside of 
the metabolic visit.  We will not do pregnancy testing once the subjects enter the pregnancy 
component of the study.  
o What birth control methods women  of reproductive potential will be instructed to use. If women 
will not be instructed about acceptable methods of birth control, clarify why.  
Subjects are instructed to use birth control for at least 7 months post -delivery. The choice of 
birth control will be noted but the choice will be up to the subject and her medical provider . 
o What birth control methods men of reproductive potential will be instructed to use. If men will 
not be instructed about acceptable methods of birth control, clarify why. NA 
• Specify which procedures, tests, visits, etc. described above are part of usual standard of care at Tufts 
and which are performed solely for research purposes. All the studies obtained as part of the protocol 
are for research purposes.  
Subjects will be given a copy of their results to share with their health care provider.  
• Clarify which tests are routinely performed for clinical care, but are providing data for the research, 
and which tests are only performed for research purposes.  
Yes
No

 Page 26 of 54  
 None of the testing performed as part of the protocol is for clinical purposes. Subjects are free to 
share the information, for example, the results of the OGTT, with their health care provider.  
 
5.3 Evaluations  
Will you perform any laboratory tests for this study?  
  
If Yes, describe the following:  
• List all laboratory tests to be done as part of the study (e.g., hematology, clinical chemistry, 
urinalysis, pregnancy testing).  
CBC without differential, urine pregnancy test, HbA1c, Lipid profile, Basic metabolic panel, Liver 
panel, TSH, urine urea nitrogen. The OGTT will be performed to measure insulin sensitivity and beta 
cell response.   
• Differentiate screening laboratory test(s) from those taken after enrollment.  
o List special assays or procedures required to determine study eligibility or assess the effect of 
the intervention (e.g., immunology assays, pharmacokinetic studies, images, flow cytometry 
assays, microarray, DNA sequencing). For research laboratory assays , include specific 
assays, estimated volume and type of specimen needed for each test. For procedures, provide 
special instructions or precautions. The above are the screening laboratory tests. If the 
subject has diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroidism etc . she will be ruled out based on 
exclusion criteria. The special assays listed above are  
NA 
• Include specific test components and estimated volume and type of specimens needed for each test.  
The initial visit will obtain a total of ~91cc (baseline eligibility labs plus OGTT). Subsequent visit s 
will obtain ~83cc only for the OGTT component of the study.  When  there is lack of  funding,  
subsequent pre -pregnancy visits will only obtain ~4 9cc of blood  for the OGTT  and pregnancy 
metabolic visits will  obtain ~ 25cc  for a fasting blood  sample . Blood collection procedures  may revert  
to those previously -approved if additional funding is secured.  
• Specify laboratory methods to provide for appropriate longitudinal and cross -sectional comparison 
(e.g., use of consistent laboratory method throughout study, use of single, central laboratory for 
multi -site studies).  
The glucose from the OGTTs will be obtained real -time onsite or  in the MIRI lab. The estimated 
intra-assay coefficient of variation is  ~ 2%. The rest of the laboratory studies will be batch ed so that 
each subject’s complete analysis is obtained at one time. The intra -assay coefficient of variation 
varies depending on the test but is generally less than 5% and the inter -assay coefficient of variation 
is generally less than 10%.  
• If more than one laboratory will be used to perform study tests, specify which evaluations will be 
done by each laboratory.  
The Tufts Medical Center and Brigham & Women’s Hospital labs will perform the routine laboratory 
studies at the 3 -month postpartum metabolic visit. A urine pregnancy test as a POC test will be 
performed before each metabolic  visit, except the pregnancy visits ; additionally, a urine pregnancy 
POC test will be performed by LIPP staff when a VO 2max test is done outside of the metabolic visit.  
The glucose and cytokine measures will be performed in the Maternal Infant Research Institute 
(MIRI) and BWH Research Facility, and the insulin and enteroinsular axis response will performed at 
the Pennington Biomedical Research Institute.  
• Specify if the laboratory tests that will be performed are in compliance with Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 . If not, explain why.  
All laboratory tests performed in the TMC and BWH hospital laborator ies will be performed in 
compliance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 . The studies 
performed in the MIRI and PBRC will be performed for research purposes only.  
• If samples will be stored for the purpose of this study, describe  the preparation, handling, and 
storage of specimens, including specific time requirements for processing, required temperatures,

 aliquots of specimens, where they will be stored, how they will be labeled, and what will happen to 
the samples after the study is over (e.g. will be destroyed).  
Samples from CTRC  or the HNRCA will be placed on ice and then brought to the MIRI during  the 3 
hour OGTT  or fasting blood draw, or processed on site .  Samples will be aliquoted in separate vials in 
the MIRI to avoid freeze thaw c ycles. Samples will be bar code d using a unique identifier code for 
subject name and study visit. Samples not run real time , will be stored in -80°Cfreezers in the MIRI. 
Samples not used at the completion of the study will be destroyed. The cord blood samples at the time 
of delivery  will be brought to the MIRI for processing (glucose), and then aliquots stored at -80°C for 
analysis of insulin, cytokines and lipids.  Samples from the BWH Research Facility will be handled in 
a similar manner but in the BWH research lab.  
The placentas obtained at the time of delivery will be fixed for histological analysis, submerged in 
RNA Later, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for molecular analysis. For a subset 
of the subjects, we will obtain fresh placental tissue for lipid metabolism activity assays.  
After participants have completed the study, insulin, c -peptide, and incretin samples will be sent to 
the PBRC site for analysis. Similarly, inflammatory markers, other biomarkers as noted and placental 
samples, will be shipped to TMC  or BWH  for analysis. An MTA will be obtained from the respective 
sites prior to shipping.  
 
5.4 Collection and Storage of Human Biological Specimens (Tissue Banking)

o Where and how data or specimens will be stored.  
o The hard copy of the information on the study record and the ICF will be stored in a locked 
cabinet in a locked room. The electronic version of the data will be stored in REDCap.  
Information that will be downloaded for analysis will be de -identified first. A copy of the ICF 
will be given to each subject and a copy retained in the subject’s medical record.  BMC, MGH 
& BWH will operate in a similar manner with all collected participant information being stored 
in a locked cabinet in a locked room. Transfer of interested parties contact information will 
occur via secure email or a s ecure Mass General Brigham maintained Dropbox.  
▪ Specifically, state where the study records, including both electronic and/or paper study

 o Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data or specimens locally?  
LIPP study staff  who are members of the MIRI (P Catalano, P O’Tierney -Ginn and study 
coordinator Li Yin Cheok ) and BWH Research Facility . The minimum amount of information 
required for scheduling will be shared with laboratory or university staff that are involved in 
study visits. Data and specimens will be in a coded data set using a unique LIPP study code 
number. Physiological data will be sent via the BWH Research Facility, HNRCA  or CTRC  
staff.  
o How data and specimens will be transported.  
BWH Research Facility, HNRC A or MIRI LIPP study staff will transport specimens . Data and 
specimens will be de -identified using a unique LIPP study code number.  
o Whether data will be coded.  
Yes we will use bar code identification  
▪ If so, specify if there is a key to the code that matches the subjects’ study identification 
number with their name and who will have access to it.  
Any key to bar code information will be kept in the LIPP research study coordinator’s 
office  
o Whether videotapes and/or photographs of subjects will be capable of identifying the study 
subject. If so, indicate who will have access to (be able to view) these items and how long the 
videotapes or photographs will be retained for the study and what the  plan is for their 
destruction. NA 
o If identifiable screening data will be retained for the study, clarify why, and who will have 
access to it.  Submit the screening log.  
Screening log has been  submitted.  Access will be through the LIPP research study coordinator 
and/or PI.  
It will be necessary to include HIPAA data on the screening log so that when approaching the 
potential subject postpartum one can refer to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Further, 
the screening log will be used as a contact source for the patien t at the time of the postpartum 
visit and in order to contact via email or text message.  
We have been very careful about ensuring privacy of study subjects whether screened or 
enrolled in our studies. The paper versions of the screening log will be maintained in a locked 
room in a locked file cabinet. The electronic version will be kept on a T ufts Medical Center 
server in a secure data file. Once the data is entered onto the REDCap database maintained by 
LIPP study staff at PBRC, the information will be de -identified and use only a secure unique 
study number.  
o Clarify whether confidential genetic information will be collected from subjects. NA  
Data and specimens should be stored in a secure location only accessible by the research team. 
The PI must ensure that study documents are stored in a manner that protects the privacy of 
subjects and the confidentiality of study data.  
• Indicate whether a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained. A Certificate of Confidentiality 
should be obtained for research involving collection of information that, if disclosed, could have 
adverse consequences for subjects or damage their financ ial standing, employability, insurability, or 
reputation. For more information, refer to NIH’s Certificates of Confidentiality Kiosk . NA 
 
6.5 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
• Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy interests. “Privacy interest” refers to 
a person’s desire to place limits on with whom they interact or to whom they provide personal 
information.  
Personal information will only be available to LIPP, BWH Research Facility, MIRI , CTRC  and 
HNRCA study staff. All other information will be de -identified for example for statistical analysis or 
DSMB review.

 Page 30 of 54  
 • Describe the steps that will be taken to make the subjects feel at ease with the research situation in 
terms of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to 
physical discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject may or may not experience in response to 
questions, examinations, and procedures.  
The consent form will describe the study procedures in detail. The study protocol will be explained to 
the subjects as well. At the time of the visit, the LIPP study staff (PI when available and study 
coordinator) in addition to the  CTRC , HNRCA  or BWH Research Facility  staff will be present to 
answer any ongoing questions. For those subjects randomized to the intervention group, HNRCA or 
BWH Research Facility staff will be present during the visit as well as the training sessions. Hence, 
there will be conti nuity of staff with all subjects in the LIPP study . 
• Under what circumstances will the research team access sources of information about the subjects.  
The only time the LIPP research team will access sources of information about potential subjects is 
when the postpartum delivery records are screened for subject eligibility  and the outcome pregnancy 
and delivery.  
 
6.6 Provisions to Monitor the Study to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
• Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data regarding both harms and benefits to assess 
subject safety as follows: We will continue to have a DSMB to evaluate subject benefit and harm.  
o Study data,  including safety data, untoward events, and efficacy data , will be reviewed  on a 
regular basis . 
Please refer to the DSMB charter . 
o Who will review the data?   
The DSMB this will include representatives from Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, TMC in 
Boston and PBRC in Baton Rouge. This has been made available to the IRB  
o How the safety information will be obtained and documented (e.g., case report forms, by 
telephone calls with participants, printouts of laboratory results, etc.).  
Per the format laid out in the DSMB which was in place in Cleveland.  
o The frequency of data collection, including when safety data collection starts.  
Safety collection starts when the first subject is enrolled into the study, in particular for the 
intervention group starting training.  
o The frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative data.  
This will depend on how there is progression of recruitment. In Cleveland we had a DSMB 
approximately twice in the first year of the grant.  We will have a minimal of 1 DSMB meeting 
per year.  
o The statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is occurring.  
The LIPP study statistician who will be located at Pennington  Biomedical  in Baton Rouge will 
determine this.   
o Any conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the research or other action for the 
research.  
Any severe adverse reaction will trigger a review and determination if this was related to the 
research protocol.  
o The plan might include establishing a data monitoring committee which addresses all the above.  
• Describe the entity responsible for monitoring the data, and their respective roles (e.g., the 
investigators, the research sponsor, a coordinating or statistical center, an independent medical 
monitor, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) /Data Monito ring Committee (DMC), and/or 
some other entity, and the timeframe for reporting events to this entity.    
o Submit a copy of the DSMB/DMC Charter if the study is monitored by a DSMB/DMC.  
We have submitted  the DSMB Charter for the LIPP study in Cleveland as well as the two  
DSMB reports (both  open and closed) to the Tufts Medical Center IRB.

 6.7 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
Does the research involve greater than minimal risk to subjects?  (Alternatively, if minimal risk, is there 
potential risk of research -related injury?) : 
  
If Yes, describe the available compensation in the event of research related injury including : 
• What this compensation will be (e.g. free medical care, payment for treatment, compensation for lost 
wages, dependent care, etc.).  
There is the potential for risk to the subjects in the intervention group, sprains and fatigue after 
exercise. These have not been of any sever e degree to affect study participation based o n the first year 
of experience in Cleveland. There will be no compensation for any injury or loss of employment.  
• Who will provide this compensation (e.g. sponsor, institution, etc.)? NA 
• What will count as a qualified harm (e.g., physical, psychological, economic, social, or other injury)?  
Qualified harm will be determined by a serious adverse event related to the study protocol as 
determined by the DSMB  
• Whether only injuries “related” to study, participation will be covered.  If yes, clarify how it will be 
determined what injuries are considered related, and who will decide this.    NA 
• Will the study distinguish between injury (short -term, resolvable) and impairment (often longer -term, 
potentially manageable, but not resolvable) and if so, why. NA 
• The process subjects must follow to obtain compensation.  If no funds are set aside for research -
related injury and subjects and/or their insurance will have to pay for the treatment of such injuries, 
include a statement such as: “No funds have been set aside for research -related injury. You or your 
insurance car rier will be required to pay for medical care associated with your research -related 
injury.”  
This has been similar to the language in all of our previous consent forms.  
“No funds have been set aside for research -related injury. You or your insurance carrier will be 
required to pay for medical care associated with your research -related injury.”  
 
6.8 Economic Burden to Subjects  
Does the research involve any costs to subjects?  
  
 
6.10 Vulnerable Populations  
If the research involves individuals who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, describe the 
rationale for their inclusion and the additional safeguards included to protect their rights and welfare.  
Will pregnant women be enrolled?   
  
If Yes, describe the following:  
• Any preclinical studies, including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies 
on non -pregnant women, that have been conducted that provide data for assessing potential risks to 
pregnant women and fetuses.  
The preliminary data that was obtained in Cleveland was data that included the number of women 
who might be eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The other preliminary data was the 
review of the average time to the second pregnancy. None of t hese information provided data related 
to risk to subjects relative to intervention.  
• Whether the risk to the fetus is caused solely by interventions or procedures that hold out the prospect 
of direct benefit for the woman or the fetus or if there is no prospect of benefit to the fetus, the risk to 
the fetus is NOT greater than Minimal Risk , and the purpose of the research is the development of 
important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by any other means.

 There is no risk to the fetus from participation in the study. The ACOG recommends that pregnant 
women partake in physical activity during pregnancy for 30 min at least 5 days a week. Our study 
protocol recommends that all subjects follow ACOG guidelines for diet and physical activity  and gain 
weight according to IOM recommendations from 2009.  
• The biomedical knowledge that is expected to result from this research for this population.  
Importance of the Knowledge Gained  
The importance of the knowledge to be gained by this proposal is the ability to determine if Lifestyle 
Interventions in Preparation for Pregnancy can achieve concrete (real) results in the efforts to stem the 
epidemic of obesity in women and their offsprin g. This study will also provide information as to the 
mechanisms of why lifestyle intervention before rather than only during pregnancy results in 
improved outcomes. Although the concept of pre -pregnancy lifestyle intervention has been 
recognized previousl y as potentially worthwhile, there have been few if any studies employing such a 
study design, because of the perceived difficulty in recruiting women prior to pregnancy. Based on 
our history of conducting research studies in women before during and after pregnancy, a study 
design of recruiting obese women immediately after pregnancy and incorporating the community into 
the lifestyle interventions, we believe that this approach will have applicability in many other 
populations.  
The risks to subjects are minimal. They are the standard of care we should provide to all our obese 
patients considering future pregnancy. Our ability to provide more than a minimal amount of 
information is hampered by the lack of resources particularly fo r women seeking care without 
considerable personal resources. If successful, as proof of principle, we believe this protocol can 
serve as a paradigm for a wider initiation of lifestyle interventions before pregnancy.  
• How any risk of this research is the least possible for achieving the objectives of the research?  
Risk will be minimized by having trained lifestyle intervention staff supervise physical activity and 
nutritionist the healthy eating for the Intervention group. The usual care group will receive benefit 
from having specific goals provided by our research team but not specific follow -up per the study 
protocol.  
• How mothers providing consent are informed of the reasonably foreseeable impact of the research on 
the fetus or neonate.  
Mothers are informed by the PI of the study and potential benefits of healthy eating and exercise 
before pregnancy . They will also be informed of the foreseeable impact of the research on their 
fetus/neonate.  
• Specify that no inducements, monetary or otherwise, will be offered to terminate a pregnancy and 
that in the case of a fetus, the fetus is not the subject of a planned abortion. NA 
• Specify that individuals engaged in the research will have no part in any decisions as to the timing, 
method, or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy or in determining the viability of a neonate. NA 
 
Will the research involve neonates of uncertain viability or non -viable neonates?  
  
 
Will subjects  who are not yet adults (neonates, children, teenagers) be enrolled?  
 Neonates will be included in the study as an outcome measure.  
a.  Check to confirm  that you will follow “ SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and 
Guardians (HRP -013)” to determine whether a prospective subject has or has not attained the legal

7 Adverse Event Monitoring  
7.1 Definitions  
• Define adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and unanticipated problems for your 
study.  
Please refer to the DSMB definitions  
During  the course  of the LIPP study,  all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be monitored, documented, and if causal reported to BWH , TMC and the PBRC  and the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). The Chair of the DSMB will be located at the PBRC . Every attempt will be made to follow a 
subject who has had negative reaction to any stud y intervention  or procedure.  
 
General  Reporting  Guidelines  
Adverse  Events  (AEs) 
 An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable medical occurrence, which may include abnormal signs (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptoms, or disease, temporally associated with, but 
not necessarily considered related to, the subject's participation in the LIPP research study.  These events are 
usually of a non -serious nature a nd are not reportable in accordance with the Institutional Review Board 
guidelines of the respective hospitals/ Universities for "Reportable Events," as they do not pose risk to study 
subjects.  
Adverse  events  that take place  during  the course  of the LIPP study  will be classified  under  the 
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE),  a descriptive  terminology  used for Adverse  
Event  (AE)  reporting.  AEs will be categorized  as expected  or unexpected  in terms  of their nature,  severity,  or 
frequency  as outlined  in the consent  form.  AEs will be graded  using  the CTCAE  system  and relatedness  
assessed  by the PI and presented  to the DSMB  at DSMB meetings.  
 
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs ) 
 
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  or "Unanticipated  Problems  Involving  Risk to Subjects  or Others,"  are 
characterized  as symptoms  which  are harmful  to the subject  and result  in significant outcomes  which  are 
reportable  to the respective IRBs  and the study's  DSMB . 
 
Examples  of serious  adverse  events  are: 
 
▪ Death  
▪ Life threatening  medical  events  that place  a subject  at immediate  risk of death  from  the event  as it occurred  
▪ Results  in impatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
▪ Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  as a result  of the study intervention  
▪ Events  that, based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  may jeopardize  the subject's  health and may require  
medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the other  outcomes listed  in this definition.  
 
The flow chart  below  provides  an algorithm  for determining  whether  an adverse  event  meets  the definition  of an 
"unanticipated  problem  involving  risk to subjects  or others."  
 
                                                  An adverse event occurs

Is the adverse event unexpected in nature,  
severity,  or frequency?  
    
  
 
Is the adverse even related or possibly related           
to participation in the research?   
  
  
 
 
Does the adverse event suggest that the research  
places subjects or others at a greater risk of  
physical or psychological harm than was   
previously known or recognized? NOTE: If the  
adverse Event is serious the answer is always  yes. 
 
 
    
      Report the adverse  The adverse event is not  
      event as an   an unanticipated problem  
      unanticipated problem   and need not be reported  
      under 45 CFR part 46   under 45 CFR part 46.  
    
 
 
Adverse  Events  which  follow  the above  figure,  that meet  the criteria  of unexpected,  fatal or life- 
threatening,  and related  or possibly  related  to the research  intervention  must  be reported  to the IRB and the 
DSMB  within  24 hours  of learning  of the event.  If necessary,  a subsequent  follow -up report  with the details  of 
the event  will be submitted  as well. All  other  reportable  adverse  events  will be submitted  to the IRB within  10 
working  days of the investigator  learning  of the event.  Reportable  events  will be submitted through the respective 
IRB's  system.   
 
AE and SAE  Assessment  Guidelines  Specific  to the LIPP S tudy  
 
Key Criteria:  to determine  if the event  is unexpected,  related  to participation  in the research study  and involves  
risk to human  subjects  or others.  
 
If an adverse  event  meets  the criterion  of unexpected,  related  or possibly  related,  and poses  risk of harm  to other  
subjects,  the study  coordinator will notify  one of the Multiple Principal  Investigators, Dr. Patrick Catalano or 
Dr. John Kirwan,  within  24- hours  who will then inform  the DSMB  Chair  and the Tufts Health Sciences IRB; 
the reviewing IRB of record . 
 
To evaluate  AEs and SAEs,  a licensed  medical  professional  will apply  the following assessment  criteria:  
Event  Expectedness  
Unexpected  Medical  Events:  
These  are the medical  events  that are not described  in the current  IRB-approved  protocol  or informed  consent,  
taking  into account  the characteristics  of the participant  population  being studied  (e.g. pregnant  population ).

vomiting,  tiredness,  lightheadedness  and upset  stomach.  
* While  the above  medical  events  may be expected , they will be collected  for outcome  purposes.  
 
Event  Severity  using  Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE ) 
Grade  refers  to the severity  of the AE. The CTCAE  displays  Grades  1 through  5 with unique clinical  descriptions  
of severity  for each AE based  on these  general  guidelines:  
• Grade  1 Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only; intervention  
not indicated.  
• Grade  2 Moderate;  minimal,  local  or noninvasive  intervention  indicated  limiting  age-appropriate  
instrumental  activities  of daily  living.  
• Grade  3 Severe  or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening; hospitalization  or 
prolongation  of hospitalization  indicated;  disabling;  limiting  self-care.  
• Grade  4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
• Grade  5 Death  related  to AE. 
 
Event  Relatedness  
 
Related:  The incident,  experience,  or outcome  is more  likely  than not caused  by study  procedures.  
 
• A reasonable  time course  would  be within  the 1-4 hours  the subject  is receiving  oral glucose  tolerance  
testing.  
• Symptoms  abate  once  the study  product  is discontinued  and patient  has received  a snack  or drink.  
Symptoms  are not explained  by other  factors  such as concomitant  medications or current  illness  
 
Possibly  Related:  There  is reasonable  possibility  that the incident,  experience  or outcome  may have  been  caused  
by study  procedures.  
 
• A reasonable  time course  would  be within  24-48 hours  the subject  either  fasting  for the study  or receiving  
the oral glucose  tolerance  testing.  
 
• Symptoms  may be explained  by other  factors  such as concomitant  medications  or current illness

8 Statistical Considerations  
8.1 Study Endpoints  
• Describe the primary and secondary study endpoints .  
The primary outcome measure of this proposal is lower neonatal adiposity at birth in the LIPP group 
relative to: 1) the usual care/control group. As secondary outcomes we anticipate that prior to a 
subsequent pregnancy, LIPP will produce significant improv ement (absolute and percent changes) in 
maternal weight and body composition, and more importantly improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell 
function, incretin response to glucose, lipid and inflammatory biomarkers, compared to the Control 
group. We also expect  reduced insulin resistance, umbilical cord lipids and inflammatory profiles in 
babies born to LIPP subjects compared to Controls.  
• Describe any primary or secondary safety endpoints.  
The risk of having a small for gestational age baby or preterm delivery will be followed closely in the 
intervention group , as this is a theoretical risk.   
8.2 Statistical Analysis  
• Describe the statistical analyses that will be performed for this study  
Statistical Analysis  
The primary analyses of Specific Aim 1a will be intent -to-treat comparisons of the LIPP and 
Control groups in regard to changes in maternal insulin sensitivity, BMI, and fat mass. The 
comparisons will be performed first with two -sample t -tests at α=0.05. Should any imbalance 
of confounding factors in the groups be recognized, linear regression models that include 
significant differences (e.g. GDM) would be used to perform covariate adjustments. Based on 
our 1 -year postpartum follow -up studies (62,63 ), we wi ll have 90% power to detect an 
absolute or covariate -adjusted improvement in insulin sensitivity of 30% and an 80% power 
to detect an improvement as small as 25% in the LIPP vs. Control group. Corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) for the absolut e or covariate -adjusted differences or percent 
improvements in insulin sensitivity between groups will be reported. We estimate the 
standard deviation (SD) of change in BMI from randomization until subsequent pregnancy to 
be 5.1 kg/m2. We will have 90% pow er to detect an absolute or covariate -adjusted difference 
in BMI of 2.6 kg/m2 and 80% power to detect a difference of 2.26 kg/m2 and 90% power to 
detect an absolute or covariate -adjusted difference in fat mass of 5.9 kg and 80% power to 
detect a difference  of 5.1 kg between groups prior to the second pregnancy.  
The primary analysis for Specific Aim 1b is an intent -to-treat comparison of LIPP versus 
Control neonates with respect to fat mass at birth. The comparison will be performed using a 
two-sample t -test at α=0.05. Linear regression will be performed, which will include weight 
(body composition measures) of the subject’s index  child as a covariate. Should any 
imbalance of confounding factors (for example gestational age) in the groups be recognized, 
linear regression models will be used to perform a covariate adjustment. Based on our 
preliminary data, we estimate the SD of neon atal fat mass between the LIPP and Control 
groups to be no more than 225 g. With at least 50 women in each group, (assuming a 50% 
dropout), the t -test or linear regression will have 90% power to detect an absolute or 
covariate -adjusted difference of 146 g fat mass between groups. We have 80% power to 
detect an absolute or covariate -adjusted difference as small as 126 g fat mass between groups. 
Corresponding 95% CI for the absolute or covariate -adjusted difference in neonatal fat mass 
between groups will be reported.  For secondary analyses, we will be using the same 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)  
VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 39 of 54  
 statistical approach. Based on our preliminary data, we estimate the SD of birth weight to be 
700 g; with 50 neonates in each group we will have 90% power to detect an absolute or 
covariate -adjusted difference of 455 g in birth weight and 80% power to dete ct a 393g 
difference between groups. Additional secondary analyses will include umbilical cord 
cytokines. Comparisons will be performed using a two -sample t -test at a significance level of 
α=0.05; however, Mann -Whitney U tests or log transformations will b e employed if data are 
not normally distributed. Linear regression models, including confounding factors, will be 
used to perform covariate adjustments. Based on our published data (80), we estimate the 
standard deviations of umbilical cord IL -6 and CRP to  be 3.4 pg/ml and 7,900 ng/ml, 
respectively. With 50 women in each group, we will have 90% power to detect an 
improvement in IL -6 and CRP levels of 50% and 42%, and 80% power to detect an 
improvement of 42% and 36%, respectively.  
 
The primary goal of Aim 2 is to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention prior to 
pregnancy on placental mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation at term. We hypothesize that 
placental β-oxidation will be higher in the LIPP group. We will conduct an intent -to-treat 
analysis using two sample t -test or non -parametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test to assess 
differences between groups. Regression analysis will be used to assess the association of 
placental β-oxidation and enzyme activity with maternal inflammatory cyt okine levels and 
insulin resistance in early pregnancy, along with neonatal fat mass with adjustment for 
gestational age and gender. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median and range will be 
calculated for all variables. Power and sample size analysis  based on our preliminary 
mitochondrial β-oxidation data in obese women (38±14 nmol/mg/hr) showed that a sample 
size of N=18/group achieves 80% power to detect a difference of 25% between groups using 
a two -sample t -test with a significance level of 0.05.  
 
• Provide a power analysis.  
These are included in the statistical analyses.  
 
8.3 Number of Subjects  
• If this is a multicenter study, specify the number of subjects to be enrolled in total across all sites.  
220.  
• Specify the number of subjects to be enrolled at the Tufts site. Subjects who sign an ICF are 
considered “enrolled”. For studies that have a separate screening ICF, this number is the number of 
subjects who sign a screening ICF.  100 
o Provide the rationale for enrolling this number of subjects at the Tufts site.  
This is approximately 50% of the study recruitment goals of 200. In addition to the already 
recruited participants in Cleveland and Baton Rouge, the Boston sites anticipate to recruit the 
remaining subjects to meet the goals.   
o Estimate the number of subjects expected to be enrolled at the Tufts site (i.e. sign the screening 
or study ICF) as well as the number needed to complete the study at the Tufts site.  
We anticipate recruiting 100 subjects in the Greater Boston area  and expect a 40 to 50% 
dropout for various reasons.  
o If a large number of withdrawals and/or dropouts are expected, explain why.  
It is not unusual for a lifestyle intervention study lasting over a number of years to have a 40% 
dropout rate. This has been addressed in the statistical analysis.  
 
8.4 Data Management

and clinical resea rch experience.  
• Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data.  
The Study coordinator, the PI and Statistical staff will ensure that the data has been collected and 
cleaned appropriately. Any data that is judged to be an outlier will be reassessed going back to the 
original source. In the past we have reanalyzed approx imately 10% of data to make sure that results 
are consistent with first time analyses.  
• Describe how data and specimens will be handled study -wide:  
o What information will be included in that data or associated with the specimens.  
The non -PHI study subject identifier as well as which visit the data was collected will be noted  
and entered into REDCap.  
o Where and how data or specimens will be stored.  
Data will be stored on REDCap. Hard copies will be maintained in a locked cabinet in a locked

 o Feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the proposed 
recruitment period. For example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What 
percentage of those potential subjects do you anticipate recruiting?  
We will have access to subjects delivering at TMC, approximately 1300/year.  To increase the 
likelihood of meeting our recruitment goal, we will also be recruiting at BWH, who see a 
higher volume of deliveries; approximately 9000/yr and 3800/yr, respectively. If recruitment is 
not adequate, we will explore recruiting at the other hospitals in Boston for example, BI 
hospital.  
We are in the process of collecting demographic data from the Tufts delivery charts to 
determine eligibility of patients delivering at TMC.  
o Confirm that the amount of time you will spend on the research is adequate to conduct and

 10.6 Community -Based Participatory Research  
Note: “Community -based Participatory Research” is a collaborative approach to research that equitably 
involves all partners in the research process and recognizes the unique strengths that each brings. 
Community -based Participatory Research begins with a research topic of importance to the community, 
has the aim of combining knowledge with action and achieving social change to improve health outcomes 
and eliminate health disparities.  
Will this study involve community -based participatory research?   
Not at this time, possibly at a later date  
  
 
10.7 Sharing Results with Subjects  
Will results (overall study results or individual subject results, such as results of investigational diagnostic 
tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings) be shared with subjects or others (e.g., the subject’s primary 
care physician or the subject’s tr eating physician)?   
  
If Yes, describe the following:  
• Rationale for sharing these results.  
Routine clinical data can be shared with PCPs to potentially avoid additional testing and expense.  
• How results will be shared.  
Please refer to the patient results form.  
• For individual subject results, specify if subjects have the option to opt -in or opt -out of receiving 
these results or allowing these results to be shared with others.  
The subjects have the option to opt out of receiving their study results and can determine if they will 
share them with others.  
• Any referral policies (i.e. for confirmation of any individual subject results).  
If a subject is screened out of the study, for example meeting exclusion criteria , the subject will be 
offered to contact the appropriate health care provider. In Cleveland, one subject was determined to 
be ineligible because of hypertension, which required treatment, and the subject was referred to her 
PCP for medical treatment.  
• Whether testing of research specimens is being conducted in, a laboratory certified (CLIA -approved) 
to conduct diagnostic testing. If patient -specific research results are reported from the laboratory and 
those results will or could be used for the diagnos is, prevention, or treatment of any disease or 
impairment, or the assessment of the health of human beings, the laboratory must be CLIA certified . 
All laboratory studies provided to patients are performed at CLIA approved laboratories at TMC.  
o If the research tests are experimental or of unknown or unproven clinical significance and the 
results will be provided to the source individual or physician or placed in the source 
individual’s medical record, provide the rationale for this.

attending local women’s health events, women responding to web - and flyer -based 
recruitment advertisements.  
• Methods that will be used to identify potential subjects.  
o Trialfacts: A web -based recruitment screening process ( https://trialfacts.com/ ).  
▪ Trialfacts creates all the advertising and recruitment material used in the 
recruitment process, including study information pages, landing pages, pre -
screening questionnaires, and online advertisements. Pennington Biomedical 
Research Center creates an additional landing page and sc reening questionnaire 
for those that pass the Trialfacts pre -screening process.  
o Physician assisted recruitment at Baton Rouge General, whereby providers at Baton Rouge 
General discuss the study and handout flyers to potential participants at their discretion.  
o Posted flyers throughout the Greater Baton Rouge area in approved locations.  
o Community events  
• Materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
o Handouts, flyers, physician referrals and online screening material will be used to recruit 
subjects.  
• When subjects respond to recruitment material, describe the information that will be provided to 
them about the study and the information that will be collected from subjects (e.g. name, telephone 
number, etc.) or submit a telephone/email script that will be used.  
o Subjects will be contacted via phone by research staff and/or directed to Pennington’s Web 
Screener Initiator (Web screener link: https://my.pbrc.edu/Clinic/Screener/Steps/Step1 ). 
o If data will be retained for subjects that are determined to be ineligible, specify how privacy 
and confidentiality of these potential subjects will be maintained. Data will be retained 
until the primary manuscript is written noting differences in the stud y population that have 
determined to be ineligible for whatever reason based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
▪ Pennington Biomedical has a Notice of Privacy Practices for Protected Health 
Information (provided below).  
• If recruitment material is being mailed or otherwise distributed, describe where/how, the 
distribution list will be obtained.  
o An email listserv with IRB approved information will be sent approximately every 
quarter to people who have subscribed to the PBRC email list.  
 
• Specify how and why the listed recruitment methods will be effective in attracting the targeted 
subject population.  
o Pennington Biomedical does not provide women’s health and reproductive services and as 
such, necessitates community involvement and hospital partnerships for recruitment. This 
has been successful in enrolling 12 research participants to date.  
 
Section 5.1 Study Design  
• Resting Energy Expenditure  
o Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) will be determined after an overnight fast using a Deltatrac 
II indirect calorimeter (Datex -Ohmeda, General Electrics, Finland) with a canopy system.  
• Neonatal Measures  
o A PEAPOD is housed at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.  
o Pennington Biomedical staff will perform requisite tissue collection at local Baton Rouge 
hospitals dependent on where the participant delivers (Legal agreements are provided for 
Baton Rouge General and Women’s Hospital, while the Ochsner legal agreement i s 
pending). After hospital discharge, participants will travel to Pennington Biomedical where 
a PEAPOD measure and neonatal anthropometrics will be performed. If travel is difficult, 
neonatal anthropometrics may be obtained at respective hospitals.

 Page 47 of 54  
 o Additionally, a medical release form will be obtained from the participant for the purpose 
of obtaining the antenatal chart.  
o Finally, neonatal  anthropometrics, caliper measurements and circumference measures may 
be conducted at the house s of PBRC -enrolled study participants if they are unable to travel 
to the PBRC site after delivery.  
• Lifestyle Intervention Group  
o Supervised Exercise Intervention  
▪ Exercise sessions will be conducted at Pennington Biomedical Fitness Center by 
the Intervention Resources Department at Pennington Biomedical. (See additional 
descriptions below.)  
 
Section 5.3 Evaluations  
• All laboratory tests will be performed by the Pennington Biomedical Clinic, Kirwan Lab Team 
and/or analyzed by the Clinical Chemistry Core at Pennington Biomedical. (See additional 
descriptions below.)  
• Sample Handling & Storage  
o Sample processing and storage will occur locally at PBRC, following the description in the 
parent protocol.  
• Cord blood collection and placenta collection at delivery  
o This process is described in detail in our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP 2304 
Placenta Collection and Processing). In brief, LIPP research staff (Caitlin Hebert) will 
collect tissue specimens from the research participant's delivering hospital. Samples will 
be collected according to protocol and placed on ice or liquid nitrogen. The  samples will 
then be immediately transported by Caitlin Hebert to PBRC for further processing and 
storage by LIPP staff (Kirwan Lab personnel) until analysis. The clinical chemistry core 
will perform glucose and lipid profiles on cord blood samples.  When the research 
participant is admitted to their delivering hospital’s delivery unit, they will hand the PBRC 
Placental Biospecimens Delivery Unit Information sheet to the attending physician.  
 
Section 6.1  Informed Consent Process  
• The PBRC site provides additional informed consent to the infants born to enrolled mothers. This 
informed consent is performed with the LIPP participant at the PBRC site during the final study 
visit (infant measurements) or may be conducted offsite if part icipants are unable to travel to PBRC 
after delivery.  
 
Interventional Resources  
Expertise including Facilities, Equipment, & Resource Descriptions  
 
Fitness Center  
Pennington Biomedical includes a 2300 -square -foot Exercise Training Facility. The facility offers state -of the -art 
equipment, professional intervention technicians, and optimal training data -capturing capabilities. Staff have the 
ability to collect and ent er data in real -time via a standing desk with dual monitors to operate the heart rate software, 
databases, and drive files as needed. The cardiovascular fitness training room contains 12 treadmills, 6 stationary 
bikes, and 2 elliptical while the strength t raining room has an extensive set of machines and free weights. There are 
3 private rooms for intervention related counseling in a one -on-one or small group setting. For measurements, 
there’s a private exam room complete with scale, stadiometer, and comput er. In addition, there’s a meeting room 
space capable of outfitting group exercise classes, group presentations, study orientations or introductory sessions, 
or childcare facility for study participants. The Fitness Center is supported by a trained staff c omposed of full -time 
exercise interventionists and students working on exercise -related degrees.  
The facility is participant friendly and includes televisions, reading materials and enthusiastic staff who are well 
trained in customer service. Further, there are locker rooms equipped with lockers and showers available exclusively 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Lifestyle Intervention in Preparation for Pregnancy (LIPP)

 Page 48 of 54  
 for the use of study participants. The facility has a defibrillator, electronic scales, and multiple heart rate monitors 
systems (Polar and Zephr Bioharness). There is an outdoor walking track as well. The scenic walking track is 12 
feet wide, paved, light ed and well -maintained. While the track is over half a mile in length there are 3 intermediate 
circle turn -outs that can be used to create shorter walking courses. All exercise intervention areas at Pennington are 
located in buildings far from the clinical  assessment area with virtually no opportunity for assessment staff to 
accidentally observe exercising participants.  
We have developed a real -time web -based system (EDIN2.0) that allows exercise interventionists to efficiently 
maintain accurate records of each exercise session. The progression of each participant is tracked both within 
individual sessions and during the entire study. Exercise can occur on a treadmill, elliptical, or cycle ergometer with 
the speed/grade/resistance modulated in order to keep participants at their target heart rate (±3 beats) derived from 
the maximal exercise testing. EDIN also allows for da ta capture of acute energy expenditure submaximal tests and 
manual entries such as outdoor exercise or resistance training.  
Resource Descriptions  
Exercise Interventionists & Research Specialists  
Interventional Resources has 7 -10 full time interventionists or specialists, and approximately 8 -10 students (varied 
by paid, interns, and volunteer status). The Interventionists and Specialists are primarily responsible for participant 
contact activities which include but are not limited to conducting orientations, run -ins, collecting assessment data, 
physical activity or other devices, randomization assignment, and setting up and conducting the physical activity 
and other interventions. They are responsib le for ongoing participant contact, maintaining participant records, 
tracking compliance and completing data entry requirements.  
 
11.2 Opt-In Ancillary Studies  
 
11.2.1  Breast Milk Collection  
 
Aim: To determine the impact of the lifestyle intervention on breastfeeding outcomes and breast milk composition 
of the index pregnancy .  
 
Hypothesis: Our overall hypothesis is that women randomized to the lifestyle intervention group will have higher 
rates of breastfeeding and less pro -inflammatory breast milk composition with a lower omega -6/omega -3 fatty 
acid ratio.  
 
Methods:  
a. Breastfeeding outcomes: Our exposure  will be randomization group and our outcomes  will be 
amount of breastfeeding versus formula feeding, duration of any breastfeeding and duration of 
exclusive breastfeeding. Study staff will administer validated breastfeeding outcome questionnaires 
every other week via text message or email to quantif y duration of exclusive and any breastfeeding. 
Statistical analysis: We will use independent samples t -test to analyze the association between 
participation in the lifestyle i ntervention program on breastfeeding rates during each timepoint of 
questionnaire administration. Next, we will use multivariate logistic regression to further examine the 
adjusted association of lifestyle intervention with rates of breastfeeding, adjustin g for key covariates.  
b. Breastmilk composition: Our exposure  will be participation in the lifestyle intervention program. Our 
outcomes  will be breast milk cytokines, PUFAs, leptin and insulin. Study staff will instruct mothers 
to collect breast milk samples and provide a 20 mL sample for this study. Participants will provide 
breast milk samples before initiating the intervention and then  at routine study visits scheduled at 3 - 
and 6 -months following intervention initiation. If mothers indicate that they plan to stop breastfeeding 
based on questionnaires, we will att empt to collect a breast milk sample prior to cessation of 
breastfeeding. PUFAs will be measured using established methods of ultra -high performance liquid 
chromatography -heated electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry UHPLC -HESI/MS -MS. 
Insulin wil l be measured using ELISA or radioimmunoassay. For statistical analysis, we will use 
independent samples t -test to analyze the association between participation in the lifestyle

VERSION DATE:   March 31st , 202 3 
 
 
 Page 49 of 54  
 intervention program and the mean concentrations of these breast milk markers. We will then use 
multivariate logistic regression to further examine this association, adjusting for key covariates.  
c. Procedures: At each study visit, if a participant is still breastfeeding and consent has been signed for 
this ancillary sub -study, study staff will collect one 10 -20mL sample of breast milk. Instructions will 
be provided at the previous study visit so that  if desired, a participant can pump their sample at home 
in the morning before arrival. If the sample is provided at the study visit, participants will be asked to 
pump a full breast using their own pump or a disposable manual breast pump that we provide. If 
pumped at the visit, study staff will thoroughly mix/shake the full sample and pour 10 -20ml into the 
provided sterile container; if at home, the participant will be given instructions on how to prepare the 
sample. The remainder of the sample will be ret urned to the subject. This sample will be processed in 
the laboratory and archived at -80oC at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The samples will be carried 
by the BWH LIPP study staff to BWH where they will be stored in freezers in a secured room in a 
secured  building by subject ID number and date of collection to be used for future analysis.   
 
 
The impact of the proposed supplemental work lies in identifying modifiable factors that may impact 
breastfeeding outcomes, offspring growth and adiposity. Results from this study could provide further 
insight into the role of lactational programming in intergenerational obesity.

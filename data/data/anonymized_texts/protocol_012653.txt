Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Injections of 
PolyPEPI 1018 Vaccine as an Add -on Immunotherapy  to the Standard-of-
Care Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Metastatic C olorectal Cancer 
(OBERTO)  
Phase of Developm ent: Phase 1; First -in-Human 
Planned Study Period:  Initiation: Second quarter of 2018 (first subject first visit) 
Primary Completion: Third quarter of 201 9 (last subject Week 12 
assessment)  
Study Objective(s):  Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of 
PolyPEPI 1018 as an add-on to maintenance therapy in subjects with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  
Secondary Objective(s):  
• To identify PEPIs (Personal EPItopes capable of inducing T cell 
responses in an individual)  from PolyPEPI 1018 in each study subject  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of PolyPEPI 1018 by measuring  both 
effector and memory T cell  responses  
• To evaluate initial efficacy of PolyPEPI 1018 by evaluating Objective 
Response  Rate (ORR)  
Exploratory Objective(s) :  
• To explore the correlation between PEPIs and T cell  responses  
• To explore the correlation between PEPIs and tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes   
• To explore the correlation between T cell  responses  and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes   
• To explore the correlation between PEPIs  and ORR  
• To explore the correlation between T cell  responses  and ORR 
Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open -label, non-randomized , multicenter study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of multiple 
subcutaneous (SC) injection s of PolyPEPI 1018 as an add-on immunotherapy 
to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in  approximately 10 subjects 
with mCRC.  This is an amended Study Design only in the USA : 5 subjects in 
Italy are under evaluation after a single SC injection of the same vaccine, as 
originally planned  (no amendment contemplated in Italy) . 
The study is composed of a 3 -week Screening Period, the administration of 
multiple doses vaccine (Day 1, Week 0 ; Day 92, Week 13; Day 183, week 
26), a 13-week Follow -up Period between the first and second vaccination 
and a 12-week Follow -up Period after the last vaccination . The study  will be 
conducted on an outpatient basis.  
Screening should be performed  in parallel with the subject’s completion of 
the standard -of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the standard -of-care 
maintenance treatment.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The first dose of PolyPEPI 1018 will be administered after the subject 
initiates the maintenance regimen, and within 3  weeks after the eligibility  CT 
scan was performed  (should be performed at the completion of the first -line 
treatment ). 
Subjects will be monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after first 
administration of PolyPEPI1018 (i.e. Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12) , then vaccinated 
again at week 13 and  monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after second 
administration of PolyPEPI1018 (i.e. Weeks 16, 19, 22 and 25), then 
vaccinated again at week 26 and  monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after

 CONFIDENTIAL  Sample Size Justificatio n: Approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled in the study  to receive three 
vaccination s. The study is not statistically powered to assess the primary or 
secondary outcomes measures.  
Assuming that the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) sets from the subjects 
follow the distribution observed in the HLA sets from the in -house database, 
at least 39 positive immune responses are expected from 10 subjects. The 
distribution of the expected number of positive tests is displayed in Figure S1, which is generated from 10,000 simulations. The x- axis shows the 
number of positive tests, and the y -axis shows the probabilities.  
Figure S1. Distribution of the Expected Number of Positive Tests  
 
Based on the simulation, at lea st 7 subjects are expected to have an immune 
response against 2 or more cancer antigens with at least 97.5% probability. 
The expected distribution of probabilities having a given number of subjects with positive immune response for 2 or more antigens is di splayed in 
Figure S2, the x-axis shows the number of subjects with a given probability 
and the y- axis shows the probabilit y.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1 Colorectal Cancer Background 
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer -related mortality worldwide. In the European 
Union (EU-28) and the World H ealth Organization  Europe Region, t he mean mortality rates 
per 100,000 population are respectively 15.2 and 15.7 for men and 9.0 and 9.7 for women 
(Ferlay 2015). The mean incidence rate of colorectal cancer  in the EU-28 is 31.3 per 
100,000 population (39.5 per 100,000 population for men and 24.4 per 100,000 population 
for women ), with 345,000 new cases per year.  
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States (US). In 2010, the US spent $14 billion for the 
management of colorectal cancer (Mariotto 2011).  
While multidisciplinary care is employed in the treatment of localized colon cancer, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). There are 
currently 10 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for the management of 
mCRC, including 5-fluorouracil (5FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan, capecitabine, bevacizumab, 
cetuximab, panitumumab, ziv- aflibercept, regorafenib and ramucirumab. There are a variety 
of regimens with different combinations of these drugs, for use in first-, second-, and 
third-line settings of treatment. For example, 5FU, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab 
are commonly used as a first -line therapy (Saltz 2008) . The Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene 
Homolog (RAS) is a family of genes including KRAS and NRAS that are often found to be 
mutated in colorectal cancer. When a tumor is  RAS wildtype (WT), patients derive benefit 
from monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab, which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Thus, EGFR targeted therapy, in addition to chemotherapy, 
is a common second- line strategy for patients with RAS WT disease (Seymour 2013). The 
chemotherapy backbone used in second -line treatment is often 5FU and irinotecan 
(FOLFIRI), with regorafenib monotherapy commonly used as a third- line option ( Grothey 
2013). More recently it has been shown that FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared with 
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, improve the outcome in patients with m CRC (Loupakis 2014). 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 19 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Despite the avail able treatment options, r esponse rates to mCRC remain low . Multiple 
therapies with novel mechanisms of actions are being developed  to treat mCRC , including 
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; also known as 
MAP2K) inhibitors. BRAF mutations, usually associated with poor prognosis, are found in 
~10% of patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC), and small molecule inhibitors of BRAF are 
being developed as combination treatments with other available therapies  (Cassidy 2017).  
Immunotherapy is an attractive treatment option since it is more tolerable  than conventional 
chemotherapy with potential long-lasting durable responses. Novel checkpoint inhibitors 
(CPIs) have demonstrated unprecedented clinical activity in a wide range of cancers. The 
observation of clinical activity in microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) mCRC was the first 
indication of a potential for mCRC to respond to these agents, and has led to a breakthrough designation by the FDA for CPI use in this subset of patients (estimated as 5% to 10% of the 
patient population with mCRC). However , a proportion of MSI-H, and nearly all 
microsatellite stable dis ease, does not respond to single-agent checkpoint inhibition, and 
clinical trials are ongoing to increase responses to immunotherapy in mCRC through both 
better patient selection and novel combinations of immunotherapeutic agents ( Bever 2017).  
1.2 PolyPEPI 1018 and Companion Diagnostic Vaccine Overview  
PolyPEPI 1018 CRC Vaccine (PolyPEPI 1018) and companion diagnostic (CDx) product is a 
precision CRC vaccine that takes into account an individual patient ’s genetics  and tumor 
heterogeneities using information technology during product design and responder selection 
processes. The subcutaneously (SC) injected vaccine product is a mixture  of 6 synthetic 
peptides ( Table 1) and the adjuvant Montanide™.  
The CDx is a pharmacogenetic test to be co-developed with PolyPEPI1018, which  will select 
patients wh o most likely respond to vaccine treatment. The CDx uses th e complete human 
leukocyte antigen ( HLA) genotype of the patient for the identification of  personal epitopes 
(PEPIs) that induce T Cell  responses. To identify PEPIs the sponsor developed the novel 
PEPI Test . As described in Section 6.6.1, the PEPI Test selects , from HLA restricted 
epitopes, certain PEPIs that are capable of activating  T cells in an individual. PEPIs are 
genetic biomarkers specific to  the HLA genotype of an  individual patient. The 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 20 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  PolyPEPI10108 CDx will use the PEPI T est to identify the patient’s PEPIs from 
PolyPEPI1018. D ata from a retrospective correlation study performed by the sponsor suggest 
that patients with  PEPIs derived from multiple CRC antigens are likely to benefit from 
PolyPEPI1018 vaccination.

The 6 peptides in PolyPEPI1018 contain 12 novel and distinct selected epitopes which are 
derived from 7 conserved cancer testis antigens (CTAs) that act in combination to activate 
T cells against CRC antigens in a high proportion of patients.   
The 7 most frequently expressed CTAs in CRC were selected as targets of PolyPEPI 1018, 
and statistical analysis demonstrates a 95% probability that 3 of these 7 CTAs are expressed 
in any CRC cell ( Figure 1). Given the high probability of targeting CRC expressed  CTAs by 
PolyPEPI 1018, tumor biopsy and CTA expression analysis, a risky, inaccurate and costly 
procedure1, is not required prior to vaccination  with PolyPEPI 1018. 
                                                 
1 There is no validated diagnostic device available to perform tumor antigen expression profiling from tumor 
biopsies. In addition, a biopsy does not comprehensively characterize a heterogeneous tumor, especially in the 
metastatic stage .

Right: Probability of expression in CRC tumor shows that 3 out of 7 CTAs are expressed in each tumor with

1.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
Cancer vaccines represent the next generation immunotherapies ( Chen 2013). They induce 
specific immune responses against tumor antigens, thereby boosting the immune system to 
attack cells expressing the targeted antigens. Tumor antigens that are currently being targeted 
by available immunotherapies include MUC1 and NY- ESO-1. Though current cancer 
vaccines have an excellent safety profile, the response rate is low due to poor antigen 
selection and the absence of a biomarker for identification of likely responders. 
PolyPEPI 1018 induces PEPI -specific immune responses against multiple CTAs that are 
expressed in CRC and are not typically expressed beyond embryonic development in healthy 
cells. One PEPI derived from one tumor antigen can activate one cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
(CTL) to proliferate (clonal expansion) and kill tumor cells that present the same PEPI. If the 
patient has a homogenous tumor that consists of a single type of cell which presents  the same 
PEPI, treatment with a single peptide vaccine could be successful. However, most tumors, 
especially at  the metastatic stage, represent a fast -evolving group of heterogeneous tumor 
cells which differ in antigen expression and PEPI presentation. Therefore, boosting several 
CTL clones (i.e. , polyvalent immune responses) using a combination of vaccines increases 
the probability of tumor cell recognition and tumor killing ( Figure 2).

1.2.2 Preclinical and Clinical Background for PolyPEPI 1018 
PolyPEPI 1018 will be evaluated in patients with mCRC. Since this is a first- in-human study, 
clinical safety and efficacy data from other peptide vaccines are summarized in the sections 
below.  
1.2.2.1 Safety of P eptide Vaccines and MontanideTM 
Overall there is a well -established safety profile for peptide vaccines and  the adjuvant 
Montanide™. To date, there are 22 published clinical trials, in 813 patients, on peptide 

Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 23 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  vaccines formulated with the adjuvant Montanide™ (details are provided in the Investigator 
Brochure). 
The most common side effect of peptide vaccines is inflammation at the injection site, 
including redness, pain, swelling, warming of the skin, itchiness, and rash. Occasionally, but 
rarely, unacceptable local skin reactions developed after 10 or more vaccinations, causing 
treatment to be terminated . After receiving a peptide vaccine, p atients occasionally 
experienced flu -like symptoms, including fever, chills, weakness, dizziness, nausea or 
vomiting, muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and occasional breathing difficulties. Blood 
pressure was also affected in some subjects who received a peptide vaccine. Many of these 
side effects,  which last for a short time, are signs/symptoms of inflammation (similar to those 
occurring after an acute viral infection) , likely indicating that the patient was mounting an 
immune response. 
Peptide vaccines , like any other medication affecting the immu ne system, can cause adverse 
effects that may prove life threatening. For example, severe hypersensitivity (allergic) 
reactions to specific vaccine ingredients have occurred following vaccination ; however, such 
severe reactions are very rare (Yoshida 2011). Furthermore, the design of PolyPEPI1018 
excludes peptides contain ing self-epitopes, thus reducing to a minimum the risk of 
autoimmune and/or hypersensitivity reactions. 
In the 813 subjects from the 22 published clinical trials on peptide vaccines formulated with 
Montanide™ the most serious adverse events (SAEs) were caused by cancer progression. 
Vaccine-related Grade 3 events were very rare (6 events, 0.7%), and consisted of skin 
reactions or cellulitis at the injection site , edemas of the head and neck regions, colit is, rectal 
bleeding and bladder-vaginal fistulae.  
1.2.2.2 Efficacy of Peptide Vaccines  
PolyPEPI1018 belongs to the class of peptide vaccines. Previous clinical studies have 
demonstrated that peptide  vaccines induce CTL responses. However, t he main limitation of 
these peptide vaccines is the absence of the induction of CTL responses against multiple 
antigens expressed in tumor cells.  
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 24 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  The sponsor hypothesized that induction of antigen specific immune response against 
multiple antigens that are expressed by the tumor cells will substantially improve the immune 
response rate and efficacy of the cancer vaccine. Consistent with this expectation, 
preliminary  clinical results with IMA901 peptide vaccines demonstrated  that polyva lent 
tumor specific CTL responses led to clinical benefit in renal cancer patients ( Walter 2012); 
two independent studies with personalized cancer vaccines confirmed these findings in melanoma patients (Ott 2017; Sahin 2017).  
A retrospective clinical study  conducted by the sponsor demonstrated significant correlation 
between objective response rate ( ORR) of cancer vaccines  containing multiple antigens  and 
PEPIs on at least  2 vaccine antigens  (see the Investigator Brochure ). These data suggest that 
that patients with  PEPIs derived from multiple CRC antigens are likely to benefit from 
PolyPEPI1018 vaccinations.  
1.3 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Regimen 
Treos Bio ZRT (sponsor) has developed a vaccine, PolyPEPI1018, which has the potential to 
elicit an immune response in most individuals with mCRC. Such an immune response is 
expected to control, reduce, or eliminate cancer  in those patients .  
The sponsor elected to move from a single vaccination (as originally planned) to multiple 
(N=3) vaccinations during this first- in-human study to establish the rate, intensity , and 
evolution of immune responses to PolyPEPI1018 as well as  initial efficacy . Since a sufficient 
time (typically 3 months/12 weeks) is required after vaccination  to observe the time course of 
both effector and memory T cell responses, the maintenance phase following first- line 
therapy of mCRC (a 4 to 6 month period when the tumor, therapy, and patient’s condition are 
expected to remain stable [ Heinemann 2014; Cremolini 2015; Venook 2017]) is the preferred 
period for treatment with PolyPEPI1018 since it offers o ptimal conditions for monitoring the 
time course of immune response after at least the initial vaccination. If a progression occurs 
during the course of the trial the subject will still be immunized at the expected times (Weeks 13 and 26), even when a second line therapy is needed and administered . 
Understanding the evolution of T cell response after vaccination will provide valuable information to design the vaccine administration schedule in future clinical studies. 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 25 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Moreover, a clean readout of immune res ponses after single vaccination with adequate 
follow-up will allow a better assessment of whether the PEPI Test can accurately  predict 
immune responses. Clarifying such correlation will provide a predictive tool that can be used 
as a CDx in future trials. Therefore , multiple  vaccinations 13 week apart  with a 12- week 
follow-up period after third and final vaccination will provide information to design  
subsequent Phase 2/3 trials.  
Only 1 line of prior mCRC chemotherapy treatment is allowed for subjects in this study since 
response to second- and third- line therapy is often associated with worse and shorter 
response compared with first-line therapy . Therefore, allowing more than 1 line of prior 
chemotherapy would not fulfil  the expectation of stable conditions during the 12- week 
follow-up period after first vaccination.  
Male or female subjects  must be between 18 years and 75 years of age at time of S creening 
since a robust immune system is needed to  elicit an appropriate immune res ponse to 
vaccination with PolyPEPI1018. Also for this reason, s ubjects must have an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 
The sponsor intends to explore whether multiple  vaccination s are able to elicit an immune 
response that is  sufficiently robust to generate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (Klintrup 
2005), and whether this correlates with PEPIs . The sponsor also intends to explore the initial 
efficacy of PolyPEPI1018 multiple vaccination s. Consequent ly, subjects must have 
histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from the colon or the 
rectum, with the presence of at least 1 measurable reference lesion according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria.  
The progression of CRC during the 12 weeks following each vaccination will be monitored 
by CT scan every 6 weeks not only to measure efficacy but also to establish whether subject 
need to start a second line induction therapy.  
Subjects in the study will receive maintenance therapy with a fluoropyrimidine (5-
fluorouracil or capecitabine) plus the same biologic agent (bevacizumab, cetuximab or 
panitumumab) used during induction. I t is typically assumed that  chemotherapy is immune 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 26 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  suppressive; however, recent advances have shown that in several  instances chemotherapy 
might exert positive effects on immune responses by inducing mechanisms that potentiate 
immunity  (Emens 2015).  It is also anticipated that treatment with  a biologic drug during 
maintenance therapy  will not interfere with vaccination. Studies have shown that EGFR 
inhibitors do not interfere with immunotherapies and bevacizumab potentiates immune 
responses ( Terme 2013; Mansfield 2013). Therefore, subjects will be immunized even when 
a second line therapy  is administered. 
Finally, maintenance therapy is allowed with 1 biological therapy regimen with or without a 
systemic chemotherapy regimen  scheduled to initiate prior to vaccination and to continue 
throughout the 12- week follow -up period. Thus, patients may receive standard -of-care 
treatment while participating in this study, including introducing a second line therapy , if 
needed. 
1.4 Benefits a nd Risks 
It is expected that PolyPEPI 1018 will induce  PEPI-specific immune responses against 
multiple CTAs expressed in CRC cells. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that 
peptide vaccines similar to PolyPEPI 1018 induce CTL responses. Recently, 2 independent 
studies have shown that personalized vaccination of melanoma patients, with selected mutant 
proteins identified as being the most likely  to generate an immune response, resulted in 
atypically long relapse-free durations after vaccination ( Ott 2017; Sahin 2017).   
Limitations of most vaccines include  a lengthy period needed to identify the targets , 
formulate  and manufacture vaccines. The present study would provide information for 
vaccine im provement. As described in Section 1.2, PolyPEPI1018 consists of the 7 most 
frequently expressed CTAs in CRC, and there is a 95% probability the 3 of these 7 CTAs are 
expressed in any CRC cell . It is expected that PolyPEPI 1018 will induce cytotoxic T cell 
responses against CTAs  expressed in CRC cells, thereby matching the vaccines to patient’s 
tumor antigens and whole HLA genotype. Only a saliva sample, not the traditionally required 
tumor biopsy, will be required for performing the  PEPI Test for the identification of likely 
responders, thus simplifying and accelerating the selection procedure.  
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 27 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  In order to examine whether the PEPI Test can predict immune respon ses and identify 
potential responders (thus providing the basis and the rationale for its use as CDx in future 
studies) it is essential that the present study allows 12 weeks of follow -up after each 
vaccination . This will also  provide useful information to inform us on scheduling (how often 
vaccination should be repeated)  during future multiple-vaccination studies. 
As described in Section 1.2.2.1, based on the safety profile of similar vaccines, 
PolyPEPI 1018 is expected to  be safe and well -tolerated. Side effects are typically mild 
(Section 1.2.2.1.). Local erythema and edema in the site of vaccination are expected , as well 
as a flu-like syndrome with minor fever and fatigue. Vaccines, like any other medication that 
affects the immune system, c an cause adverse effects that may prove life threatening. For 
example, severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions to specific vaccine ingredients have 
occurred following vaccination; however, such severe reactions are very rare ( Yoshida 
2011). Furthermore, the design of PolyPEPI1018 excludes peptides containing self-epitopes, thus reducing the risk of autoimmune and/or hypersensitivity reactions to a minimum.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous (SC) injections of 
PolyPEPI1018 as an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of- care maintenance therapy in 
approximately 10 subjects with mCRC. This is an amended Study Design only in  the USA: 5 
subjects in Italy are under evaluat ion after only a single SC injection of the same vaccine, as 
originally planned.  
The study is composed o f a 3-week Screening Period, the administration of multiple doses 
vaccine (Day 1, Week 0; Day 92, Week 13; Day 183, week 26), a 13- week Follow -up Period 
between the first and second vaccination and a 12- week Follow -up Period after the last 
vaccination. The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis. The Screening Period will occur between 21  days and 1 day prior to administration of 
PolyPEPI 1018 administration. Screening should be performed in parallel with the subject’s 
completion of the standard-of- care first-line treatment and initiation of the standard-of- care 
maintenance treatment.  During this study period, results from a CT scan, which should be 
performed at the completion of the first- line treatment regimen , must be obtained. T he results 
from the CT scan must confirm that the subject has responded to first- line chemotherapy with 
documentation of cancer regression or lack of progression, according to the RECIST version 
1.1 criteria.  Once informed consent has been obtained , the subject will undergo a biopsy 
procedure in one of the accessible tumors (primary or metastasis) to check for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  (TILs). 
The first dose of PolyPEPI1018 will be administered  on Day 1 of Week 0 and must be 
(1) after the subject initiates the maintenance  regimen, and (2) within 3 weeks after the 
eligibility CT scan was performed . Vaccination will be performed at 4 anatomic sites 
(preferably draining to axillary or inguinal lymph nodes) and administered by SC injection . 
After the last injection, the subject must remain at the site for at least 1 hour to be monitored 
for any local and/or systemic allergic reactions.  A buccal swab will be collected to determine 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 30 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  HLA types. A subject diary will be distributed to subjects to collect local signs related to the 
injection sites, physical fatigue , and body temperature. 
Subjects will be monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after first administration of 
PolyPEPI1018 (i.e. Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12), then vaccinated again at week 13 and  monitored 
every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after second administration of PolyPEPI1018 (i.e. Weeks 16, 19, 22 and 25), then vaccinated again at week 26 and  monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks 
after third administration of PolyPEPI1018 (i.e. Weeks 29, 32, 35 and 38).  
The timing of the s tudy assessments and procedures are summarized in the Schedule of Study 
Assessments (SoA)  in Appendix A . 
Figure 3. Study Design Schema  
Five subjects in Italy will follow the original Study Design  
 
Ten Subjects in the USA will follow the amended Study Design ; those who have already 
signed an Informed Consent Form for the original Study Design will be asked to sign a new

Design, the first one be ing accrued in May 2017. These subjects will be asked to sign a new 
informed consent for multiple dosing and it is anticipated that they will be willing to agree . It 
is also anticipated that subject accrual rate for the remaining six subjects will be one  subject 
every 20 days. Based on this rate it will take approximately 4 months to accrue a total of 10 
subjects. Since subjects are followed for 38 weeks  after the PolyPEPI 1018 initial vaccination , 
the total duration of the study is  approximately 14 months from the date of amendment, that 
is approximately 17 months from the initiation of the OBERTO study.

4.3 Subject Withdrawal and Discontinuation 
Any subject may voluntarily withdraw consent (i.e., reduce the degree of participation in the 
study) for aspects of continued participation and data collection. The reason for withdrawal 
will be recorded on the End of Study Case Report Form ( CRF). Assessments to be performed 
at the Last Visit are described in Section 7.4.  
Discontinuation (i.e., complete withdrawal from study participation) may be due to dropout 
(i.e., active discontinuation by subject) or loss to follow-up (i.e., discontinuation by subject 
without notice or action). Additionally, the investigator and sponsor have the discretion to 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 37 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  discontinue any subject from the study if, in their judgment, continued participation would 
pose an unacceptable risk for the subject.  
During the initial study period, that is during the 12 weeks following the first vaccination, if a 
patient experiences disease progression and needs to start a second -line therapy, the patient 
will be withdrawn from the study. This is required to obtain a complete (12 weeks)  
measurement of the immunological response curve after the initial vaccination, that is one of 
the original study objectives. In contrast, if a patient experiences disease progressi on and 
needs to start a second -line therapy  after the second vaccination , the patient will remain in 
the study, receive the third vaccination as scheduled and complete follow- up. This will allow 
to gain a better sense of initial efficacy of the PolyPEPI 1018 vaccine, that is another study 
objective. 
If a subject must be withdrawn from the study, the responsible designee medical monitor will 
be informed immediately, and this person will then notify the sponsor’s medically 
responsible party . All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of 
cause, should be seen as soon as possible and undergo the assessments specified for the Last 
Visit (see Section 7.4). 
If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the subject will remain under the supervision of the investigator until satisfactory health has returned or health has stabilized. The investigator 
will inform the subject’s primary health care provider (as applicable) as agreed by the 
subject, to ensure the subject receives the appropriate follow- up and care.  
If the subject is prematurely discontinuing due to withdrawal of consent, the investigator 
should clarify the level of consent withdrawal with the subject (i.e., consent withdrawal with 
regard to permission to utilize samples already collected but not analyzed and willingness to return for safety follow -up assessments). The level of consent withdrawal should be 
document ed this in the electronic case report form (eCRF)  
For subjects who are lost to follow-up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because 
they fail to appear for study  visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 38 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  should show “due diligence” by documenting in the source documents all steps taken to 
contact the subject (e.g., dates of telephone calls and registered letters ). 
Subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn from the study , including withdrawal after receipt 
of the study’s  IP on or after Day 1  of Week 0 , will be replaced, except for subject s who 
experience a DLT : a subject who experiences  a DLT will be withdrawn from the study and 
will not be replac ed. 
 
4.3.1 Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects will be permanently withdrawn from treatment for the following reasons: 
• Vaccine-related toxicity ( Section 5.5) 
• Requirement of prohibited concomitant medications ( Section 5.4.2) 
• Request by subject to terminate study 
• Completion of the study treatment as defined by the protocol 
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by the physician, even if not addressed in 
Section 5.5 
4.3.2 Premature Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects will be prematurely discontinued from treatment for the following reasons: 
• Failure by the subject to attend two consecutive clinic visits  
• Request by the subject to withdraw 
• Pregnancy  
• Development of an exclusionary condition as outlined in Section 4.2 
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he thinks the study is no longer in the best interest of the subject  
• Subject judged by the investigator to be at significant risk of failing to comply with 
the provisions of the protocol as to cause harm to self or seriously interfere with the 
validity of the study results 
• Subject reaches a defined study endpoint, as outlined in Se ction 3.2, if applicable 
• At the discretion of the health authority , IRB/IEC, investigator, or pharmaceutical 
supporter

statistician, and ad hoc authorized representatives as appropriate. The safety review team will 
meet regularly to review all SAEs and will examine non -serious AEs, clinical laboratory data 
and other relevant safety data.  
5.5.1 Local Reactions 
Local reactions, resulting from the vaccine will be graded using the local reaction assessment scale (Table 2).

If the subject develops a potentially life -threatening (Grade 4) local reaction thought to be 
probably or definitely related to vaccination , the safety review team must be notified within 
24 hours. 
The safety review team will determine whether local reactions are due to the vaccine.  
5.5.2 Systemic Reactions  
Systemic reactions will be graded according to the World Allergy Organization 
Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System ( Cox 2010) ( Appendix B ). 
The safety review team should be contacted within 48 hours for any non- local Grade 3 or 4 
reactions (i.e., elevated temperature following vaccination s) thought probably or definitel y 
related to vaccination.  
The safety  review team will determine whether systemic reactions are due to the vaccine.  
5.5.3 Anticancer Drugs  
Unanticipated and anticipated toxicities from the anticancer maintenance therapy regimen 
will be graded according to  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 ( https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ).  
Any Grade 3 or 4  toxicities that result in a temporary or permanent change in an anticancer 
therapy must be reported to the safety  review team within 4 days of knowledge of the 
change.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PRO CEDURES  
The timing of the study assessments and procedures are summarized in the SoA in 
Appendix A .  
The investigator and sponsor will conduct the study in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local regulations. Adherence to 
the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct, and the investigator must ensure that study procedures are performed as 
described in the protocol. During the study, procedures and observations will be monitored to 
confirm th at study requirements are being followed as outlined in the SoA. 
6.1 Informed Consent Form  
Any patient who provides informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) is considered a subject in the study. Subjects  presently on 
study who have signed an informed consent form for a single vaccination will be asked to sign a new informed consent form for multiple (N=3) vaccinations. 
6.2 Subject Identification Code  
The following series of numbers will comprise the SIC: protocol identifier (e.g., 090701) to 
be provided by the sponsor, 2- or 3 -digit study site number (e .g., 02) to be provided by the 
sponsor, and 3- or 4 -digit subject number (e.g., 0003) reflecting the order of providing 
informed consent. For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at the 
site 02 will be identified as Subject 090701-020003. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, 
clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Additionally, a uniquely coded SIC(s) is permitted if i t does not contain a 
combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e .g., collection of a 
subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing 
data privacy.  
6.3 Screening Log  
The study site is responsible for maintaining a Screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 47 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  failure. All screenin g data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening 
outcome. If a subject is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new 
informed consent form ( ICF), new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject.  
6.4 Vaccine Site Evaluation 
A vaccine site evaluation for local and/or systemic adverse reactions will be performed in the 
clinic 1 hour after vaccination. If there are no adverse reactions noted within 1 hour after 
vaccination, subjects may be released from the clinic.  
Results of the site evaluation and toxicity grade, if appropriate, must be recorded in the source documents and documented on the CRF. 
For subsequent visits, vaccine site evaluation must be repeated.  
The following vaccination steps must be recorded in the source documents and documented 
on the CRF: 
• Vaccination sites  
• Disinfection of vaccination sites 
• Time of application  
6.5 Evaluation of Response to First- line Therapy  
During the Screening Period, results from a CT scan which was performed at the completion 
of the first -line treatment regimen must be obtained  (i.e., eligibility CT scan). The results will 
be evaluated by the investigator and must confirm that the subject has responded to first- line 
chemotherapy with documentation of cancer regression or lack of progression, according to 
RECIST version 1.1 criteria  
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf ) 
6.6 Immunogenicity and Efficacy Assessments  
The following immu nogenicity and efficacy parameters will be assessed:  
• PEPI Test  
• Effector T cell response  
• Memory T cell response  
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 48 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • TILs assessment  
• CT assessment  
6.6.1 PEPI Test  
To identify PEPIs the sponsor developed a novel PEPI Test. The PEPI Test selects from 
HLA restricted epitopes certain PEPIs that are capable of activating  T cells in an individual. 
PEPIs are genetic biomarkers specific to the HLA genotype of an individual patient. The PEPI Test will be used to identify PEPIs among the 12 selected epitopes of PolyPEPI1018 in  
each study subject .  
To perform the PEPI Test a buccal  swab sample will be collected on Day 1 (Visit 2) and sen t 
to LabCorp for HLA genotyping. LabCorp will send the HLA genotype data to T reos Bio 
ZRT (sponsor) to perform the PEPI Test. The sponsor will perform the PEPI Test before any 
immunology or efficacy assessment  becomes available, essentially in a blinded fashion. The 
PEPI Test results will be unblinded and the data compared with immunology and efficacy 
results as described in Section 9.5.2. 
6.6.2 Effector T Cell Response 
Effector T cells are generated through activation of naïve or memory T cells following 
recognition of epitopes presented by the HLA molecules. E LISPOT assay is a routine test to 
be utilized for the detection  of effector T cells that respond to PolyPEPI1018 treatment from 
a population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 
6.6.3 Memory T Cell Response 
Memory T cells are a subset of antigen specific T cells that previ ously encountered and 
responded to their cognate epitope. Such T cells are primed by HLA- restricted peptides and 
originate either from cancer cells or from the vaccine. Durin g a second activation, memory 
T cells can proliferate faster than during priming. This behavior is captured by the PHPC 
assay, abbreviated from “T cell precursors with high proliferation capacity” that allows the 
expansion of memory cells during prolonged culture and then detects the progeny of the 
antigen-specific memory T cell clone b y IFN-γ ELISPOT. It has been previously 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 49 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  demonstrated that the PHPC assay identifies expandable memory T cells that can reveal 
previous exposur e to specific peptide antigens ( Calarota 2008). 
6.6.4 Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL s)  
The presence of TILs is associated with favorable long ‐term outcome in several cancers, 
including breast cancer and CRC ( DeNardo 2007; Schmidt 2008; Klintrup 2005). 
During the  procedure tumor specimens are fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 
4‐μm ‐thick sections are prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining or other appropriate 
staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). All stainings  and data readin g are performed and 
reviewed by the same pathologist. The unused tumor sections will be retained according to 
the site procedure.  
TILs are assessed according to published criteria (Klintrup 2005) using a 4- degree scale at 
the deepest area of the invasive margin. A score of 0 is given when there is no increase in 
inflammatory cells, 1 denotes a mild and patchy increase in inflammatory cells, 2 denotes a moderate and band like inflammatory infiltrate with some destruction of ca ncer cell islands, 
and 3 denotes a marked and florid cuplike inflammatory infiltrate with frequent destruction of cancer cell islands. These scores can be subsequently classified as low grade (scores 0 and 
1) and high grade (scores 2 and 3).  
6.6.5 CT scan and RECIST/ irRECIST evaluation  
CT scan will be performed at the site and original data will be retained either in a CD -ROM 
format or in a data room.  
RECIST criteria will be evaluate d at baseline, week 6 (Visit 4), week 12 (Visit 6), week 25 
(Visit 11), week 38 (Visit 16) based on the CT scan results. If progressive disease (PD) is 
suspected at week 6, irRECIST evaluation 
(https://www.parexel.com/files/7914/2186/7838/irrecist- path-PDF.pdf)  will be implemented; 
if the subject remains in the study, the CT scan on Wk 12 will be evaluated according to irRECIST criteria.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.7 Safety Assessments 
6.7.1 Adverse Events  
Details on definitions and reporting of AEs are provided in Section 8. 
All AEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the ICF until completion of the Last 
Visit. Patients should be monitored for AEs consistent with the current Investigator’s 
Brochure for PolyPEPI 1018. 
6.7.2 Urgent Safety Measures  
An urgent safety measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by the protocol, 
to protect subjects participating in a clinical trial from immediate harm. Urgent safety 
measures may be taken by the by the investigator or the safety review team , and may include 
any of the following:  
1. Immediate change in study design or study procedures 
2. Temporary or permanent halt of a given clinical trial or trials  
3. Any other immediate action taken to  protect clinical trial participants from immediate 
hazard to their health and safety  
The investigator or the safety review team may take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect subjects against any immediate hazard to their health or safety. The measures sho uld 
be taken immediately and may be taken without prior authorization from the sponsor. In the event(s) of an apparent immediate hazard to the subje ct, the investigator will notify the 
medical monitor immediately by phone and confirm notification to the safety review team  in 
writing as soon as possible, but within 1 calendar day after the change is implemented. The 
sponsor will also ensure the respons ible ethics committee(s) and relevant competent 
authority(s) are notified of the urgent safety measures taken in such cases according to local regulations. 
6.7.3 Untoward Medical Occurrences  
Untoward medical occurrences occurring before the first exposure to IP are not considered 
AEs (according to the definition of AE, see Section 8). However, each serious untoward 
medical occurrence experienced before the IP exposure (i.e., from the time of signed 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 51 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  informed consent up to but not including the IP exposure) will be described on the AE CRF 
and on the SAE Report Form. These events will not be considered as SAEs and will not be 
included in the analysis of SAEs.  
For the purposes of this study, each non- serious untoward medical occurrence experienced 
by a subject undergoing study- related procedure(s) before the IP exposure will be recorded 
on the AE CRF; these events will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the 
analysis of AEs.  
6.7.4 Non-Medical Complaints  
A non-medical complaint (NMC) is any alleged product deficiency that relates to identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety, and performance of the product but did not result in an 
AE. NMCs incl ude but are not limited to the following: 
1. A failure of a product to exhibit its expected pharmacological activity and/or design 
function, e.g.  reconstitution difficulty  
2. Missing components 
3. Damage to the product or unit carton 
4. A mislabeled product (e.g., potential counterfeiting/tampering)  
5. A bacteriological, chemical, or physical change or deterioration of the product 
causing it to malfunction or to present a hazard or fail to meet label claims  
Any NMCs of the product will be documented on an NMC form and reported to the sponsor 
within 1 business day. If requested, defective product(s) will be returned to the sponsor for 
inspection and analysis according to procedures. 
6.7.5 Medical, Medication, and Non -Drug Therapy History  
At Screening, the subject’s medical his tory will be described for the following body systems 
including severity (defined in Section 8.2.1) or surgery and start and end dates, if known: 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; musculoskeletal; 
neurological; endocrine; hematopoietic/lymphatic; dermatological; and genitourinary. 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 52 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  All medications taken and non-drug therapies received from 3 months prior to enrollment 
until completion/termination will be rec orded on the concomitant medications and non- drug 
therapies CRFs.  
6.7.6 Physical Examinations 
Complete and targeted physical examinations will be performed as summarized in 
Appendix A .  
Complete physical examinations will be performed on the following body systems: general appearance, signs and symptoms (including, but not limited to the head and neck, eyes and 
ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and joints, lymph nodes, skin, 
and neurological). Moreover, diagnoses, Karnofsky  score, height, weight and vital signs will 
be registered. Finally , skin observation will be performed. 
At Screening, if an abnormal condition is detected, the condition will be described on the 
medical history CRF. At study visits, if a new abnormal or worsened abnormal pre- existing 
condition is detected, the condition will be described on the AE CRF. If the abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a preexisting disease (described 
in Section 8.1.6), not clinically significant, a symptom of a new/worsened condition already 
recorded as an AE, or due t o another issue that will be specified, the investigator will record 
the justification on the source record. 
At Visits 3 and 5, a targeted physical examination including vital signs should be driven by 
any new or previously identified signs and symptoms that the subject has experienced since 
the last visit. 
6.7.7 Vital Signs  
Vital sign values (including seated blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and oral temperature) are to be measured at every visit  as part of the complete and targeted physical examinations,  
and recorded on the CRF. At Day 1, measurement of vital signs must be performed in two 
occasions: before vaccination and 1 hour after last vaccination. For each abnormal vital sign 
value, the investigator will determine whether to report an AE (see definit ion in Section 8.1.1 
and record the medical diagnosis [ preferably ], symptom, or sign on the AE CRF) to the 
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 53 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  safety review  team. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the 
significance or etiology of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be 
obtained when clinically indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at 
the discretion of the investig ator. 
6.7.8 Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
6.7.8.1 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry 
The hematology panel will consist of complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes [i.e., red blood cell count], and leukocytes [i.e., white blood cell count]) with 
differential (i.e., basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils) and platelet counts.  
The clinical chemistry panel will consist of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
protein, albumin, ALAT , ASAT, gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase,  total bilirubin, uric acid, 
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alkaline phosphatase and glucose.  
Urinalysis will include description of color and clarity, specific gravity, pH, content of 
protein, glucose, nitrites and ketones. A microscopic analysis will be performed to check for 
red or white blood cells, casts, crystals, bacteria, yeast cells, parasites , and squamous cells. 
Urine and blood samples will be obtained for assessment of hematology and clinical 
chemistry at Screening, at Visit 2  (Day 1, Week 0) , Visit 4 (Week 6) , Visit 6 (Week 12), 
Visit 9 (Week 19), Visit 11 (Week 25), Visit 14 (Week 32) and Visit 16 (Week 38). 
Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed at the local laboratory at 
the investigator site.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.7.8.3 Assessment of Laboratory Values 
6.7.8.3.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values  
The investigator’s assessment of each laboratory value will be recorded on the CRF. For each 
abnormal laboratory value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered 
clinically significant or not. For clinically significant values, the investigator will indicate if 
the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 8.1.1, and record the sign, symptom, 
or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF), is a symptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due to a pre- existing disease (described in  Section 8.2.2), or is due to another issue that 
will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indicate the reason, i.e., because it is due to a preexisting disease, due to a lab error, or due to 
another issue that will be specified. Additional tests and other evaluations required to 
establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE 
should be obtained when clinically indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be 
followed at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator will communicate the AE to 
the safety review team for final evaluation.  
6.7.9 Patient Diary  
A subject dia ry will be distributed to subjects  on Day 1 (Visit 2) , Day 92 ±2 (Visit 7) and 
Day 183 ±2 (Visit 12) to collect local signs related to the injection sites, physical fatigue, and 
body temperature during the first two weeks after the injection . Temperature s hould be 
consistently measured at  the same location (e.g. underarm, ear, mouth etc.) . 
6.8 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance  
All study procedures are to be performed under the direct supervision of the investigator/a 
licensed healthcare professional at the study site, and thus, no separate procedures will be 
used to monitor subject compliance.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
Timely collection and assessment of SAE reports are critical for protecting the safety of 
patients. SAE reporting is a regulatory responsibility of the Sponsor under the Code of 
Federal Regulations (Title 21, Sub-Part B, section 312.32). 
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an IP that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (e.g., 
rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or 
outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether  considered causally 
related to the I P.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the 
initiation of the treatments or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatments. 
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1 or more of 
the following criteria:  
1. Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) . 
2. Is life-threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of 
the safety  review team, at ris k of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization – inpatient hospitalization  refers to any inpatient admission, regardless 
of length of stay. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
5. Is a medically important event – a medical  event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definitions above.  
Treos Bio ZRT  OBERTO -101 Amendment 3 
Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 59 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
Any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment (i.e., including active comparators) that is 
both serious and unexpected.  
The event(s) must meet all the following: 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious 
• Unexpected  
• Assessed as related to study treatment  
Once determined to meet the criteria for a SUSAR, an SAE  should be submitted to regulatory 
agencies expeditiously.  
8.1.4 Non-Serious Adverse Event  
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.  
8.1.5 Unexpected Adverse Events  
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safety 
Information (RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the product, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the product under investigation. The expectednes s of AEs will be determined by the 
sponsor using the Investigator’s Brochure as the RSI. This determination will include 
considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated form the pharmacologica l properties of a product. 
8.1.6 Preexisting Diseases  
Preexisting diseases that are present before entry in to the study are described in the medical history, and those that manifest with the same severity, frequency, or duration after IP 
exposure, will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an increase in the severity, 
duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE CRF.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE from the IP exposure until study completion/discontinuation date will be described 
on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be 
established at the time of reporting the AE, a symptom or sign, in standard medic al 
terminology to  avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition 
in Section  8.1). Each AE will be evaluated by the safety  review team for:  
1. Seriousness as defined in Section 8.1.2 
2. Severity as defined in Section 8.2.1 
3. Causal relationship to IP exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 8.2.2 
For each AE, the outcome (i.e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved 
with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable (e.g. for 
maintenance therapy drugs)  action taken (i.e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose 
reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs attribution must be clearly specified, whether it is attributed to the 
vaccine or to maintenance drugs or any other concomitant medication. Recovering/resolving 
AEs will be followed until resolution,  medically stabilized, or 30 days after the study 
completion, whichever comes first). If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported 
as separate AE). During the course of any AE, the highest severity rating will be reported.  
Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including overdosing, under dosing, abuse, and withdrawal), treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an 
incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol-defined dosing schedule), failures of 
expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be 
followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy, and/or other observations 
because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities.  
Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP to a female subject or to a male subject whose partner gets pregnant during the study period will be reported on a Pregnancy Re port 
Form and followed- up at estimated date of delivery.

 CONFIDENTIAL  If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study completion, the 
SAE must be reported on the provided SAE Report Form within 24 hours after awareness; no 
additional reporting on CRFs is necessary.  
8.2.1 Severity 
The safety review team will assess the severity of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment based on the most appropriate description below (according to CTCAE 
Version 4.0): 
1. Mild (Grade 1)  
o Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2. Moderate (Grade 2)  
o Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
3. Severe (Grade 3)  
o Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indi cated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
4. Life threatening (Grade 4)  
o Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5. Death related to AE  (Grade 5)  
o Grade 5 is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option  
These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a 
study-related procedure(s), if necessary.  
8.2.2 Causality 
Causality is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP is 
etiologically related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e .g., 
assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, 
and physiological plausibility. For each AE, the safety review team will assess the causal

Product: PolyPEPI 1018 Colorectal Cancer Vaccine  Page 62 of 81 
 CONFIDENTIAL  relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and ju dgment 
according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: 
1. Not related (both circumstances must be met)  
o Is due to underlying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs 
o Is not associated with the IP (i.e., does not follow a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of IP or has a much more likely alternative 
etiology).  
2. Unlikely related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)  
o Has little or no temporal relationsh ip to the IP  
o A more likely alternative etiology exists  
3. Possibly related (both circumstances must be met)  
o Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IP 
o An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to the IP 
4. Probably related (both circumstances must be met)  
o Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of IP, which may include but is not limited to the following:  
– Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re-administration (pos itive 
rechallenge)  
– Positive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc.)  
– Toxic level of the IP as evidenced by measurement of the IP 
concentrations in the blood or other bodily fluid 
o Another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely  
5. Definitely related  
o There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. 
These causality definitions will also be used to assess the rel ationship of an AE with a 
study-related procedure(s), if necessary .

 CONFIDENTIAL  9 STATISTICS  
9.1 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of the IP . 
This population will be the primary analysis set for safety outcomes.  
9.2 Replacement of Subjects  
Any subject who withdraws from the study prematurely, or who discontinues study 
vaccination prematurely without experiencing a primary safety endpoint ( Section 9.4) before 
the Day 85 (Week 12, Vi sit 6) evaluation, and whose reasons for withdrawing from the 
study, or discontinuing study vaccination administration, are unrelated to any real or 
perceived effect of the study vaccination or its administration, will be replaced with another 
subject. If possible, all subjects who discontinue study treatment prematurely will be 
followed for 12 weeks for all study evaluations. A maximum of 5 subjects will be replaced  
without asking the sponsor ’s permission . If more than 5 subjects need to be replaced, then the 
study team  may, for this reason, ask the sponsor for approval. 
9.3 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
9.3.1 Missing Data Resulting from Study Withdrawal  
Only data collected from the visits by subjects will be included in the statistical analysis. No  
imputation will be carried out on missing values.  
9.3.2 Intermediate Missing Data  
Only data collected from the visits by subjects will be included in the statistical analysis. No 
imputation will be carried out on missing values.  
9.4 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the occurrence of at least 1 ≥Grade 4 local AE or 1 ≥Grade 3 
systemic AE and/or signs/symptoms, lab toxicities, and/or clinical events that is  probably or 
definitely related to study treatment (as judged by the safety review team, including site 
clinicians on the team) any time from Day 1 (Visit 2) until 21 days after administration of the 
vaccine (Visit 3).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.5 Statistical Analyses 
9.5.1 Safety Analysis 
Major components for the safety analysis will include:  
• AEs solicited at every study visit, recorded, and  coded according to the version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that is current on the date of 
study initiation  
• SAEs 
• Vital signs and physical examination findings  
• Laboratory parameters  
All safety assessments will be summarized in a descriptive manner similar to the analysis 
described in Section 9.5.1.1.  
Data reported by the subjects in Patient Diary, including local signs  related to the injection 
sites, physical fatigue, and body temperature , will be summarized in a descriptive manner.  
9.5.1.1 Analysis of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis. Adverse events will be listed for each subject and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term according to the latest version of MedDRA. In addition, summaries of AEs by 
severity and relationship to IP will be presented. All safety and tolerability data recorded 
during the study will be listed and summarized over time, as appropriate. For the purpose of summaries and listings , the durations of AEs will be calculated as follows: (stop [day ] – start 
[day]) + 1 day, which yields the number of days on which the AE was pr esent. 
Treatment emergent AEs are defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened in severity after 
the first administration of the IP. Adverse event summaries will include incidence of TEAEs, 
SAEs including deaths, AEs that led to IP discontinuation, AEs b y maximum severity and 
relationship to IP, and temporally infusion related AEs. The version of the MedDRA that is 
current on the date of study initiation will be used throughout conduct and data analysis. All summaries will be presented by MedDRA SOC and preferred term for each treatment group.  
Safety/tolerability and AE data will be presented in individual listings.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.5.2 PEPI and Immunogenicity Analyses 
Each of the 6 peptides in  PolyPEPI1018 contain 2 epitopes (for a total of 12 epitopes) 
selected to elicit a T  cell response in a high portion of subjects . The PEPI Test identifies 
which epitope represents a PEPI (that is capable of inducing a T cell response) in each  
subject. A PEPI is unique and is based on the subject’s HLA genotype. T herefore, a selected 
epitope encoded in PolyPEPI1018 might be a PEPI for 1 individual and not for others, and 
vice versa. A subject may have more  than 1 PEPI , or no PEPI. The  PEPI Test (described in 
Section 6.6.1) will be performed in each subject who is enrolled in the study from the results 
of the HLA genotyping.  
The ELISPOT assay (described in Section 6.6.2) and the PHPC assay  (described in 
Section 6.6.3) measure effector and memory responses, respectively . These assays will be 
performed in each subject from blood samples collected during a time course from B aseline 
until the Last Visit. Based on the results of the PEPI Test and the immunogenicity tests  
(ELISPOT and PHPC)  the secondary outcome measures will be analyzed as described in 
Section 3.2.2.  
Immunogenicity analyses may be performed at any time during the trial, however, t he results 
of the PEPI Test will be obtained before the results of the corresponding immunogenicity 
tests are available. F inal analysis  will be based on all data up to Day 85 (Week 12, 
Visit 6) for all study subjects (data from the start of study treatment of the last accrued 
subject through Day 85 [Week 12, Visit 6]). 
9.5.3 Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy will be evaluated as Objective Response Rate (ORR) measured by CT scan at 
Screening Visit (Week -3 to -1), and at 6-, and 12 weeks after administration of each dose of 
the vaccine. RECIST and irRECIST criteria will be used.  
Primary and secondary  analyses will be summarized in a descriptive manner .

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.5.4 Exploratory Analyse s  
• Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to measure correlations. The 
significance of the correlations will be tested using standard method of estimating 
significance of correlations ( 𝑟𝑟�𝑛𝑛−2
1−𝑟𝑟2 follows the t  distribution with degree of freedom 
n-2, where r  is the Pearson correlation and n is the number of measurements)  
• Correlated data points will be plotted and trend lines will be obtained using 
perpendicular (orthogonal) regression, since both axes contain measurements and/or 
predicted valu es (PEPIs predicted by the PEPI T est)  
• The significance of the changes will be tested by non- parametric tests (Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test). Non- parametric test is preferred due to the small sample size and 
the questionable normality of the data  
9.6 Determination of Sample Siz e 
Approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled in the study to receive three vaccinations . The 
study is not statistically powered to assess the primary or second ary outcomes measures.  
Assuming that the HLA sets from the subjects fo llow the distribution observed in the HLA 
sets from the in -house database, at least 39 positive immune responses are expected from 
10 subjects. The distribution of the expected number of positive tests is displayed in Figure 4, 
which is generated from 10,000 simulations. The x-axis shows the number of positive tests, and the y-axis shows the probabilities.

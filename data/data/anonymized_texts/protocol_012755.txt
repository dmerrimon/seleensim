vital signs, physical exam, concomitant medications, cancer 
screening tests, viral screening, MNSI, VAS, 12 lead EKG, retinal 
fundoscopy, serum chemistry and hematology, and pregnancy test 
(women of childbearing potential only).  
 
Prior to full screening, subjects will give informed consent and 
then be initially screened using the VAS , the S ymptoms portion of 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 6 of 103 the BPNS and the MNSI.   Only s ubjects with a VAS score of ≥ 40 
mm, a ≤ 5 point difference in symptom of BPNS between legs and 
MNSI score of ≥ 3 will be allowed to proceed  with the full 
screening procedures. The remaining s creening activities will 
include assessment of the other study e ligibility  criteria, a 
complete medical history, vital signs, physical exam, concomitant 
medications, cancer screening tests, viral screening, 12 lead EKG, 
retinal fundoscopy, serum  chemistry  and hematology including 
HbA1c , urinalysis, and pregnancy test ( women of childbearing 
potential only) . 
 
If applicable, the subject will be washed out of prohibited 
medications prior to initiation  of the 7 day Daily Pain and Sleep 
Interference Diary ; completion of the Diary should occur  within 1 4 
days prior to the first  round of injections.  The average pain score 
of the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary must be ≥ 4 with a 
standard deviation ≤ 2  in order to be eligible for study 
participation.    
 
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in 2:2:1 ratio to the 
low dose, high dose or placebo group. 
 
Prior to injections, subjects  will undergo a skin biopsy (one 3 mm 
diameter round sample from the left ankle, the left calf and the left  
upper thigh, for a total of 3 samples / subject).  Subjects will 
receive VM202 or placebo (normal saline) by intramuscular 
injections in both legs (in the calf) on Day 0, and Day 14 as 
follows:

Note:  Visually, normal saline is indistinguishable from 
reconstituted VM202.  The subjec t and clinician will not be able to 
distinguish placebo from  VM202 injections . 
 
Subject s in the High  Dose Group ( 16 mg VM202 / leg) will receive  
the following intramuscular injections in each calf : 
 
• Day 0  - 32 injections of 0.5mL of VM202 / calf (8 mg of V M202 
/ calf ) 
• Day 14  - 32 injections of 0.5mL of VM202 / calf (8 mg of 
VM202 / calf ) 
 
Subject s in the placebo control group will receive 32 injections / 
calf of 0.5 mL normal saline at each visit.  
 
 HGF s erum levels will be determined  immediately pre -treatm ent on 
Day 0, immediately pre -treatment on Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60 
and Day 90.   
 
The number of copies of VM202 in whole blood  will be determined 
at Day 0 (pre- injection, and 2 hours  [± 1 hour]  post injection), at 
Day 14 (pre -injection, and 2 hours [± 1 hour]  post injection), Day 
21, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90.  
VAS, and Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy 
(BPI-DPN) , will be recorded at Day 0 , Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 
6 months and 9 months.  Patients’ Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC ) will be recorded at Day  30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months 
and 9 months.  MNSI will be conducted at 6 months and 9 months 
to track disease progression .  Skin biopsy will be repeated at 6 
months and symptoms of the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy 
Screening (BPNS ) will be recorded at  6 months.   
 
The Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary will be filled out by 
patients before Day 90, the 6 Month and 9 Month visits. 
 Retinal fundoscopy will be conducted at 9 months.

STUDY ENDPOINTS  The primary study endpoint is the  change  in the average 24 hour 
pain score  (change from baseline to the 6-month follow -up). The 
difference in the mean of the change in the average 24 -hour pain 
score will be compared  between the treatment groups and the 
placebo arm  to determine the treatme nt effect .  The average pain 
score s will be obtained from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference 
Diary  (recorded daily by the patient for 7 days during Screening 
prior to  the first round of injections and again, before the 6 month 
follow -up).   
 
SAFETY  Any subject  who receives study drug ( VM202  or placebo)  will be 
included in the safety analysis population.   Adverse events 
(including serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to 
treatment discontinuation) throughout the 9 month s follow -up will 
be de scribed according to severity and to their relationship with the 
study drug and injection  procedure. Descriptive statistics (N, mean, 
median, SD, minimum and maximum values, where applicable) will be used to characterize safety parameters.  
 All subject s will all undergo testing as presented in the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Screening Guidelines as part of their baseline testing to rule out cancer.  
 
PHARMACOKINETICS  Determination of HGF serum levels will be determined 
immediately pre -treatment on Day 0,  immediately pre -treatment on 
Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  The number of copies of 
VM202 in whole blood will be determined at Day 0 (pre -injection, 
and 2 hours  [± 1 hour]  post injection), at Day 14 (pre -injection, and 
2 hours [± 1 hour]  post inj ection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 
90.

1.1. DIABETES  
Approximately 23.6 million adults in the United States have diabetes mellitus, a 
metabolic disorder of multiple causes characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and 
disorders of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism.†  Diabetes can result from 
defects in insulin secretion (type 1), insulin action (type 2), or a combination of these 
factors, and is associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality.  The total 
estimated cost of diabetes in 2007 was $174 billion, including $116 billion in excess 
medical expenditures and $58 billion in reduced national productivity.1 
 
1.1.1.  DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY  
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most commonly encountered 
neuropathic pain syndromes in clinical practice, and is a particularly debilitating 
complication of diabetes.  When symptomatic, it is associated with continuous or 
paroxysmal pain described by patients as  shooting, stabbing, or electric in nature.2  
The pain can either be triggered by an external stimulus or be independent of external i nput.  Unlike other painful sensations which signal a warning in response to 
a harmful stimulus, neuropathic pain is maladaptive.  DPN accounts for significant morbidity
 by predisposing the foot to ulceration and lower extremity amputation.3,4   
 According to both the American Diabetes Association and the National Institute of 
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Dise ase, 60 to 70 percent of diabetics will 
eventually develop some form of diabetic neuropathy.  Today, 3.9 million diabetics over the age of 40 already have symptomatic DPN.
5  The total annual cost of DPN 
and its complications in the U.S. is estimated to be between $4.6 and $13.7 billion.6,7  
If current health trends persist unabated, the costs associated with diabetic 
neuropathy will rise sharply over the coming decades.  
 
1.1.2.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY  
DPN manifests as three broad categories: sensory, motor and autonomic.  The most 
prevalent form is somatic or sensorimotor neuropathy.  Symptoms often exhibit a distal symmetric pattern, beginning distally at the base of the toes and ascending 
proximally up the lower leg as the disease progresses.  Symptoms are described as 
burning, tingling, stabbing and a pins -and-needles sensation in a stocking and glove 
distribution.  Patients may also display muscle weakness, lack of coordination and ataxia, and loss of pain perception.  Loss of protective sensation can lead to the 
formation of foot ulcerations, infections, and amputations.  
 
Despite being the focus of current research, the sequence of physiological events that 
result in this condition is poorly understood.  The pathogenesis of diabetic 
neuropathy likely involves the interplay of hyperglycemia, ischemia, and oxidative

  Page 17 of 103 stress.8  Vascular dysfunction, driven by metabolic change, is thought to play a 
crucial role in the progression of diabetic neuropathy.9-12  Figure 1 portrays the 
relationship of hyperglycemia to oxidative stress, metabolic alterations, vascular 
dysfunction and neural damage.  
 
 
Figure 1. The neurodestru ctive effects of hyperglycemia 
 
Increased polyol pathway flux.  Hyperglycemia causes increased levels of 
intracellular glucose in nerves, leading to saturation of the normal glycolytic pathway.  Extra glucose is shunted into the polyol pathway and converted  to sorbitol 
and fructose by the enzymes aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Accumulation of sorbitol and fructose lead to reduced nerve myoinositol, decreased 
membrane Na
+/K+-ATPase activity, impaired axonal transport, and structural 
breakdown of  nerves, causing abnormal action potential propagation.13 
 
Non-enzymatic protein glycation.  Advanced glycation end products are the result of 
nonenzymatic addition of glucose or other saccharides to proteins, lipids, and 
nucleotides.  In diabetes, excess glucose accelerates advanced glycation end product 
generation that leads to intracellular and extracellular protein cross -linking and 
protein aggregation.  Activation of the advanced glycation end product receptor alters intracellular signaling and gene expression, releases proinflammatory 
molecules, and results in an increased production of reactive oxygen species that 
contribute to diabetic microvascular complicatio ns. 
 Oxidative Stress.  Hyperglycemia induces an increased presence of markers of 
oxidative stress, such as superoxide and peroxynitrite ions, and decreases antioxidant defense moieties in patients with DPN.  It is associated with the development
 of 
apoptos is in neurons and supporting glial cells 14 

 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 18 of 103  
Vascular Damage . Nervous tissue depends on adequate blood flow to deliver 
nutrients and remove metabolic waste.  Normally, the capillary basement membrane 
allows the passage of nutrients into the cell and permits the removal of waste 
products.  In patients with prolonged hyperglycemia, glucose is more likely to be deposited in the basement membrane, thus decreasing its permeability.  Decreased 
permeability results in the buildup of toxic metabo lites, resulting in poor cellular 
metabolism, further free radical formation, apoptosis and a decline in vascularization of nervous tissues.  
 
 
1.2. CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS  
Currently, there are no approved drugs or interventional strategies known to halt or 
reverse the progression of DPN.  Treatments target pain reduction, physical function 
improvement, reduction of psychological distress, and quality of life 
improvements.15 
 
1.2.1.  PREVENTIVE TREATMENT  
Glycemic control.  It is generally agreed that long -term complications of both type 1 
and type 2 diabetes can be reduced by tight glycemic control.  To date, this is the 
only intervention specifically shown to  arrest or postpone the onset and severity of 
peripheral neuropathy.16-18   
 
Modifiable risk factors.  The incidence of neuropathy is also associated with 
potentia lly modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including an elevated triglyceride 
level, a high body mass index, smoking, and hypertension.19   
 Foot care.  Patients  with diabetes also need to be educated about foot care and 
footwear, and about protection of hyposensitive areas and pressure points, to prevent 
the occurrence of ulcers and to decrease the risk of bone infection.
20   
 
1.2.2.  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
There are only two drugs approved by FDA specifically for the treatment of the 
symptoms of DPN: Cymbalta – (duloxetine), a serotonin and norepineph rine 
reuptake inhibitor; and Lyrica - (pregabalin), an anticonvulsant drug.  Both are 
prescribed for the management of pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  
Table 1 presents the Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Consensus 
Treatment Guidelines Advisory Board’s recommendations for first - and second -tier 
agents to treat DPN  based on the level of evidence available from clinical trials and 
the committee’s clinical experience.2

1.2.3.  OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS  
α-lipoic acid . α-lipoic acid is a naturally occurring antioxidant compound that can be 
purchased as a dietary supplement.  It is synthesized in small amounts by humans 
and found in various plants such as spinach and bro ccoli.  α-lipoic acid was recently 
studied in a multicenter placebo -controlled trial of subject s with type 2 diabetes and 
symptomatic neuropathy.  One hundred eighty one (181) subject s were given once a 
daily oral doses of 600 mg, 1200 mg or 1800 mg of α-lipoic acid or placebo.  After 5 
weeks, neuropathic symptoms improved in those subject s that received α-lipoic acid.  
The 600 mg dose appeared to provide the optimum risk- to-benefit ratio.21  
 
Nerve decompression surgery. Surgery to decompress the lower -extremity 
peripheral nerves in patients with DPN is still considered an experimental intervention.  Results of a comprehensive meta analysis of studies of nerve 
decompression in DPN patients had mixed results.
22 
 Pancreatic transplantation.  Pancreatic transplantation in patients with diabetes can 
stabilize neuropathy and in some instances improve motor, sensory, and autonomic 
function.
23 
 
1.2.4.  UNMET CLINICAL NEED 
Peripheral neuropathy is a serious complication of diabetes.  This form of 
neuropathy carries a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction.  
There is currently no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy, and go od glycemic 
control is the only way to minimize the risk of occurrence.  Clearly, it would be desirable to prevent, impede, or reverse the disrupting and often life- threatening 
manifestations of peripheral neuropathy by stimulating growth or regeneration o f 
peripheral nerve axons.

  Page 20 of 103 1.3. HGF  FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC NEUROPATHY  
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be a potent angiogenic growth 
factor, stimulating the growth of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth 
muscle cells.24,25  It is a multi- functional mesenchyme -derived cytokine with potent 
angiogenic and anti -apoptotic effects  24-27  HGF stimulates DNA, RNA and protein 
synthesis by endothelial cells in a dose -dependent manner and attenuates high D -
glucose -induced endothelial cell de ath.  HGF has also been shown to upregulate 
vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression, and has demonstrated greater 
mitogenic activity than that of VEGF alone in human aortic endothelial cells in 
vitro .28,29  Recently, HGF gene transfer  has been shown to produce significant 
augmentation of collateral formation in the rabbit hind limb ischemia model.25  
Furthermore, a significant increase in blood flow was achieved by HGF gene 
transfer  both in rat diabetic and non- diabetic  hind limb ischemia models.27,30   
 Recent research also indicates that HGF can function as a neurotrophic factor.
31  
Sympathetic neurons co -express bioactive HGF , its cognate receptor  (the Met 
receptor ), and localized exogenous HGF has been shown to promote the growth (but 
not surv ival) of sympathetic neurons.32-36  It is proposed that administration of HGF 
may promote axonal growth and regeneration.  As loss of microvasculature in 
diabe tic neuropathy has also been implicated in acceleration of neuronal loss and 
pain symptoms,37 HGF may be an ideally suited candidate for the treatment this 
condit ion.  Exogenous VEGF has been studied in this patient population, but with 
limited success.38-41 
 
The challenge associated with delivering a targeted sustained dose of exogenous 
HGF is in overcoming the instability of HGF in blood circulation and its rapid clearance by the liver; HGF has an in vivo  half-life of less than 15 minutes.
42,43  
 
One approach to increasing HGF in ischemic tissues is to develop a gene transfer 
strategy that would allow for persistent expression of HGF protein in vivo .  Although 
plasmid DNA is one of the least efficient gene transfer systems currently in use, the 
fact that it is associated with limited persistence and no propensity for genomic 
integration, (particularly in skeletal muscle tissue) makes it an attractive option for 
local targeted deli very.  
  
1.4. VM202 
The investigational agent being studied in this protocol is VM202.  VM202 is a 
DNA plasmid that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid human hepatocyte growth 
factor (HGF) coding sequence (HGF -X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF 
728 and HGF 723. 
 
The key feature of HGF -X7 is that it was designed by inserting a series of intron 
sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so that both isoforms of HGF protein are expressed simultaneously and efficiently as in the human genome.  Because there is 
 
 
 
   
    
VM202 
are identical to the wild -type human HGF proteins .  
 
 
Safety 
of VM202.   The use of plasmids for targeted delivery of angioge nic factors 
into muscle tissue is a particularly attractive and a relatively safe therapeutic approach, because plasmids have been shown to effectively transfect postmitotic 
cells such as skeletal and heart muscle and to successfully express angiogenic gen es 
with very little dissemination and persistence at distant sites.  Following intramuscular injection, the plasmid that persists is extrachromosomal and 
integration into host DNA, if it occurs, is negligible.
44-46  This local effect of 
conventionally injected naked plasmid DNA is well known.47,48   
 
Potential Efficacy of VM202.   VM202 has demonstrated potential for stimulating 
angiogenesis in animal models.  The development of new blood vessels may improv e blood flow to peripheral nerves and potentially replace damaged capillary 
bed.  As there is some overlap in the pathology of critical limb ischemia and diabetic neuropathy,
49 VM202 may have the ability to decrease neuropathic pain, and 
improve quality of life and exercise capacity.  
 
 
1.5. PRECLINICAL DATA 
The non- clinical safety of VM202 has been evaluated for general toxicity following 
single intramuscular and intra venous doses in rats.  In addition, the general toxicity 
of VM202 following multiple intermittent (weekly or monthly) intramuscular doses has been evaluated in rabbits and rats, respectively.  The potential for genomic 
integration at the injection site as well as the potential for distribution to and 
persistence of VM202 in reproductive tissues was evaluated in rats. The ability of VM202 to induce humoral immune responses was evaluated following intramuscular 
administration with or without adjuvant in mice.   All species utilized for these 
studies (mouse, rat, and rabbit) were shown in in vivo  experiments to be able to 
express the plasmid following intramuscular injection.  
 

 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 22 of 103 An ischemic heart disease efficacy study in a Yorkshire swine model demonstrated 
that intramyocardial administration of VM202 increased the capillary density and 
regional perfusion in ischemic myocardium and improved ischemic left ventricular function.  An ischemic heart disease efficacy study in rats demonstrated that 
histologically ident ifiable capillaries increased following intramuscular 
administration of VM202 (versus pCK and pCK -VEGF165; p< 0.001).  
 
Collectively, VM202 has been well -tolerated in all studies conducted to date, with 
the only evidence of toxicity consisting of mild, transient injection site irritation in rats at a dose level 11 times the clinical dose of 8 mg / leg (0.11 mg/kg for a 70 kg 
subject ).  There has been no evidence of systemic toxicity in any study and human 
HGF has not been detected in the sera of rats or rabb its following intramuscular 
injection [lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) = 125 pg/mL].  There is no evidence of genomic integration, potential germ cell transmission, or immunostimulatory 
effects following intramuscular administration of VM202 to animals.   
 
Therefore, the nonclinical efficacy and safety studies support the clinical 
investigation of VM202 in subject s with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.   
 
 
1.6. CLINICAL DATA 
VM202 was/is being evaluated in three clinical trials.  
 
1.6.1.  PHASE I STUDY IN CRITIC AL LIMB ISCHEMIA  
VM202was evaluated for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in a prospective, 
dose-escalation Phase I study .  The study consist ed of four (4) cohorts of three (3) 
‘no-option’ CLI subject s.  Subject s received 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg VM202.  
For each dose cohort, VM202 was administered as local intramuscular injection s 
with half of the dose administered at Day 0 of the study and the second half 
administered 2 weeks later .  Preliminary efficacy (hemodynamic assessments), 
safety and tol erability were evaluated at Baseline (screening) and at designated time 
points throughout the study.  Clinical evaluations were to be conducted at baseline, 
Days 15, 28, 59, 91, 180, and 365.  All dose cohorts were followed for a year from 
the time of the first dose of study drug administration.  
 Between March of 2007 and October of 2008, twelve  (12) subject s participated in 
the study (median age, 72 years, 53% male and 75% were a current or former smoker).  No deaths occurred during the 12 month follow up,  but one subject  
underwent a major amputation.  Median ABI and TBI significantly increased from 
0.35 to 0.52 ( P=0.005) and 0.15 to 0.24 ( P=0.01) at 12 months follow -up.  TCPO
2 
showed a n improvement  trend  (increase) .  A significant reduction in pain was 
reported by nine of eleven subject s, with median VAS decreasing from 58 to 16 
(P=0.03) at 6 months follow -up. VAS score reduction tracked well with the 
hemodynamic data.   
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 23 of 103 In general, there was more improvement over baseline in Cohort II (4 mg VM202) 
than in any other cohort.  Cohort I (2 mg of VM202) also experienced a significant 
reduction in pain and modest improvement in hemodynamic measurement.  Interestingly, 2 subject s in each of these cohorts had diabetes, possibly suggesting 
some benefit of VM202 in this subpopulation.  Doses of aspirin above 81 mg daily 
may have an inhibitory effect on the therapeutic activity of VM202.   
 
VM202 appears to be well tolerated at doses as high as 16 mg.  There were no 
unexpected adverse events in the study.  None of the  serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
were directly attributable to VM202 (eight SAEs in five subjects, 5/12, 41. 7%).  
There w as one  amputation  caused by osteomyelitis which was assessed as unrelated 
to VM202.  Results from this study have been published in Gene Therapy  in 2011.
50 
 1.6.2.  P
HASE II STUDY IN CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA  
VM202 is being eva luated for treatment of CLI in a prospective,  double- blind, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter Phase II study.  Eligible subjects are randomized to a 
low dose of VM202 (8mg, n=20), high dose of VM202 (16mg, n=20) or placebo (n=10) .  Subject s are receiving a final dose of 8 mg  VM202, 16 mg VM202 or 
placebo by IM inj ections in the affected, unilateral calf on Days 0, 14, 28, and 42.  
As of July 29, 2011, 33 thirty-three (33) subjects  have been enrolled into the study.  
All 33 received at least one round of injections; 31 subjects  have completed all four 
rounds of inje ctions.  Twenty -four (24) completed the 90 day follow -up evaluation; 
14 completed the six months follow -up; 8 co mpleted the 9 month follow -up, and 3 
subjects have completed the 12 month follow -up and have been exited from the 
study.  To date, two patients have been discontinued or withdrawn early from the 
study.  One patient withdrew after completing all rounds of injections but prior to the 
90-day follow - prior to clinical hold.   
 As of July 29, 2011, fourteen (14) subjects experienced 20 serious adverse events , 
none of which were considered related to the study medication .  Ten (10) patients 
experienced one SAE to date, three (3) patients have experienced 2 SAEs, and one 
(1) patient has experienced 4 SAEs.  There were eleven (11) incidents of ‘worsening 
of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)’, which included increased pain, acute- on-
chronic critical limb ischemia, increased ulceration requiring skin grafting, or the development of gangrene/infection requiring amputation.  There were two (2) 
incident s of femo ral artery thrombosis , two (2) gastrointestinal bleeds, and one each  
of arr hythmia resulting in pacemaker implantation, acute renal failure, chest pain, , 
worsening of COPD, and pancreatitis.   
  1.6.3.  P
HASE I/II STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH PAINFUL DPN  
VM202 was evaluated for treatment of DPN in an ongoing  prospective, dose-
escalation Phase I study.  The study consist ed of three  (3) cohorts of four (4) 
subject s.  Subject s received 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg VM202 unilaterally in a calf .  For 
each dose cohort, VM202 was admi nistered as local intramuscular injections  with 
half of the dose administered at Day 0 of the study and the second half administered 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 24 of 103 2 weeks later.  Preliminary efficacy (hemodynamic assessments), safety and 
tolerability were evaluated at Baseline (screening) and at designated time points 
throughout the study.  All 3 dose cohorts were followed for one year from the time 
of the first dose of study drug administration.  Between June 2010 and March 2011, 
twelve (12) subjects were enrolled in the study, and enr ollment  and follow -up are  
complete.   
 
Ten out of 12 subjects (10/12, 83%) experienced a reduction in pain at their 6 month 
visit.  One patient each in Cohort I and Cohort II did not experience a reduction in 
pain.  At 6 month, mean change in VAS was -8.2 in Cohort I, -31.6 in Cohort II and 
-25 in Cohort III.   
 
At 12 month, 9  out of 12 subjects ( 9/12, 75%) experienced a reduction in pain.  The 
same 2 patients, one each in Cohort I and Cohort II did not experience a reduction in 
pain, and one patient in Cohort III returned to baseline levels at 12 month .  At 12 
month, mean change in VAS was -12.0 in Cohort I, -32.8 in Cohort II and -18.5 in 
Cohort III.  VAS scores also tracked well with other quality of life measures (BPI -
DPN).   
Intramuscular injections of VM202 appear to be well tolerated at doses as high as 16 
mg in patients with DPN.  There were no incidents of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).  
There have been no serious or unexpected adverse events in the study.   The level of 
VM202 DNA was below the LLOQ in all 12 subjects by day 90.  Circulating HGF 
levels remained relatively constant throughout the study, suggesting that the plasmid 
remained active only at the injection site.    
 
Preliminary Conclusions.   These early data support the feasibility  and safe ty of 
intramuscular injections of VM202 in subject s with critical limb ischemia  and DPN .  
Results  suggest that this therapeutic approach may improve functional outcomes and 
provide symptomatic relief.  VM202 is rapidly eliminated from circulation, and appe ars to remain active only at the injection site.  The incidence of complications  
did not appear to be significantly different between treatment cohorts.  Continued study of VM202 in subject s with CLI and DPN is warranted.    
 
 
1.7. STUDY AND DOSE RATIONALE  
DPN,  by definition, is a bilateral neuropathy.  Treating only one leg may confound 
patient -reported pain levels and quality of life measures.  Based on the excellent 
safety profile  of VM202 seen thus far in the phase I CLI study, the ongoing phase II 
CLI study  and the safety and preliminary efficacy data from the phase I/II study of 
VM202 injections in patients with DPN, we propose bilateral treatment in this phase 
II study.   
 Two doses of VM202 will be tested against placebo (normal saline).  The dose of 
VM20 2 per leg will remain within the dosing scheme of the phase I/II study (8 mg / 
leg and 16 mg /leg), and the same dosing schedule used in the DPN phase I study 
will be followed in this study (namely, intramuscular injections in the calf will be 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 25 of 103 given on Day  0, and Day 14 ).  As in all three prior studies, VM202 will be delivered 
in a solution of 0.5 mg VM202 / mL.  Subject s will be treated with an overall  final 
dose of 16 mg VM202, 32 mg VM202 or placebo , dosages well within those 
supported by the body of pha rmacology and toxicology safety studies of VM202.  
Safety studies in rabbit, rat and mouse models demonstrate that doses approximately 
2½ (80mg/70kg) to 30 (960mg/70kg)  times  the maximum clinical dose (3 2 mg)

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 
3.1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety of IM administration o f 
VM202 in subject s with painful DPN in lower extremities .  In addition, the potential 
bioactivity of IM administration of VM202 in subjects with painful DPN, when compared with placebo, on pain will be assessed . 
  
3.2. S
TUDY DESIGN  
This is a phase II, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 9 -
month study  designed to assess the safety and efficacy of VM202 in subjects with  
painful DPN .  Subject s with painful DPN will be screened for study eligibility after 
giving informed consent.   
 
Initial Screening  Activities . Prior to full screening, subjects will give informed 
consent and then be initially screened using the VAS , the S ymptoms portion of the 
BPNS and the MNSI.   Only s ubjects with a VAS score of ≥ 40 mm , a ≤ 5 point 
difference in symptom of BPNS between legs and MNSI score of ≥ 3 will be 
allowed to proceed  with the full s creening procedures. Screening.  If the VAS, BPNS 
and MNSI criteria are met, the rest of screening will proceed. If applicable, the 
subject will be washed out of prohibited me dications.   During medication wash -out, 
screening  procedures consisting of assessment of study eligibility, a complete 
medical history, vital signs, physical exam, concomitant medications, cancer 
screening tests, viral screening, 12 lead EKG, retinal fundoscopy, serum  chemistry  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 26 of 103 and hematology  including HbA1c , urinalysis, and pregnancy test (women of 
childbearing potential only) . 
 
If applicable, the subject will be washed out of prohibited medications 14 days prior  
to initiation of the 7 day Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary .  The Daily Pain 
and Sleep Interference Diary  shall be completed with 14 days of the first injections . 
Subjects  will be asked to rate their 24-hour average daily pain intensity score using 
an 11 point numerical scale with 0 = no pa in – 10 = worst pain possible , and to 
evaluate how much the ir pain interferes with sleep (also an 11 point numerical rating 
scale from 0 (did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interfered  with sleep ; 
patient was not able to sleep due to pain).   The subject must record at least five 
assessments of the 24 -hour average daily pain intensity score during the seven- day 
period .  The mean baseline 24- hour will represent the baseline reference value.   The 
average daily pain intensity score of the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary 
must be ≥ 4 with a standard deviation ≤ 2 in order to be eligible for study 
participation.    
 Data from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference D iary at screening and BPI-DPN on 
Day 0 will represent the baseline reference values.   
 
All screening  assessments should occur within the 60 days prior to Day 0 (day of 
first injection s). 
 
Randomization.   Subject s who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned 
in a 2:2:1 fashion to one of the three treatment arms:  Low Dose (16 mg VM202 total 
dose, 8 mg / leg ), High Dose (32 mg VM202 total dose, 16 mg / leg), or placebo, 
respectively.  Assignment to a treatment arm will be centralized, using an  
independent predetermined randomization scheme in a double-blinded fashion .  
Blinding  will be achieved by having the stud y medication (test and control products) 
prepared by the study pharmacist.   Reconstituted VM202 is indistinguishable from 
saline solution.  
 
Injection.   Prior to the first injection, vital signs, concomitant medications, VAS, 
and BPI-DPN will be conducted.  Blood will be drawn for determination of  serum 
HGF, serum chemistry and hematology, and copies of VM202.  Subjects will also 
undergo a skin biopsy (one 3 mm diameter round sample from left calf and one 3 
mm diameter round sample from left upper thigh  and ankle  for a total of 3 samples / 
subject).   
 Subjects will receive VM202 and / or placebo (normal saline) by intramuscular 
injections in both legs (in the calf) on Day 0, and Day 14 as follows:

VM20 2 will be delivered in a solution of 0.5mg VM202 / mL.  All subjects will 
receive thirty -two (32) 0.5 mL injections evenly distributed over each calf at each 
visit of VM202 or placebo as follows:  
 
Subject s in the Low Dose Group ( 8mg VM202 / leg) will recei ve the following 
intramuscular injections in each calf : 
 
• Day 0  – 32 injection s / calf:  
• 16 injections of 0.5mL of VM202 / calf – (4 mg of VM202 / calf)  
• 16 injections  of 0.5mL of normal saline  / calf  
 
• Day 14 – 32 injection s / calf:  
• 16 injections of 0.5mL of V M202 / calf – (4 mg of VM202 / calf)  
• 16 injections  of 0.5mL of normal saline  / calf  
 
Note:  Visually, normal saline is indistinguishable from reconstituted VM202.  The 
patient and clinician will not be able to distinguish placebo from VM202 injections  
 
Subjects in the High  Dose Group ( 16 mg VM202 / leg) will receive  the following 
intramuscular injections in each calf : 
 
• Day 0  - 32 injections of 0.5mL of VM202 / calf (8 mg of VM202 / calf ) 
• Day 14  - 32 injections of 0.5mL of VM202 / calf (8 mg of VM202 / calf ) 
 
Subject s in the placebo control group will receive 32 injections / calf of 0.5 mL 
normal saline at each visit.  
 
HGF s erum levels will be determined  immediately pre -treatment on Day 0, 
immediately pre -treatment on Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.   
 
The number of copies of VM202 in whole blood  will be determined at Day 0 (pre-
injection, and 2 hours  [± 1 hour]  post injection), at Day 14 (pre -injection, and 2 
hours  [± 1 hour]   post injection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90.   
 Serum chemistry and he matology will be determined on Day 0, Day 30, Day 90 and 
9 months. HbA1c will be determined on Day 90, 6 months and 9 months.

VAS and Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ( BPI-DPN) will 
be recorded at Day 0 , Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months.  Patients’ 
Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  will be recorded at Day  30, Day 60, Day 90, at 
6 months and 9 months.  MNSI will be conducted at 6 months  and 9 months  to track 
disease progression.   Skin biopsy will be repeated at 6 mont hs and the s ymptoms 
portion of the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screening (BPNS) will be recorded at  6 
months.   
 
The Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary will be filled out by patients prior to the 
Day 90, and the 6 Month and 9 Month visits.  
 
Retinal fu ndoscopy will be conducted at 9 months.  Adverse events, concomitant 
medications and vital signs will be recorded throughout the 9 month follow -up 
period , while injection site reactions will be assessed starting on Day 0 through Day 
60.  
A summary of the s chedule of evaluations and visits from screening through the end 
of the study can be found  in Appendix 1

3.4. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Prior to recruitment of any subject s into the study, written approval of the protocol 
and informed consent must be obtained from the IRB  and IBC (if applicable) . 
 
3.4.1.  INFORMED CONSENT  
The investigator will explain the study purpose, procedures, and subject ’s 
responsibilities to the potential participant.  The subject 's willingness and abi lity to 
meet the follow -up requirements will be determined and written informed consent 
will be obtained ( Appendix 2 ).  The subject  will sign and date the informed consent 
form.  The investigator will also sign and  date the consent form.  The original 
informed consent form will be retained with the subject  records ; a copy  will be 
provided to the subject .   
 
Following is a detailed list of study visits from screening to final follow -up and the 
required procedures/tests.  Methodologies for specific tests/ procedures are described in Section 4. 
 
3.4.2.  S
UBJECT IDENTIFICATION  
To maintain confidentiality, the subject ’s name should not b e recorded on any study 
document other than the informed consent form.  All subject s that give informed 
consent (sign the informed consent form) will be assigned a unique identifier  in the 
following format: XX -YY-ZZZ.   XX is the 2 digit assigned site numbe r, YY is the 
sequential subject ID number, and ZZZ are the subject initials (initials of first 
name/middle name  (if applicable )/last name).  For example, the first subject named 
John Simon Doe at site 11 will be assigned 11 -01-JSD.    
   
3.4.3.  SCREENING  (DAY -60 TO DAY 0) 
Prior to full screening, subjects will give informed consent and then be initially 
screened using the VAS , the S ymptoms portion of the BPNS and the MNSI.   Only 
subjects with a VAS score of ≥ 40 mm , a ≤5 point difference in symptom of BPNS 
between legs and MNSI score of ≥ 3 will be allowed to proceed  with the full 
screening procedures.  
If the VAS, BPNS and MNSI criteria are met, the rest of screening will proceed.  If 
applicable, the subject will be washed out of prohibited medications.   During 
medication wash -out and prior to randomization, subject eligibility will be assessed  
as follows :

• Urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential only)  
• Cancer screening  should be conducted per the current American Cancer Societ y 
Guidelines for the Early Detection of Cancer.  Testing should also include:  pap 
smear and mammogram if not performed within past 12 months (females only); 
chest X -ray or chest CT scan (if the subject  has a previous history of tobacco use, 
a CT scan will be performed instead of X -ray) within 3 months prior to study 
entry; PSA within past 3 months (males only);†  for subject s ≥ 50 years old, 
colonoscopy within past 10 years ; for subject s with family history of colon 
cancer in any first degree relative, colonoscopy within past 12 months.      
• Viral screening – HIV, Anti-Human T -Cell Lymphotropic Virus  (HTLV), 
Positive Hepatitis B  or C as determined by Hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcA b), 
antibody to Hepatitis B antigen (IgG and IgM; H BsAb), Hepatitis  B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C antibodies (Anti -HCV), at Screening  
• Retinal Fundoscopy  – in cases where fundoscopy alone is deemed insufficient to 
rule out exclusionary conditions (see exclusion criterion # 1 2), fluorescein 
angiography may be conducted  
• Following medication washout (if applicable) and w ithin 1 4 days prior to 
injection . Subjects will keep a Daily Pain and Sleep I nterference Diary for 7 
days.  They will be asked to rate their 24-hour average daily pain intensity score 
using an 11 point numerical scale with 0 mm = no pain – 10 0 mm worst possible 
pain, and to evaluate how much their pain interferes with sleep (also using an 11 
point numerical rating scale from 0 (did not interfere with sleep) to 10 
(completely interfered  with sleep ; patient was not able to sleep due to pain).  The 
subject must record at least five assessments of the 24 -hour average daily pain 
intensit y score during the seven- day period .  The mean 24-hour scores at 
Screening will represent the baseline reference value.   In case less than five 
assessments are recorded, a new Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary will be 
provided and the Day 0 visit wil l be rescheduled to allow completion of the 
Diary.  The average pain score of the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary 
must be ≥ 4 with a standard deviation ≤ 2 in order to be eligible for study 
participation.

3.4.4.  PROHIBITED CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
3.4.4.1.  MEDICATION THAT MAY I NTERFERE WITH VM202  BIOACTIVITY  
COX -1 and COX -2 inhibiting drugs will interfere with the bioactivity of VM202, 
and are therefore prohibited from use during the study.  Other than the maximal 81 
mg daily dose of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), subjects  must  agree to not take any of 
these drugs until completion of the 9 month follow -up visit .  The patient needs to be  
advised that c ommon over the counter medications excluded include: Bayer (> 
81mg), Excedrin, Aleve, Advil (motrin, ibuprofen).   A full list of the excluded 
medications, including the washout period, can be found in Appendix 3 . 
 3.4.4.2.  M
EDICATIONS THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH ASSES SMENT OF VM202  
EFFECT  ON PAIN  
Subjects may not take new drugs for DPN  symptoms  during the study and must be 
on the same medication for at least one month prior to screening .  However, subjects 
are all owed to stop the existing  medication during the study. 
 Subjects must discontinue use of all opioid drugs fourteen days prior to the 
completion of the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  and agree to remain off of 
these medications until completion of the 9 month follow -up visit.  
 
3.4.4.3.  S
CREEN FAILURES  
Subject s not meeting all study entry criteria will be designated as a screen failures.   
End of study procedures will not be performed for these subject s, but their reason for 
discontinuation will be recorded on  Screening Log.  Screen failures will be replaced.  
 
3.4.5.  TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION  
After providing written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo 
Screening assessments.  The site will complete a Treatment Authorization Form  
(TAF) for subject s determined to be eligible for study participation .  The TAF  
includes the subject  identification number, demographic information (gender, date of 
birth ) and indication  that the subject  meets all in clusion and exclusion criteria.   The 
completed TAF  and comp leted Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  will be 
faxed to the Sponsor or its designee.   The Sponsor  or its designee will confirm 
whether  the subject  can be treated , and return the TAF to the investigational site  and 
a copy to the drug depot .  Upon rec eipt, the Investigator  will schedule the subject  to 
undergo the study treatment.   Note: adherence to this process is mandatory  to track 
enrollment and to assure proper randomization . 
 
3.4.6.  RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
A randomization schedule with subjects allocated to high dose, low dose or control 
in a 2:2:1 ratio will be sent to a centralized drug depot, which will prepare individual 
kits that contain the appropriate treatment based on the randomization schedule.  
When a site identifies a subject and treatment authorization is granted, the Sponsor  
or its designee  will notify the drug depot.  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 33 of 103 The drug depot will : 
 
1. Ship the next kit in sequence to the study pharmacist at the site, labeled with the 
subject identification  number.   
2. Record which kit was assigned to which site/subject and the date.  
3. Include in the kit, a sealed envelope that identifies the subject identification 
number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be opened by the 
Investigator or designee only in the case of a medical emergency.  
4. Send another sealed envelope to the Sponsor with the subject identification 
number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be opened by the 
Sponsor or designee only in the case of a medical emergency.   
 Blinding will be achieved by having the study medication (VM202) prepared by the 
study pharmacist.  Reconstituted VM202 is indistinguishable from saline solution . 
The site pharmacist prepares the vials according to the instructions in the kit (which 
vials to reconstitute with water for injection  [WFI].  The drug depot, site pharmacist 
and select individuals at  (but not including study monitors  and 
study manager ) will be unblinded to the treatment assignments.  The subject and 
study personnel, including core lab,  principal investigator , co-investigators and study 
coordinators, will remain blinded until all data has been entered into the database 
and the database is locked.  
 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY ONLY, i.e. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
AND ONLY WHEN THIS INFORMATION INFLUENCES THE  SUBJECT 'S 
MANAGEMENT, the Investigator may open the sealed envelope to unblind the study medication assignment . 
 For each opened envelope, the Investigator will provide the name of the person who 
opened the envelope, reason, date, and signature on the envelope.  At the end of the 
study, all (opened and unopened) envelopes will be returned to the Sponsor.

9 months have been performed in accordance with the study protocol.  
 
3.5.2.  DISCONTINUED SUBJECT S 
Any subject  may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time without prejudice.  
The investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if (s)he 
considers that remaining in the study compromises the subject ’s health or the subject  
is not sufficiently cooperative. In either event, reason(s) for disc ontinuation should 
be recorded on the CRF.  
 
Possible reasons for study discontinuation include the following:  
 • Adverse events (A Es) necessitating discontinuation from the study (pre -
treatment).  
• The subject  is lost to follow -up. 
• Subject  decision (spec ify). 
• Investigator decision (specify).  
• Other reason (specify).  
 
The reasons for any subject  discontinuation will be recorded on the study completion 
form of the CRF.  
 
Additional subjects may be enrolled if subjects discontinue prior to the 90 day visit  
in order to achieve a 100 patient dataset with 90 day data.

  Page 37 of 103 Subject s discontinued for AE(s) will be followed -up after subject ’s discontinuation 
until the event is resolved or considered medically stable by the investigator.   
 
Subjects that withdraw prio r to study completion will undergo the following if 
possible:  
 
• Retinal Fundoscopy  
• Concomitant Medications  
• Serum Chemistry and Hematology  
• HbA1c 
• Vital Signs  
• Serum HGF if discontinued prior to Day 90

to keep accurate records showing final disposition of all investigational drugs.   
 
Investigational drugs are to be used only in accordance with this protocol and under 
supervision of the  Study Pharmacist or a duly designated person .  The Study 
Pharmacist or his /her designee will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the 
test drug as shipped by the Sponsor/Designee, including the date received.  In 
addition, an accu rate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount 
dispensed to each subject  and the date of dispensation.  This inventory record must 
be available for inspection at any time.  Copies of this record will be provided to the 
Sponsor by the Study Pharmacist  at the conclusion of the study.  
 After the study is completed, the Study P harmacist  must account for all drug used, 
unused and partially used.  Unused study medication from the study site will be returned to the Sponsor/Designee as directed in  writing by the Sponsor for gross 
reconciliation.  
 
3.6.4.  D
OSE AND ADMINISTRATION  
VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2. 5 mg of lyophilized study 
product.  Before administration, it will be reconstituted with 5 mL of water for 
injection (WFI) by the study pharmacist for a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / 
mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be used for one subject.  .  The placebo group 
will receive only normal saline injections.  All subjects will receive 32 injections per 
calf per v isit.  The Low Dose arm will receive VM202 and normal saline injections.

A complete medical history will be obtained at Baseline.  All positive and negative 
findings will be carefully documented on the CRF.  Any new finding discovered 
during the Screening/ Baseline evaluation and prior to the first study drug 
administration (Day 0) will be considered to be part of the medical history and will 
not be recorded as an adverse event.  
 The Investigator will perform an especially detailed assessment of past diabetes 
history to include all events and interventions prior to study enrollmen t.  Other 
potential causes of peripheral neuropathy will be excluded (e.g. , alcohol 
consumption, renal failure, liver disease, hypothyroidism, collagen vascular diseases, 
vasculitis, osteoarthritis of the ankle or foot, gout, bursitis, fasciitis, and B-12 or

extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, neu rological, gastrointestinal , and 
dermatological systems.  Any clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded 
in the subject ’s CRF.  
 
4.1.3.  CANCER SCREENING  
All subject s participating in this trial must undergo routine cancer screening.  The 
history and d iagnosis of potential or apparent malignant and non- malignant diseases 
and neoplasms will be assessed through several diagnostic tests and procedures.  
Some diagnostic tests and procedures performed prior to study consent and 
documented in the subject ’s me dical history may be acceptable where noted.  
Routine cancer screening includes the following:  
 
1. For subject s ≥ 50 years old, colonoscopy within past 10 years ; for subject s with 
family history of colon cancer in any first degree relative, colonoscopy within

4.2. EVALUATIONS CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY  
 
4.2.1.  RETINAL FUNDOSCOPY  
Proliferative retinopathy is defined as the presence of new proliferating blood 
vessels (neovascularization) arising from the retina or optic disc and growing on the 
retinal surface or into the vitreous cavity will be assessed by retinal fundoscopy at 
Screen ing for eligibility and repeated at 9 months.  Retinal fundoscopy must be 
performed by an ophthalmologist within 3 months of Screening.   
 
In cases where fundoscopy alone is deemed insufficient to rule out exclusionary 
conditions (see exclusion criterion #  12), fluorescein angiography may be conducted 
at Screening.  
 
4.2.2.  CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant medications will be recorded at each visit using the trade name or 
generic name as described in  Section 3.7. 
 
4.2.3.  VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs consisting of blood pressure (while subject  is sitting), temperature, body 
weight, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be measured and recorded at Screening  
and at every visit through the 9 month follow -up and recorded in the subject s CRF.  
 
4.2.4.  SERUM CHEMISTRY , HEMATOLOGY  AND HBA1C 
Evaluation of serum chemistry and hematology will be conducted at Screening, Day 
0, Day 30, Day 90 and 9 month s.  Evaluations will be conducted at a local  
laboratory at each site. 
 
Serum chemistry evaluations will include: calcium, glucose, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphata se, albumin, and total protein . 
 
Hematology evaluations will include: complete blood count (CBC): red blood cells 
(RBC); hemoglobin (HgB), hematocrit ( HCT ), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin conce ntration 
(MCHC), platelets and white blood cells (WBC) with differential .  Abnormal 
readings do not necessarily constitute an adverse event ; the re sults need to be 
reviewed in the context of the subject ’s health . 
 
HbA1c will be determined at Screening, Day  90, 6 months and 9 months  at a local 
laboratory at each site.   Laboratory testing by visit is provided in  Appendix 1 . 
 
4.2.5.  S
ERUM HGF  
Serum HGF will be determined by ELISA at the following follow -up visits: 
immediately  pre- treatment on Day 0, immediately pre -treatment on Day 14, on Day  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 42 of 103 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  A minimum 6 cc blood draw will be taken at each time 
point.   Allow blood to clot for 30 – 60 minutes at room temperature then centrifuge 
for 10 minutes at 1000 x g.  Divide the isolated serum into six (6) equal aliquots of 
~0.3 mL each. (0.5mL plastic storage tubes provided).  Samples should be labeled 
with subject ID, draw date, study number and visit interval (i.e., Day 0, 14, 30, 60  or 
90).  Samples will be main tained in a cooler containing dry ice and then placed in a 
≤ -65°C freezer until shipped for analysis.   At the request of the Sponsor or its 
designee, serum HGF samples will be batched with VM202 samples, and shipped in 
a special container with temperature tracking recorder  to  
for analys is. 
 
 
 
 
4.2.6.  COPIES OF VM202  IN WHOLE BLOOD  
The number of copies of VM202 in whole blood will be determined by PCR at Day 
0 (pre -injection, and 1 to 3 h ours post injection), Day 14 (pre-injection, and 1  to 3 
hours post injection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90.  Six (6) cc of w hole 
blood will be collected in EDTA -coated tubes, inverted >5 times and transferred to 
plastic sterile and or RNase and DNase free vials of ~0. 6 – 1 cc aliquots each  for a 
total of 6 aliquots per time point .  These will be maintained in a ≤ -65°C freezer until 
shipped for analysis.  Samples should be labeled with subject ID, draw date and time, study number, and visit interval ( i.e., Day 0  pre, Day 0 post, Day 14 pre, Day 
14 post, Day 21, Day 30, Day 60 or Day 90).  At the request of the Sponsor or its 
designee, VM202 samples will be batched with serum HGF samples, and shipped in 
a special container with temperature tracking reco rder to  
for analysis.  
 
 
 
 Note,  wil
l provide collection tubes, plastic vials, labels, 
shipment  materials including temperature tracking recorder  to each participating site 
for use during the study.  
 
4.2.7.  VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS ) SCORE  
Pain will be recorded during site visits  at Screening,  Day 0 before the treatment 
(injection), on Day 30, Day 60,  Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months using the visual 
analog scale (VAS) .  The VAS scoring instrument is a 10 0mm line, oriented 
horizontally , with the left  end indicating “no pain” and the right end  representing 

 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 43 of 103 “very severe pain ”.  The patient  is asked to mark a place on the line corresponding to 
the current pain intensity.  The distance along the scale is then converted into a 
numeric reading by measuring the distance of the patients  mark in centimeters from 
the beginning of the scale (the 0 mark).  The VAS is i llustrated in Appendix 8 . 
 
4.2.8.  DAILY PAIN AND SLEEP INTERFERENCE DIARY  
Subjects will be asked to keep a Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  (see 
Appendix 9) .  Subjects will be asked to rate their 24 -hour average daily pain 
intensity score 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible 
pain) .  The effect of pain on the subject’s ability to sleep will be assessed using the 
sleep interference score.  Like the pain intensity score , the sleep interference score is 
an 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (pain did not interfere with sleep) to 10 
(pain completely interfered; patient was not able to sleep due to pain).   
 The diary will be completed  at Screen ing following washout of prohibited 
medications  and within 14 days prior to the Day 90, 6 months and 9 months visits .   
To increase compliance, the D iary will be FedExed to the subject 2 weeks prior to 
the scheduled visit.  The FedEx shipping bill will be come part of the subject’s source 
documents.  Ten days prior to the scheduled visit, the  study coordinator at each site 
will call the subject s to remind them of their upcoming visit  at Day 90, 6 months or 9 
months, and the requirement to complete the diary  pages st arting within 1 4 days of  
the visit.   The phone call will be documented on the source document worksheets.   
One day prior to the visit, the study coordinator at each site will call the subject s to 
confirm their upcoming visit  and to remind the subject to bring the completed Diary.  
If the subject arrives at the clinic without the completed diary, the visit will be 
rescheduled as soon as possible.   
 Optionally at the Day 90, Month 6 and Months 9 visits only  (not at Screening): if the 
subject states  that the Diary was completed and it is a hardship for the subject to 
reschedule the visit (e.g., distance or transportation issues), the site may provide a 
completed FedEx shipping bill to the subject so the subject can send the completed 
Diary to the sit e using FedEx.   
 Upon completion of the Diary, the study coordinator will check the Dairy for 
completeness.  Any omissions or ambiguous answers will be clarified by the subject 
prior to leaving the clinic.  
 
4.2.9.  P
ATIENT ’S GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE  (PGIC ) 
The patient’s global impression of change  after treatment will be measured using the 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC ) questionnaire.54  This questionnaire 
takes measures a patients perception of how treatment has affected their level of 
activity, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life.  Each descriptor is ranked 
on an intensity scale of 1 = Very Much Improved ; 2 = Much Improved ; 3 = 
Minimally Improv ed; 4 = No Change ; 5 = Minimally Worse ; 6 = Much Worse  7 = 
Very Much Worse .  This test will be self-administered during study visits  on Day 30, 
Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months .   
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 44 of 103  
Upon completion of the questionnaire, the study coordinator will ch eck the 
questionnaire for completeness.  Any omissions or ambiguous answers will be 
clarified by the subject prior to leaving the clinic.  The PGIC  can be found in 
Appendix 6.  4.2.10.  M
ICHIGAN NEUROPATHY SCREENING INSTRUM ENT 
The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) will be conducted at 
Screening  in order to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  and at 
6 months and 9 months to track disease progression .51-53  The MNSI is comprised of 
a subject  questionnaire (15 questions) and of a physical evaluation which includes a 
foot inspection, vibration sensation testing, muscle stretch reflexes, and 
monofilament testing.  The MNSI forms and instructions can be found in Appendix 
4.  
4.2.11.  B
RIEF PAIN INVENTORY FOR SUBJECTS WITH DIABETIC PERIPHERAL 
NEUROPATHY (BPI -DPN ) 
The brief pain inventory (BPI -DPN)55,56 will be self-administered during site visits  
on Day 0 before the treatment (injection), on Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months 
and 9 months .  The Questionnaire is a patient - completed numeric rating scale that 
assesses the severity of pain, its impact on daily functioning, and other aspects of pain (e.g. location of pain, relief from medications).  The questionnaire was also 
modi fied to distinguish between pain due to DPN and pain due to other causes.  
 Upon completion of the questionnaire, the study coordinator will check the 
questionnaire for completeness.  Any omissions or ambiguous answers will be 
clarified by the subject prior  to leaving the clinic .  The full Questionnaire can be 
found in Appendix 7 . 
 4.2.12.  B
RIEF PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY SCREENING (BPNS)  
Symptoms of BPNS will be assesses at pre-screening and Month 6 in order to 
evaluate the bilateral extent of DPN  (see Appendix 10). 
 
4.2.13.  INJECTION SITE REACTION ASSESSMENT  
Local injection sites reactions will be assessed on Day 0 post injection, Day 14 pre 
and post injection, Day 21, Day 30 and Day 60 by the N ational Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminology for Adverse Events v3.0.  The grading categories are as follows and will be recorded on the CRF as described in  Table 3 .

Prior to the first round of injection, subjects will undergo a skin biopsy (one 3 mm 
diameter round sample from the left ankle, the left calf and the left upper thigh , for a 
total of 3 samples / subject).  Skin biopsies will be performed again at the 6 month 
follow -up visit.  Skin biopsies will be conducted under local anesthesia with the aid 
of a sterile 3mm skin punch .  Samples will be sent to a central laborator y (TBD) to 
characterize change in peripheral  innervation.  
  
 
5. E
VALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. DEFINITIONS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or 
the deterioration of a pre- existing medical condition following or during expos ure to 
an investigational product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.   
 
An untoward medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 46 of 103 An adverse reaction  means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused  the event.  
 Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward  medical occurrence which:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (admission to hospital with a stay > 24 hours) or prolongation of hospitalization which is not specifically required by the 
protocol or is elective;  
• Result s in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure; or  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening or require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when they jeopardize 
the subject  or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include: allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and s cientific judgment 
must be exercised when classifying events as serious.  
 
Life-threatening  means that the subject  is, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE which, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.   
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  means that the event resulted in 
permanent or significant and substantial disruption of the subject s’ ability to carry 
out normal life functions.   
 An unex pected AE  is an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information (e.g. , Investigator Brochure for an unapproved 
product).  Expected means that the event has been previously observed with the test 
article and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information.  It 
does not mean that the event is expected with the underlying disease(s) or concomitant medications.  It is expected that certain disease states will have 
reoccurring adverse events some of which may be considered expected over time.  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 47 of 103  
5.2. ASSESSMENT OF AES 
All AEs, regardless of severity, occurring following the first study drug 
administration and the 9 month follow -up visit of the study by a subject  must be 
recorded on the AE form provided w ith the CRF.  This will include the following 
information:  
 
• Description of the AE  
• Date of onset  
• Duration  
• Frequency 
• Severity  
• Seriousness (yes/no)  
• Treatment  
• Outcome  
• Relationship to study medication, injection procedure  and/or  underlying disease  
 
All AEs a nd SAEs must be followed until resolution, or the condition stabilizes .  The 
Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as possible the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  The Sponsor  or its designee may request that the Investigator perform 
or arrange for  the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  
 
5.2.1.  AE
 CAUSALITY  
The study investigator will determine whether an AE is related or unrelated to study 
medication, the procedure (intramuscular injection) and / or the underlying disease 
using the following criteria:  
 Not related:  An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure.   
 
Possibly related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure. An alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant study 
product(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   
 
Probably related: An adverse event that might be due to the use o f the test article or 
administration procedure. The relationship in time is suggestive. An alternative 
explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
Definitely related : An AE that is due to the use of the test article or administration 
procedure. The event cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation – 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 48 of 103 5.2.2.  AE INTENSITY  
The intensity of the AE/SAE will be defined by the following criteria:  
 
Mild : The AE is noti ceable to the subject  but does not interfere with 
routine activity.  
Moderate : The AE is discomforting and interferes with routine activity.  
Severe: The AE significantly limits the subject ’s ability to perform 
routine activities despite symptomatic therapy.  
 
 
5.3. REPORTING /RECORDING OF AES 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by the investigator to 
remain alert to possible AEs.  The first concern will be the safety of the subject , and 
for providing appropriate medical intervention.  The p eriod of observation for 
collection of AEs starts during the first intramuscular injection procedure (Day 0) 
until the 9 month follow -up visit.  Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF page(s).

EPORTING / RECORDING OF SAE S 
 
5.4.1.  INVESTIGATOR ’S RESPO NSIBILITY  
SAE s will be recorded following the first study drug administration through the 9  
month follow -up visit.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during this 
investigation, whether or not related to the study medication, must be reported immediately (within 72 hours) to the Sponsor and  MedTech Consultants, Inc., the  
designated CRO.   
 
Each SAE must be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved or 
assessed as chronic or stable regardless of whether or not, in the opinion of the 
Inves tigator, the event is thought to be related to the study medication.   
 The Investigator will be required to provide complete information concerning each 
SAE to the CRO and Sponsor within 5 calendar days of the event.  This information 
must be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and then transcribed onto the SAE 
Form.  The completed SAE Form (including the Investigator’s opinion of the relationship of the SAE to the study medication), copies of related results/reports, 
consultant report(s), and other relevant information will be faxed and mailed to the 
CRO.  
 In the event of an SAE leading to hospitalization, every effort will be made by the 
investigational site to obtain medical records, including a hospital discharge 
summary.  In the event of a fatal A E, documentation of any available postmortem 
findings, including autopsy, will be provided to the Sponsor  or their designee.  In 
any event, the Investigator will provide a narrative summary of circumstances, 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 49 of 103 events related to the death, and cause of death,  if known.  Any follow -up information 
obtained must be recorded on an SAE follow -up report form.  
 
The Investigator must comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities and the Institutiona l 
Review Board (IRB), and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)  if applicable .  
Upon receipt from the Sponsor of an initial or follow -up IND Safety Report or other 
safety information, the Investigator must promptly notify his or her IRB, and IBC (if 
applicable) . 
 
5.4.2.  SPONSOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported on an annual basis to FDA in accordance with 
the IND regulation (21 CFR Part 312).  Per the 2010 FDA Guidance Document for Industry and Investigators “Safety Reporting Requirements for IN Ds and BA/BE 
Studies,” events categorized as ‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related will be treated as 
‘suspected adverse reactions.’  Events categorized as ‘definitely’ related will be 
treated as an ‘adverse reaction.’  
 All serious, unexpected adverse reactions  and suspected adverse reactions will be 
reported to FDA and to all participating investigators as an IND Safety Report within 15 calendar days of the event  after the sponsor determines that the suspected 
adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR §3 12.32).  Any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening AEs will be reported to the Agency within 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
 
The Sponsor  will notify all participating investigators of any new safety information 
that alters the current risk -benefit assessment of the study medication or that would 
be sufficient to consider changes in VM202 administration or in the overall conduct of the trial.  
 
 
 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate th e safety of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with painful DPN in lower extremities ; and, to evaluate the potential 
bioactivity of IM administration of VM202 in subjects with painful DPN, when compared 
to placebo, on rest pain (as assessed by frequenc y of pain, pain medication use history, 
sleeping history, and intensity of pain) and sensory perception . 
 
6.1. GENERAL METHODS  
Means, standard deviations (SD), medians and minimum and maximums will be 
presented for continuous variables, the number and percentag e of patients in each 
category will be presented for nominal and ordered categorical variables.  Statistical 
tests with a p value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant, unless 
otherwise stated.

6.2. ANALYSIS POPULATION  
Efficacy Analysis Population  – Subjects that received all injections of the correct 
dose of study drug medication based on randomization schedule and have completed 
the 6 -month assessment; subjects must not have any protocol violation or major 
deviation which will be determined in a blinded review before database lock for data 
analyses.   
Safety Analysis Population  – Subjects that have received any injections  
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population  – All randomized patients  
  
6.3. S
TUDY ENDPOINTS  
The objectives of this study are o evaluate the safety of IM administration of VM202 
in subjects with painful DPN in lower extremities; and to evaluate the potential 
bioactivity of IM administration of VM202 in subjects with painful DPN, when 
compared with placebo, on pain.  
 
6.3.1.  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
The primary  study endpoint is the change in average 24 -hour pain score from 
baseline to the 6 -month follow -up.  The average pain scores will be obtained from 
the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary (recorded daily by the patient for 7 days 
prior to the first roun d of injections and again, for 7 days before the 6 month follow -
up).  T he difference in the mean change in average 24 hour pain score between the 
two treatment groups and the placebo arm will be evaluated to determine the 
treatment effect .  
 The primary an alysis will be conducted in the Efficacy Analysis Group .  A 
secondary analysis will be conducted in the ITT group, and further analyses 
conducted as necessary to explore any inconsistency between the two results.  
 
6.3.2.  S
ECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
Other secondary endpoints and evaluations will include:  
 
• Difference in all clinical parameters measured (VAS, BPI DPN, MNSI,PGIC, 
average pain score and sleep interference score from the Daily Pain and Sleep 
Interference Diary)  and histological findings on skin biopsy  between the low 
dose and high dose groups at all time  points  
• Change between treatment arms and placebo in VAS score from baseline to  Day 
30, Day 60, Day 90, 6 months, and 9 months.  
• Change in mean pain score from the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary  
between treatment arms and placebo from baseline t o Day 90, 6 months and 9 
months.  
• Change between treatment arms and placebo in mean MNSI score from baseline 
to 6 months  and 9 months . 
• Change between treatment arms and placebo in BPI-DPN from baseline to  Day 
30, Day 60, Day 90, 6 months, and 9 months.  
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 51 of 103 • Change in PGIC  between treatment arms and placebo at Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, 
6 months, and 9 months.  
• Change between treatment arms and placebo in histological findings on skin 
biopsy from baseline to 6 months  
 
6.3.3.  SAFETY  
Any patient who receives injections ( study drug or placebo) will be included in the 
safety analysis population.  Adverse events (including serious adverse events, and 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation) throughout the 9 month follow -
up will be described according to severity and to their relationship with the study drug and injection procedure.  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD, 
minimum and maximum values, where applicable) will be used to characterize safety parameters.  
 
6.3.4.  PHARMACODYNAMICS  
HGF serum levels will be determined  immediately pre -treatment on Day 0, 
immediately pre -treatment on Day 14, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  Copies of 
VM202 in whole blood will be determined at Day 0 (pre -injection and 2 hours post 
injecti on), at Day 14 (pre-injection and 2 hours post injection), Day 21, Day 30, Day 
60 and Day 90.  
 
6.3.5.  DATA SAFETY MONITORING AND INTERIM ANALYSES  
For ethical reasons, and to ensure study integrity, an interim examination of key 
safety data will be performed when approximately 50% of the patients (n= 50) have 
Day 90  data.   The primary objective of this analysis will be to evaluate the 
accumulating data for an unacceptably high frequency of negative clinical outcomes in either active treatment arm.  An independent da ta safety monitoring board 
(DSMB) will perform the review.   
 
The DSMB Chair will review a limited set of unblinded tables and listings, including all reported AEs and SAEs, every three months through to the full DSMB interim 
analysis and  continue the revi ew every six months thereafter.  The DSMB chair may 
request additional data for review and/or additional meetings of the committee as he 
/ she sees fit.  
 
 
6.4. SUBJECT CATEGORIZATION  
Screen Failure  - Any subject  who was consented and entered into the Screening  
process appropriately, but subsequently did not meet the entry criteria in order to be treated.  Subjects who fail screening will not be followed for safety or efficacy 
assessment, and no other study procedures will be performed.  Screen failures will 
be replaced.  
 Evaluable Subject  - Any subject  who received the study drug.  
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 52 of 103 Lost to follow -up - A subject  deemed to be lost to follow -up is any subject  who 
received treatment, but who does not complete scheduled study visits.  This includes 
those subject s who withdraw consent and refuse further study participation and all 
attempts to contact the subject  are deemed unsuccessful.  
 
 
 
7. ACCESS TO STUDY DOCUMENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
The Sponsor  has designated MedTech Consultants to monitor the progress of this study.  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor , has the obligation to follow this 
study closely.  In addition to conducting a site visit prior to initiation of enrollment, the clinical monitor will visit the study facilities regularly, and util ize telephone and written 
communications on an ongoing basis to maintain current knowledge of the study.   
 
During periodic visits to the study site, the monitor will review the source documents used 
in the preparation of the CRFs to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information 
contained in those reports in preparation for retrieval.  All source documents must contain 
all information required by the CRF.  All data generated during this study and the source documents from which they originated are  subject  to inspection by the Sponsor  or its 
representative, the FDA and other regulatory agencies.  
 
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (close -out) to 
the site.  The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports 
are complete, verify that study drug and other supplies have been accounted for and ensure 
that the investigator is aware of his/her responsibilities post -study. 
 
 
 
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor  employees and/or their contracted representatives utilize Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP) designed to ensure that research procedures and documentation are 
consistently conducted/prepared to the highest quality standards.  These SOPs also require 
compliance with Health Authority regulations and Good Clinical Practice guidance.  
 
A Quality Assurance audit may be conducted by the Sponsor  or its designee at any time 
during or after completion of a study.  The Investigator will be given adequate notice if 
he/she is selected for an audit.  The audit will include, but is not limited to, a review of all 
informed consent forms, a review of CRFs, associated source documents and medical 
records, a review of regulatory documentation, an assessment of study conduct and 
protocol co mpliance, and a review of the investigational drug accountability.  At the 
conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting with the Investigator to review the findings of the audit.

certification statement to that effect.  The certification statement will be submitted to the OBA.  
 
 
 
11. INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform each subject , prior to the screening 
evaluation , of the purpose of this clinical trial, including possible risks and benefits and 
document the informed consent process in the subject ’s chart.  A sample informed consent 
form containing the required elements of informed consent is provided in Appendix 2.  Any 
changes made to this sample must be approved by the Sponsor  or its designee, prior to 
submission to an IRB.  After approval by the Sponsor  or its designee, the informed consent 
must be submitted to and approv ed by an IRB.  Prior to entry into the study or initiation of 
any study -related procedures, the subject must read, sign and date the informed consent 
form.  The person executing the consent must also sign and date the final consent form 
page.  Subject s wil l be asked to initial each page of the informed consent form to 
acknowledge awareness of its contents.  One original informed consent form is to be retained by the study site and a copy  is to be given to the subject .  The informed consent 
process must be d ocumented in the subject ’s medical record.  
 
The informed consent must be written in a language in which the subject  is fluent.  If a 
foreign language translation is required, a statement of certification of the translation must 
be issued.  Regulations require that foreign language informed consent forms be submitted 
to the IRB for approval.  The investigator must forward a copy of the consent form, the 
certified foreign language translation and an IRB approval letter to  the Sponsor or its 
designee.

amendment.   Protocol modifications that impact subject  safety or the validity of the study 
must be approved by the IRB before implementation.  In the case of a medical emergency, 
to remove immediate apparent hazard to subjects , a change may be mad e preferably after 
discussion with  the Sponsor  or its designee.  In these instances, the IRB and FDA will be 
notified as soon as possible.  
  
 
14. D
ATA MANAGEMENT  
All data relating to study procedures will be entered into CRFs provided by the Sponsor  or 
its de signee.  All requested information must be entered on the CRF.  If an item is not 
available or not applicable this fact should be indicated.   
 
Obvious errors (self -evident corrections) will be corrected and documented by the Sponsor  
or its designee.  Other errors or omissions will result in queries which will be sent to the 
investigational site on Data Clarification Forms (DCF) /Query  for resolution.  A copy of the 
signed DCF is to be kept by the site with the CRFs.  Once the original is received by the 
Sponsor or its designee, the resolutions will be reviewed and entered into the database.   
 
Data will be entered into a computer database developed specifically for this trial.  Access 
to the database will be restricted to personnel responsible for data entry  and to data 
management and statistics personnel who are directly involved in the management or analysis of this trial.  During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data 
items that are potentially erroneous and require appropriate cl arification or correction.  
Prior to database lock, statistical verification of the data will be undertaken in order to further assure data quality.

  Page 69 of 103 giving a reason.  A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part, will not affect 
the standard of care you receive.  Regardless of your decision, you will still be treated for your 
medical condition.   
 
Why is this study being done?  
You are being considered to participate in this research study because you have type I or II  
diabetes with current treatment control and, you are experiencing painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy (DPN) in both lower extremities.   
 
The specific events that result in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy are not well understood, 
but high blood sugar, reduced blood flow in the limbs, and changes in the blood vessels are 
thought to result in damage to the nerves in the affected areas.  Stimulating the growth of new blood vessels may stimulate growth or regeneration of nerves and may reduce pain. R esearchers 
have discovered that a protein called hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF)  that your body naturally 
produces in small amounts can cause the growth of new blood vessels  and protect nerves.  
Unfortunately, your body only makes a small amount of this protein and not always in the areas where you need it.  Researchers have found a way to increase the amount of HGF in your legs.  
They have isolated the genes responsible for directing the production of HGF, and have designed 
a product that can be injected in to your leg.  
 In the research study the HGF gene will be injected into your calf muscle cells to evaluate if it 
changes your pain related to diabetic neuropathy.  The product being used in this study is called 
VM202.  VM202 is an experimental drug that is not yet approved by regulatory authorities (the 
US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  VM202 is a plasmid (a small piece of DNA), which 
includes the HGF gene s.  VM202 has been used in a small feasibility study in the United States 
in subject s with painful diabetic neuropathy; in a study in Korea in subject s with coronary artery 
disease and in another study in the United States in subject s with critical limb ischemia 
(decreased blood flow to the legs).  VM202 has also been tested in people undergoing coron ary 
bypass surgery.  It is hoped that VM202 injected into your calf muscle will reduce pain related to 
diabetic neuropathy.  This study is intended to help determine:  
 
• The safety and efficacy of a low and high dose of VM202.  
• If there are any effects of VM2 02 on your symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy.  
 
VM202 will be injected into both your calf muscle s using a syringe with a fine needle.

requirements of the study.   
 
How many people will take part in this research study? 
A total of 100 patients  will take part in this study at up t o 20 hospitals in the United States  and 
Korea .   
 
 What happens if I agree to be in this research study? 
After you sign this consent form indicating you want to participate in this study, you will need to undergo some tests done to see if you qualify for t he study.  If you do not meet all of the study 
entry criteria, you will not be able to participate in the study and your doctor will discuss with you other options that you may have for treatment of your medical condition.  The study doctor 
will tell you w hether you are able to participate in this study after the initial test results are 
received and reviewed.   
 
This study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized clinical study.  If you agree and are 
eligible to participate you will be “ randomly ” assigned (like drawing numbers out of a hat or 
flipping a coin) to one of three groups as listed below.  “ Double- blind ” means that you and your 
doctor will not know the treatment you are getting during the study.  However, your doctor can 
find out if neede d for safety reasons .  “Placebo controlled” means not all participants will be 
assigned to a treatment group that will receive the study drug.  Some participants may only 
receive saline injections.  What group you are assigned to is done by a computer and is not 
known by your doctor until the study is completed.   
 You will be randomly assigned to one of three possible study groups.  In each study group, you 
will receive 32 injections in each calf at the Day 0  and Day 14 visits.  The contents of the 
injecti ons depend on your study group:  
  
• Low Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this group, you will receive 16 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the two injection visits ( 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 0 visit 
and 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 14 visit  in each leg ).  At each of these two injection visits, 
you will receive 16 injections of 0.5 mL of VM202 in each leg  and 16 injecti ons of 0.5 mL 
saline in each leg .  The total volume of all of the injections is about 3 teaspoon s of fluid .  
Approximately forty p ercent  of patients will be selected for this group.   
 
 
• High Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this group, you will receive 32 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the two injection visits ( 16mg of VM202 at the Day 0 visit  
and, 16mg of VM202 a t the Day14 visit) .  At both injection visits, you will receive 32 
injections of 0.5 mL of VM202 in each leg.  The total volume of all of the injections is about 
3 teaspoon s of fluid .  Approximately forty percent  of patients will be selected for this group .

  Page 71 of 103 • Placebo  Control Group – if you are selected for this group, you will not receive VM202.  
You will only receive injections of saline.   At both injection visits, you will receive 32 
injections of 0.5 mL of saline in each leg .   The total volume of all of the injections is about 3 
teaspoon s of fluid .  Approximately twenty percent  of patients will be selected for this group.   
 
Before your first treatment, you will be asked to fill out a daily questionnaire for a week (7 days).  
You will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 0 -10 (with 0 = no pain, and 10 = worst possible 
pain) every day.  You will also be asked to describe if your pain interfered with your sleep on a 
scale of 0 -10 (with 0 = pain did not interfere with sleep, and 10 = pain completely interfered; I 
was not able to sleep due to pain).  You will not be able to receive injections if you do not complete this diary.  A small skin sample will be taken from your left ankle, calf and left upper 
thigh, for a total of three samples.  .  These samples  will be very small (about the size of a half of 
a grain of rice) and will be taken using local anesthetic.  These samples will be taken again at the 
6 month visit and will used to track the progress of your neuropathy.  
 
What tests, procedures, and diagnos tic studies will be done during this study?  
There are 9 visits which span 9 months total time from visit #2 to visit # 9.  Depending on the 
visit, different tests will be done.  Visit #1 may actually take more than one visit to accomplish 
depending on how many tests can be scheduled on that first day, but is usually completed within 
a few weeks before the first injection procedure (Visit #2).  Below is a detailed description of each of the required visits and the laboratory tests, procedures, and evaluation s that will be done 
during the visits.   
 
Description of the tests, procedures, and diagnostic studies to be done  
 
Medical history – Discussion with your doctor of your medical history, including diabetes 
history and any changes that have happened.   
 Physical exam – Your doctor will examine you.  This exam includes taking your sitting blood 
pressure, temperature, heart rate and weight  (vital signs ).   
 Medication Review – Discussion with your doctor of what medications and dietary supplements 
you have taken or are currently taking.   Please note, some medications may not be taken during 
the study since they may interfere with the potential effect of the study medication or ability to 
assess the response to the study medication.  The doctor will talk to you about these medications; 
if you are currently taken any of these medications, you will be asked to stop taking these medications for the duration of the study.      
 Assessment of neuropathy – Assessment by your doctor of the condition of your feet and leg s, 
your reflexes, and sensitivity to touch.  
 
Injection site reaction assessment – Assessment by your doctor of any pain or other reaction at 
the locations where VM202 was injected.

  Page 72 of 103  
Assessment of side effects – Assessment by your doctor of any unpleasant m edical experiences, 
side effects, or discomforts that may have happened to you.   
 
Questionnaire – You will be asked to fill in short questionnaire s about feeling in your legs and 
feet before the first injection .  You will be asked to complete brief questi onnaires about pain in 
your feet and legs at some visits.  
 
Pain and Sleep Interference Diary - You will be asked to assess your average pain in your feet 
and lower legs  for 7 days.   You will also be asked to assess to what degree your pain interferes 
with your sleep.  
 Cancer Screening  – Cancer screening includes pap smear and mammogram if not performed 
within past 12 months (females only); PSA within past 3 months (males  ≥ 50 years  only); for 
subject s ≥ 50 years old, colonoscopy within past 10 years; for subject s with family history of 
colon cancer in any first degree relative, colonoscopy within past 12 months; and X-ray or CT 
scan of chest.  
 Retinal Fundoscopy – An ophthalmologist may dilate your pupils and perform a retinal 
examination with retinal photog raphs at Screening.  If your ophthalmologist determines that a 
more detailed image of the blood vessels in your eye is necessary to determine if you are eligible 
for study participation, he / she may conduct another test called fluorescein angiography.   T his 
involves injecting a dye into a vein in your arm; the dye then circulates through the bloodstream and to the blood vessels of your eye .  Retinal photographs of the back of your eye will be taken 
again at 9 months, but the fluorescein angiography will not be repeated.   If dilating eye drops are 
used, they may impair focusing of the eyes for several hours. Therefore, arrangements should be 
made for someone else to drive after the examination. Wearing sunglasses or tinted lenses may 
make dilated pupils mor e comfortable.  You should tell the examiner if you are allergic to any 
medications, are taking any medications, or have glaucoma or a family history of glaucoma.   
 
Pregnancy test – If you are a female of child bearing age, you will have a urine pregnancy  test 
done to confirm that you are not pregnant.  You cannot participate if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the course of the trial.   
 12 Lead E KG – An electrocardiogram (E KG) is a measurement of your heart’s electrical 
activity that is  traced and sent to a machine, which can be read by your doctor.  This procedure is 
not painful and involves lying as still as possible for a few minutes with sticky pads (electrodes) 
on your chest, arms and legs which are connected through wires to the E KG machine.  This test 
typically takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  
 
Blood tests – Routine blood tests will be done at certain visits.  Laboratory tests will also include 
testing for VM202  and HGF  levels in the blood at certain visits.  The screening eva luation

of rice) and will be taken using local anesthetic.  These samples will be taken again at the 6 month visit and will be used to track the progress of your neuropathy.  
 Below is a list of each visit and the specific tests that will be done  
 
Visit # 1: Screening/Baseline Evaluations  
Screening is a process of evaluating your initial health status and assessing the status of your 
pain related to diabetic neuropathy.  Screening is usually completed within two month s before 
the first study injections if you qualify for this study.  If you agree to take part in this research study, you will first sign this consent form, and then undergo sc reening.  Screening will involve 
the following procedures:  medical history, physical exam, vital signs, medication review, 
completion of questionnaires , assessment of neuropathy, cancer screening, retinal fundoscopy; 
blood tests including a viral screen; urine test, urine pregnancy test (if you are a female of 
childbearing age), 12 lead E KG, and completion of a pain and sleep interference diary . 
 
Please note:   If any of your viral test results are positive you may need to have a second test done 
to make sure the results are the same.  The doctor or his/her nurse will tell you how to find medical help and counseling as needed, and you will not be able to take part in this study.  The 
study sponsor will not pay for the cost of the repeat tests, or any other f ollow -up medical care, or 
counseling for a positive or abnormal test result.   
 
It takes approximately one to two weeks to get all of the initial test results.  After your doctor has 
reviewed the results of these tests he/she will determine whether you are eligible for participation 
in the study.  If you are eligible for the study and you do wish to continue, you will be assigned 
by chance (randomly) to either one of the groups to receive VM202 (low or high dose) or the 
placebo control group.  You will then  be scheduled for the first set of injections  which will be 
done at your next visit (Visit #2).   Prior to  that time, you will be reminded to fill out the daily 
questionnaire for a week (7 days).   
 Visit # 2 – First Injection Procedure (injection s of VM202 or placebo into both calf 
muscle s) 
 Before Injection Procedure:  
The following tests will be performed before you have your injection procedure done:  medication review, completion of questionnaires, review of your completed diary entries, vital 
signs, skin biopsy, and blood tests including HGF and VM202.

You also must not participate in any other clinical trial while participating in this study.   
 
What about my rights to decline participation or withdraw from the study?  
You may choose not to be in the study, or, if you agree to be in the study, you may withdraw 
from the study at any time.  If you withdraw from the study, no new data about you will be collected for stu dy purposes unless the data pertain to a side effect related to the study.  If such 
an event occurs, we may need to review your entire medical record.   
 
Your decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study will not involve any penalty or 
loss of  benefits to which you are entitled, and will not affect your access to health care.  If you do 
decide to stop your participation in the study, you should talk to your doctor immediately so he/she can advise you of any additional tests that may be needed f or your safety.  Your doctor 
may decide to take you off this study if your condition gets worse, if you have serious side effects, or if he/she determines that it is no longer in your best interest to continue.  The Sponsor 
or regulatory agencies may stop this study at anytime without your consent.  If this occurs, you 
will be notified and your study doctor will discuss with you other options you may have.   
 What are the risks of this research study?  
There are known risks and discomforts involved in some of the tests and evaluations.  There are 
also unknown risks.  Below is a description of these risks.   Your doctor will discuss the risks 
and procedures with you before you start in the study.   
 
Risks from Injection Procedures  
VM202 will be injected into t he calf muscles using a fine needle.  There may be some pain at the 
injection site at the time of injection.   There may be swelling, bruising or inflammation near the 
injection site.   You may experience an increase in the level of pain in the treated leg.  There may 
be a risk of an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), fever or tissue damage from the injection 
(ulceration, necrosis).  Because HGF has the potential to create new blood vessels 
(angiogenesis), there may be risk of promoting tumor growth (cancer) or  of increasing the 
number of blood vessels in the back of your eye and damaging your retina (retinopathy).   
 Risks to women who can get pregnant or are breastfeeding 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risk s.  
Therefore, pregnant women cannot take part in this study.  If you are a woman who can get 
pregnant, a urine pregnancy test will be done and it must show that you are not pregnant before 
you can participate in this study.  You must also agree not to become pregnant during this study.  
You may not take part in this study if you are breastfeeding.  If sexually active and with 
childbearing potential , you must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control for the whole 
study.   
 The following birth cont rol measures are acceptable:

in combination with a spermicide;  
• Intrauterine device (IUD);  
• Birth control pills  
• Depo -provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate);  
• Levonorgest rel implants;  
 
Abstention, the rhythm method, and/or contraception by the partner are not acceptable methods 
of contraception.   
 If you do become pregnant during this study or think that you might be pregnant, you must 
inform your study doctor immediately .  If this happens, the study doctor will discuss with you 
what you should do.  If you get pregnant, you will be asked to stop taking part in the study and you will be asked for information about the pregnancy and the baby.   
 
Risks from taking a blood sam ple 
You will have routine blood samples taken from a vein in your arm by a needle stick.  Risks 
associated with drawing blood from your arm include slight discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.  The number of 
times that you will have a blood sample drawn for this study totals about 1 0 times over 
approximately 1 1 months.  Each time your blood is drawn roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood 
will be taken.   
 
Risks from taking a skin biopsy  
A small skin sample will be taken from the back of each of your calves and from  each of  your 
upper thighs ( 3samples in total)  before the first injections and again at 6 months.  Risks 
associated with skin biopsies include bleeding, temporary bruising and inf ection, although with 
proper wound care, is not likely.  
 Risks from cancer screening  
Cancer screening includes pap smear and mammogram if not performed within past 12 months 
(females only); PSA within past 3 months (males ≥ 50 years  only); for subject s ≥50 years old, 
colonoscopy within past 10 years; for subject s with family history of colon cancer in any first 
degree relative, colonoscopy within past 12 months; and X-ray or CT scan of chest.  Possible 
risks include a small amount of radiation exposure from  a chest X-ray (or chest CT scan, if you 
have a history of smoking) and mammogram (if you are female), discomfort associated with pap 
smear and mammography (if you are female), and risks associated with taking a blood sample 
(as described above).  Possible risks from colonoscopy may include:  bowel perforation (a hole 
or tear in the wall of the colon) requiring a repair operation (fewer than 1 out of 1,000 tests), heavy or persistent bleeding from biopsy or polyp- removal sites (1 out of 1,000 tests), advers e 
reaction to sedative medication causing breathing problems or low blood pressure (4 out of 10,000 tests), infection requiring antibiotic therapy (very rare), and nausea, vomiting, bloating, or 
rectal irritation caused by medicines taken by mouth to clean se the bowel.

  Page 78 of 103  
Risks from Retinal Fundoscopy  
The test itself involves no risk.  If dilating eye drops are used, they may produce a brief stinging 
sensation when put in the eyes and a medicinal taste in the mouth caused by the medication 
draining from the tear ducts into the throat.  Dilating eye drops rarely produce nausea, vomiting, 
dryness of the mouth, flushing, dizziness, or an attack of narrow -angle glaucoma.  If glaucoma is 
suspected, drops generally are not used.  
 Risks from Fluorescein Angiography  (if deemed necessary by the ophthalmologist)   
Side effects associated with injection of fluorescein dye into a vein in the arm include nausea and/or vomiting (approximately 5% of subject s) hives and itching (approximately 0.5% of 
subject s) and rarely, a life threatening allergic reaction, consisting of possible seizures and 
difficulty in breathing (less than 0.01%).  There may be a local temporary discomfort at the si te 
of injection.  
 
Risks from E KG  
In rare circumstances, a rash or irritation at the location of the electrocardiogram electrode 
placement can occur due to the adhesive.  If this should occur it will be assessed and treated 
using clinical standards of care with appropriate medication(s) and/or compresses.  
 
Unknown risks  
In addition to the risks  already described, there may be other discomforts or risks from this study 
drug and/or procedures that we do not know about.  You will be watched for signs and symptoms of any side effects and you should tell your doctor if you do not feel well or experie nce any 
unusual symptoms.   
 Are there benefits to taking part in this research study?  
There may be no direct benefit to you by participating in this study.  However, it is possible that 
the pain related to your diabetic neuropathy will improve.    
 Knowle dge from this study may help us better understand how to treat people with painful 
diabetic neuropathy.     
 
What if new information becomes available? 
If additional data regarding potential safety risks become available during the study, your 
research doc tor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the 
study.  If you decide to withdraw from the study, your research doctor will make arrangements for your care to continue.  If you decide to continue in the study you may be asked to sign an 
updated consent form which will explain the new information clearly.   
 
Also, on receiving new information your research doctor might consider it to be in your best 
interests to withdraw you from the study.  He/she will explain the reasons  and arrange for your 
care to continue.

What alternatives are there to participation in this study?   
Currently, there are no approved drugs or treatment strategies known to stop or reverse the 
progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  Treatments goals are to reduce pain, improve 
physical function, reduce psychological distress, and improve quality of life.  Good glycemic 
control is the only factor shown to slow the progress of neuropathy symptoms.  Lowering your 
triglyceride level, l osing weight (if you are overweight), stopping smoking (smokers only) and 
reducing blood pressure have also shown to reduce diabetic neuropathy symptoms.

WASHOUT  OF OPIOIDS 
 
Since opioids may interfere with assessment of VM202 effect on pain, subjects must discontinue 
use of all opioid drugs fourteen days prior to the completion of the Daily Pain and Sleep 
Interference Diary at Screening.  
 Subject must agree to remain off of these medications until completion of the 9 month follow -up 
visit.

How to Use the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument  
 
 
History.  The history  questionnaire is self -administered by the subject .  Responses are added to 
obtain the total score.  Responses of “yes” to items 1 -3, 5-6, 8-9, 11- 12, 14- 15 are each counted 
as one point.  A “no” response on items 7 and 13 counts as 1 point.  Item #4 is a measure of 
impaired circulation and item #10 is a measure of general aesthenia and are not included in 
scoring.  To decrease the potential for bias, all scoring information has been eliminated from the 
subject version.    
 Physical Assessment.   For all ass essments, the foot should be warm (>30°C).   
 
Foot Inspection:   The feet are inspected for evidence of excessively dry skin, callous formation, 
fissures, frank ulceration or deformities.  Deformities include flat feet, hammer toes, overlapping toes, halux valgus, joint subluxation, prominent metatarsal heads, medial convexity (Charcot 
foot) and amputation.    
 
Vibration Sensation:   Vibration sensation should be performed with the great toe unsupported.  
Vibration sensation will be tested bilaterally using a 128 Hz tuning fork placed over the dorsum 
of the great toe on the boney prominence of the DIP joint.  Subject s, whose eyes are closed, will 
be asked to indicate when they can no longer sense the vibration from the vibrating tuning fork.    
In general, the  examiner should be able to feel vibration from the hand -held tuning fork for 5 
seconds longer on his distal forefinger than a normal subject  can at the great toe (e.g. examiner’s 
DIP joint of the first finger versus subject ’s toe).  If the examiner feels vibration for 10 or more 
seconds on his or her finger, then vibration is considered decreased.  A trial should be given when the tuning fork is not vibrating to be certain that the subject  is responding to vibration and 
not pressure or some other clue.  Vibration is scored as 1) present if the examiner senses the vibration on his or her finger for < 10 seconds, 2) reduced if sensed for ≥ 10 or 3) absent (no 
vibration detection.)   
 
Muscle Stretch Reflexes:  The ankle reflexes will be examined using an approp riate reflex 
hammer (e.g. Trommer or Queen square).  The ankle reflexes should be elicited in the sitting position with the foot dependent and the subject  relaxed.  For the reflex, the foot should be 
passively positioned and the foot dorsiflexed slightly t o obtain optimal stretch of the muscle.  
The Achilles tendon should be percussed directly.  If the reflex is obtained, it is graded as 
present.  If the reflex is absent, the subject  is asked to perform the Jendrassic maneuver (i.e., 
hooking the fingers together and pulling).  Reflexes elicited with the Jendrassic maneuver alone are designated “present with reinforcement.”  If there flex is absent, even in the face of the 
Jendrassic maneuver, the reflex is considered absent.  
 
Monofilament Testing:   For this examination, it is important that the subject ’s foot be supported 
(i.e., allow the sole of the foot to rest on a flat, warm surface).  The filament should initially be prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger).  The 
filament is then applied to the dorsum of the great toe midway between the nail fold and the DIP joint.  Do not hold the toe directly.  The filament is applied perpendicularly and briefly, (<1 
 
 
 
Protocol VMDN-002/C CONFIDENTIAL  VM BioPharma  
  Page 90 of 103 second) with an even pressure.  When the filament bends, the force of 10 grams has been 
applied.  The subject , whose eyes are closed, is asked to respond yes if he/she feels the filament.   
Eight correct responses out of 10 applications is considered normal: one to seven correct  
responses indicates reduced sensation and no correct answers translates into absent sensation.

  Page 92 of 103 1. Test article preparation   
 
VM202 - VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial conta ining 2.5 mg of lyophilized study 
product.  Before administration, it will be reconstituted with 5.0 mL of water for injection 
(WFI) for a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be 
used for one subject.  For subjects randomized to the Low Dose or High Dose arms of the 
study, t he final doses of VM202 will be divided evenly between the Day 0 administration 
and the Day 14 administration.  Every i ndividual injection will be 0.5 mL.  All injections 
administered by intramusc ular injections.  
 
Placebo  - Patients assigned to either the placebo arm or the Low Dose arm will receive 
normal saline injections.  The placebo group will receive only normal saline injections; the Low Dose arm will receive 16 injections of VM202 and 16 injections of normal saline in 
each leg at both injection visits.  Visually, normal saline is indistinguishable from 
reconstituted VM202.

2. Test material administration  – Patients will receive injections of VM202 or placebo on Day 
0, and Day 1 4.  A fine needle (e.g. 27 gauge, 1”) suitable for IM injections will be used .  
Both calves will be treated with 32 injections each at each visit.   Distribute injection site s 
evenly over the calf muscle , carefully avoiding fas cia. 
 
3. Inject the entire amount of the drug per each injection in about 3-5 seconds.  Immediately 
after completion of injection, lightly press the injection site with the finger head in order to prevent reflux.  Do not massage the injection site.  An indeli ble marker should be used to 
identify each injection site.  
 
4. Subsequent  administration s – Subsequent administrations should also be distributed evenly 
over the calf, and, as much as is possible, at different injection sites.  If marks made to 
identify previ ous injection sites are visible, every effort should be made to inject at alternate 
locations.

The VAS will be completed by the subject.  The subject should be asked: “ How do you 
currently rate your pain  in your leg s (below the knee – this includes pain in your feet)?”   
 
The subject should be instructed to indicate his or her current level of pain in their legs by 
placing a single vertical line perpendicular to the horizontal line of the scale ensuring that the 
two lines intersect.  Additionally, the subject should b e instructed to not use a check mark, “x” or 
circle that would intersect the horizontal line of the scale multiple times.  Ensure the subject understands that the mark must be only one line that is perpendicular to and intersects the scale 
line.  The subje ct should complete the VAS with a fine or medium point pen; felt tip pens and 
pencils should not be used.   
 
 
The VAS should be checked for accuracy and completeness immediately after it is completed by 
the subject.  If the subject’s mark does not intersect the line or intersects the line more than once, 
reinstruct the subject to modify his or her mark so it meets the appropriate criteria.  Any 
corrections should be accompanied by the subject’s initial and date.  For Day 0 , all corrections 
MUST be completed prior to injections; do NOT have the subject correct the scale after 
injections.  Instead, use the data collected prior to dosing.  
 The VAS score (0 to 100mm) will be calculated by measuring the distance from the left end of 
the line (“No Pain”) along the scale to the mark made by the subject.  If the mark made by the 
subject intersects the horizontal line of the scale multiple times and was not corrected, measure 
to the middle point between the two marks.  If the mark made by the subject does not inters ect 
the line of the scale and was not corrected, project the location of the mark vertically to a point on the line of the scale for the measurement.

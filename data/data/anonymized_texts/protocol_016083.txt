Trial Summary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  2.1 
 Table 2 -a footnote a:  
Trial personnel  will follow U.S. Navy subjects through Day 45 , U.S. Air Force subjects through Day 53, 
and U.S. Marine subjects through Day 72 . If a subject early terminates (ET), Day 45 , Day 53 or Day 72 
procedures, as applicable, should be performed.  
Table 2 -a footno te d:  
After written informed consent is obtained within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 1, subse quent 
study procedures including blood draw and randomization may be done. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 
to receive NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or placebo (saline). On Day 1, the subject will receive 
the study dose he/she was randomized to receive. The study d ose will be administered IM in the middle 
1/3 of the deltoid muscle. After vaccination, the subject will be observed for at least 15 minutes . If the 
investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required by the US 
military are given, the trial dose may be administered later during the training period. For subjects in 
Subset A,  . Tthose concomitant required vacc ines administered on Day 1 (the same day as the NoV 
GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or placebo) will b e recorded on the subject’s source documents (by 
manufacturer, lot number, expiry date) and subsequently recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). For all subjects enrolled after Subset A, this information will be filed at the site as source 
documentation but not recorded in the eCRF.  
Table 2 -a footnote f:  
Blood will be collected on all subjects once within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 1, and once 
post-vaccination on each of Days 8 and 29 and at the end of the AGE  active surveillance period (EOS) in 
order to explore a level of protection. The EOS sera will also provide information on asymptomatic NoV 
illness for those subjects who develo p a 4 -fold or greater rise in anti -NoV antibodies between Day 29 and 
EOS.  
Table 2 -b footnote a:  
During the AGE surveillance period (Day 1 through Day 45  for U.S. Navy, Day  53 for U.S. Air Force, and 
Day 72 for U.S. Marines ), those subjects, who present w ith AGE, will be instructed to record their AGE 
symptoms on the logs and report to the medical clinic for assessment at the next trial visit . Initial AGE 
symptom logs will be given  at trial entry to record AGE symptoms. Subjects will be instructed to retur n 
any subsequent logs and the latest AGE symptom log to the medical clinic at the next trial visit.  
Table 2 -b footnote b:  
For those subjects who present with AGE, a stool specimen and a vomitus specimen (vomitus if available) 
will be collected as soon as  possible after the onset of each new episode of AGE for processing and 
subsequent RT -PCR testing. If no samples are provided at AGE onset, samples should be obtained as 
soon as possible thereafter. If samples at AGE onset are inadequate ie too small for b oth RT -PCR to 
NoV and co -infection tests, the sample should be prioritized for RT -PCR to NoV and a subsequent 
sample  should be obtained for co -infection testing as soon as possible thereafter. If samples become 
lost, destroyed, damaged or otherwise unavail able for use, AGE onset samples should be repeated as 
soon as possible. After the initial stool specimen is obtained at the onset of AGE; up to  three additional 
stool specimens as available (optional), will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days, once betw een 21 
and 29 days and  once at EOS. The onset of AGE is defined as the date the subject initially presents with 
vomiting and diarrhea .

 Trial Summary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Table 2 -c footnote a:  
Trial personnel will follow U.S. Navy subjects through Day 45 , U.S. Air Force subjects through 
Day 53, and U.S. Marine subjects through Day 72 . If a subject early terminates (ET), Day 45, 
Day 53 or Day 72 procedures, as applicable, should be performed.  
Section  6.1 This is a Phase 2b, double blind, randomized, multi -site, placebo -controlled, efficacy trial of a 
single dose of the IM NoV vaccine combined with Al(OH) 3 adjuvant compared to a single dose 
of placebo (saline) control . Based on prior incidence rates of AGE over multiple seasons in the 
US Military training installa tions, the estimated sample size for the trial is 2800 -8700 healthy 
subjects aged 18 to 49 years who will be recruited from US military training installations. This 
trial has a case -driven design, with the primary analysis planned after ~ 30 cases of moder ate or 
severe AGE due to infection with genotype -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains represented in 
the vaccine have been confirmed (excluding co -infection with any of three bacterial pathogens, 
Salmonella, Shigella  or Campylobacter). If there are < 30 ca ses (as defined above) at the end of 
the first season  (September through May) , the trial may be continued beyond the end of  May 
the first season , may be stopped, or may be continued for a second season  (September through 
May) . If the accrual of cases (as d efined above) is slower than expected, an interim analysis 
may be performed when approximately 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to any NoV 
strain have been accrued. For all enrolled subjects, accrual of additional AGE cases due to NoV 
will continue f or all enrolled subjects until the end of each respective active AGE surveillance 
period  (45 days) . Thereafter, further enrollment of new subjects will be stopped.  
Section  6.3 Trial participation is expected to be from enrollm ent through EOS (trial Day 45 for U.S. Navy 
subjects, trial Day 53 for U.S. Air Force subjects, and trial Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects ) 
Section  7.2 Criterion #15v:  
Abstinence, defined as refraining f rom heterosexual interco urse, i e sexual intercourse with 
risk of conception, during the entire study period.  
Criterion #17:  
If male and sexually active, the subject must be advised not to donate sperm from Day 1 
through 6 months after the last dose of trial vaccine.  
Section  7.3 Bullet 2:  
If the investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required 
by the US military are given, the trial dose may be administered later during the training 
period.  
Section  7.4 Number 3: 
Lost to follow -up: The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful and/or the subject graduated and left the base . Attempts to contact the 
subject must be documented.  
Section  9.1.3  Paragraph 1:  
If the subject is interested to participate, trial staff will review the informed consent form and 
will highlight the key aspects of the trial. The consenting procedure may occur in small groups 
of up to three subjects at once. Notably, this procedure will be handled by non -uniformed trial 
staff not involved in the training of the subjects to avoid any feeling of coercion, and also 
include an Ombudsman  [28].  
Section  9.1.4  Individual s who received Receipt of any vaccine s within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 
28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial with the exception of routine 
immunizations as per Military Procedures (see Appendix D). If the investigational trial dose is 
delayed beyond the day the licensed vaccines are given, the trial dose may be subsequently 
administered later during the training period.

 Trial Summary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  9.1.8  Paragraph 1:  
All subjects will have surveillance for AGE disease performed from Day 1 until the end of the 
active AGE disease surveillance period (Day 45 for U.S. Navy subjects, Day 53 for U.S. Air 
Force subjects, or Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects ). 
Paragraph 2:  
Subject s will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease, and a new AGE disease 
symptom log will be given to record AGE disease symptoms until they resolve. Subjects will be 
instructed to return any subsequent and the latest AGE and any subsequent  disease  symptom 
log to the medical clinic trial site at the next trial visit. A convalescent blood specimen for 
serology will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days after the onset of the AGE disease. After 
the initial stool specimen obtained at the onset of AGE d isease: as available , three additional 
stool specimens will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days, once between 21 and 29 days and 
once at end of the acute AGE surveillance period EOS . These follow -on stool specimens will be 
analyzed for NoV by RT -PCR.  If an AGE event occurs within 7 days prior to the EOS visit 
(Day 45), a convalescent serum sample and a single optional stool sample should be collected 
at the EOS visit. There is no further follow -up for AGE after graduation from recruit 
training at Day 45.  
Section  9.1.13  For female subjects of child bearing potential, pregnancy testing using urine or serum will be 
performed within 72 hours prior to vaccination. Subjects will be provided with information on 
acceptable methods of contraception as part of the subject informed consent process and will be 
asked to sign a consent form stating that they understand the requirements for avoidance of 
pregnancy as well as donation of ova (or sperm  in the case of male participants) . 
Section  9.3.6  Heading:  
Procedures at end of Active AGE Disease Surveillance Period ( +/-4 - 7 days)  
Section  10.4.3  Paragraph 1:  
Collection of SAEs will be collected by close monitoring from the time that t he subject is 
administered the trial vaccine (Day 1) up to the end of the active AGE disease surveillance 
period (at Day 45  for U.S. Navy subjects, at Day 53 for U.S. Air Force subjects, and at Day 72 
for U.S. Marine subjects ).

 Trial Sum mary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  9.1.4  3rd paragraph:  
All medications, vaccines and blood products including specific history of antibiotic use and 
the duration thereof,  taken or received by the subjects within 3 months prior to the start of the 
trial are to be recorded on the source do cument and entered onto the Prior and Concomitant 
Medications eCRF. The use of antipyretics and/or analgesic medications within 24 hours prior 
to vaccination must be identified and the reason for their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) 
must be described i n the source documents or the eCRF.  
Section  9.1.7  A saliva specimen will be collected once during the trial (at any time pre - or post -vaccination)  
either on Day 1 or  from subjects in Subset A for assessment of HBGA secretor st atus or at any 
time (pre - or post -vaccination) during the trial.  
Section  9.1.8  1st paragraph:  
All subjects will have surveillance for AGE disease performed from Day 1 until the end of the 
active AGE disease surveillance period  (Day 45 for U.S. Navy subjects, Day 53 for U.S. Air 
Force subjects, or Day 72 for U.S. Marine subjects). All participants will be given an AGE 
disease symptom log and a thermometer at trial entry within 7 days prior to vaccination or on  
(Day 1 ) and instru cted to record their AGE disease symptoms and report to the medical clinic as 
soon as possible. The subjects will record in the AGE disease symptom log the onset time of 
vomiting and/or diarrhea, their temperature, the number of episodes of vomiting and/or  
diarrhea, and the stop time of vomiting and/or diarrhea to calculate duration of AGE. The 
subjects will also document whether the symptom(s) have had impact on their ability to train. 
The subjects will be given  instructed to use the provided thermometers to measure and record 
their temperature on the AGE disease symptom log. The subjects will be informed that the 
recommended route to take their temperature is oral and instructed to use this route.  At the 
medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to dete rmine if they have an AGE disease that meets 
the work -up definition (see Section 6.1). Subjects who meet the work -up definition will be 
assessed for disease severity and provide a stool specimen (not rectal swabs) and /or vomitus  
specimen for processing and  later detection of NoV by RT -PCR. Subjects will only provide 
vomitus  specimen if actively vomiting. All initial stool samples for each new onset episode of 
AGE will be analyzed for the following three enteric pathogens: Salmonella , Shigella , and 
Campyloba cter. 
2nd paragraph:  
Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease, and a new AGE disease 
symptom log will be given to record AGE disease symptoms until they resolve. Subjects will be 
instructed to return any subsequent and the latest AGE disease symptom log to the medical 
clinic at the next trial visit. A convalescent blood specimen for serology will be obtained once 
between 7 and 14 days after the onset of the AGE disease. After the initial stool specimen 
obtained at the onset of AGE disease: as available, three additional stool specimens will be 
obtained once between 7 and 14 days, once between 21 and 28 29 days and once at end of the 
acute AGE surveillance period. These follow -on stool specimens will be analyzed for NoV by 
RT-PCR.  
Section  9.1.10  2nd paragraph:  
All enrolled subjects will have blood drawn once within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 
1 and once  on each of  Days 1, 8, 29 and at the EOS (end of the active AGE surveillance 
period). For thos e subjects who develop AGE during the surveillance period, a single 
convalescent serum specimen will also be obtained once between 7 to 14 days after each new 
onset AGE episode.

Section 9.1.8. After the initial stool specimen obtained at the onset of AGE disease: as 
available, three additional stool specimens will be obtained once between 7 and 14 days, 
once between 21 and 28 29 days and once at end of the acute AGE surve illance period. 
Refer to Section 9.1.8.  
Section  9.3.6  Section title:  
9.3.6  Procedures at end of Active AGE Disease Surveillance Period (+/ - 2 4 days)  
Section  9.3.7  Collect data on AEs. 
Section  10.1 Table 10 -a, Table 10 -b footnotes : clarified body temperature is recommended to be taken by 
the oral route  and to record the ac tual method taken on the CRF.  
Section  13.1.5  2nd paragraph  
For subje cts in Subsets A and B, safety will be assessed daily for 7 days after vaccination 
(including the day of vaccination) via collection of solicited AEs, including local AEs 
(injection site: pain, erythema, induration and swelling) and systemic AEs (headache,  fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, vomiting, and diarrhea). In addition, other indicators of safety will be 
collected ( e.g., body temperature). Body temperature will be summarized by actual route 
taken with no adjustment or conversion for route of measurement.  
Section  13.2 1st paragraph:  
An interim analysis will be performed on after the first 200 subjects (Subset A) have completed 
the EOS visit, and when  the assay results are completed. The anti -NoV GI.1 and GII.4 VLP 
antibody resp onses at baseline (prior to or on Day 1) and on Day s 1, 8, 29 and EOS, and the 
antibody responses at baseline (prior to or on Day 1) and  on Day s 1 and 29 to adenovirus type 
4, to meningococcal vaccine serogroup A, and to the seasonal influenza vaccine H3 s train, will 
be summarized by treatment group and provided to the sponsor and DMC for review. In 
addition, all available  safety data for these subjects, including solicited AEs and unsolicited 
AEs, will be summarized and provided to the DMC for review . Spec ifically, the interim safety 
and immunogenicity for this subset may be summarized separately as the results become 
available.

Trial No. NOR -211 Page 15 of 103 
Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 Trial Sum mary  Adapted to reflect the changes in the body of the protocol.  
Section  13.3 2nd paragraph:  
The average weekly incidence (as percentage of recruits on the base) ove r the winter NoV high 
seasons (October -May) and summer low seasons (June -September) of consultation at the 
medical stations for symptoms of AGE were evaluated for the full trial  period from September 
2011 to September 2014. The expected background rate of NoV GI.1/GII.4 was calculated 
using two three  assumptions. The incidence of NoV over the winter high season is the excess of 
AGE in the winter (first panel in Table 13-a) compared to the summer (second panel in Table 
13-a) and can thus be calculated as the  average weekly AGE incidence during the winter season 
minus the average weekly AGE incidence during the preceding  corresponding  summer season. 
This has been calculated in the last panel in Table 13-a. The second assumption is that 50% of 
the NoV cases are  due to GI.1/GII.4 which  that is compatible with the overall breakdown of the 
NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes identified by the CDC as the cause of NoV 
outbreaks reported to CDC over the same 2011 -2014 time period. The weekly incidence rates 
are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of training) to obtain the incidence rate over training 
and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that all subjects  reporting to the medical 
station are  all moderate or severe AGE cases  are reported to the medical station . 
3rd paragraph:  
The background incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype -specific (GI.1 
and GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co -infection with Salmonella , 
Shigella , or Campylobacter ) is as sumed to be  0.535-1.687% per subject -training period of 
observation based on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned trial sites (Table 13-a). 
Under such attack rate assumptions, approximately 2800 -8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 
ratio to NoV vaccin e and saline placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or 
severe AGE due to NoV infection by genotype -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains. As this is a 
case-driven trial, subjects will continue to be enrolled and followed through the entire a ctive 
AGE surveillance period until ~ 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to genotype -specific 
(GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, excluding co -infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be 
closed to further enrollment.  
Appendix C Bullet 25:  
Female subjects of childbearing potential ( e.g., non -sterilized, premenopausal female subjects) 
who are sexually active must use adequate contraception (as defined in the informed consent) 
from enrollment  Day 1 and  through out the duration of the trial. Regular  pPregnancy tests will 
be performed throughout the trial for all female subjects of childbearing potential as defined in 
the protocol and in the informed consent . If a subject is found to be pregnant during trial, the 
investigator will offer the subject the choice to receive unblinded treatment information.

USA  Product Name:  
Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus -Like Particle Vaccine  
Trial Title:  Phase 2b, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy  and 
Immunogenicity of the Intramuscular Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus -like Particle Vaccine in Healthy Adults 
Aged 18 - 49 Years  
IND No.:  014421  EudraCT No.: Not applicable  
Study Identifier:  NOR -211 Phase:  2b Trial Blinding Schema:  Double blind  
Background and Rationale:  
Noroviruses (NoVs) cause an acute debilitating illn ess characterized by vomiting and diarrhea. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are due to NoV 
each year in the United States (US). NoVs have emerged as an important cause of ou tbreaks of viral gastroenteritis 
worldwide. These outbreaks can occur in all age groups, wherever people gather, and commonly result in significant 
morbidity and mortality, particularly in the very old and very young. In addition, NoV illnesses and outbrea ks exact a 
significant socioeconomic toll on businesses, hospitals, schools and other closed settings, such as dormitories and 
military barracks.  
AGE is commonly reported within training and deployed US military populations. Viral -associated AGE is easily 
transmitted from human -to-human and can rapidly spread throughout an entire military unit causing widespread 
incapacitation often leading to disruption and reduction in operational readiness. NoV was found to be a major cause 
of AGE outbreaks and sporadic AGE cases among US military personnel deployed during the Persian Gulf War in 
1991 as well as coalition forces in Gulf War II, Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in 200 3. Similar outbreaks have been 
described in European military units deployed to these areas.  
AGE surveillance data collected over multiple seasons (2011 through 2014 ) from the Naval Health Research Center’s 
(NHRC) Enteric Disease Surveillance Program (EDSP) support that NoV was the predominant pathogen identified in 
cases of  AGE among US military  subjects at the Marine Corps Recruit  Depot (MCRD -SD) in San Diego, California , 
at the MCRD in Parris Island  (MCRD -PI), South Carolina,  and at the Naval Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes 
(NRTC‐GL), Illinois. AGE due to NoV was originally known as “winter vomiting disease”, and as expected, t he 
highest detection rate of AGE due to NoV was during the months of September to May for both Marine and Navy 
subjects. The estimated population -based inci dence of NoV illness at these training centers is 10 to 35 cases per 1000 
subjects during training (an average of 7.6 weeks) in  this high season (September -May).  
Currently, no vaccine exists for protection against AGE due to NoV. Given the disruptive effec t of AGE due to NoV 
upon military training, readiness and performance, it is important to develop an effective vaccine. Takeda has 
conducted two proof of concept NoV vaccine and live oral challenge studies; a monovalent GI.1 VLP vaccine 
delivered as intran asal dry powder followed by live NoV genotype GI.1 oral challenge and a bivalent GI.1/GII.4 
bivalent VLP vaccine delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by live NoV genotype GII.4 oral challenge. 
Both trials showed that the VLP based vaccines re duced severity of AGE due to the challenge viruses.  The more 
robust immunogenicity drove the decision to pursue the IM route of administration . 
The NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine for IM injection to be evaluated in this trial contains both NoV GI.1 an d 
NoV GII.4 VLPs as the antigens formulated with aluminum as aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH) 3) adjuvant. Aluminum 
salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety profile of over six decades. The GI.1 VLP represents a single GI.1 
strain and the GII.4 VLP consist s of a consensus sequence of three GII.4 strains (cVLP). NoV VLPs are non -infectious 
because they do not contain viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).  
Prior safety and immunogenicity data for the NoV vaccine given by the IM route are available from approximately  
1000 adult subjects, evaluated in five Takeda clinical trials (LV03 -104, LV03 -105, NOR -107, NOR -201, and 
NOR -210). The NoV vaccine evaluated in these trials either contained both Al(OH) 3 plus monophosphoryl lipid A

 trial withdrawal throughout the active AGE surveillance period.  
The 200 subjects in Subset A and 200 subjects in Subset B will be evaluated for solicited local and solicited systemic 
AEs for 7 day s after dosing using diary cards returned on or after Day 8 and for unsolicited AEs for 28 days after 
dosing by interview on or after Day 29.  
Surveillance for AGE:  
Each enrolled subject will have surveillance for AGE performed from Day 1 until the end of t he active AGE 
surveillance period  (Day 45). Each enrolled participant will be given an AGE symptom log at trial entry (Day 1) and 
instructed to record any AGE symptoms and report to the medical clinic as soon as possible  after onset of AGE 
symptoms . The su bjects will record on the AGE symptom log the onset time of vomiting  and/or  diarrhea, number of 
episodes of each, and the stop time of vomiting and/or diarrhea  to calculate duration  of AGE . Other symptoms 
associated with the AGE episode will also be record ed. 
Work -up AGE in ill subjects:  
At the medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to determine if they have an AGE that meets the work -up definition:  
 1 or more episodes of vomiting within 24 hours judged by the investigator as not related to the trainin g AND/OR;  
 Any diarrhea episode of 3 or greater severity on a 5 -point scale* within 24 hours . 
* Grade 1: fully formed (normal); Grade 2: soft (normal); Grade 3: thick liquid (diarrheal); Grade 4: opaque watery 
(diarrheal); or Grade 5: Rice -water (diarrheal) . 
Subjects who meet the work -up definition will provide a fresh stool specimen and vomitus  specimen (if available) for 
processing and later detection of NoV by RT -PCR  and be assessed for disease severity . Subjects will receive standard 
of care treatment f or AGE disease  from the site clinic  and additional AGE disease symptom logs will be given to 
record further AGE symptoms until resolution. Subjects will be instructed to return all subsequent AGE symptom logs 
to the trial staff at the next trial visit.  
NoV  AGE case definition in ill subjects:  
A case of NoV AGE is defined as one occurring > 7 days after immunization until the end of the active AGE 
surveillance period.  
A NoV  AGE case is defined as meeting the work -up definition plus a NoV positive stool sampl e or vomitus  sample 
confirmed by RT -PCR. In circumstances where both stool and vomitus  samples are obtained, the subject will be 
considered NoV positive if either specimen is confirmed NoV positive by RT -PCR.  
Severity of AGE is defined as follows:  
 
Mild   1 to 2 episodes of vomiting* within 24 hours AND/OR . 
 3 unformed stools** within 24 hours   
 
Moderate   3 to 5 episodes of vomiting* within 24 hours AND/OR  
 4 to 5 unformed stools** within 24 hours   
 
Severe   6 or more episodes of vomiting* within 24 hours AND/O R 
 6 or more unformed stools** within 24 hours AND/OR  
 Hospital admission and/or intravenous rehydration for mild or greater AGE   
*Judged by the investigator as not due to the training; uses the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) for vomiting 
episo des. 
**For definition purposes, unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity o f diarrhea on a 5 -point scale ( *noted  above).  
Notes : 
 “Within 24 hours” refers to a rolling time period. That is, the criteria will be considered to have been met if occurring during 
any 24 -hour period between the onset and end of AGE symptoms.  
 A new episode of vomiting is defined as one that occurs at least 5 minutes after the previous one.  
 A new episode of diarrhea is defined as ‘a trip to the toilet’.

 AGE were evaluated for t he period  from September 2011 to  September  2014. The expected background rate of NoV 
GI.1/GII.4 was calculated using three assumptions.  The incidence of NoV over the winter high season is the excess of 
AGE in the winter compared to the summer and can thus be calculated as the average weekly AGE incidence during 
the winter season minus the average weekly AGE incidence during the correspond ing summer season. The second 
assumption is that 50% of the NoV cases are due to GI.1/GII.4 that is compatible with the overall breakdown of the 
NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes identified by the CDC as the cause of NoV outbreaks reported to 
CDC over the same 2011 -2014 time period. The weekly incidence rates are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of 
training) to obtain the incidence rate over training and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that all 
subjects reporting to the  medical station are moderate or severe AGE  cases . 
The background incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype -specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV 
strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co -infection with  Salmonella , Shigella or Campylobact er) is assumed to  
be 0.5-1.7% per subject -training period of observation based on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned 
trial sites.  Under such attack rate assumptions, approximately 2800 -8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 ratio to NoV 
vaccine and sa line placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to NoV infection by 
genotype -specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains.  As this is a case -driven trial, subjects will continue to be enrolled and 
followed through the entire active AG E surveillance period until ~ 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to 
genotype -specific (GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, excluding co -infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be 
closed to further enrollment.  
Data Monitoring Committee:  
An overall D MC is established to evaluate overall safety of the NoV program on an ongoing basis. The DMC will 
review the safety and immunogenicity results to the NoV vaccine ( Subset A) and the results to the selected 
co-administered vaccines ( Subset A). The overall pr ogram DMC charter is a separate document.

In case of AGE: 
(a) During the AGE surveillance period (Day 1 through Day 45), those subjects, who present with AGE, will be instructed to record their AGE symptoms on the logs and report for 
assessment at the next trial visit . Initial AGE symptom logs will be given at trial entry to record AGE symptoms. Subjects will be instructed to return any subsequent logs and the 
latest AGE symptom log at the next trial visit. 
(b) For those subjects who present with AGE, a stool specimen and a vomitus specimen (vomitus if available) will be collected as soon as possible after the onset of each new 
episode of AGE for processing and subsequent RT-PCR testing. If no samples are provided at AGE onset, samples should be obtained as soon as possible thereafter. If samples 
at AGE onset are inadequate ie too small for both RT-PCR to NoV and co-infection tests, the sample should be prioritized for RT-PCR to NoV and a subsequent sample should 
be obtained for co- infection testing as soon as possible thereafter. If samples become lost, destroyed, damaged or otherwise unavailable for use, AGE onset samples should be 
repeated as soon as possible. After the initial stool specimen is obtained at the onset of AGE; up to three additional stool specimens (optional), will be obtained once between 7 
and 14 days, once between 21 and 29 days and once at EOS. The onset of AGE is defined as the date the subject initially presents with vomiting and diarrhea. 
(c) For those subjects who present with AGE, a convalescent blood sample of 5 – 10 mL of blood will be collected once between 7 and 14 days after the onset of each new episode 
of AGE, defined as the date the subject initially presents with vomiting or diarrhea.

 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background 
Nor
oviruses (NoVs) cause an acute debilitating illness characterized by vomiting and diarrhea [3]. 
Acc
ording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 21 million cases of acute 
gastroenteritis (AGE) are due to NoV each year in the United States (US) [4, 5] . NoVs have 
e
merged as an important cause of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. These outbreaks 
can occur in all age groups, wherever people gather, and commonly result in significant morbidity 
and mortality, particularly in the very old and very young [6, 7] . In addition, NoV illnesses and 
outbre
aks exact a significant socioeconomic toll on businesses, hospitals, schools and other closed 
settings, such as dormitories and military barracks. 
AGE is commonly reported within training and deployed US military populations [8-13] . 
Viral
-associated AGE is easily transmitted from human- to-human and can rapidly spread 
throughout an entire military unit causing widespread incapacitation often leading to disruption 
and reduction in operational readiness. NoV was found to be a major cause of AGE outbreaks and 
sporadic AGE cases among US military personnel deployed during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 
[13] as well as coalition forces in Gulf War II, Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in 2003 . Similar 
outbreaks have been described in European military units deployed to these areas. 
AGE surveillance data collected over multiple seasons (2011 through 2014) from the Naval Health 
Re
search Center’s (NHRC) Enteric Disease Surveillance Program (EDSP) support that NoV was 
the predominant pathogen identified in cases of AGE among US military subjects at the Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD- SD) in Sa n Diego, California, at the MCRD in Parris Island 
(MCRD-PI), South Carolina, and at the Naval Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes 
(NR
TC‐GL), Illinois. AGE due to NoV was originally known as “winter vomiting disease”, and as 
expected, the highest detection rate of AGE due to NoV was during the months of September to 
May for both Marine and Navy subjects. The estimated population-based incidence of NoV illness 
at these training centers is 10 to 35 cases per 1000 subjects during training (an average of 7.6 
we
eks) in this high season (September-May) [communication from NHRC-EDSP]. 
Currently, no vaccine exists for protection against AGE due to NoV
. Given the disruptive effect of 
AGE due to NoV upon military training, readiness and performance, it is important to develop an 
effective vaccine. Takeda has conducted two proof of concept NoV vaccine and live oral challenge 
studies; a monovalent GI.1 VLP vaccine delivered as intranasal dry powder followed by live NoV 
genotype GI.1 oral challenge [14-18] and a bivalent GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine delivered by 
int
ramuscular (IM) injection followed by live NoV genotype GII.4 oral challenge [19, 20] . Both 
tria
ls showed that the VLP based vaccines reduced severity of AGE due to the challenge viruses. 
The more robust immunogenicity drove the decision to pursue the IM route of administration. 
The NoV
 GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine for IM injection to be evaluated in this trial contains 
both NoV GI
.1 and NoV GII.4 VLPs as the antigens formulated with aluminum as aluminum 
hydroxide (Al(OH) 3) adjuvant. Aluminum salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety profile 
of over six decades [21].  The GI.1 VLP represents a single GI.1 strain and the GII.4 VLP consists

 of a consensus sequence of three GII.4 strains (cVLP). NoV VLPs are non-infectious because they 
do not contain viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). 
Prior safety and immunogenicity data for the NoV vaccine given by the IM route are available 
from approximately 1000 adult subjects, evaluated in five Takeda clinical trials (LV03-104 [20] , 
LV03
-105 [19] , NOR-107, NOR-201, and NOR-210). The NoV vaccine evaluated in these trials 
e
ither contained both Al(OH) 3 plus monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants combined or the 
Al(OH) 3 a
djuvant alone. In clinical trials with the NoV vaccine, a single suspected unexpected 
serious a
dverse reaction (SUSAR) was reported, and to date, no other serious adverse events 
(SAEs) related to the vaccine were reported in these trials. Trial NOR-107 conducted in adults 
aged 18-64 years, a Phase II dosage, adjuvant justification, safety, and immunogenicity trial, 
evaluated 11 vaccine formulations, and showed that the N
oV VLP vaccine adjuvanted with 
aluminum as Al(OH) 3 adjuvant was as immunogenic as the NoV VLP vaccine adjuvanted with 
Al(OH) 3 a
nd MPL combined. 
Re
fer to the current Investigator Brochure of Takeda’s NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine for 
additional product information and a more detailed review of pre-clinical and clinical studies [22]. 
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Trial 
NoV
 outbreaks seriously impact military and civilian adult populations. Surveillance studies 
conducted over multiple years have demonstrated a consistently high incidence of NoV-related 
illness 
among US military subjects. Moreover, the success of a recent adenovirus vaccine efficacy 
(VE) trial in military subjects further supports the selection of the population for this trial [23]. The 
primary goal of this Phase 2b clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the NoV vaccine against 
modera
te or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV 
strains 
in 2800-8700 healthy US military adult subjects. Specifically, this trial will inform whether 
the NoV va
ccine will provide protection against circulating NoV strains. Data from this trial will 
further
 inform the clinical development plan for Phase 3 of the NoV vaccine. 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International Conference on 
Harmoniza
tion and Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines, 21 Code of Federal 
Re
gulations (CFR) Part 56 & 50, and applicable regulatory requirements.

Work-up for AGE in ill subjects: 
At the medical clinic, the subject will be assessed to determine if they have an AGE that meets the 
work-up definition: 
 1 or more episodes of vomiting within 24 hours judged by the investigator as not related to the 
tra
ining AND/OR; 
 Any diarrhea episode of 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on a 5-point scale* within 24 hours. 
* Grade 1: full
y formed (normal); Grade 2: soft (normal); Grade 3: thick liquid (diarrheal); 
Grade 4: opaque watery (diarrheal); or Grade 5: Rice-water (diarrheal) (Appendix E] . 
Subjects who meet the work-up definition will provide a fresh stool specimen, and vomitus  
specimen (if available) for processing and later detection of NoV by RT-PCR and be assessed for 
disease
 severity. Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease from the site 
clinic and additional AGE disease symptom logs will be given to record further AGE symptoms 
until resolution. Subjects will be instructed to return all subsequent AGE symptom logs to the trial 
staff at the next trial visit.

 NoV  AGE case definition in ill subjects: 
 A case of NoV AGE is defined as one occurring > 7 days after immunization until the end 
of the
 active AGE surveillance period. 
 A NoV AGE case is defined as meeting the work-up definition plus a NoV positive stool 
sample or vomitus  sample confirmed by RT-PCR. In circumstances where both stool and 
vomitus  sa
mples are obtained, the subject will be considered NoV positive if either 
spec
imen is confirmed NoV positive by RT-PCR. 
Severity of AGE is defined as follows: 
Mild   1 to 2 episodes of vomitinga within 24 hours AND/OR . 
 3 unformed stoolsb within 24 hours  
Moderate   3 to 5 episodes of vomitinga within 24 hours AND/OR  
 4 to 5 unformed stoolsb within 24 hours  
Severe   6 or more episodes of v omitinga within 24 hours AND/OR  
 6 or more unformed stoolsb within 24 hours AND/OR  
 Hospital admission and/or intravenous rehydration for mild or greater AGE  
(a) Judged by the investigator as not due to the training; uses the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) for vomiting 
episodes. 
(b) For definition purposes, unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on a 5-point scale (*noted 
above). 
Notes: “Within 24 hours” refers to a rolling time period. That is, the criteria will be considered to have been met if occurring during 
any 24-hour period between the onset and end of AGE symptoms. 
A new episode of vomiting is defined as one that occurs at least 5 minutes after the previous one. 
A new episode of diarrhea is defined as ‘a trip to the toilet’. 
6.2 Justification for Trial Design, Dose, and Endpoints 
NoV
 outbreaks seriously impact military adult populations; this justifies the selection of th is 
population for the trial. 
Data generated to date with Takeda’s NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccin e administered by IM 
injection from several Phase I or II studies (LV03-104, NOR -107 and NOR-201) with various 
dosages of antigen (see IB), show that peak immune responses were observed 8 days after the first 
dose, with a second dose given 28 days later having only a limited effect. Thus, a single dose 
regimen will be evaluated in the present trial. The aluminum concentration per dose was selected 
empirically from data that demonstrated that this amount of aluminum enhanced the 
immunogenicity of the vaccine [21] . Aluminum salt-based adjuvants have a demonstrated safety 
prof
ile of over six decades [21] . Each dose (0.5 mL) delivers 15 μg of GI.1 NoV VLP, 50 μg of 
GII.4 NoV VLP (consensus of 3 strains), and 500 μg of aluminum as Al(OH) 3). Approximately 
1000 subj
ects have received the NoV bivalent vaccine by IM injection and all doses contained the 
Al(OH) 3 adjuvant.

 The U. S. Military administers multiple licensed vaccines to protect enlisted recruits in basic 
training (Appendix D). The immunogenicity of the co-administration of those vaccines on the 
same da
y with the NoV vaccine has not previously been assessed. The collection of solicited and 
unsolicited symptoms following these vaccinations is consistent with other vaccine evaluation 
studie
s. The se data will be provided to the DMC for their review. (Refer to Section 13.2. Interim 
Anal
ysis) 
Enrollment will begin prior to or during the NoV high season (between September and May). If the 
number of AGE cases due to NoV has not been reached by the end of the first season (end of May), 
enrollment may be continued if more AGE cases are actively accruing later in the current season, 
may be stopped due to the lower incidence of NoV infection, and/or may be continued the 
following S
eptember (second season). This duration corresponds to the window of time during 
which ~ 30 AGE cases due to NoV (GI.1/GII
.4 or any NoV genogroup GI or GII strain) will occur. 
The AGE disease severity definitions are based on the proceedings of the External Clinical Expert 
meeting: NoV vaccine Phase 3 efficacy trial designs working session (internal document) and 
CTCAE 
Version 4.0 [26]. Unformed stools are those meeting a 3 or greater severity of diarrhea on 
a

has 
been described [27] and v omitus  specimens will also be evaluated when collected in addition to 
the stool specimens. 
6.3 Duration of Subject’s Expected Participation in the Entire Trial 
Tr
ial participation is expected to be from enrollment through EOS (trial Day 45). 
6.4 Premature Termination or Suspension of Trial or Investigational Site 
6.4.1
 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Trial 
The
 trial will be completed as planned unless one or more of the following criteria are satisfied that 
require temporary suspension or early termination of the trial. 
 New information or other evaluation regarding the safety or efficacy of the investigational 
vaccine that indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile, such that the risk/benefit is no 
longer acceptable for subjects participating in the trial. 
 Significant deviation from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to 
a
chieve the primary trial objectives or compromises subject safety. 
6.4.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites 
A trial site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the investigator) is 
found in si
gnificant deviation from GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
ade
quate performance of the trial, or as otherwise permitted by the contractual agreement.

 7.3 Criteria for Delay of Vaccination and/or Blood Sampling 
After enrollment, subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that warrant a delay in the 
administration of trial vaccination. These situations are listed below. In the event that a subject 
meets a criterion for delay of vaccination, the subject may receive trial vaccination once the 
window for delay has passed as long as the subject is otherwise eligible for trial participation. 
 Subjects who have received antipyretics/analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to the 
int
ended vaccine administration. 
 If the investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the routine immunizations required 
by the US military are given, the trial dose may be administered later during the training 
period. 
7.4 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject 
The prima
ry reason for discontinuation or withdrawal of the subject from the trial should be 
recorded in the [electronic] case report form (eCRF) using the following categories. For screen 
failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.14 . 
1. Protocol deviation : The  subject may remain in the trial unless continuation in the trial 
jeopardizes the subject’s health, safety or rights. 
2. Adverse Event: The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because 
c
ontinued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health or the subject is 
unwilling to continue because of the AE. 
3. Lost to follow-up: The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
we
re unsuccessful an d/or the subject graduated and left the base. Attempts to contact the 
subj
ect must be documented. 
4. Withdrawal by subject: The subject wishes to withdraw from the trial. The reason for 
withdra
wal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal 
and, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded ( ie, withdrawal due 
to an AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category). 
5. Trial terminat ed by sponsor. 
6.
 Pregnancy: Any subject who, despite the requirement for adequate contraception, becomes 
pre
gnant during the trial will not receive further trial vaccines. The site should maintain contact 
with the pregnant subject and complete a “Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form” as soon as possible. 
In addition, the subject should be followed-up until the birth of the child, or spontaneous or 
voluntary termination; when pregnancy outcome information becomes available, the 
information should be captured using the same form. The subject should be reported as a 
withdrawal from trial and the reason for withdrawal ( eg pregnancy) recorded in detail on the 
Trial Termination” eCRF and subject’ medical records.

 7. Other. 
Note: The specific reasons should be recorded in the “specify” field of the eCRF. 
7.5 Procedures for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject 
The
 investigator may discontinue or withdraw a subject’s trial participation at any time during the 
trial when the subject meets the trial termination criteria described in Section 7.4. In addition, a 
subject may discontinue his or her participation without giving a reason at any time during the 
trial. Should a subject’s participation be discontinued, the primary criterion for termination must 
be recorded, if possible. Subjects who withdraw from the trial or whose participation is 
discontinue
d should be followed-up for safety. Discontinued or withdrawn subjects will not  be 
replac
ed.

 day. Temperature excursions must be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible and use of these 
vaccines requires sponsor approval. 
8.1.3 Dose and Regimen 
S
ubjects will receive on Day 1 either one dose of the NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or 
sali
ne placebo according to their random assignment. 
Routi
ne vaccinations will be sourced and administered by and per US military procedures. (Refer 
to Appendix D.  
8.2 Trial Vaccine Assignment and Dispensing Procedures 
The
 investigator or investigator’s designee will access the IRT within 7 days prior to or on Day 1 to 
obtain the subject num
ber. Details of randomization and the IRT will be covered in the IRT user 
manual.
 
The investigator or investigator’s designee will utilize the IRT to randomize the subject into the 
trial
, including assignment into the subsets. During this contact, the investigator or designee will 
provide the necessary subject identifying information. 
The trial dose identification number to be administered will be assigned by the IRT. 
The 
vaccination will be administered by the unblinded designee according to the instructions in the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Each subject will receive either 1 trial dose of NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or saline 
place
bo on Day 1. The NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine or saline placebo will be 
admi
nistered by IM injection in to the middle third of the deltoid muscle. 
If
 sponsor-supplied vaccine is lost or damaged, the site can request a replacement from the IRT. 
Expired vaccines must not be administered. 
The investi
gator or designee will be responsible for overseeing the administration of trial doses to 
subjects enrolled in the trial according to the procedures stipulated in this trial protocol. All trial 
doses 
will be administered only by unblinded personnel who are qualified to perform that function 
under applicable laws and regulations for that specific trial. 
PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADMINISTERING THE TRIAL VACCINE : 
Prior to vaccination, a subject must be determined to be eligible for trial vaccination and it must be 
clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. Eligibility for vaccination 
prior to administration is determined by evaluating the entry criteria outlined in this protocol 
(Sections 7.1 and 7.2).  
Eligibi
lity for subsequent trial procedures is determined by following the criteria outlined in 
Section 7.0.  
Trial vaccines should not be administered to individuals with known hypersensitivity to any 
component of the vaccines.

Trial No. NOR -211 Page 59 of 103 
Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 Standard immunization practices are to be observed and care should be taken to administer the 
injection intramuscularly into the middle third of the deltoid muscle. Before administering the 
vaccine, the vaccination site is to be disinfected with a skin disinfectant ( eg, 70% alcohol). Allow 
the skin to dry. DO NOT inject intravascularly. 
As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appropriate medical treatment 
should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following vaccination. For example, 
epinephrine 1:1000, diphenhydramine, and/or other medications for treating anaphylaxis should 
be available. 
8.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage 
Ra
ndomization personnel of the sponsor or designee will generate the randomization schedule(s). 
Randomization information will be stored in a secured area, accessible only by authorized 
personnel. 
8.4 Trial Vaccine Blind Maintenance 
The
 trial vaccine blind will be maintained by the unblinded designee. 
8.5 Unblinding Procedure 
The
 trial vaccine blind shall not be broken by the investigator unless information concerning the 
trial vaccine is necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. In the event of a medical 
emergency, if possible, the medical monitor should be contacted before the trial vaccine blind is 
broken to discuss the need for unblinding. 
For unblinding a subject, the trial vaccine blind can be obtained by the investigator, by accessing 
the IRT. 
The sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department must be notified as soon as possible if the trial 
vac
cine blind is broken by the investigator. Notably, the completed unblinding form must be sent 
within 24 hour
s. The date, time, and reason the blind is broken must be recorded in the source 
document and the same information (except the time) must be recorded on the eCRF. 
If a subject is unblinded, the subject must be withdrawn from the trial. Subjects withdrawn from 
the tria
l due to unblinding should be followed for safety to the end of trial. Further details for 
dea
ling with safety follow-up for subjects withdrawn from the trial will be provided. 
8.6 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor-Supplied Vaccine(s) 
Va
ccine supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned to the sponsor or 
designee as noted below. Sites will maintain source documents in addition to entering data in the 
IRT. 
The investi
gator or designee must ensure that the sponsor-supplied vaccine is used in accordance 
with the approved protocol and is administered only to subjects enrolled in the trial. To document 
approp
riate use of sponsor-supplied vaccine(s) (NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine and saline

 placebo), the investigator must maintain records of all sponsor-supplied vaccine delivery to the 
site, site inventory, administration and use by each subject, and return to the sponsor or designee. 
Upon receipt of sponsor-supplied vaccine(s), the investigator or designee must verify the contents 
of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantity is correct, the 
trial vaccine is received within the labeled storage conditions ( ie no cold chain break has occurred 
during transit), and is in good condition. If quantity and conditions are acceptable, investigator or 
designee will acknowledge receipt of the shipment by recording in IRT. 
If 
there are any discrepancies between the packing list and the actual product received, the sponsor 
or desig
nee must be contacted to resolve the issue. The packing list should be filed in the 
investig
ator’s essential document file. 
The investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor-supplied vaccines (including 
placebo) received and administered during his or her entire participation in the trial. Proper 
vaccine accountability includes, but is not limited to: 
 Verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory. 

 Verifying that the log is completed for the vaccine dose identification number used to prepare 
ea
ch dose. 
 Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log. 

 Verifying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly. 
I
f any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately. 
The investigator must record the current inventory of all sponsor-supplied vaccines [(NoV 
GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine and saline placebo) in a sponsor-approved vaccine accountability 
log. The following information will be recorded as a minimum: protocol number and title, name of 
investigator, site identifier and number, description of sponsor-supplied vaccine(s), expiry date 
and amount. The IRT will include all required information as a separate entry for each subject to 
whom sponsor-
supplied vaccine is administered. 
The investigator will be notified of any expiry date or retest date extension of clinical trial material 
during the trial conduct if applicable. On expiry date notification from the sponsor or designee, the 
site must complete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of expired 
clinical trial material for return to the sponsor or its designee for destruction. 
Prior
 to site closure or at appropriate intervals throughout the trial, before any clinical trial 
materials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction, a representative from the 
sponsor or its designee will perform clinical trial material accountability and reconciliation. The 
investigator will retain a copy of the documentation regarding clinical trial material accountability, 
return, and/or destruction, and originals will be sent to the sponsor or designee. 
The pharmacist (or designated individual) at each site will be responsible for vaccine 
accountability and will document receipt, use, return, or destruction. Vaccine accountability 
documenta
tion will be reviewed by the monitor during clinical monitoring visits.

 9.0 TRIAL PLAN 
9.1 Trial Procedures 
The
 following sections describe the trial procedures and data to be collected. For each procedure, 
subjects are to be assessed by the same investigator or site personnel whenever possible. The 
Schedule of Trial Procedures is located in Section  2.1. 
9.1.1 Screening Interview 
W
ithin the first few days after entry into the recruit training facilities, subject groups will be given 
a brief description of the trial. The trial will be introduced and explained by a trial staff member. A 
visual aid/video may be used. Subjects will be asked if they are interested to participate in the trial. 
If so, the subjects will undergo a screening interview. Notably, the screening interview will be 
performed by non-uniformed trial staff not involved in the training of the subjects to avoid any 
fee
ling of coercion [28] . Subjects may receive the routine immunizations required by the US 
mi
litary, before or after the screening interview. No flyers, emails or posters are planned to recruit 
potential trial subjects. 
9.1.2 Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
Elig
ibility by review of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be documented after informed consent 
(see Section 9.1.3) and before randomization (Refer to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 ). 
9.1.3 In formed Consent 
If the subject is interested to participate, trial staff will review the informed consent form and will 
highli
ght the key aspects of the trial. The consenting procedure may occur in small groups of up to 
three subjects at once. Notably, this procedure will be handled by non-uniformed trial staff not 
involve
d in the training of the subjects to avoid any feeling of coercion, and also include an 
Ombudsman [28].  
The re
quirements of the informed consent are described in Section 15.2 and  Appendix C.  
I
nformed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering into the trial, and before any 
protocol-directed procedures are performed. The informed consent may be obtained within 7 days 
prior to vaccination or on Day 1. 
A unique subj
ect number (screening number) will be assigned to each subject after informed 
consent is obtained from the IRT . If all eligibility criteria are fulfilled, this subject number will 
become the definitive subject number and will be used throughout the trial. Subject numbers 
assigned to subjects who fail screening should not be reused (Section 9.1.14) . 
9.1.4 Demographics, Medical History and Prior Medications 
De
mographic information to be obtained will include date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race as 
described by the subject.

 Medical History will also be collected, including but not limited to any medical history that may be 
relevant to subject eligibility for trial participation such as prior vaccinations, concomitant 
medications, and previous and ongoing illnesses or injuries. Relevant medical history can also 
include any medical history that contributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs during trial 
participation, if it represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting problem. 
Adverse medical occurrences that occur after the subject signs the informed consent form but 
before administration of the trial dose, are to be documented in the Medical History. 
All me
dications, vaccines and blood products including the duration thereof, taken or received by 
the subj
ects within 3 months prior to the start of the trial are to be recorded on the source document 
and e
ntered onto the Prior and Concomitant Medications eCRF. The use of antipyretics and/or 
analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to vaccination must be identified and the reason for 
their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) must be described in the source documents or the eCRF. 
Medications taken for prophylaxis are those intended to prevent the onset of AEs following 
vaccination. Medications taken for treatment are intended to reduce or eliminate the presence of 
symptoms that are present. 
These data must be written in the source documents. 
Prohibited Therapies (and see also Sections 7.2 and 7.3 ): 

 Parenteral Ig preparation, blood products, and/or plasma derivatives within 3 months of trial 
vac
cination; 
 Immunosuppressive therapy within 3 months or systemic ( eg, oral or parenteral) corticosteroid 
treatment within 60 days prior to trial dose administration; 
Re
ceipt of any vaccine within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days (for live vaccines) 
prior to enr
ollment in this trial with the exception of routine immunizations as per Military 
Proc
edures (see  Appendix D ). If the investigational trial dose is delayed beyond the day the 
licensed vaccines are given, the trial dose may be subsequently administered later during the 
training period. 
Medical history (including corresponding medication) to be obtained will include any significant 
conditions or diseases that have disappeared or resolved at or prior to signing of informed consent. 
9.1.5 Documentation of Trial Entrance/Randomization 
Onl
y subjects who have signed the informed consent form, meet all of the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for entrance/randomization into the vaccination phase. 
The list of randomization assignments is produced by the unblinded statistician and processed by 
IRT. 
If
 the subject is found to be not eligible for randomization/trial phase, the investigator should 
record the primary reason for failure on the subject enrollment log.

 9.1.6 Physical Examination 
Subjects have already undergone physical examination per Military Entrance Processing. Entry 
criteria will be based on investigator judgment and by review of the subject’s medical history. 
9.1.7 Assessment of HBGA Secretor Status 
A sa
liva specimen will be collected once during the trial (at any time pre- or post-vaccination) 
from subjects in Subset A for assessment of HBGA secretor status. 
9.1.8 AGE Disease Surveillance  
A
ll subjects will have surveillance for AGE disease performed from Day 1 until the end of the 
active AGE disease surveillance period (Day 45). All participants will be given an AGE disease 
symptom log and a thermometer at trial entry within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 1 and 
inst
ructed to record their AGE disease symptoms and report to the medical clinic as soon as 
possible. The subjects will record in the AGE disease symptom log the onset time of vomiting 
and/or diarrhea, their temperature, the number of episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea, and the 
stop time of vomiting and/or diarrhea to calculate duration of AGE. The subjects will also 
document whe
ther the symptom(s) have had impact on their ability to train. The subjects will be 
instructed to use the provided thermometers to measure and record their temperature on the AGE 
disease
 symptom log. The subjects will be informed that the recommended route to take their 
tempera
ture is oral and instructed to use this route . At the medical clinic, the subject will be 
assessed to determine if they have an AGE disease that meets the work -up definition (see 
Section  6.1). Subjects who meet the work-up definition will be assessed for disease severity and 
provide a
 stool specimen and vomitus  specimen for processing and later detection of NoV by 
RT-P
CR. Subjects will only provide vomitus  specimen if actively vomiting. All initial stool 
sampl
es for each new onset episode of AGE will be analyzed for the following three enteric 
pathogens: Salmonella , Shigella , and Campylobacter . 
Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for AGE disease, and a new AGE disease 
symptom log will be given to record AGE disease symptoms until they resolve. Subjects will be 
instructed to return the latest AGE and any subsequent disease symptom log to the trial site at the 
nex
t trial visit. A convalescent blood specimen for serology will be obtained once between 7 and 
14 da
ys after the onset of the AGE disease. After the initial stool specimen obtained at the onset of 
AGE disease: as available, three additional stool specimens will be obtained once between 7 and 
14 days, once between 21 and 29 days and once at EOS. These follow-on stool specimens will be 
ana
lyzed for NoV by RT-PCR. If an AGE event occurs within 7 days prior to the EOS visit 
(Day 45), a convalescent serum sample and a single optional stool sample should be collected at 
the EO
S visit. There is no further follow-up for AGE after graduation from recruit training at Day 
45. 
9.1.9 Id entification of Co-pathogens in Stool of Each Subject with New Onset AGE 
The initial stool specimen obtained from each subject with new onset of AGE will be evaluated for 
the following enteric pathogens: Salmonella , Shigella , and Campylobacter . Because the true cause

 abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow-up should occur even if the 
intended duration of safety follow-up for the trial has ended. 
Any pregnancy occurring following trial vaccine administration should be reported immediately, 
using a pregnancy notification form, to the contact listed in the Investigator Site File. 
Should the pregnancy occur after administration of a blinded trial vaccine, the investigator must 
inform the subject of their right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses to receive 
unblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken by the investigator and 
proce
dures must be followed as described in Section 8.5. 
9.1.14 Doc
umentation of Subjects who are not Randomized 
Investigators must account for all subjects who sign an informed consent. If the subject is found to 
be not eligible at this visit, the investigator should complete the eCRF. The IRT should be 
contacted as a notification of non-randomi
zation. 
The primary reason for non-randomization is recorded in the eCRF using the following categories: 
 Screen failure (did not meet one or more inclusion criteria or did meet one or more exclusion 
c
riteria), 
 Withdrawal by subject, 
 Trial terminated by sponsor. 
S
ubject numbers assigned to subjects who fail scr
eening should not be reused. 
9.2 Monitoring Subject Treatment Compliance 
The
 investigator will record all injections of trial vaccine given to the subject in the eCRF. 
9.3 Schedule of Observations and Procedures 
The
 schedule for all trial-related procedures for all evaluations is shown in Section 2.1. 
Assessm
ents should be completed at the designated visit/time point(s). 
9.3.1 Screening Procedures (With in 7 Days Prior to Vaccination or On Day 1) 
1. Informed consent (Section 9.1.3; Appendix C ) . 
2. De mographics. 
a. Concomitant medications and vaccinations.  
b. Medical history. 
3. Review of systems: Review of systems is a structured interview that queries the subject as to 
any complaints the subject has experienced across each organ system. 
4. Assessment of eligibility criteria.

 5. The site should schedule the next trial activity; 
6. The subject will receive a written reminder of the next planned trial activity. 
9.3.2
 Vaccination Procedures (Within 7 Days Prior to Vaccination or On  Day 1)  
 Prior to vaccination: 

 Confirm eligibility. Refer to Sections 7.1 and 7.2;  
 Perform a urine or serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child-bearing potential. Refer to 
S
ection  9.1.13. The pregnancy test must be done within 72 hours prior to vaccination. If more 
than 72 hours ha
ve elapsed prior to vaccination, the pregnancy test must be repeated by either 
method. 
 If the subject meets all eligibility criteria: 

 Randomize subject. Refer to Section 9.1.5;  

 Collect data on concomitant medications and vaccinations. Refer to Section  9.1.4;  
 Collect blood specimen once within 7 days prior to vaccination or on Day 1. Refer to 
Se
ction s 9.1.10 and 9.1.11. Blood should be taken from the subject using an aseptic 
venipunctur
e technique. Refer to the detailed collection and handling procedures outlined 
in the Manual of Study Procedures. 
 Collect saliva specimen once at any time during the trial from subjects in Subset A. 
 Provide diary cards for subjects in Subsets A and B. 

 Careful training of the subject on how to measure local AEs and body temperature, how to 
c
omplete the diary card and how often to complete the diary card. Training of the subject 
on how to measure an injection site AE should be performed while the subject is under 
observation after vaccination. 
Diary card instructions must include the following: 
 The subject must understand that timely completion of the diary card on a daily basis is a 
c
ritical component of trial participation. The subject should also be instructed to write 
clearly and to complete the diary card in pen. Any corrections to the diary card should 
include a single strikethrough line with a brief explanation for any change and be initialed 
and dated. 
Please note: 
Diary cards will be the only source document allowed for remote collection of solicited local and 
systemic AEs (including body temperature measurements). The following additional rules apply 
to the documentation of safety information collected by diary card: 
 The Diary Card should be reviewed with the subject.

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
  No corrections or additions to the diary card will be allowed after it is reviewed with the 
investigator/designee. 
 Any data that is identified as implausible or incorrect, and confirmed by the subject to be a 
transcription error should be corrected by the subject on the diary card (the correction 
should include a single strikethrough line and should be initialed and dated by the subject). 
 Any blank or illegible fields on the diary card not otherwise corrected as above will be 
mi
ssing in the eCRF. 
 The site must enter all readable entries on the diary card into the eCRF. 
 Any newly described solicited safety information should be added to the diary card by the 
subj
ect and initialed and dated. Any new unsolicited safety information would be recorded 
in the subject source document as a verbally reported event and therefore captured as an 
AE and recorded in the AE eCRF. 
 Starting on the day of vaccination, the subject will check for specific types of events at the 
inj
ection site (solicited local AEs), any specific generalized symptoms (solicited systemic 
AEs), body temperature (by any method with oral route recommended), any other symptoms 
or c
hange in the subject’s health status, and any medications taken. The subjects will be 
informed that the recommended route to take their temperature is oral and will be instructed to 
use this route. These solicited AEs and body temperature will be recorded in the diary daily for 
7 days. Assessments should preferably take place in the evening at day’s end. 
 Temperature measurement is to be performed using the thermometer provided by the site. 
I
f the subject feels unusually hot or cold during the day, the subject should check their 
temperature. If the subject has fever, the highest body temperature observed that day 
should be recorded on the diary card. 
 The measurement of solicited local AEs (erythema, swelling, and induration) is to be 
pe
rformed using the ruler provided by the site. 
 The collection on the diary card of body temperature, solicited local AEs, and solicited 
systemic AEs will continue for a total of 7 days following vaccine administration. The 
diary
 cards will be collected and maintained in the trial records. The collection of 
unsolicited A
Es and medications will continue for 28 days following vaccine 
admi
nistration and be collected by interview.  
After
 vaccination, the subject will be observed for at least 15 minutes. Information should be 
re
corded in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. The investigator or delegate will take the 
opportunity to remind the subject how to measure solicited AEs and body temperature as part of 
this obser
vation period. All safety data will be collected in the subject’s source documents. 
 The subject will receive a written reminder of the next planned trial activity. The subject 
will
 be reminded to complete the Diary card daily and to contact the site if there are any 
questions and to contact the site immediately (or as soon as the subject is medically stable)

 10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1
 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a trial vaccine; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with trial 
vac
cine administrati
on. 
An AE
 can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of a trial 
vaccine whether or not it is considered related to the tria l vaccine. 
AEs will be graded by the investigator in the following manner: 
Mild  Grade 1   Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities. Relieved with or without symptomatic treatment . 
Moderate  Grade 2   Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity. Only 
partially relieved with symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  Grade 3   Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents  normal everyday activities. Not relieved with symptomatic treatment  
10.1.2 Solicited Adverse Events 
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety (Table 10.a) will be measured/collected for 
subje
cts included in Subset A. These will be summarized in the final report under the category 
“soli
cited adverse events” to differentiate them from other AEs which were not solicited. Any 
solicited local or systemic AE observed as continuing on Trial Day 8 will be recorded as an AE on 
the Adve
rse Event eCRF.

collected and recorded. The site staff will record the actual route taken on the CRF. The subjects will be informed 
that the recommended route to take their temperature is oral and will be instructed to use this route. 
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
1. Results in DEATH. 
2.
 Is LIFE THREATENING. 

 The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
ti
me of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY. 
5.
 Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT in the offspring of a subject. 
6.
 Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the following: 

 May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above. 

 May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
thre
atening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization. 
10.2 Causality of AEs 
 Relatedness (causality) to vaccine will also be assessed by the investigator. The relationship of 
ea
ch AE, including solicited systemic AEs (solicited local AEs are considered as related) to trial 
vaccine(s) will be assessed using the following categories: 
Related:  There is suspicion that there is a relationship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE (without determining the extent of probability); there is a reasonable 
possibility that the trial vaccine contributed to the AE.  
Not Related:  There is no suspicion that there is a relationship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE; there are other more likely causes and administration of the trial vaccine is 
not suspected to have contributed to the AE.  
10.2.1 Relationship to Trial Procedures 
Relationship (causality) to trial procedures should be determined for all AEs/SAEs. 
The re
lationship should be assessed as “Yes” if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibility that an event is due to a trial procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as “No”.

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 10.2.2 Outcome of AEs 
Resolved : The subje ct has fully recovered from the event or the condition has 
returned to the level observed at baseline  
Resolving : The event is improving but the subject is still not fully recovered  
Not resolved : The event is ongoing at the time of reporting and the subje ct has still not 
recovered  
Resolved with sequelae : As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 
disability/incapacity ( eg became blind, deaf or paralysed)  
Fatal:  The subject died due to the event. If the subject died due to othe r circumstances 
than the event, the outcome of the event per se should be stated otherwise ( eg 
Not Resolved or Resolving ) 
Unknown:  If outcome is not known or not reported.  
10.3 Additional Points to Consider for AEs 
An untoward occurrence generally may: 
 Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition. Intermittent 
e
vents for pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered as AEs. 
 Necessitate therapeutic intervention. 
 Require an invasive diagnostic procedure. 
 Require vaccine discontinuation or a change in concomitant medication. 

 Be considered unfavorable by the investigator for any reason. 
Dia
gnoses vs. signs and symptoms: 
 Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
a
bnormal laboratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded appropriately as AEs. 
Worsening of AEs: 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after starting administration of 
the 
trial vaccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition ( eg, “worsening 
of…”). 
 If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in trial 
va
ccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition ( eg, “worsening of…”).

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 Changes in severity of AEs: 
 If the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE, the event should be captured once with 
the ma
ximum severity recorded. 
Preplanned surgeries or procedures: 
 Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
infor
med consent are not considered AEs. Complications resulting from any planned surgery 
should be reported as AEs. 
Elec
tive surgeries or procedures: 
 Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
shoul
d not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the  subject’s source documents. 
Compl
ications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs. 
10.4 Procedures 
10.4.1
 Collection and Reporting of AEs 
Any unsolicited AEs (see Section s 9.1.12 and 10.1.1) for 28 days after the vaccination (including 
the day
 of vaccination) will be collected on or after Day 29 by interview of subjects in Subsets A 
and 
B. All findings for subjects in Subsets A and B experiencing AEs must also be reported in the 
subje
ct's medical records. 
All AEs, whether considered related with the use of the trial vaccine or not, must be monitored 
until symptoms subside and an
y abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline, or until 
there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full 
pathol
ogist’s report should be supplied, if possible. All findings must be reported on an AE eCRF 
or SAE form, as necessary. Reporting of SAEs and AEs that led to trial withdrawal from Day 29 
onwards w
ill be spontaneous or retrospectively collected at the end of the active AGE disease 
surveillance period. 
The following information will be documented for each event: 
 Reported term for the AE. 
 Start and end  date. 
 Serious (Y/N ). 
 Severity. 
 Investigator’s opinion of the causality (relationship) between the event and administration of 
trial 
vaccine(s) (“related” or “not related”). 
 I nvestigator’s opinion of the causality (relationship) to trial procedure(s), including the details 
of the suspected procedure.

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
  [If multiple doses] Action taken with the trial treatment (trial vaccine). 
 Outcome of event. 
10.4.2
 Collection and Reporting of Solicited AEs 
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety will be recorded on diary cards by the subjects 
included in Subsets A and B for 7 days after the vaccination (including the day of vaccination) and 
will be recorded on the “Local and Systemic Reactions” eCRF, as appropriate. Any solicited local 
or systemic AE observed as continuing on trial Day 8 will be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the 
AE eCRF. Any solicited local or systemic AE that resolved before Day 8 but recurred at a later 
time ( ie, is discontinuous), will be recorded as an unsolicited AE on the AE eCRF. 
Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria must be entered as an AE on the AE 
eCRF: 
 Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead the subject to withdraw from the trial. 
 Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead to the subject being withdrawn from the trial by the 
i
nvestigator. 
 Solicited local and systemic AEs that otherwise meet the definition of an SAE (see 
Section  10.1.3)  
10.4.3 Collec
tion and Reporting of SAEs 
Collection of SAEs will be collected by close monitoring from the time that the subject is 
administered the trial vaccine (Day 1) up to the end of the active AGE disease surveillance period 
(at Day 45). 
For all subjects, SAE reporting will be collected at the clinic visits on Days 8, 29, and EOS. Any 
ongoing SAEs at the end of the active AGE disease surveillance period will be followed in the 
electronic health databases and personnel medical records of those subjects who remain active in 
the military. 
SAEs should be reported according to the following procedure: 
A sponsor SAE form that is part of the Investigator Site File must be completed, in English,  and 
signe
d by the investigator immediately or within 24 hours of first onset or notification of the event. 
The information should be completed as fully as possible but contain, at a minimum: 
 A short description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious. 

 Subject identification number. 
 Investigator’s name. 
 Name of the trial vaccine(s) – if no unblinding is necessary, in a blinded way. 
 Causality assessment.

Trial No. NOR -211 Page 79 of 103 
Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 During the active AGE disease surveillance period, the SAE form should be transmitted within 24 
hours to the attention of the contact(s) in the list provided to each site. All findings in subjects 
ex
periencing SAEs must also be reported in the subject's medical records. In case of death, a full 
pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible 
10.5 Follow- up P rocedures 
10.5.1 AEs 
All AEs will be monitored until resolution or a stable status is reached or until a formal diagnosis 
can be made. AEs will not be monitored after the training has ended, unless deemed necessary by 
the sponsor
. 
10.5.2 S
AEs 
If information not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should complete a follow-up SAE form or provide other written documentation and 
fax it immediately within 24 hours of receipt. Copies of any relevant data from the hospital notes 
(eg, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the sponsor. 
All SAE
s should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or until 
otherwise
 explained. The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for 
the initial report. Ongoing SAEs at the end of trial visit will be followed by the Principal 
Investigator by
 review of the subject’s electronic health databases and personnel medical records. 
10.5.3 S
afety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities 
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for reporting to regulatory authorities, including 
investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) a
nd any other applicable SAEs reported up to the end of the active AGE disease 
surveillance period, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the trial is  
conduc
ted. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life-threatening events 
and 15 days for other SUSARs, unless otherwise required by national regulations. The sponsor 
will also prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where these might materially alter the 
current benefit-risk assessment of an investigational medicinal product or that would be sufficient 
to consider changes in the trial vaccine administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The 
investig
ational site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to their IRB or IEC in 
accordance with national regulations. 
10.5.4 P
ost-Trial Events 
Any
 SAE that occurs outside of the protocol-specified observation period or after the end of the 
trial but considered to be caused by the trial vaccine must be reported to the sponsor. These SAEs 
will 
be processed by the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department. Instructions for how to submit 
these SAEs will be provided in a handout in the Investigator Site File.

 12.0 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING 
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data Management Plan. 
AEs, SAEs, medical history, and concurrent conditions will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (system organ class (SOC), High Level Group 
Term (
HLGT), High Level Term (HLT), Low Level Term (LLT), Preferred Term ( PT), and their 
corresponding descriptive terms). Drugs will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug Dictionary. 
12.1 Electronic CRFs (eCRF) 
C
ompleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an informed consent. 
The sponsor or its designee will supply investigative sites with access to eCRFs. The sponsor will 
make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the e CRF . These eCRFs are used to 
transmi
t the information collected in the performance of this trial to the sponsor and regulatory 
authorit
ies. eCRFs must be completed in English. 
After completion of 
the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by sponsor 
personnel (or designees) and will be answered by the site. 
Corrections to eCRFs are recorded in an audit trail that captures the old information, the new 
information, identification of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, 
and the reason for change. 
The principal investigator or designee must review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and 
must sign and date the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the investigator must retain 
full responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all data entered on the eCRFs. 
eC
RFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptability at the trial site during periodic visits by 
trial monitors. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review a subject’s medical and 
hospital re
cords pertinent to the trial to ensure accuracy of the eCRFs. The completed eCRFs are 
the sole prop
erty of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmental health or regulatory authorities, 
without written permission of the sponsor. 
12.2 Record Retention 
The
 investigator agrees to keep the records stipulated in Section 12.0  and those documents that 
include (but are not limited to) the trial-specific documents, the identification log of all 
participating subjects, medical records. Temporary media such as thermal sensitive paper should 
be c
opied and certified, source worksheets, all original signed and dated informed consent forms, 
subject authorization forms regarding the use of personal health information (if separate from the 
informed consent forms), copies of eCRFs, including the audit trail, and detailed records of 
vac
cine disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities, the sponsor or its 
designees. Furthermore, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6 Section 4.9.5

 requires the investigator to retain essential documents specified in ICH E6 (Section 8) until at least 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application for a specified indication being 
investigated or, if an application is not  approved until at least 2 years after the investigation is 
discontinue
d and regulatory authorities are notified. In addition, ICH E6 Section 4.9.5 states that 
the tria
l records should be retained for an amount of time specified by applicable regulatory 
require
ments or for a time specified in the Clinical Study Site Agreement between the investigator 
and sponsor. 
Refer to the Clinical Study Site Agreement for the sponsor’s requirements on record retention. The 
investigator should contact and receive written approval from the sponsor before disposing of any 
such documents.

Trial No. NOR -211 Page 87 of 103 
Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 compatible with the overall breakdown of the NHRC genotype analysis and the NoV genotypes 
identified by the CDC as the cause of NoV outbreaks reported to CDC over the same 2011-2014 
time period. The weekly incidence rates are then multiplied by 7.6 (average length of training) to 
obtain the incidence rate over training and thus during the trial. There is a further assumption that 
all
 subjects reporting to the medical station are moderate or severe AGE cases. 
The ba
ckground incidence rate of moderate or severe NoV AGE due to genotype-specific (GI.1 
and GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine (excluding co-infection with Salmonella , 
Shigella or Campylobacter ) is assumed to be  0.5-1.7% per subject-training period of observation 
base
d on NHRC AGE NoV surveillance data at the planned trial sites. Under such attack rate 
assumptions, approximately 2800-8700 subjects, randomized in 1:1 ratio to NoV vaccine and 
sa
line placebo, would be needed to reach 30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to NoV 
infec
tion by genotype-specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains. As this is a case-driven trial, subjects 
will continue 
to be enrolled and followed through the entire active AGE surveillance period until ~ 
30 cases of moderate or severe AGE due to genotype-specific (GI.1or GII.4) NoV strains, 
excluding co-infection are confirmed. Thereafter, the trial will be closed to further enrollment.

 14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
14.1 Trial-Site Monitoring Visits 
Moni
toring visits to the trial site will be made periodically during the trial to ensure that all aspects 
of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data recorded 
on the e CRF s. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. The 
investigator and institution guarantee access to source documents by the sponsor or its designee 
(CRO) and by the IRB or IEC. 
All aspects of the trial and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or designee 
(as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s Binder, 
investigational trial dose, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, 
documentation of subject authorization to use personal health information (if separate from the 
informed consent forms), and review of e CRF s and associated source documents. It is important 
that the investigator and other trial personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
14.2 Protocol Deviations 
The
 investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to trial subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviation from protocol-specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the Responsible 
Medical Officer (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There 
will be no exemptions (a prospective approved deviation) from the inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections 
The
 trial site also may be subject to quality assurance audits by the sponsor or designees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor-designated auditor will contact the site in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory samples are collected, 
where
 the trial doses are stored and prepared, and any other facility used during the trial. In 
addit
ion, there is the possibility that this trial may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including 
those of for
eign governments ( eg, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the United 
Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Pharmaceuticals and 
Medical Devices Agency of Japan). If the trial site is contacted for an inspection by a regulatory 
body
, the sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator and institution guarantee 
access for quality assurance auditors to all trial documents as described in Section 14.1.

 15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF THE TRIAL 
This trial will be conducted with the highest respect for the individual participants ( ie, subje cts) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the trial according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her 
conduc
t in accordance with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in  Appendix A.  
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requirements for informed consent and investigator responsibilities. 
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval 
I
RBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable local or region al requirements of 
each participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and titles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has direct participation in this trial, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting 
must also be obtained. Those US sites unwilling to provide names and titles of all members due to 
privacy and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide Assurance 
Number or comparable number assigned by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, a copy of 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or advertisements 
and other documents required by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a 
central or local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the protocol and 
subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of the trial ( ie, before shipment of the sponsor-supplied Vaccine or trial specific 
scre
ening activity). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the trial by exact protocol title, number, 
and version date; identify versions of other documents ( eg, informed consent form) reviewed; and 
state the a
pproval date. The sponsor will notify the site once the sponsor has confirmed the 
adequacy of site regulatory documentation and, when applicable, the sponsor has received 
permission from the competent authority to begin the trial. Until the site receives notification no 
protocol ac
tivities, including screening may occur. 
Sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by their respective IRB or IEC. This may include 
notific
ation to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent 
form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by subjects, local safety reporting requirements, 
reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the trial at intervals specified by the 
respe

 15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization 
Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form, subject authorization form (if 
applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal health information for purposes of 
conducting the trial. The informed consent form and the subject information sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the trial, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the 
date informed consent are given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the 
partic
ipant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and 
without pre
judice to his or her further medical care. 
The investigator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
informed consent form and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use. 
The infor
med consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner 
deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally acceptable representative may 
provide such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
The subject must be given ample opportunity to: (1) inquire about details of the trial and (2) decide 
whether or not to participate in the trial. If the subject determines he or she will participate in the 
trial
, then the informed consent form and subject authorization form (if applicable) must be signed 
and dated by the subject at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the trial. The 
subje
ct should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black 
ballpoint ink. The investigator must also sign and date the informed consent form and subject 
authorization (if applicable) at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the trial ; 
however, the sponsor may allow a designee of the investigator to sign to the extent permitted by 
applicable law. 
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject information sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medica
l record and e CRF . Copies of  the signed informed consent form, the signed subject 
authorization form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) shall be given to 
the subjec
t. 
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by relevant subject in the same 
manner a
s the original informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be

Protocol Version 3.0 15 November 2017  
 
 recorded in the subject’s medical record and e CRF , and the subject should receive a copy of the 
re
vised informed consent form. 
15.3 Subject Confidentiality 
The
 sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy. Throughout this trial, a subject’s source data will only be linked to the 
sponsor’s clinical trial database or documentation via a unique identification number. As permitted 
by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, 
and subject initials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique 
identification number. 
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requires the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives from any 
regulatory authority ( eg, FDA, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, 
Pha
rmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the  
appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory test result reports, ECG reports, admission 
and discharge summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a subject’s trial participation, 
and a
utopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific 
authorization of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2).  
Copies of
 any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
persona
lly identifiable information removed ( ie, subject name, address, and other identifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s e CRF ). 
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy 
15.4.1
 Publication and Disclosure 
The results of this trial are expected to be published in a scientific journal. It is anticipated that 
clinical and laboratory co-investigators will participate in authorship. The order of authorship an d 
choice of journal will be determined by the PIs and the sponsor. The data analysis center for this 
trial will provide the analyses needed for publication. Information regarding this trial will be 
posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. 
15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration 
In order to ensure that information on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to 
comply with applicable law, regulation and guidance, the sponsor will, as a minimum register all 
cli
nical trials conducted in subjects that it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or 
other publicly accessible websites before trial initiation. The sponsor contact information, along 
with inve
stigator’s city, country, and recruiting status will be registered and available for public 
viewing.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA009002
Protocol Title:  A Phase 1/2a Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study for Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
BMS-986156 Administered Alone and in Combination with Nivolumab  (BMS-936558, anti PD-1 Monoclonal 
Antibody) in Advanced Solid Tumors.
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):  
BMS-986156 (anti-GITR antibody) is supplied as a sterile 10 mg/m L formulation to be administered as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion. Nivolumab (BMS-936558, an anti-PD-1 antibody) is available as a sterile 10 mg/mL formulation to be 
administered as an IV infusion.
Each subject will be administered IV doses of BMS-986156 per the cohort assignment as follows:
In Part A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned dose level s for BMS-986156 are 10, 30 , 100, 240, a nd 800 mg 
once every 2 weeks (Q2W), in 8-week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy.
In Part B, combin ation therapy dose escalation, the planned dose levels for BMS- 986156 are 10, 30, 100, 240, and 
800 mg Q2W in combination with nivolumab, which will be administ ered at a dose of 240 mg Q2W, in 8-week cycles, 
for up to 3 cycles of study therapy. The Sponsor chose 30 mg BMS-9 86156 in combination with 240 mg nivolumab 
as the starting dose in Part B, based on the safety profile of P art A (monotherapy dose escalation). No DLT nor any 
AE (greater than Grade 1), for which no other cause than the investigational drug could be identified, had occurred.
Starting dose level of BMS-986156 was determined based on safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
and is one dose level lower than the dose already tolerated Part A (ongoing monotherapy dose escalation).
In Part C, a monotherapy tumor-specific cohort expansion will b e carried out at the BMS-986156 monotherapy dose 
selected from Part A (monotherapy dose escalation), which may r epresent the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
maximum administered dose (MAD), or an alternate dose(s). Study  therapy will be administered Q2W, in 8-week 
cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
In Part D, a combination therapy cohort expansion will be carri ed out using the combination dose of BMS-986156
selected from Part B, 240 mg BMS 986156 in combination with 240 mg nivolumab, Q2W dosing, and may represent 
the MTD, MAD, or an alternate dose(s) for the combination. Study  therapy will be administered Q2W, in 8-week 
cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
In Part E, a combination therapy cohort expansion, exploring Q4W  dosing, will be carried our using the combination
dose of  480 mg BMS 986156 with 480 mg nivolumab, in cervical can cer (cohort 9) and othe r tumor types (Cohort 
10). Each cohort in Part E will consist of approximately 40 sub jects each. Study therapy will be administered Q4W, 
in 8-week cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
Study Phase:  Phase 1/2a
Research Hypothesis:  It is anticipated that anti-GITR antibody (BMS-986156), administered as a single agent or in 
combination with nivolumab, will demonstrate adequate safety and  tolerability, as well as a favorable risk/benefit 
profile, to support further clinical testing. No prospective hypotheses are being formally evaluated.
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and 
MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 administered alone and i n combination with nivolumab in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:
•To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BMS-98615 6 administered alone and in combination with 
nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors 
•To characterize the PK of BMS-986156 administered alone and in combination with nivolumab
•To characterize th e immunogenicity of BMS- 986156 administered a lone and in combination with nivolumab, and 
the immunogenicity of nivolumab administered with BMS-986156.
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS-986156 administered as a single agent and in combination with 
nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. 
The study will be conducted in 5 parts. Parts A and B will consi st of dose escalation with BMS-986156 administered 
as a single agent (Part A) or in combination with nivolumab (Part B) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Starting 
dose selection of BMS-986156 for Part B was determined using all available safety (clinical and laboratory), PK  
 data and will be one dose level lower than the already tolerat ed dose in the ongoing monotherapy dose escalation 
in Part A (See Section 1.1.4  for details). Subsequently, escalation in the Parts A and B will proceed in parallel. 
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 240 mg administered Q2W for all combination dose cohorts (Parts B and 
D).
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks for combination dose cohorts Part ECohort expansions were evaluated with BMS-986156 monotherapy (P art C) and combination therapy (Part D). 
Part C consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 monotherapy in 2 disease-restricted populations, NSCLC with 
progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior 
platinum doublet-based chemotherapy, and persistent, recurrent,  or metastatic cervical cancer, of approximately 25 
subjects each. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with nivolumab in disease-
restricted populations as follows (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma head and 
neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) hepatocellular carcinoma of approximately 40 subjects each.
Part E consists of cohort expansion with BMS 986156 administered in combination with nivolumab in cervical cancer 
(cohort 9) and other solid tumor types (Cohort 10). Each cohort will contain approximately 40 subjects each.
In an e ffort to limit confounding factors, for all cohorts where  applicable, no more than 5 subjects pre viously found 
to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy wi ll be enrolled per cohort. Rapid progressors are 
defined as subjects who have progressed as of their first response assessment while on prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (if 
applicable).
Treatment in Parts C and D will be initiated when the MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) for monotherapy and combination 
with nivolumab have each been determined. The doses selected for Parts C and D will not exceed the MTD or MAD

Subjects will complete up to 3 periods of the study:  Screening, Treatment, and Safety follow-up, as described below:
Screening (up to 28 days): Subjects will sign consent and be evaluated for study eligibility
Treatment Period consists of up to three, 8-week treatment cycles. In Parts A and C, each treatment cycle will 
comprise 4 doses of BMS-986156 administered Q2W on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43 of the treatment cycle. In Parts B and 
D, each treatment cycle will comprise 4 doses of BMS- 986156 (administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43) in combina tion 
with 4 doses of nivolumab administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43  of the treatment cycle. In Part E, each treatment 
cycle will comprise 2 doses of BMS-986156 (administered on Days  1 and 29) in combination with 2 doses of 
nivolumab administered on Days 1 and 29, of the treatment cycle . In Parts B, D, and E when both study drugs are 
given, nivolumab will be given first followed by BMS-986156 at least 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of 
nivolumab. 
Treatment beyond progression may be allowed in select subjects w ith initial RECIST v1.1-defined progressive disease 
(PD) after discussion and agreement with the BMS Medical Monitor that the benefit/risk assessment favors continued 
administration of study therapy (e.g., subjects are continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by the 
Investigator, tolerating treatment, absence of signs or symptom s indicating disease progression, and do not meet 
treatment discontinuation criteria as specified in Section 3.12.1 ).
Treatment with Additional Cycles beyond 24 weeks: Subjects completing approximately 24 weeks of treatment 
with ongoing disease control (complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) or unconfirmed 
progressive disease (PD) may be eligible for an additional 3 cy cles of study therapy in both monotherapy (Parts A and 
C) and combination therapy (Parts B and D) beyond the initial 2 4 weeks, on a case-by-case basis, after careful 
evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio supports administration of further study therapy. All subjects completing  approximately 48 weeks of treatment with ongoing 
disease control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed PD, may be eligib le for an additional 7 cycles of study therapy in

recommendation of next dose level to be investigated. The BLRM ( -Copula) with an overdose control principle 
(escalation with overdose control)1 will be employed to ensure t hat safety is not compromised during dose escalation.
The initial dose level of BMS-986156 in Part A will be 10 mg fla t dose administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks (See Section 1.1.2 ). Expected dose levels for dose escalation (determined by half log increments from 
starting dose)1are provided in Table -1.
Starting dose selection of BMS-986156 for Part B (combination w ith nivolumab) will be determined using data 
available from all doses evaluated in Part A, including clinica l and safety laboratory, PK,  and modeling 
recommendation within Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework by incorporating single agent toxicity profiles of 
both BMS-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209-003, a Phase 1 ni volumab monotherapy data in advanced solid 
tumors) and will be one dose level lower than a dose already test ed and shown to be tolerated in ongoing monotherapy 
dose escalation in Part A (see Section 1.1.4 for details). 
Dose levels considered for the next cohort were be based on evaluating three potential recommendations by BLRM (-
Copula): escalate, de-escalate, or stay at same dose level. Fin al dose selection for next cohort/dose level will be made 
in conjunction with all data available from all dosed subjects, i ncluding clinical and laboratory safety assessments, 
PK  data, will not allow escalation by more than one dose level and will be made after discussion and 
agreement between investigators and BMS medical monitor. Accord ingly, intermediate or lower doses, or less 
frequent dosing of BMS-986156 may be tested if none of the plan ned doses/schedules are found to be tolerated as 
monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab.
Cohort tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendati on will occur according to BLRM (-Copula) 
recommendation and after completion the 4 week DLT observation period. Continuous re-assessment of dose 
recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) will be carried out at each dose level. 
Approximately 30 subjects each will be treated in dose escalatio n phases in monotherapy (Part A) and combination 
therapy (Part B). No intra-subject dose escalation or reduction is allowed.  Sentinel Subject (Parts A and B only): During dose escalation, a staggered dosing (sentinel subject) approach will 
be used for the first subject in the first dose level of both mo notherapy and combination cohorts. The first subject in 
both Part A and Part B will receive Cycle 1 Day 1 dose of study drug/s, and be observed for 5 days before additional 
subjects, i.e. subject two onward in that cohort receive study d rug. The first subjects to be dosed in subsequent cohorts 
will not be required to observe the 5-day interval between trea tment start dates.

Cohort Expansion (Parts C, D, and E):   The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, 
preliminary efficacy, PK information regarding BMS-986156 as monot herapy or in combination with 
nivolumab. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment in the 
expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment-related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% 
across all subjects treated in the Part C cohort expansions, the findings will be discussed and further enrollment may 
be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxici ty and after assessing the risk: benefit ratio, a new 
dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.
Part C consists of cohort expansions with BMS-986156 monotherapy in 2 disease-restricted populations: (i) NSCLC 
subjects with progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1 ) during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy 
following prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy and (ii) persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.  
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with nivolumab in 
disease-restricted populations as follows: (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma 
head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) hepatocellular carcinoma.
In an e ffort to limit confounding factors, for all cohorts where  applicable, no more than 5 subjects pre viously found 
to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy will be enrolled per cohort.
Rapid progressors are defined as subjects who have progressed a s of their first response assessment while on prior 
PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (if applicable).Parts E includes two cohorts with one as cervical and another for other solid tumors for signal seeking and exploration 
of Q4W dosing respectively. Due to the purpose of signal confirming in cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response

Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLTs):   For the purpose of guiding dose es calation, DLTs w ill be defined based on the 
incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs) for which no alternate cause can be identified ( Section 4.3.1). The 
incidence of DLTs which occur within 4 weeks following the star t of study therapy will guide dose escalation 
decisions. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
AEs version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). For the purposes of subject management, drug-related AEs occurring at any time 
which meet the DLT definition will lead to dose interruption an d or permanent discontinuation of study drug as defined 
in Sections 3.7 and 4.3.1.
Part E will consist of an initial safety lead in period of up t o 12 subjects. Six subjects need to complete the 14-day 
observation period before the full expansion cohorts, of up to 40 subjects, are opened. Patients who discontinue for 
reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-related toxicity may be replaced. An observation period of 
14 days has been chosen based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation for BMS-986156, based on PK 
parameters derived from preclinical studies ( Section 1.1.5 ).
Duration of Study: The total duration of time for any individual subject in both monotherapy and combination arms 
of the study is expected to be approximately 3.1 years. 
Number of Subjects: Approximately 310 subjects will be dosed.
Study Population:
Male and/or fe male subjects who are at least 18 years old, and s atisfy eligibility criteria by medical history, physical 
examination (PE) , 12-lead  electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory evaluations will be included to participate 
in the study as follows:
For Dose Escalation in Parts A and B: Subjects with any solid tumor type (with the exception of prima ry central 
nervous system tumors) are eligible to enroll. All subjects will be required to document availability of archival tumor 
tissue before study drug is admin istered. If arch ival tumor tis sue is not available, subjects must consent to a tumor 
biopsy.
For Cohort Expansion (Parts C, D, and E): Subjects must have one of the tumor types defined above.

Study Assessments:  
•Safety Outcome Measures :  Safety assessments will be based on comprehensive medical re view of adverse 
event reports, vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinat ions, and results of laboratory tests. AEs will be 
coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the
incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and revi ewed for potential significance and clinical 
importance. Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for 100 days after the last
treatment. Both AEs and laboratory tests will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
•Efficacy Measures : Disease assessment with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnet ic resonance imaging
(MRI), as appropriate, w ill be performed at baseline and every 8 weeks until disease pr ogression. Once disease 
progression is noted, no more protocol required tumor assessmen ts are needed unless treatment is continued 
beyond progression. For those subjects who continue study therapy beyond initial disease progression, tumor 
assessments will continue every 8 weeks until confirmed disease progression or study treatment is discontinued. 
Tumor responses will be derived as defined by RECIST v1.1 based on recorded tumor measurements (see 
Appendix 3 ).
•Pharmacokinetic Measures : Serial serum samples will be collected from all subjects at specified time points to 
evaluate concentrations of BMS-986156. PK parameters such as Cma x, Ctrough, Tmax, T-HALF, AUC (TAU), 
CLT, and accumulation index (AI) will be derived, if feasible, fro m serum concentration versus time data.  
•Immunogenicity Measures : Serum samples to evaluate development of anti-drug antibody (A DA) response to 
BMS-986156 alone, and in combination with nivolumab will be collec ted at specified time points.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:  
Dose Escalation :
As a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial, the sample size at each dos e in these arms depends on observed toxicity and 
posterior inference. Approximately 60 subjects are expected to b e treated during the dose- escalation phase (around 30 
subjects for BMS-986156 monotherapy and around 30 subjects for B MS-986156 in combination with nivolumab). 
Initially up to 3 subjects will be tr eated at the starting dose levels of BMS-986156 or BMS-986156 i n combination 
with nivolumab. Additional cohorts of approximately 3 evaluable  subjects will be treated in recommended dose levels
per BLRM (-Copula) during the dose-escalation phase. At most 12 D LT-evaluable subjects will be treated at each 
dose level.

Cohort Expansion: 
Part E includes two cohorts with one as Cervical and another on e as the mixed tumors for signal seeking and 
exploration of Q4W dosing. Due to the purpose of signal confirming in cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response 
rates of the mixed tumors cohort, approximately 40 subjects are  planned for each cohort in part E. For initial safety 
evaluation of 480 mg BMS-986156/480 mg nivolumab Q4W in Part E, 6 subjects will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 weeks (please refer to Section 3.7 for the r ationale for 2 week period) prior to opening Part E to full 
enrollment.
The planned sample size for each of the expansion cohorts serve  as a guidance. Final decision will be made by the 
sponsor based on totality of data available by then.If in a cohort of 40 subjects 10, or 15 responses are observed,  then the lower limit of the one-sided 90% exact binomial 
CI for the ORR is 16%, and 27% respectively. These calculations are made using the Clopper-Pearson method for 
exact confidence intervals. If the true ORR in a tumor type is 40%, then with 40 subjects in a tumor type, there is 93% 
chance of observing at least 12 responses, and 87% chance of observing at least 13 responses, and there is 7% chance
of observing 11 or fewer responses (false negative rate).
Primary Endpoints:   
•The primary objective of the study is to establish MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s). The assessment of safety will be 
based on the incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation, and deaths. In addition clinical laboratory test abnormalities will be examined.
Secondary endpoints:
•The ORR, duration of response, and progression free survival ra te (PFSR) at 24 weeks will be assessed based on 
RECIST v1.1 criteria. The above will be determined based on tum or measurements occurring every 8 weeks 
during the Treatment Period.
•Pharmacokinetics: Selected BMS-986156 parameters, such as Cmax,  Ctrough, Tmax, T-HALF, AUC-(TAU),
CLT and AI, will be assessed, if feasible, from concentration-time data during Cycle 1 and Cycle 3.
•Immunogenicity: Incidence of specific ADA to BMS-986156 and or nivolumab. Samples will be collected at 
multiple time points.
Analyses:   
Safety analysis: All recorded adverse events will be coded according to the most current version of MedDRA, listed 
and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, treatment arm, and dose level. Vital signs and clinical laboratory 
test results will be listed and summarized by treatment arm and  dose. Any significant physical examination findings 
and results of clinical laboratory test will be listed. ECG lis tings will be evaluated by the investigator and 
abnormalities, if present, will be listed.
Efficacy analysis: Listing of tumor measurements will be provided by subject and study day in each arm and dose 
level. Individual subject’s BOR will be listed based on RECIST v1.1.
To describe the anti-tumor activity of BMS-986156 in single agent and in combination with nivolumab, ORR will be 
calculated. ORR and corresponding 2-sided exact 95% exact confidence interval by the Clopper and Pearson method will be provided by treatment arm and dose level. Median duration of response and corresponding two-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be reported by treatment arm and dose level. Duration of response will be analyzed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. PFSR at 24 weeks will be estimated by the K aplan-Meier methodology and the corresponding 
90% confidence interval will be presented.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Antibody-based therapy for cancer has become established in rec ent years and is now one of the 
most successful and important strategies for treating patients w ith hematological malignancies and 
solid tumors.1Aside from targeting antigens that are involved in cancer cell proliferation and 
survival, antibodies can also function to either activate or an tagonize immunological pathways that 
are important in cancer immune surveillance. It is now clear th at an antigen-specific anti-cancer 
immune response is the result of a complex dynamic interplay between antigen-presenting cells
(APC), T lymphocyte (T) cells, and the target cancer cells.2The critical balance of T-cell activity 
that dictates whether endogenous anti-tumor immune responses wil l be effective, are largely 
understood to be controlled by antigen-specific stimuli sensed by the T-cell receptor and by the 
combined activity of both positive (co-stimulatory) and negativ e (co-inhibitory) T-cell surface 
molecules.3Within the past decade, antibodies against these key receptors have been designed and 
evaluated in the clinic with impressive results, heralding the onset of immunotherapy as a key 
pillar of anticancer therapy.4
The most extensively studied immunotherapies in cancer are the negative regulatory receptors, 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and programmed death-1 (PD-1).5
Inhibition of these negative regulatory receptors, referred to as immune checkpoint blockade, 
results in the enhanced activation of T-cell responses and poten t antitum or activity in pr eclinical 
models. Trials with CTLA-4 blockade provided the first clinical  evidence of improvement in 
overall survival with immune modulatory anticancer therapy in pa tients with metastatic 
melanoma.6,7Following that, Topalian et al. showed that anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective 
responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal-cell cancer 
(RCC).8
Following on the success of CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 pathway-targete d agents, the field of tumor 
immunotherapy is beginning to expand rapidly. In addition to blo cking co-inhibitory pathways, 
activating co-stimulatory pathways to potentiate antitumor immu ne responses is being considered 
as a promising approach.9Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFR sf) 
include several co-stimulatory proteins with key roles in B and T cell development, survival, immune activation, and antitumor immune responses.
10Preclinical data have provided the basis 
for the trial of agonist antibodies to TNFRsf co-stimulatory re ceptors 4-1BB,11,12OX40,13,14
glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-(GITR)-related gene,15,16and CD2717,18as potential therapies for 
patients with cancer. Overall, enhancement of the magnitude and  potency of tumor antigen-
specific adaptive cellular responses by CD8 and CD4 T cells is now considered a major goal in 
cancer immunotherapy. 
With these recent emerging clinical lines of evidence of signif icant activity of single agent 
immunotherapies, it is possible that combination therapies coul d potentially lead to greater depth 
of response and overall survival as has been noted with the com bination of anti-PD-1 and anti-
CTLA4 in advanced melanoma patients.19 20This raises the possibility that combining strategies

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
involving a broader range of immunotherapies, e.g. checkpoint blocking antibodies with antitumor 
immune pathways such as agonist antibodies to T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, could potentially lead to durable, long term responses and possibly even cures in  this high un met medical need 
population of patients with metas tatic or refractory tumors. Pre -clinical data from evaluation of 
combinations in mouse tumor models indicate that treatment with the combination of both agents 
can lead to enhanced antitumor activity above that from each agent alone
21Patients with metastatic 
or refractory tumors have a very p oor p rognosis.22Traditional or c onventional tr eatment options 
for patients with advanced cancer include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and 
immunotherapy, all of which have differing mechanisms of action . Despite advances in 
multimodal therapy, increases in overall survival in this patient population have been limited. 
CA009002 is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human (FIH), ascending multip le-dose study of BMS-986156, 
an anti-GITR agonistic antibody, in humans with advanced/metastatic solid tumors as
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. This study will e valuate the safety profile, 
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, of intravenous (IV) dose s of BMS-986156 
administered every 2 weeks as monotherapy and in combination wit h nivolumab in advanced solid 
tumors and is expected to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) or an alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 to be used in fu ture monotherapy and 
combination with nivolumab therapy trials. In addition, the stu dy will evaluate  BMS-986156 as 
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in the following d isease-restricted populations, 
as follows: NSCLC with progressive disease during, or recurrent disease, during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand (PD-L1), and persistent, recu rrent, or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Additional tumor types are bladder cancer, head and nec k squamous cell cancer , ovarian 
cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (see Section 3.9.1 ).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer- related mortality worldwide, 
accounting for approximately 18% of all cancer deaths.
23Lung cancer is also the leading cause of 
cancer death in the US. In 2014, an estimated 224,210 new cases were expected to be diagnosed, 
and 159,260 deaths are estimated to occur because of the disease, accounting for 27% of all deaths 
due to cancer.24
Most lung cancers ( ׽80%) are NSCLC.25Of these patients, more than 65% present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease.26Despite treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, the 
standard of care for first-line therapy, patients with metastatic NSCLC have a median survival of approximately 10 months and a 5-year survival r ate of less than 5%,
27and treatment options for 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type 
NSCLC are particularly limited after failure of front-line chem otherapy. Overall, this group of 
patients only has an OS of about 8 months after progression fro m platinum agents. Once resistance 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) occurs, the patients who h ave EGFR mutations or ALK 
translocations often hav e a rapid dis ease progression.

Recentl y, nivolumab was a pproved for the management of advanced squamous and non-squamou s

the possibility that combining anti-PD-1 antibody with other ag ents could potentially lead to 
deeper and more durable long term responses in high PD-L1 expressing tumors and possibly even

rationale for evaluating novel combinations in this disease. 
Carcinoma of the Cervix
Cervical cancer remains a considerable problem worldwide with 5 00,000 new cases and 250,000 
deaths annually.29In 2014, in the US, an estimated 12,360 new cases were expected  t o  b e  
diagnosed, and 4,020 deaths are estimated to occur because of t he disease.30Treatment for cervical 
cancer is typically surgery for Stages IA to IIA1 and concurrent chemoradiation for Stages IB2 to 
IVA. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer depends on stage and ranges from 93% for early
stage disease (IA) to around 15% for Stages IVA and B.31Treatment of recurrent disease is 
typically with surgery for resectable disease or chemotherapy p lus bevacizumab, which improved 
objective response rate (ORR), (48% vs. 36%) and mOS (17 vs. 13. 3 months) compared to 
chemotherapy alone.32After first line chemotherapy, there is no standard of care tha t has 
demonstrated improved benefit over best supportive care.
Bladder Cancer
Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world, wi th 430,000 newly diagnosed in 
2012.33In the United States (US), approximately 77,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths occur each 
year due to bladder cancer.34In Europe, there were an estimated 118,000 cases and 52,000 deaths 
in 2012.35In developed regions such as North America and Europe, the histological phenotype is 
predominantly urothelial carcinoma.
From 1985 to 2005, the number of bladder cancers diagnosed in the US increased by more than 
50%, while from 1975 to 1996, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with bladder cancer 
increased from 75% t o 81%.36Mortality rates in several western European countries have show n 
similar downward trends over the last two decades but are still increasing in some eastern European 
countries.36
Many bladder cancer patients do not die of their disease but do  experience multiple recurrences. 
As a consequence, there are a relatively large number of people  alive with a history of bladder 
cancer. In middle-aged and elderly men, bladder cancer is the s econd most prevalent malignancy 
after prostate cancer.37
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck
There are large geographic differences in the incidence and primary site of head and neck cancers. 
These likely reflect the prevalence of risk factors, such as to bacco and alcohol consumption, as 
well as ethnic and genetic differences among populations.

Although the highest rates of head and neck cancer are in older  males, the incidence has been 
increasing in females as more women use tobacco, and in young non-smokers as human 
papillomavirus (HPV) plays an increasingly prominent role as an  e t i o l o g i c  f a c t o r  i n  t h e  
development of oropharyngeal head and neck cancer. 
Tobacco (smoked and smokeless) is the most important known risk factor for the development of 
head and neck cancer. There is some evidence for a genetic predi sposition to the carcinogenic 
effects of tobacco. In addition, tobacco and alcohol consumptio n appear to have a synergistic 
effect. The repeated exposure of the mucosa of the upper aerodi gestive tract to the carcinogenic 
effects of tobacco, alcohol, or both appears to cause multiple primary and secondary tumors in this 
“condemned mucosa,” a phenomenon described as “field cancerizat ion.”
HPV infection is a causative agent for head and neck cancer. HPV-associated head and neck 
cancers occur primarily in the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue), account for the younger 
age of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and  define a subset of patients with 
improved treatment outcome. However, the use of HPV status in clinical decision making remains 
investigational at this time, and treatment is the same as for patients without an HPV-associated
tumor.38,39,40,41,42,43,44
Ovarian Cancer
The term ovarian cancer (OC) includes not only epithelial OC but also primary peritoneal and 
fallopian tube cancer. The latter two are less common neoplasms,  which, however, are managed 
in a similar manner to epithelial OC. Epithelial OC is the lead ing cause of death from gynecologic 
cancer in the US and is the country’s fifth most common cause o f cancer mortality in women. 
Nearly 75% of the patients present with advanced-stage OC.45According to the International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 5-year survival rates are approximately 46.7% for Stage 
IIIa, 41.5% for Stage IIIb, 32.5% for Stage IIIc, and 18.6% for Stage IV. Patients with platinum
sensitive OC treated with platinum-based frontline therapy have  high response rates of up to 81% 
and median progression free survival (mPFS) and mOS of 19.1 and 44.1 months, respectively.46
However, patients with subsequent relapses, either platinum sen sitive or resistant, have a 
significantly worse prognosis with mPFS between 10.2 and 4.1 months and mOS between 17.6 
and 5.0 months, respectively,47Immunotherapy with weekly int raperitoneal IL 2 produced  a ~17% 
complete pathologic response rate in patients with platinum-res istant OC.48A threefold 
prolongation of PFS was observed in patients treated with recom binant human IFN- Ȗ combined 
with MTD cisplatin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, with minimal added toxicity.49,50The 
presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in advanced-stage OC correlates with an 
improved outcome. Patients with Stage III and IV OC and the pre sence of TILs within the tumor 
had better disease free survival and OS (P < 0.001) than did pat ients with similar staged OC and 
absence of TILs.51

Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second leading 
cause of cancer-related death. The incidence of HCC varies geog raphically largely due to 
variations in hepatitis B and C virus infection. 
HCC has the highest mortality-to-incidence rate ratio of 0.98, f ollowed by lung (0.85) and 
esophageal (0.83) cancers.52The number of deaths is close to the number of new cases because 
most HCCs are detected at an advanced stage and occur in patien ts with underlying liver 
dysfunction, making HCC a highly lethal cancer. The prognosis i s also poor because of the low 
effectiveness of available tr eatments. The 5-year HCC survival rate is approximately 5% to 6% 
compared with 72% and 22% for breast cancer stages III and IV, respectively.53,54,55Treatment of 
HCC is challenging because the disease is highly heterogeneous with different etiologies and 
because of varying approaches to diagnosis and treatment and var iations in responses to therapy.56
Relatively few patients are eligible for curative treatment bec ause of the late appearance of 
symptoms.57The majority of patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease when 
the disease is beyond resection and locoregional treatments are ineffective. The prognosis for these 
patients is poor.58
GITR: Immune Activation by T cell Costimulation and Regulatory T cell Suppression
GITR protein (also known as TNFRsf18) was first identified as a dexamethasone-inducible 
molecule on a murine  T cell hybr idoma.59GITR is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to 
the TNFRSF including OX40, CD27, and CD137. These receptors are costimulators of T cell 
activity a nd with T cell receptor engagement result in T cell activation.
GITR is expressed on naive murine T cells but shows little expression on naive human T cells.60
GITR is expressed upon activation of CD8 and CD4 effector T (Te ff) cells, but is constitutively 
expressed on regulatory T (Treg) cells. In normal human periphe ral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), GITR expression on Treg cells is higher than on conventional T cells, and while 
expression on resting CD4+ T cells was low it markedly increase d after activation.61It is also 
expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and at low levels on B c ells, eosinophils, basophils, 
macrophages and dendritic cells, and can be upregulated by activ ation.62,63,64,65,66,67,68GITR 
ligand is found largely on APCs.69
GITR engagement on CD8 T cells has been shown to have an intrin sic effect of potentiating CD8 T 
cell activity.70,71Additionally, GITR engagement has an intrinsic effect on CD8 T cell 
expansion.72.Consistent with its role in costimulation, GITR engagement prom otes autoimmunity 
in autoimmune-prone mouse strains73similar to that observed upon blockade of the 
PD-1 pathway.74GITR signaling results in redu ced T cell apoptosis and promotes  T cell survival, 
at least in part by upregulating th e expression of the Bcl-xL p rosurvival molecule downstream of 
NFNB.75

While Treg cells a ntagonize effector T cells, thereby limiting antitumor activity, engag ement of 
GITR on Teff cells promotes increased T cell function by l imiting t he sensitivity of these cells to 
Treg suppression. Stephans et al mixed irradiated T-cell depleted splenocytes and anti-CD3, and 
Teff and Treg cells isolated from WT or GITR-deficient (GITR-/-) mice, showing that GITR
agonism renders Teff cells resistant to Treg suppression.76In addition, in certain circumstances 
engagement of GITR on intratumoral Treg cell may result in dimi nished suppressor activity. NK 
cells also express low levels of GITR, which can be up regulate d by interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15.77
The consequences of GITR engagement on NK cells in antitumor res ponses remains to be 
determined because of conflicting data as to whether engagement increase 78or decreases NK cell 
activity.79
Rationale for BMS-986156 therapy
BMS-986156 is a fully human agonist antibody of the IgG1 isotype that binds with high affinity 
to the human GITR family related receptor.

1.5.4 Clinical Pharmacology and Safety
BMS-986156
Ongoing safety data as of 12-Dec-2016 from St udy CA009002 are consistent with a manageable 
safety profile with no signals observed to date. Adverse events have been reported in 33 out of 34 
(97.1%) subjects on monotherapy, and 39 out of 50 (78.0%) subjects  on combination therapy of 
BMS-986156 with nivolumab (2 subjects on BMS-986156 30 mg/nivol umab 240 mg, 7 subjects 
on 100 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 20 subjects on 240 mg BMS-98 156/240 mg
nivolumab and 10 subjects on 800 mg BMS-98156/240 mg nivolumab).  The AEs were mainly 
Grade 1 and Grade 2. The types of AEs (all grades, all causalit y) were similar among the 
BMS-986156 dose levels. One subject on 800 mg BMS 986156/240 mg n ivolumab experienced a 
Grade 4 CPK elevation with myalgia event which was deemed related to study drug after the DLT window on day  29 of Cy cle. Concomitantly the patient experience d increased liver values Grade 
3 lasting 1 day. The patient wa s taken off study, treated with steroids, and then tapered off. He is 
clinically well and the CPK elevation is resolving to Grade 1 wh ereas the increased liver values 
lasted 1 day.
The most frequently reported AEs were nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, fatigue, abdominal pain, 
constipation, back pain, and headache. AEs for which no alterna tive cause other than study drug

(58.8%) subjects on monotherapy, and 28 out of 50 (56%) subjects on combination therapy. 
Eleven subjects receiving BMS-986156 monotherapy died due to di sease progression: 3 subjects 
on BMS-986156 10 mg, 4 subjects on BMS-986156 30 mg, 1 subject on  BMS-986156 100 mg, 
and 3 on 240 mg BMS-986156 and 1 on 800 mg BMS-986156. One subjec t receiving 
BMS-986156 240 mg/nivolumab 240 mg died due t o disease progression. One subject receiving 
BMS-986156 240 mg/nivolumab 240 mg died due to aspiration pneum onia. A total of 270 subjects 
reported serious adverse events (SAEs): Two SAE with no alternat ive cause other than study drug 
(Grade 2 pneumonitis identified, 800 mg Q2W and another subject Gr ade 4 blood creatine 
phosphokinase and Grade 3 hepatic enzyme elevation, 800 mg BMS 986156/ 240 mg nivolumab)

240 mg/nivolumab 240 mg) discontinued from the study due to SAEs resulting from disease 
progression.
1.5.5 Nivolumab Clinical Safety and Activity
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD reached at any dose tested up to
10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or ca usality of AEs to nivolumab dose
level. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1-2) with relatively few drug-related high-grade (Grade3-4) AEs. The safety profile of nivolumab combination therapy v aries with the agent combined
with nivolumab, but is generally consistent with the safety pro files observed with either agent

alone and, in some cases, both frequency and severity of AEs we re greater than that observed with 
either agent alone. The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimuma b combination therapy was
consistent with the mechanisms of action of nivolumab and ipili mumab. A dose of 3 mg/kg
nivolumab/3 mg/kg ipilimumab exceeded the MTD, and both 1 mg/kg nivolumab/3 mg/kg
ipilimumab and 3 mg/kg nivolumab/1 mg/kg ipilimumab were identif ied as the MTD. For
nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy, most high-grade events were manageable with use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (HRT; endo crinopathies).
In several ongoing clinical trials, the safety of nivolumab in combination with other therapeutics
such as ipilimumab, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, a nd targeted therapies is being
explored. Most studies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of nivolumab combinationscontinues to evolve. Management algorithms including the use of  immunosuppressive agents, such 
as corticosteroids, infliximab, etc., are provided in Appendix 4 . Nivolumab should not be used in 
subjects with active autoimmune disease given the mechanism of action of the antibody. Updated 
overall clinical experience for nivolumab is available in the c urrent version of the IB.

BMS-986156 Starting Dose for Part A (Monotherapy)
The FIH dose for this study has been carefully selected based on  a thorough review of all available 
nonclinical data . Since BMS-986156 is an immune agonist and act ivates the 
T-cell mediated immune response, MABEL and HNSTD were considered  in selecting the FIH 
starting dose.
To balance the potential for pharmacologic activity and need fo r reasonable safety in a cancer 
patient population vs. normal healthy vol unteers, a dose of 10 mg w as selected as the FIH safe 
starting dose. This dose is approximately 100-fold lower than the MRSD (992 mg) projected from 
the 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys, is approximately 5-fold lower than the 
projected human efficacious dose (56 mg), and is within the derived MABEL dose range).127Thus 
the selected FIH starting dose of BMS-986156 appropriately bala nces regard for patient safety 
with the potential of exposing a higher number of patients with advanced cancer to 
non-pharmacologically active doses. Monotherapy dose escalation has cleared 800 mg wit hout the 
MTD being reached.
BMS-986156 Starting Dose for Part B (Combination with Nivolumab )
The Sponsor decided to choose the 30 mg BMS-986156 in combinatio n with 240 mg nivolumab 
based on the safety profile of the monotherapy dose escalation, Part A, of BMS-986156. No DLT 
nor any AE (greater than Grade 1) for which no other cause than the investigational drug could be 
identified had occurred. Starting dose of BMS-986156 in Part B (combination with nivolumab) is 
one dose level lower than a dose already tested and shown to be tolerated in ongoing monotherapy dose escalation in Part A . At no point will the dose of BMS-98 6156 
administered in combination with nivolumab in Part B exceed dos es of BMS-986156 that have 
been demonstrated previously to be safe in the monotherapy dose  escalation arm (Part A), nor at 
any point during Part B escalation will the BMS-986156 dose exc eed the highest dose determined 
to be tolerated in Part A. Combination dose escalation has clea red 240 mg BMS-986156/240 mg 
nivolumab and has been initiated at 800 mg/240 mg without the MTD being reached.
Dose Escalation in Parts A and B
BLRM with overdose control (EWOC) principle
144will be employed to ensure that safety is not 
compromised during dose escalation. In addition, following the completion of one dose level, dose 
selection for next cohort/dose level will be made in conjunctio n with the data available on all 
previously dosed subjects, (including clinical and laboratory s afety assessments, PK,  data),

will not allow escalation by more than one dose level, and will be made after discussion and 
agreement between Investigators and Medical Monitor.
Safety Monitoring on Study Therapy (Parts A-F)
In the absence of a pre-clinically defined safety signal, safet y monitoring, by way of complete 
blood counts and chemistry (incl uding liver enzyme) tests will be carried out prior to 
administration of study therapy, on a weekly basis for the firs t cycle and bi-weekly thereafter. In 
addition, complete physical examinations (PEs) will be conducte d on Day 1 of each new cycle, 
along with bi-weekly symptom-directed targeted PEs pri or to each administr ation of study drug.
 
 
In a pre-clinical mouse study in which a rat anti-GITR antibody was repeatedly administered 
anaphylactoid reactions were observed due to the development of  IgE antibodies.145As noted in 
the nonclinical studies , BMS-986156 repeatedly administered to  cynomolgus 
monkeys did not induce infusion-related or anaphylactoid reactions. However, because of the as 
yet unknown potential of i nfusion r eactions with the administration of BMS-986156 in humans, 
all subjects receiving first 2 doses of BMS-986156 monotherapy a nd in combination with 
nivolumab, will be closely monitored until 120 minutes post i nfusion for potential infusion 
reactions that could occur after either first administration, o r from repeat dosing of a novel 
monoclonal antibody. In addition, detail guidance management an d algorithms for IRRs are 
provided in the protocol and the administrati on of BMS-986156 a s monotherapy or in combination 
with nivolumab will occur at sites with medical monitoring and capability to manage infusion 
reaction or anaphylaxis.
Due to the potential risk of amplification of antigen-specific T-cell responses and exaggerated 
inflammatory response, subjects with auto-immune disorders who are at risk for flare of 
auto-immunity, as well as those with viral inf ection (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 
Hepatitis B or C) at risk for exaggerated anti-viral inflammato ry response will be excluded (see 
Section 3.9.2 ).
Safety assessments will also be carried out by the Sponsor/Medic al Monitor and Investigators 
throughout the study to determine whether dose modification, ad ditional safety measures, or 
termination of the study, as pertaining to administration of BMS -986156 as monotherapy or in 
combination with nivolumab, is required at any t ime. In addition, AEs and SAEs will be reviewed 
regularly by the Medical Monitor/Study Director and the Pharmac ovigilance group to look for 
trends and potential safety signals. Treatment of AEs will foll ow Institutional guidelines and 
recommended management algorithms as listed in the nivolumab prescribing information and

Clinical Safety Update
Study CA009002 is ongoing and safety data from patients treated  in Parts A and B as of 12-Dec-
2016, is summarized below:
BMS-986156 Monotherapy (Part A)
As of 12 Dec-2016, 34 subjects h ave been treated with BMS-98615 6 as monotherapy. 
BMS-986156 monotherapy was evaluated during dose escalation phases at 10 mg (4 subjects), 
30 mg (6 subjects), 100 mg (4 subjects), 240 mg (9 subjects), an d 800 mg (11 subjects) of 
BMS-986156. Overall, the safety profile of BMS-986156 monotherapy is manageable with the MTD not being reached at 800 mg.
There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs across the BMS-986156 dose 
levels studied. AEs were experienced by 97.1% (33/34) of subjects on monotherapy, with the most 
frequently reported AEs being nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, fatigu e, abdominal pain, constipation, 
back pain, and headache. There were no DLTs and all SAEs were a ttributed to causes other than 
the study drug with the exception of a SAE of Grade 2 pneumonit is in a single subject at the 
800 mg dose level. All AEs leading to discontinuation are attrib uted to causes other than study 
drug. AEs for which no alternative cause besides BMS-986156 can be identified, including IRRs, 
were reported in 58.8% (20/34) of subjects with the most frequently reported AEs being nausea, pyrexia, and chills, all of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The 12 subjects for which no alternative cause besides BMS-986156 can be identified include:
•9 subjects at the 240 mg dose level: 3 of these subjects experien ced pyrexia
•11 subjects at the 800 mg dose level: pain, paresthesia, cough and pneumonitis in 1 subject; 
chills, fever, nausea and vomiting in 1 subject; and cases of h eadache, fever, malaise, flu like 
symptoms, vomiting and IRR, each experienced in different single  subjects. The IRR which 
occurred twice at Grade 2 occurred in a single subject. With fu ll premedication 
(acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and steroids) and a prolonged infusion time of 2 hours, the 
Grade 2 infusion reaction did not recur. 
The Grade 2 pneumonitis case occurred  
 This subject received 2 doses of BMS-986156, 
800 mg IV Q2W. Following the second dose,  complained of coughi ng and increasing dyspnea. 
On evaluation  was afebrile and had an oxygen saturation of 96%. Computed tomography of the 
chest showed lower lobe infiltrates that were consistent with p neumonitis, a left sided pleural 
effusion and increase in the size and number of pulmonary metas tases.  was treated with 
IV methylprednisolone (80 mg) and was admitted overnight for observation. The steroid dose was continuously decreased and symptoms improved. The subject did not resume BMS-986156 dosingas  experienced disease progression and thus came off study.

BMS-986156 in Combination with Nivolumab (Part B)
As of 12-Dec-2016, 50 subjects have been treated with the combi nation of BMS-986156 and 
nivolumab: 3 subjects at 30 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 9 subjects at 100 mg 
BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 27 subjects at 240 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab and 800 
mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab. Overall, the safety profile of BMS-986156 combination 
therapy is manageable with no MTD reached.
There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality o f AEs to BMS-986156 across these 
dose levels. Adverse events were experienced by 78% (39/50) of subjects: 2 of 3 subjects on 30 mg 
BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 7 of 9 subjects at 100 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 20 
of 27 subjects BMS-98156 240 mg/nivolumab 240 mg and 10 of 11 BMS-98156 800 mg/nivolumab 240 mg. All SAEs reported were attributed to cause s other than study drug.
In all 10 patients who experienced these AEs for which no alternative cause other than study drug could be identifie d, the nature of the AEs were as follows:
•2 subjects on 30 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab: pyrexia and pr uritus in 1 subject and 
pyrexia, hypomagnesemia, arthralgia, and appetite decreased in 1 subject, all Grade 1. 
•6 subjects on 100 mg BMS-986156 /nivolumab 240 mg: Grade 1 pyre xia, rigors, IRR, and 
elevated lipase. One subject experienced Grade 2 nausea, vomiti ng, and weight loss. One 
subject experienced Grade 3 elevated lipase, elevated amylase, myalgia and dry mouth all 
Grade 1. One patient experienced arthralgia, grade 2.  One subject experienced a Grade 3 lung 
infection 
•13 subjects on 240 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab: Grade 1 pyrexia, headache, chills malaise, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia diarrhea, dry mouth, hype rtension, Grade 2, fatigue, 
cough, myalgia, decrease neutrophil count and peripheral sensor y neuropathy.. Grade 3, 
fatigue.
Each subject treated wit h 30 mg BMS- 986156 and 240 mg nivolumab experienced Grade 1-r elated 
IRRs (fever/pyrexia, rigors, chills, nausea, night sweats) foll owing the first dose administered 
within 24 hours of the infusion. These events resolved with the  oral administration of 
acetaminophen 500 mg. The IRRs did not recur upon subsequent dosing apart form in exception 
of 1 subject that experienced an additional related Grade 1 IRR after the third dose was 
administered (also resolved with acetaminophen 500 mg).  
Two of the 9 subjects dosed with 100 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivol umab experienced an IRR 
following the first dose administered within 24 hours of the infusion. These events resolved with 
the oral administration of acetaminophen 500 mg. These IRRs did  not recur upon subsequent 
dosing. Six of the 27 subjects on 240 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivol umab experienced an IRR 
following the first dose administered within 24 hours of the infusion. This event resolved with the 
oral administration of acetaminophen 500 mg. 6 of the 34 subject s (17.6%) on monotherapy 
experienced IRR, (1 subject  on 100 mg BMS 986156, 3 on 240 mg BMS  986156 and 3 on 800 mg

Adequate monitoring and safety assessments as outlined in Section 5.3 of the study protocol is in 
place for mitigating the risk of cytokine release should it occur at any point in the trial. A specific 
study of cytokine release potential in pre-clinical models for the combination is at this time 
unnecessary given the clinical safety profile.
Overall Risk/Benefit for Combination with Nivolumab 
Nivolumab has demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with a dvanced NSCLC, RCC, melanoma 
and lymphomas among other tumors and has been recently approved in the treatment of second 
line melanoma following Yervoy and BRAF inhibitors for BRAFV600  mutant positive tumors, 
and second line squamous NSCLC.121
Nivolumab has demonstrated a manageable safety profile. The ove rall safety experience with 
nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other therap eutics, is based on experience in 
approximately 8,700 subjects treated to date.97There is no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. The most common AEs i ncluded fatigue, rash, pruritus, 
diarrhea, and nausea. Side effects of nivolumab therapy may inc lude those associated with 
immune-mediated activation, such as pneumonitis, thyroiditis, an d transaminitis. Most of these 
events resolved with immunomodulating medication (e.g. < 1% subjec ts who developed 
pneumonitis (5/ 691) treated subjects have died.121To mitigate risk from serious immune-
mediated AEs, subject management algorithms for nivolumab-relate d AEs from prior collective 
nivolumab experience have been included ( Appendix 4 ). For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety 
profile is similar across tumor types. The only exception is pu lmonary inflammation AE), which 
may be numerically greater in subjects with NSCLC, because in s ome cases, it can be difficult to 
distinguish between nivolumab-related and unrelated causes of p ulmonary symptoms and 
radiographic changes. The nonclinical findings of increased late -stage pregnancy loss and early 
infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab-exposed pregnant monkeys  
 suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is contin ued treatment with nivolumab 
during pregnancy. However, nivolumab exposure during human pregnancy has not been permitted in clinical trials, and is not permitted in this protocol.
The combinatio n of nivolumab and BMS- 986156 has the potential f or increased benefit compared 
to nivolumab monotherapy. In general, the combination of nivolumab with other therapeutic 
agents results in a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases, with a greater frequency. In several ongoing clinical trials, t he safety of nivolumab in combination 
with other therapeutics such as ipilimumab, cytotoxic chemother apy, anti-angiogenics, and 
targeted therapies is being explored. Most studies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of 
nivolumab combinations continues to evolve. Thus far, the combi nation of both agents results in 
a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alon e, but in some cases with a greater 
frequency. 
Summary
An urgent need exists for new therapies for subjects with advanced cancer that has progressed or 
not responded to other treatmen ts. Substantial nonclinical effi cacy profile and evidence of single

agent as well as combination activity with mouse s urrogates of anti-GTIR and anti-PD-1 antibodies 
has been noted in a variety of mouse tumor models (See Section 1 ). These pre-clinical results taken 
together with the emerging role of combination immunomodulating therapies in producing deep 
and durable responses in well-designed clinical trials,146the lack of a safety signal in pre-clinical 
toxicology studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, the careful consideration for safety in study 
design, and clinical data observed to date, support the expecta tion of fa vorable benefit to risk for 
evaluation of BMS -986156 as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS-986156 administered as a single agent and in 
combination with nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumor s. 
The study will be conducted in 5 parts. Parts A and B w ill consist of dose escalation with BMS-
986156 administered as a single agent (Part A) or in combinatio n  wi th  n i v ol u m a b  (Part B )  i n  
subjects with advanced solid tumors. Starting dose selection of  BMS-986156 for Part B 
(combination with nivolumab) was determined using all available safety (clinical and laboratory), PK, and modeling recommendations within Bayesian hierarchical modeling 
framework by incorporating single agent toxicity profiles of both BMS-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (data from CA209003 study, a phase 1 nivolumab monotherapy data in advanced solid tumors) and will be one dose level lower than a dose already tes ted and shown to be tolerated in 
ongoing monotherapy dose escalation in Part A
.  Subsequently, 
escalation in the 2 parts will proceed in parallel. 
A dose -1 cohort of 3 mg has also been included and will only be explored in the event 10 mg dose 
of BMS-986156 is determined to exceed the MTD in monotherapy or  in combination with 
nivolumab ( Table 3.4.1-1 ).
At no point will the dose of BMS-986156 administered in combination with nivolumab in Part B exceed doses of BMS-986156 that have been demonstrated previous l y  t o  b e  s a f e  i n  t h e  
monotherapy dose escalation arm (Part A), nor at any point during Part B escalation will the BMS-986156 dose exceed the highest dose determined to be tolerated in Part A. 
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks for combination dose cohorts 
(Parts B and D).  
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 480 mg every 4 week s for combination dose cohorts 
Part E
Part C consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 monotherapy  in 2 disease-restricted 
populations, NSCLC with progressive  or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during or after anti-
PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior platinum doublet-bas ed chemotherapy, and persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer , of a pproximately 40 subjects each. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in disease-restricted populations as follow:  (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder 
cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) HCC, of 
approximately 40 subjects each.
Part E consists of cohort expansion with BMS 986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in cervical cancer (cohort 9) and other tumor types ( Cohort 10). Each cohort will 
contain approximately 40 subjects each.  Patients who discontinu e for reasons other than disease 
progression, death, or treatment-related toxicity may be replac ed

No more than 5 subjects previously found to be “rapid progresso rs” on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
therapy will be enrolled per cohort. Rapid progressors are defined as subjects who have progressed 
as of their first response assessment while on prior PD-1/PD-L1  therapy (if applicable).
Cohort expansion arm in part C will consist of approximately 25 subjects. Cohorts in Part D and Part E will contain a pproximately 40 subjects.  Patients who discontinue for reasons  other than 
disease progression, death, or treatment-related toxicity may b e replaced. Treatment in Parts C 
and D will be initiated when the MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) for monotherapy and combination 
with nivolumab have each been determined based on evaluation of t he totality of available clinical 
safety, PK, and modeling data for Parts A and B, respectively. The doses selected for Parts C 
D, and E will not ex ceed the MTD or MAD determined in Parts A and B. Part D may beg in while 
Part B continues to explore higher dose levels.

Subjects will complete up to 3 phases of the study:  Screening,  Treatment, and Safety follow-up,
as described below:
Screening
The screening phase will last for up to 28 days. Screening phase begins by establishing the 
subject’s initial eligibility and signing of the ICF. Subjects will be enrolled using the Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS).
Treatment Phase
The treatment phase consists of up to three 8-week treatment cycles.  In Parts A and C, each 
treatment cycle comprises 4 doses of BMS-986156 administered eve ry 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, 29, 
and 43 of the treatment cycle. In Parts B and D, each treatment  cycle comprises 4 doses of 
BMS-986156 (administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43) in combination with 4 doses of nivolumab 
administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43 of the treatment cycle.  In Parts B and D and E when both 
study drugs are given, nivolumab will be given first followed b y BMS-986156 at least 30 minutes 
after completion of the  infusion of nivolumab. In Part E, the co hort of 480 mg/480 mg each 
treatment cycle comprises 2 doses of BMS-986156 (administered o n Days 1 and 29) in 
combination with 2 doses of nivolumab administered on Days 1 and  29 of the treatment cycle.  
Following each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a subject  with additional cycles of study 
therapy, up to a maximum  of 13 treatment cycles, w ill be based on tumor assessment (evaluation 
performed between Days 49 and 56 of each cycle and completed before the first dose in the next cycle). Tumor progression or response endpoints w ill be assesse d using Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 criteria for solid tumors (Appendix 3 ). 
Treatment beyond progression may be allowed in select subjects with initial RECIST v1.1-defined 
progressive disease (PD) after discussion and agreement with th e BMS Medical Monitor that the 
benefit/risk assessment favors continued administration of stud y therapy (e.g., subjects are 
continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by the In vestigator, tolerating treatment, and 
meeting other criteria specified in Section 3.11.1.1 ).
Subjects with a response of unc onfirmed PD, SD, partial respons e (PR), or complete response 
(CR) at the end of a given cycle  will continue to the next treat ment cycle. Subjects will generally 
be allowed to continue study therapy until the first occurrence of either: 1) completion of the maximum number of cycles, 2) confir med PD, 3) clinical d eterioration suggesting that no further 
benefit from tr eatment is likely, 4) intolerability to therapy; or 5) the subj ect meets criteria for 
discontinuation of study therapy as outlined in protocol Section 3.11.  Individual subjects with 
confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study therapy on a case by case basis after 
specific consul tation and agr eement between the Investigator and BMS Medical Monitor in 
settings where benefit/risk justify discontinuation of study therapy. 
3.2 Treatment with Additional Cycles Beyond 24 Weeks
All subjects  will be tr eated for 24 weeks (up to 3 cycles) of monotherapy (Parts A or C) or 
combination therapy (Parts B or D) unless criteria for st udy drug discontinuation are met earlier 
(Section 3.11). All sub jects completing approximately 24 weeks of treatment with ongoi ng disease

control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed PD, may be eligible for a n additional 3 cycles of study 
therapy in both monotherapy (Parts A and C) and combination the rapy (Parts B D and E) beyond 
the initial 24 weeks, on a case-by-case basis, after careful ev aluation and discussion with the BMS 
Medical Monitor to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio sup ports administration of further 
study therapy. All subjects completing approximately 48 weeks o f treatment with ongoing disease 
control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed PD, may be eligible for a n additional 7 cycles of study 
therapy in combination therapy (Parts D and E) beyond the initial 48 weeks, on a case-by-case 
basis, after careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether 
the risk/benefit ratio supports administration of further study  therapy. For patients who present 
with PD for the first time at the end of cycle 6, please contact the Medical Monitor for discussion.  Upon completion of 3 cycles of study therapy (or up to a maximu m of 13 cycles if applicable), all 
subjects will enter safety follow-up period.
3.3 Follow-up
3.3.1 Safety Follow-up
Upon completion  of 3 cycles  of study therapy (or up to a maximu m of 6 cycles if applicable), all 
subjects will enter safety follow-up period once the decision i s made to discontinue the subject 
from treatment (e.g., at end of treatment [EOT]).
For subjects that complete all scheduled cy cles of therapy, EOT visit will be the same as the last 
scheduled and completed on-treatment visit, and the start of we ek 1 safety  f ol l ow up visit. For 
subjects that do not complete all scheduled cycles of therapy, EOT visit will be the most recent 
on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data)  and does not need to be repeated, 
and will be considered the start of week 1 safety follow up vis it.
After the EOT visit, all subjects will be evaluated for any new AEs for at least 100 days after the 
last dose of therapy. Follow-up visits should occur at Days 30, 60 and 100 ( ±7 days) after the last 
dose or coinciding with the date of discontinuation ( ±7 days) if date of discontinuation is greater 
than 30 days after the last dose to monitor for AEs. All subjects will be required to complete the 3 
clinical safety follow up visits regardless of whether they sta rt new anti-cancer therapy, except 
those subjects who withdraw consent for study participation.

3.4 Dose Escalation
3.4.1 Parts A and B
The dose-escalation phase of the study will evaluate the MTD/MA D/alternate dose(s) of 
BMS-986156 alone or in combination with nivolumab based on DLTs  using a BLRM-Copula 
model, where the BLRM is designed to guide BMS-986156 monothera py dose escalation and

The initial dose level of BMS-986156 in Part A will be a flat dose of 10 mg as an IV infusion over 
60 minutes every 2 weeks. Expected dose levels for dose escalat ion (determined by half log 
increments from starting dose)147are provided in Table 3.4.1-1 .
Starting dose select ion of BMS-986156 for Part B will be determined using data available from all 
doses evaluated in Part A, including clinical and safety laborat ory, PK,  and modeling 
recommendations within Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework by incorporating single agent 
toxicity profiles of both BMS-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209003, a Phase 1 nivolumab monotherapy data in advanced solid tumors ); starting dose will  be one dose level lower than a 
dose already tested and shown t o be tolerated in ongoing monothe rapy dose escalation in Part A 
. A dose -1 cohort of 3 mg has been included and will only be e xplored 
in the event 10 mg dose of B MS-986156 is determined to exceed t he MTD in monotherapy or in 
combination with nivolumab (Table 3.4.1-1).
Dose levels to be considered for the next cohort will be based on evaluating three potential 
recommendations by BLRM (-Copula): escalate, de-escalate, or stay at same dose level. Final dose 
selectio n for next c ohort/dose level will be made in conjunction with the data avai lable on all dosed 
subjects, including clinical and laboratory safety assessments, PK,  data, w ill not allow 
escalation by more tha n one dose level and will be made after d iscussion and agreement between 
Investigators and Medical Monitor. Accordingly, intermediate or  lower doses, or less frequent 
dosing of BMS-986156 may be tested if none of the planned doses /schedules is found to be 
tolerated as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab.  Up to an additional 9 subjects may 
be enrolled in an already DLT cleared cohort to collect additio nal PK, and safety data to b etter 
understand any dose response relationship. Approximately 30 subjects each will be treated in each dose esc alation phases in monotherapy 
(Part A) and combination therapy (Part B).  During dose escalation phase, once a dose level has been decide d, a set of approximately 3 subjects 
will be treated a t that specified dose level. Cohort tolerab ility assessment and subsequent dose 
recommendation will occur according to BLRM (-Copula) recommendation and after at least 
2 subjects complete the 4 week DLT observation period. If the pot ential DLT occurring in the 3rd 
evaluable subject regarding the specific dose level does not influence the dose recommendation 
by BLRM (-Copula), the BLRM (-Copula) recommended next dose level may proceed without 
waiting for the 3rd subject to complete the corresponding DLT o bservation period, after discussion 
and agreement between Sponsor and Investigators.  
Subjects must be observed for a total of 28 days following the first therapy dose to be considered 
evaluable for DLT. Subjects discontinued during DLT observation period due to DLT are also 
considered as evaluable for DLT. Continuous re-assessment of dose recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) will also be carried out at each dose levels.
The MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 selected for cohort expansion in Parts C and D 
will be based on evaluating the recommendation from BLRM and a synthesis of all available data, 
including clinical and laboratory safety assessments, PK,  and efficacy data, from all treated 
patients at each dose level up to the MTD/MAD.

No intra-subject dose escalatio n or reduction is allowed.  
Sentinel Subject (Parts A and B only): During dose escalation, a staggered dosin g (sentinel 
subject) approach will be used for the first subject in the first dose level of both monotherapy and 
combination cohorts. Only applicable to the lowest dose level: The first subjects at the lowest dose 
levels in both Part A and Part B will receive Cycle 1 Day 1 dose  (e.g., the first dose of study drugs) 
and be observed for 5 days before additional subjects in the co hort receive study drug (e.g., subject 
two onward are dosed). The first subjects to be dosed in subseq uent cohorts w ill not be required 
to observe the 5-day interval between treatment start dates.

3.5 Cohort Expansion (Parts C, D, and E)
The purpose of cohort expansion is t o gather add itional safety, tolerab ility, preliminar y efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS-986156 as monotherapy or in comb ination with 
nivolumab. 
Part C consists of cohort expansions with BMS-986156 monotherap y in 2 disease-restricted 
populations: (i) NSCLC subjects with progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during 
or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior platin um doublet-based chemotherapy 
and (ii) persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in disease-restricted populations: (i) NSCLC, (ii) cer vical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) 
squamous cell carcinoma head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (v i) HCC.

No more than 5 subjects previously found to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
therapy will be enrolled per cohort (see definition of “rapid pr ogressors” in Section 3.1).
Each of the cohort in cohort expansion phase will contain appro ximately 40 subjects. (Please refer 
to more details in Section 8.1.2 ).
Parts E includes two cohorts with one as cervical and another for other solid tumors for signal 
seeking and exploration of Q4W dosing respectively. Due to the pu rpose of signal confirming in 
cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response rates of the othe r solid tumors cohort (I-O 
experienced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, SCCHN, and H CC), approximately 40 
subjects are planned for each c ohort in part E. For in itial safety evaluation of 480 mg BMS-
986156/480 mg nivolumab Q4W 6 subjects for a safety lead-in will  be enrolled and followed for 
a minimum of two weeks (refer to Section 3.6 for the rationale for two week period) prior to 
opening full enrollment of Part E.

Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansio ns will be performed throughout 
enrollment in the expansion cohorts. If at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment-related toxicit ies 
meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all subjects treated ac ross all cohorts treated within 
monotherapy and combination therapy phases at the same dose, th e findings will be discussed and 
further enrollment may be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity and after

assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested 
lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.
3.6 Dose-limiting Toxicities
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be define d based on the incidence and grade 
of AEs for which no alternate cause can be identified ( Section 4.3.1 ).  The incidence of DLTs 
which occur within 4 weeks following the start of study therapy  will guide dose escalation 
decisions. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer I nstitute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). For the purposes of subject 
management, drug-related AEs occurring at any time which meet t he DLT definition will lead to 
dose interruption a nd/or permanen t discontinuation of study drug as defined in Section 4.3.6 .
The DLT evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatmen t and continues for 4 weeks, that 
is, through Day 28 of the first cycle in both Parts A and B. Subjects discontinued during DLT 
observation period due to DLT are also considered as DLT evaluable. Based on the predicted human T-HALF of BMS-986156 of 2 weeks, this interval is expected to cover the anticipated time frame for the occurrence of clinically significant immediate an d early onset AEs related to (i) 
single dose BMS-986156 monotherapy or first combination dose wi th nivolumab and, (ii) repeat 
dosing of monotherapy BMS-986156 as well as combination dose wi th nivolumab. 
3.6.1 Safety observation time for Q4W dosing 
Part E will consist of an initial safety lead in period of up to 12 subjects. Six subjects need to 
complete the 14 day observation period before the full expansion cohorts, of up to 40 subjects, are
opened. Patients who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-
related toxicity may be replaced.  An observation period of 14 da y s has been chosen based on 
pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation for BMS-986156, ba sed on PK parameters derived 
from preclinical studies.
In part E, BMS-986156 w ill be evalu ated at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) with 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.  The BMS-986156 480 mg Q4W dose is much l ower than the already 
assessed safe dose of 800 mg Q2W dose (given as monotherapy and combination with nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W). Additionally, PK predictions indicate that BMS-9861 56 concentrations during the 
first 2 weeks after treatment with 480 mg Q4W will be higher tha n those achieved by first 240 mg 
Q2W dose of BMS-986156 Figure 3.6.1-1 . However, BMS-986156 levels after first 480 mg dose 
will be markedly lower than the Cmax achieved after 1st or 2nd dose of 240 mg BMS-986156 
within 7 days, as indicated by the dotted lines below in Figure 3.6.1-1. A similar trend is expected 
for nivolumab 480 mg Q4W when compared with nivolumab 240 mg Q2 W. Although levels of 
BMS-986156 and nivolumab with 480 mg Q4W dosing regimens are pr edicted to be lower than 
the concentrations achieved after 2nd dose with Q2W dosing within 7 days, an additional 7 day safety margin was included to give a 14 day safety observation p eriod was chosen.  This measure 
ensures that nivolumab concentrations will be well below the Cmax  seen with the tested 240 mg 
nivolumab plus BMS-986156 combination dose evaluated in part D
. A strict safety monitoring in patients will continue throughout
the study.

3.7 Stopping Rules During Cohort Expansions
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansio ns will be performed throughout
enrollment in the expans ion cohorts. If at a ny time, the a ggregate rate of t reatment-related toxicities 
meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all subjects tr eated across all cohorts treated within 
monotherapy and combination therapy phases at the same dose, the findings will be discussed and 
further enrollment may be interrupted. If an expansion cohort is  discontinued due to toxicity, a 
new cohort at a previously tested lower dose level , or an altern ate treatment regimen (see Table  
3.4.1-1 ) may be considered based on the aggregate safety experience and in consultation and 
agreement between Investigators and Sponsor. 
All safety signals throughout the conduct of the study w ill be reviewed by the BMS- 986156
Medical Surveillance Team (MST). If unexpected safet y findings are identified between scheduled 
MST meetings, an ad hoc meeting will be convened as appropriate.  
Efficacy and safety will be continuously monitored and go/no go  decision will be made by 
discussion with sponsor based on totality of data after assessi ng benefit/risk ratio in combination 
with clinical judgement.

used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 hal f-lives of the study drug(s) plus 
30 days).
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.
•Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified 
in Section 5.1 .
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event 
that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
•The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the sub ject.
9) Use a condom in male subjects with female partners.
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
1) Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and/or post-ovu lation methods)

3.9.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any femal e who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as  12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition,

females under the age of 55 years must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with HRT are likely to have artificially suppre ssed FSH levels and may require a 
washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is 
a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested 
guidelines and the Investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be 
considered postmenopausal. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.
3.10 Concomitant Treatments
3.10.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
a) Immunosuppressive agents (except as stated in Section 3.10.3 ), unless they are utilized to 
treat an AE.
b) Concomitant therapies are allowed but must be recorded on the c ase report form (CRF).
c) Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medica tions within 14 days of 
study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses > 10 
mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of  active autoimmune 
disease.

3.10.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes 
(e.g., allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen for each subject.  Imaging contraindications a nd contrast risks should be 
considered in this assessment.  Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast should not be given to  subjects with severe renal 
insufficiency (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) because of 
increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in this subject  population. In these patients, 
alternative imaging tests, or MRI without gadolinium should be considered. In addition, subjects 
are excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.   
The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual subject i n this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the Investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.

3.10.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Systemic tr eatment with a short course of 
steroids (< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating study drug is permitted. A brief course of 
systemic corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye al lergy) or for treatment of non-
autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reac tion caused by a contact allergen) 
is permitted.
•Systemic immunosuppressive agents and the use of systemic corti costeroids are permitted in 
the context of treating AEs. Subjects receiving corticosteroids  for treatment of drug-related 
AEs must be at < 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent prior to re -initiation of study therapy for 
7 days. Subjects may c ontinue to receive HRT.
•Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articu lar, intranasal, and inhalational
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).
3.10.4 Palliative Local Therapy
•Palliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be offered to all subjects on 
the trial after the DLT evaluation period. Limited radiation therapy or surgery to control 
isolated lesions is permitted for subjects who have investigator assessed clinical benefit 
following consultation with the BMS Med ical Monitor. 
•Subjects should not receive study treatment during radiation as the potential for overlapping 
toxicities with radiotherapy and BMS-986156, or combination of BMS-986156 and nivolumab 
currently is not known. Anecdotal data suggest that radiotherapy  administered to subjects while 
receiving nivolumab therapy is tolerable. However, because concurrent radiotherapy and immunotherapies in cancer have not  been formally evaluated, in cases where palliative 
radiotherapy is required for a tumor lesion, then BMS-986156 alo ne or BMS-986156 in 
combination with nivo lumab should be withheld for at least 1 week before, during, and 1 week 
after radiation. Subjects should be closely monitored for any p otential toxicity during and after 
receiving radiotherapy, and AEs related to radiotherapy should r e s o l v e  to G r a d e  1  p r i o r  t o  
resuming study therapy.
•Subjects who have received palliativ e local therapy will be doc umented as having had disease 
progression for the purpose of efficacy analyses.
3.11 Discontinuation of Subjects Following Any Treatment with Study Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue invest igational product (IP) (and non-I P at the discretion of the 
Investigator) for any of the following reasons:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment and/or participation in the study
•Any clinical AE, laboratory a bnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the 
subject
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infect ious disease) illness
•Pregnancy

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
•Documented and confirmed disease progression as defined by RECI ST (see Appendix 3 ) 
unless subject meets criteria for treatment beyond progression (Section 3.11.1)
•Clinical deterioration while receiving active study therapy tha t in the opinion of the 
Investigator indicates that continued participation in the study  is not in the best interest of the 
subject 
•Discretion of the Investigator
•Inability to comply with t he protocol requirements
•Protocol defined reasons for discontinuation (see Section 4.3.6 ).
In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/Designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the Investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study drug, a discussion between the I nvestigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/Designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue IP should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedures as 
outlined in Section 3.3. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject with draws consent 
for all study proce dures including post-treatment study follow-up or loses the abi lity to consent 
freely (e.g., is imprisoned or i nvoluntarily incarcerated for t he treatment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
3.11.1 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
As described in Section 1.1.3 accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects with sol id 
tumors treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit d espite initial evidence of PD. 
Subjects will be permitted to continue on treatment beyond init ial RECIST v 1.1 (see Appendix 3) 
defined PD, as long as they meet the following criteria:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit, and do not have rapid di sease progression
•Continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria
•Tolerance of study drug
•Stable performance status
•Treatment be yond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving any additional nivolumab or 
BMS-986156 treatment, using an ICF describing any reasonably for eseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternative treatment options
•Absence of signs or symptoms indicating disease progression
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from cont inued treatment. All decisions to 
continue treatment beyond init ial progression must be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor

and an assessment of the risk/benefit of continuing with study therapy must be documented in the 
study records. Subjects will be re- consented to explain the rat ionale for this ongoing treatment . 
3.11.1.1 Discontinuation Due to Further Progression (Confirmed Progression)
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined 
as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of init ial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should be used as the reference baseline 
for comparison with the post-progression assessment.
Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of initial  progression may become 
measurable and therefore must be included in the tumor burden measurement as follows:
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pr ogression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must  have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). 
For statistical analyses that include the investigator-assessed  progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment be yond initial i nvestigator-assessed, RECIST v1.1-defined progression will be 
considered to have investigator-assessed progressive disease at  the time of the initial progression 
event.
3.11.1.2 Assessment Schedule for Subjects with Post-progression Treatment
Subjects should continue to receive monitoring according to the  On-Treatment Assessments in 
Section 5.3 . Radiographic assessment by computerized tomography (CT; preferre d) or MRI 
described in Section 5 is required when subjects continue post-progression treatment. For subjects 
that discontinue post-progression tr eatment with study therapy, no additional radiographic 
assessments will be required.
3.12 Post Study Drug Follow up
Post-study follow- up is of criti cal importance and is essential to preserving sub ject safety and the 
integrity of the study. Subjects who discontinue study drug mus t continue to be followed per the 
Safety Follow-up (approximately 100 days).
3.12.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug w ill remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him /her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects sho uld notify the Investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from  future follow-up in writing, whenever possible. The withdrawal 
of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records  by the Investigator, as to whether 
the withdrawal is from further tr eatment with st udy drug only or also from study procedures and/or 
post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital 
status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local 
law.
3.12.2 Lost to Follow-up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with pe rsons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability to  reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject t o one registered mail letter. All attempts 
shoul d be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If Investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow-up portion of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the Investigator may use a Sponsor-retained 
third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up portion of the study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public h ealth registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If a fter all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined  by the Investigator should be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An IP, also known as investigat ional medicinal product in some regions, is defined a 
pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tes ted or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing aut horization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized 
indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regu lations. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study su bjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel accordin g to local regulations. 
In this protocol, IPs are:  BMS-986156 and nivolumab.
4.1.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for prev entative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as non-
IPs. 
In this protocol, non- IP(s) is/are: Not applicable for this stu dy.
4.1.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug i s stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, the study drug should not be dispensed 
and contact BMS immediately.
Non-study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
IP documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be mainta ined that includes all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includ es documentation of drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, recons titution, and use of required 
processes (e.g., required diluents, administration sets).For non-IP, if marketed product is utilized, it should be stored in accordance with the package 
insert, SmPC, or similar.
For treatment visits where both BMS-986156 and nivolumab are ad ministered, nivolumab will be 
administered first for 30 minutes followed by BMS-986156 at leas t 30 minutes after completion 
of the nivolumab infusion. Further details regarding preparatio n and administration will be 
provided separately in site/pharmacy training materials4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
This is an open-labeled study. All subjects must be assigned a subject number upon providing 
signed written informed consent. During the Screening visit, th e investigative site will call into the 
enrollment option of the IVRS designated by BMS for assignment of a 5-digit subject number that 
will be unique across all sites. Enrolled subjects, including t hose not dosed, will be assigned 
sequential subject numbers . The patient

Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
identification numbe r (PID) will ultimately be comprised of the site number and subject number. 
For example, the first subject screened (e.g., enrolled) at site number 1, will have a PID  
. Specific instructions for using IVRS will be  provided to the i nvestigational sites in a 
separate document.
Once it is determined that the subject meets the eligibility criteria following the Screening visit, 
the investigative site will call the IVRS within 3 days pri or to the first s tudy drug administration 
for the subject to be either: 
•Assigned to a part (Part A or Part B) and dose cohort in the dose escalation portion of the study
•Assigned to a part (Part C, D, or E F) and dose cohort in the dose  expansion portion of the 
study. 
During dose escalation, all subjects will be assigned to Part A  until the decision is made to start 
the combination with nivolumab at n-1 dose level. Subsequently,  treatment in Part B will be 
initiated and escalation in the 2 parts will occur in parallel.  Treatment assignments for subjects 
eligible for both Part A and Part  B will alternate between the 2 parts, with consecutively treated 
subjects assigned to different parts through IVRS whenever poss ible.  If there are no openings 
available in the part to which the subject would be assigned by this algorithm, then the subject will 
be assigned to the next open part/cohort.
During dose escalation (Part A and Part B), subjects who are not evaluable for DLT determination 
may be replaced. Replacement subjects w ill be assigned to the same part (Part A or Part B) and 
dose, but will be assigned a new subject number.
Subjects in expansion cohorts in Parts C and D and E may be added if  adequate paired pre-
treatment and on-treatment biopsy specimens are not obtained. T he replacement subject will 
receive the same tr eatment as the s ubject being replaced but a new subject number will be assigned.
Escalation and expansion may be open in parallel. Once expansion is open subjects eligible for 
parts C and D and E based on tumor type, may be assigned to any open cohort.  
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Each subject w ill be assigned to a specific dose level as listed in Section 4.2 in sequential order 
during dose escalation. Subjects in cohort expansion w ill be tr eated at the MTD, the MAD, or at 
an alternate dose(s), as agreed upon by the Investigators and t he Sponsor.
Nivolumab will be administered as flat doses in cohorts B and D a t 240 mg and in cohort E, at 
480 mg. There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivol umab allowed once assigned. 
Subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous do se. There are no pre-medications 
recommended for nivolumab on the first cycle. If an acute infus ion reaction is noted, the subjects 
should be managed according to Section 4.3.7 .
BMS-986156 will be administered as flat dosing at the doses listed in Section 1.1.1 .

4.3.2 Management Algorithms for Immuno-oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
from AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and BMS -986156 are considered I-O
agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AE s associated with I-O agents may 
mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms that have been developed from extensive 
experience with nivolumab to assist Investigators in assessing and managing the following groups 
of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological
•The clinical nature of AEs noted with BMS-986156 will determine  the role of the above 
algorithms for use in tox icities related to its use in this study. 
The algorithms reco mmended for utilization in this protocol are included in Appendix 4.
4.3.3 Guidelines for Dose Modification
Intra-subject dose escalation or reduction of BMS-986156 or nivol umab is not permitted in this 
study in order to allow better evaluation of extended safety an d efficacy at individual dose levels 
and schedules.
4.3.4 Dose Delays Due to Toxicity
Subjects who experience a DLT must have study drug held. Subjec ts who are required to 
permanently discontinue both study drugs are listed in Section 4.3.6 . In addition, all 
Grade 2 hepatic, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurolog ical AEs should be evaluated and 
managed per the toxicity management algorithms (Appendix 4). Su bjects not meeting guidelines 
for permanent discontinuation w ill be permitted to resume therapy based on the criteria sp ecified 
below in Section 4.3.5 . Subjects eligible to resume study therapy will resume study t herapy at the 
treatment visit following their last received study medication dose.
In Parts A and C, if there is a delay in dosing of BMS- 986156 of between 1 -12 days, the procedures 
at the original scheduled visit should be performed as soon as possible. If the delay is more than 
Revised Protocol No.: 05

Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
12 days, the visit and dose will be considered missed; the procedures at the next scheduled visit 
should be performed, and subsequent BMS-986156 doses will follo w every 2 weeks. 
In Parts B, D and E depending on the dosing schedule (See Table 5.1-2 ), if there is a delay in 
dosing of combination dose (same day dose of BMS-986156 and niv olumab) of between 
1 -12 days, If the delay is more than 12 days, the visit and dose will be considered missed; the 
procedures at the next scheduled visit should be performed, and  subsequent combination doses 
will follow after 2 weeks. 
Extensions to the per iod of dose delay s may be granted for indiv idual subjects on a case by case 
basis after specific consultation and agreement between the Inv estigator and BMS Medical 
Monitor in settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study therapy (e.g., subject deriving 
clinical benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper for manag ement of non-DLT drug-related 
AEs, or experiences delays for management of a non drug related  AE).
The end of cycle tumor assessments (i.e., CT/MRI, positron emiss ion tomography, etc) will 
continue on an every 8 weeks schedule relative to the subject’s 1 st dose regardless of any tr eatment 
delay incurred.
4.3.5 Criteria to Resume Treatment
Subsequent dosing with study therapy may resume once drug-relat ed non -DLT A Es resolve to 
Grade 1 or baseline. 
Subjects experiencing AEs not meeting criteria for permanent di scontinuation as outlined in 
Section 4.3.6 may resume treatment with study medication under the following criteria:
•Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug-rel ated AE(s) resolve to Grade 
d1 or baseline value with the following exceptions:
Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigu e;
Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity;
Subjects with Grade 2 uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision not  meeting DLT criteria 
(Section 4.3.1 ) must resolve to baseline prior to resuming study therapy;
Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed;
Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.
If the cr iteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next scheduled 
time point per protocol.
The consideration to re-init iate study therapy under these exceptions will be made on a cas e by 
case basis after considering the overall benefit/risk profile a nd in consultation between the 
Investigator and the study spons or. Any AE with c linical risk will be assessed on a case by case 
basis with the Investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor to dete rmine the risks and benefits of 
continuing on therapy following resolution versus discontinuing therapy permanently.

If treatment with study  medication is delayed > 6 weeks, the subject must be permanently 
discontinued from study therapy, except as specified in Section 4.3.6. 
4.3.6 Guidelines for Permanent Discontinuation
Subjects will be required to permanently discontinue both study drugs for the following AEs:
•Any drug related AE occurring at any time that meets DLT criteria as outlined in Sectio n 4.3.1
will require permanent discontinuation with the following exceptions :
a) Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain that re turns to grade 1 or baseline 
within 3 days with med ical intervention;
b) Grade 3 pruritus or rash that r eturns to grade 1 or baseline within 7 days or baseline with 
medical intervention;
c) Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities that d72 hours in duration;
d) Grade 4 neutropenia d5 days in duration;
e) Grade 4 increase in amylase or lipase that is not associated with clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis;
f) Grade 4 lymphopenia d5 days in duration.
•Any dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks will be cause for permanent discontinuation. Extensions 
to the period of dose delays may be granted for individual subj ects on a case by case basis after 
specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator an d BMS Medical Monitor in 
settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study therapy  (e.g., subject deriving clinical 
benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper for management of n on-DLT irAEs, or
experiences delays for management of a non-drug-related AE). 
•Accordingly, dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers  to manage drug-related AEs 
are allowed. Additionally, dosing delays > 6 weeks that occur f or non-drug-related reasons 
may be allowed if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor. 
•Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing del ay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS 
Medical Monitor must be consulted. 
•Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosin g is delayed.
All subjects who discontinue IP should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedures as 
outlined in Section 3.3. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject with draws consent 
for all study proce dures including post-treatment study follow-up or loses the abi lity to consent 
freely (e.g., is imprisoned or i nvoluntarily incarcerated for t he treatment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s compl etion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
4.3.7 Treatment of Drug-related Infusion Reactions
Since BMS-986156 and nivolumab contain only human immunoglobulin  protein sequences, it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, r igors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other sympt oms. All Grade 3 or 4 i nfusion

reactions should be reported wit hin 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE 
if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; interventi on not 
indicated)Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infus ions: diphenhydr amine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before a dditional study 
drug administrations.For Grade 2 symptoms: Moderate reaction requires ther apy or infusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatmen t [e.g., antihistamines, non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for d24 
hours.
•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusi on of norm al saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); monitor subject until resolution of symptoms.
•Bronchodilator or corticosteroid therapy may also be administer ed as appropriate.
•The infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original i nfusion r ate when symptoms resolve; if 
no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the 
original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely.
•The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the CRF.
•If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab, as the case may be,  will be administered at that 
visit.
•The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for f uture infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of Solu Cortef or equiva lent) may be used.
Late-occurring symptoms: In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms 
(e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticostero ids).
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [e.g., not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for other clinical sequelae 
[e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]; Grade 4: life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated). 
Immediately discontinue study drug infusion. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylpred nisolone 100 mg IV (or

equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the I nvestigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Study drug will be permanently disconti nued. Investigators should follow 
their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis . Remain at bedside and monitor 
subject un til recovery from symptoms. In the case of late-occur ring hypersensitivity symptoms 
(e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticoste roids).
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.5 Treatment Compliance
Study drug w ill be administered in the clinical facility by trained medical  personnel. Treatment 
compliance will be monitored by drug accountability, as well as  by recording BMS-986156 and 
nivolumab administration in subjects’ medical records and CRF.
4.6 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced b y the Investigator) such as partially 
used study drug containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspec ted and reconciled by the 
responsible BMS Study Monitor unless study drug containers must be immediately destroyed as 
required for safety, or to meet local regulations (e.g., cytoto xics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal s tandards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s standard operating systems and a copy pro vided to BMS upon request.
•Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identif ication of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible BMS  Study Monitor will make 
arrangements for return of study drug.
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are 
kept.

Results of all laboratory tests required by this protocol must be provided to BMS, either recorded 
on the laboratory pages of the CRF or by another mechanism as a greed upon between the 
Investigator and BMS (e.g., provided electronically). If the uni ts of a test result differ from those 
printed on the CRF, the recorded laboratory values must specify the correct units. Any abnormal laboratory test result considered clinically significant by the  Investigator must be recorded on the 
appropriate AE page of the CRF (see Section 6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities).
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Disease assessment with CT and/or MRI as appropriate will be performed at baseline and every 8 
weeks during Treatment Phase until disease progression per RECIS T v1.1 (see Appendix 3 ), or 
until confirmed disease progression for subjects treated beyond p rogression [
defined as an additional 
10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of ini tial progression (including all target lesions 
and new measurable lesions)] , discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from study. Tumor 
assessments at other time points may be performed if the Investigator is concerned about tumor progression. Assessment of tumor response will be reported by t he Investigator for appropriate 
populations of subjects as defined by RECIST v1.1
148(see Appendix 3) for subjects with solid 
tumors. Same modality/s canner should be used for all assessments.
Changes in tumor measur ements and tumor responses will be assessed by the Investigator using 
RECIST criteria. Investigators w ill also report the  number and size of new lesions that appear 
while on-study. The time point tumor assessments will be reported on the CRF based on Investigators’ assessment using RECIST criteria. Please refer t o Appendix 3 for specifics of 
RECIST v1.1 criteria to be utilized in this study.

5.5.1 Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Collection and Processing
Table 5.5.1-1 lists a detailed sampling schedule to be followed for the assess ment of PK and 
immunogenicity for BMS-986156 as a monotherapy and in combinati on with nivolumab. All time 
points are relative to the start of BMS-986156 and nivolumab adm inistration. Pre-dose samples 
shoul d be taken within 30 minutes before the start of dose administra tion. End-of-infusion samples 
should be taken just prior to the end of infusion (EOI; prefera bly within 2 minutes). Further details 
of sample collection, processing, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory procedures 
manual. On-treatment PK samples are intended to be drawn relati ve to actual dosing days; if a 
dose occurs on a different day w ithin the cycle due to delays o r minor schedule adjustments, PK

pre-dose sample should be collected just prior to the delayed d ose. However, if a pre-dose sample 
is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additiona l pre-dose sample should not be 
collected.
Additional samples for immunogenicity assessments and serum con centration, referred to as 
“ADA Event Driven” samples, may  be collected and justified in ca ses of Grade 3/4 infusion or 
hypersensitivity reactions (see Section 4.3.7 ). The immunogenicity (and corresponding serum

have a causal relationship with  this treatment. An AE can there fore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), sympt om, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considere d related to the study drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
AE. The causal relationship can be one of the following:
•Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and the 
AE.
•Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug administration 
and the AE. 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended  questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent r eporting bias, subjects should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately 
life-threatening or may not result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate 
medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention 
[eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outc omes listed in the definition 
above; examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization). Potential drug-induced liver injury (pDILI) is also considered 
an important medical event (see Section 6.6 for the definition of potential pDILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and pDILI are not always serious by regulatory definition, 
these events must be handled as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).

Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS c linical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24  hours that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•routine h ealth assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth and planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentation is require d in these cases.
•admission encountered for another life ci rcumstance that carrie s no bearing on health s tatus 
and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (e.g., lack of ho using, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and ReportingSections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB
98represent the Reference Safety Information to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the sub ject’s written consent to 
participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not rela ted to study drug, must be collected, 
including those thought to be associated with protocol-specifie d procedures. All SAEs must be 
collected that occur during the screening phase and within 100 d ays of discontinuation of dosing., 
except in cases where a study participant has started a new ant i-neoplastic treatment.
However, any SAE occurring after the start of a new anti-neopla stic treatment that is suspected to 
be related to study treatment by the investigator should be repo rted.
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrati ve section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Rep ort Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The pr eferred method for SAE data 
reporting co llection is th rough the electronic (e)CRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance 
forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning. In this case, 
the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC ), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used a nd submitted immediately only 
in the event that the electronic system is unavailable for tran smission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same Investigator term(s) initial ly reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report. 
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Non-serious Adverse Events
Anon-serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection o f nonserious AE i nformation should begin at initiation of study drug 100 days after 
discontinuation of dosing or until starting a new anti-neoplast ic treatment (whichever occurs first) 
at the time points specified in the study assessments and proced ures ( Section 5 ). Nonserious AE 
information should also be collected from the start of a placeb o lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those pre sent at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and  described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported / identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than  laboratory term, would be used by 
the reporting Investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the IP, it is subsequently discover ed that a study sub ject is pregnant or 
may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 5 half-lives after 
product administration, the Investigator must immediately notify  the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregn ancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting p rocedures described in 
Section 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion 
of benefits and risk with the subject.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, X-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The Investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) M edical Monitor of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) within 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Se ction 6.1.1. 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information, must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occur rences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (pDILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a pDILI event. All occurrences of pDILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1) Aminotransferase (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times ULN,
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of ch olestasis (elevated serum ALP),
AND

3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, preexisting chro nic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final PEs, EC G, x-ray filming, and any other 
potential safety assessment required or not required by protoco l should also be recorded as a 
nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordin gly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
8.1.1 Dose Escalation
As a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial, the sample size at each dose in these arms depends on observed 
toxicity and posterior inference. A pproximately 60 subjects are expected to be treated during the 
dose-escalation phase (around 30 subjects for BMS-986156 monotherapy and around 30 subjects for BMS-986156 in combination with nivolumab). Initially approx imately 3 subjects will be 
treated at the starting dose levels of BMS-986156 or BMS-986156  in combination with nivolumab. 
Additional subjects will be treated in recommended dose levels per BLRM (-Copula) during the 
dose-escalation phase. At most 12 DLT-evaluable subjects will be  treated at each dose level.
Additional subjects may be treated at any dose level at or belo w the MTD or MAD (if no MTD is 
identified) for further evaluation of safety, PK parameters as r equired. At most 12 
DLT-evaluable subjects will be treated at each dose level.
8.1.2 Cohort Expansion
Part C contains 2 cohorts of 25 subjects each in monotherapy cohort expansion,. Each cohort in 
the combination cohort expansion phase (parts D and E) will con tain approximately 40 subjects. 
Forty subjects in parts D and E are planned with the goal of ac hieving a width of approximately 
20% in the 95% confidence interval for ORR, and to provide addi tional information on safety. 
Patients in any cohort who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-related toxicit y may be replaced.  
For initial safety evaluation of 480 mg BMS-986156/480 mg nivol umab Q4W in Part E, 6 subjects 
will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 weeks (please refer to Section 3.6 for the 
rationale for 2 week period) prior to opening Part E to full enrollment. 
If in a cohort of 40 subjects, 10 or 15 responses are observed, then the lower limit of the one-sided 
90% CI for the ORR would be 16%, and 27% respectively. These calculations are made using the 
Clopper-Pearson method for exact confidence intervals. If the t rue ORR in a tumor type is 40%, 
then with 40 subjects there is 93% chance of observing at least 12 responses, and 87% chance of observing at least 13 responses, and there is 7% chance of observing 11 or fewer responses.

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
Continuous interim evaluations and monitoring of safety and efficacy based on the totality of data 
will be carried out throughout the expansion phase. Decisions r egarding continuing enrollment 
based on these evaluations will be made through discussion between the Sponsor and investigators based on totality of data and overall clinical activity (such as  but not limited to duration of 
response, quality of response, clinical assessment of response a nd/or SD and safety). The number 
of subjects receiving treatment of t he planned sample size is ap proximate and may exceed the 
specified numbers due to unknown time to response and true recr uitment rate (i.e additional
participants may be enrolled to compensate the 25%-35% of the screening failure rate in 
combination with the non response evaluable rate to account for par ticipants who may drop out
of the study without being evaluable for response and/or true recruitment rate is much higher 
than anticipated and thus, Sponsor will examine on the totality  of data to determine the benefit/risk 
ratio as well as overall clinical activity when making the final Go/no Go decision.

8.3.2.2 Efficacy
The second antitumor activity of BMS-986156 alone and BMS-986156 in combination with 
nivolumab will be measured by ORR and duration of response based  on RECIST 1.1. Disease 
assessment with CT and/or MRI as appropriate will be performed at baseline and every 8 weeks 
during Treatment Phase until disease progression per RECIST v1. 1, or until confirmed disease 
progression for subjects treated beyond progression [defined as  an additional 10% or greater 
increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and 
new measurable lesions)], discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from study. Subjects having 
received local palliative therapy will be documented as having h ad disease progression for the 
purpose of efficacy analyses. 
•Best overall response (BOR): defined as the best response desig nation over the study as a 
whole, recorded between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to 
subsequent therapy. BOR is assessed by investigator (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
•ORR is defined as the proportion of all treated subjects whose BOR is either a CR or PR.
•Duration of response, computed for all treated subjects with a BOR of CR or PR, is defined as 
the time between the date of first response and the date of dis ease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. 
•PFSR at 24 Weeks : The proportion of treated s ubjects remaini ng progressi on free and surviving 
at 24 weeks . The proportion will be calculated by the K-M estimate which t akes into account 
censored data.

contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who choose complete 
abstinence are not required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to have 
pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effecti ve 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.

APPENDIX 1 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
STATISTICAL DETAILS FOR BAYESIAN LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (BLR M 
AND BLRM-COPULA) AND PRIORS FOR DOSE ESCALATION1 MODEL SETUP FOR BMS-986156 MONOTHERAPY (PART A):
1.1 Monotherapy Methodology Description 
An adaptive 2-parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM ) guided by the escalation 
with overdose control (EWOC) principle
1,2,3will be used to guide the dose escalation of 
BMS-986156 in the monotherapy phase. 
The BLRM will be fitted on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) data  collected within the 28-day DLT 
period to model the dose-toxici ty relationship of BMS-986156 in the monotherapy dose escalation 
phase. 
The dose-toxicity relationship for BMS-986156 alone is assumed t o follow a logistic model:

where ݌௜is the probability of toxicity at dose level ݀ଵ௜. Note that the ߙଵandߚଵparameters are 
assumed positive, and ݀ଵכis the reference dose for BMS-986156 ( ߙଵand ߚଵare defined in 
Section 1.2.1).
1.2 Prior Specification for BMS-986156 Monotherapy
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distr ibutions for model parameters which 
include parameters ( ߙଵ, ߚଵ) for BMS-986156. The prior distributions for this single agent  activity 
were derived using the meta-analytic-predictive (MAP)3approach based on CD137 agonist 
(BMS-663513) dose- DLT data.
Derivation of prior distribution of these parameters is provide d in the following subsections.
1.2.1 Prior Derivation for BMS-986156 Parameters ( ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢻ૚ሻ,ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢼ ૚ሻ)
A mixture prior will be used for param eters (ߙଵ, ߚଵ) for BMS-986156. There are two bivariate 
normal components in generating this mixture prior:
•MAP component: Obtained from the dose-DLT data from CD137 agoni st (st udy CA 186001 
and study CA186006) using the MAP approach. 
•Weakly informative component: Reflecting the potential of differ ent toxicity of BMS-986156 
and allowing for considerable prior uncertainty.

2 MODEL SETUP FOR BMS-986156 AND NIVOLUMAB COMBINATION 
(PART B)
2.1 Methodology Description for Combination therapy
Toxicity profiles of both BMS-986156 monotherapy and nivolumab m onotherapy will be 
incorporated to develop the combination model framework. A copu la-type model will be used to 
cover all general combination cases, including additive and syn ergistic effects. The combination 
of the 2 treatments w ill be explored using a Bayesian hierarchic al model by utilizing the toxicity 
profiles of both BMS-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209-003, Ph ase 1 nivolumab 
monotherapy data in advanced solid tumors). The following copul a-type model4will be used to 
describe the probability ݌௜௝of toxicity when dose level ݅of agent A and dose level ݆of agent B are 
administered in combination:

guess toxicity probability for agent B, ݉and ݊characterize the individual drug effect, and 
ߛଵcharacterizes the drug-drug interactive effect.
The joint toxicity framework models the toxicity rates of both agents as well as their interaction 
effects in a 7-parameter hierarchical model, where each monother apy dose-toxicity relationship 
will be characterized by a 2-param eter BLRM model (see Section 1.1 ). There are 3 additional 
parameters for the copula-type model, one for each agent ( mand n) as well as one for the 
interaction term ( ߛଵ). A dose-toxicity surface will be characterized for different dose combinations 
of these 2 agents. 
As there are currently neither historical data nor prior knowled ge to indicate how much 
information is to be borrowed for each of the single agents, pa rameters mand nare both set to be 
1, meaning borrowing 100% of the information from the 2 agents.  The above formula is then 
simplified into a 5-parameter model as follows:

.
Since only a fixed nivolumab dose (240 mg) will be used in the BMS-986156 and nivolumab 
combination arm, this surface will be simplified into a 2-dimen sional dose-toxicity curve. 
Posteriors for the corresponding 5 parameters (2 logistic regression parameters [ ߙଵ,ߚଵ] for BMS-
986156 and 2 logistic regression parameters [ ߙଶ,ߚଶ] for nivolumab, as well as 1 interaction 
parameter for the copula-type model [ ߛଵ, which will be discussed in d etail in the following 
section]) will be fitted into the in-house developed model. The  model implements the above-
described theoretical setup.2.2 Prior Specification for Combination Studies
2.2.1 Marginal Prior for BMS-986156
Posterior information on log(
D1) and log( E1) from the m onotherapy part of the study will be used 
as marginal BMS-986156 prior for combination with nivolumab. Thi s prior information will be 
continuously updated when addi tional toxicity (DLT) information  from the monotherapy (Part A) 
is available.

2.2.2 Marginal Prior Derivation for Nivolumab Parameters (log( DD2), log(EE2))
Similar to BMS-986156 monotherapy in the monotherapy phase, the l ogistic model for nivolumab 
is as follows:

assumed positive, and ݀ଶכis the reference dose for nivolumab.
The toxicity profile of nivolumab has been evaluated in several studies. A bivariate normal prior 
for the nivolumab model parameters (log( D2), log(E2)) was obtained by extracting a posteri or for 
nivolumab using DLT and safety data from the Study CA209003, which is used later as the meta-
analytical-predictive (MAP) prior for nivolumab.

2.2.3 Prior for Interaction Parameters for Joint Toxicity of BMS-986156 and 
Nivolumab Combination
A gamma prior distributio n for the interaction parameter ɀଵis derived to reflect the current lack of 
knowledge regarding the toxicity profile of the combination of BMS-986156 and nivolumab. 
Although no PK drug-drug interaction is expected, the possibili ty of a significant positive 
interaction between BMS-986156 and nivolumab cannot be totally e xcluded. The interaction 
parameter ɀଵwas chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty in orde r to allow for the 
possibility that the interaction may be positive or negative. T herefore, the following assumptions 
are made for the interaction parameter:
•ɀଵfollows a gamma distribution and with a mean centered at 1.1, w hich means the combination 
of 2 agents is likely to have only a small synergistic effect.
•The standard deviation of Ȗ1is 0.8, such that there is a 45% prior probability that ߛis larger 
than 1. 
This model assigns the highest probability to there being small  synergistic interaction and also 
allows for the potential of larger synergism of the toxic profiles. It also does not completely ignore 
the possibility of antagonism because there is also a 55% prior  probability that ɀ ଵis less than 1.

3 DECISION RULE FOR DOSE ESCALATION AND SIMULATION
3.1 Parameters for Dose Recommendation Decision for the Monotherapy  
and Combination Therapy
In Parts A and B, the BLRM and BLRM-Copula models w ill be utilized for dose recommendations 
after DLT information becomes available for each dose cohort an d each dose level. Final dose 
selection for the next dose cohort w ill be based on BLRM (- Copula) dose recommendations in 
combination with the totality of d ata available on all dosed subjects , after discussion and agree ment 
between investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor.
The Bayesian Logistic Regression Method (BLRM) with an overdose  control principle (escalation 
with overdose control [EWOC]) was selected as an appropriate de sign for the dose escalation parts 
of this study for the monotherapy setting. For the combination s etting, the BLRM-Copula model, 
which is an extension of the BLRM design, will be utilized.  BL RM (-Copula) is similar to the 
rule-based method (ie, 3 + 3 des ign) in that th e cohort size is  approximately 3 subjects for each 
subject cohort and the toxicity boundaries are set at a minimum  16% (~ 1 in 6) dose- limiting 
toxicity (DLT) rate and a maximum 33% (~ 1 in 3) DLT rate. These  boundaries were chosen in 
order to target a dose that has meaningful activity but not unacceptably high toxicity. A minimum 
16% DLT rate ensures that the model does not guide to use of too low a dose and sacrifice 
opportunity for benefit without meaningful improvement in safet y. The 33% maximum is chosen 
as this would be the maximum DLT rate where a positive benefit/ r i s k  r a t i o  i s  l i k e l y  t o  b e  
demonstrated.
Compared with the rule-based method, when recommending the next dose level, BLRM offers 
more accuracy and efficiency in determining the true MTD by inc orporating historical data and all 
previous on-study DLT data. The BLRM model also quantifies the benefit and risk during the dose 
level decision making process. When DLT data are incorporated i nto the model, the distribution 
of predicted DLT rates (based on posterior estimation) for a sp ecific dose level will be updated 
accordingly. The predicted DLT rates will be categorized according to the following 3 categories: 
•“under-dosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between 0% and up to 16%
•“target dosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between over 16 % and up to 33%
•“overdosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between over 33% a nd 100% 
Following the principle of EWOC, after DLT information is obtai ned from each cohort, the 
candidate doses are those with less than 25% chance of excessiv e toxicity for monotherapy and
with less than 35% chance of excessive toxicity for combination th e r a p i es . T h e s e  t w o  E W O C  
cutoffs are selected after examining various cutoffs in simulation studies by optimizing the chance of identifying the true MTDs under different scenarios. Only th e candidate dos es will be 
considered for dose decision by Investigators and BMS study personnel based on all relevant data available from all dose levels evaluated in the ongoing study.

For dose expansion, the final recommended maximum tolerated dose  (MTD)/recommended Phase 
2 dose (RP2D) of BMS-986156 alone and in combination with nivolu mab will be based on the 
recommendation from the BLRM (-Copula) model and a synthesis of all the data available on all 
dosed subjects, including clinical and laboratory safety assess ments, PK  
data, and efficacy data from all  treated patients at each dose level MTD/RP2D.
To examine the operating characteristics of BLRM (-Copula) method , simulations for 
BMS-986156 alone and in combination with nivolumab were conducted. Simulation details are shown in the following sections.
3.2 BLRM (-Copula) Dose Escalation Recommendation Rules and Tool s
Recommendations for the next dose level will be provided by BLRM (-Copula) models 
(considering available DLT information) together with the follo wing dose escalation rules for 
BMS-986156 alone and in combi nation wit h nivolumab:
•Dose levels for the next cohort w ill be based on evaluating 4 potential recommendations: 
escalate, de-escalate, stay at same dose level, or stop and sel ect a new dose other than pre-
specified doses.
•Escalation by more than 1 dose level (dose skipping) is not per mitted in real trial conduction. 
•Based on model suggestions and a review of the available safety , PK, and PD data in 
combination with clinical recommendation, lower doses of BMS-98 6156 may be tested if none 
of the planned doses are found to be tolerated as monotherapy o r in combination with 
nivolumab. Such decisions will be made after discussion and agr eement between the 
investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor.
•No intra-subject dose escalation of BMS-986156 is allowed at an y dose level.
•Dose de-escalation can be recommended by the model, and the fin al decision will be made 
based on clinical recommendation.
BLRM Stopping Rules during Dose Escalation 
•If all of the c urrent pre-specified doses are considered intolerable according  to the pre-specified 
cutoff, then the model will recommend stopping the current dose  level and a new dose level 
lower than the current lowest dose level will need to be identi fied (EWOC stopping). 
•The maximum number of subjects in a dose level will be 12. This  limit is set to avoid instances 
in which the model could recommend adding subjects indefinitely  to a specific dose level due 
to uncertainty in the tolerability profile. 
•If, for a specific dose level, 6 subjects have been treated and  the chance of determining that 
dose level to be the “target” dose is > 50%, then the model wil l suggest to stop the arm and 
declare the current dose level to be MTD.

4 INTERIM MONITORING CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE BLRM (-COPULA)
PROVISION OF RECOMMENDATIONS DURING DOSE ESCALATION
In order to provide a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the  models, different hypothetical 
scenarios exploring all possibilities are examined. For the sim plicity of illustration purposes, a 
static cohort size of 3 subjects is applied for dose levels 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg and 240 mg in the 
BMS-986156 monotherapy and for the dose level 30 mg in the combination setting. This cohort 
size could vary during the actual clinical trial, and the BLRM (-Copula) models are designed t o fit 
various different cohort sizes, adaptively. In general, there are 4 possible scenarios for a specific dose level, which are 0 DLT observed in 3 total subjects in that cohort (denoted as 0/3), 1 DLT 
observed in 3 subjects (1/3), 2 DLTs observed in 3 subjects (2/ 3), and 3 DLTs observed in 3 
subjects (3/3).
During interim monitoring, posterior probabilities will be updated when there is new DLT 
information available. The following three visualization plots will be produced to reflect the real 
time dose-DLT relationship, to quantify benefit (in the form of  target dosing) and risk (in the form

of overdosing and underdosing) during model’s recommendation process, and to facilitate clinical 
team’s interpretation of the model recommendations for the fina l decision making:
•Dose-DLT profile for the doses ranging between 0 mg and 1000 mg (Figure 1).
•Stacking histograms displaying predictive probabilities on DLT rates classified into 3 different 
categories (Underdosing, Target dosing and Overdosing) ( Figure 2).
•Box plots summarizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample s of predicted DLT 
rates for the 5 pre-specified dose levels ( Figure 3).
Figure 1: Updated dose-DLT profile after incorporating prior information and 
all previous DLT information up to 30 mg (in cluding all monotherapy 
DLT data for BMS-986156 up to 100 mg)
Interpretation and usage of Figure 1:
Figure 1 is a snapshot of an updated dose-DLT profile with DLT information available at dose 
level 30 mg for combination studies. The dose-DLT profile is capt ured with a continuous dose 
spectrum ranging from 0 mg to 1000 mg, which is a slice of the do se-DLT surface of the 
combination of two drugs with Nivolumab fixed at 240mg. For eac h dose within the range, there 
is a corresponding distribution of the predicted DLT rates calculated from the posterior samples of 
the model parameters. This figure will be updated each time new DLT information becomes 
available from the combination studies. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS-986156 
monotherapy.
In Figure 1, there are 3 different quantiles (2.5%, 50%, and 97 .5%) plotted to characterize the 
current trend of the toxicity profile (as shown by the 50% quan tile), as well as the variation of the 
dose-DLT profile (as shown by the 2.5% percentile and the 97.5%  percentile), according to the 
accumulation of DLT data from all previous and c urrent dose levels. The toxicity boundaries 
(0.16 and 0.33) are illustrated in two dotted horizontal lines t o benchmark the way in which the 
dose-DLT profile is trending. 
Intermediate dose levels can be identified using different boundary cutoffs. For example, using the 
50% percentile curve (green highlight), which represents the ne arly average DLT distribution for 
each dose level, the 50 mg could be a potential intermediate dose level corresponding to the lower

pre-specified DLT rate boundary of  0.16, and the 375 mg could be  a fitted MTD dose level 
associated with the upper boundary of 0.33. 
Moreover, if all of the current pre-specified doses are conside red intolerable (overdosing 
probabilities > 0.35 for combination therapy, a case not shown o n the current Figure 1), the model 
will recommend to stop the current dose level, and the clinical  team can leverage the current 
updated dose-DLT curve to pinpoint a new dose, which is lower t han pre-specified lowest dose 
(10 mg) by using the DLT rate boundaries.
Figure 2: Updated stacking histogram after incorporating prior information 
and all previous DLT information up to 30 mg (including all 
monotherapy DLT data up to 100 mg for BMS-986156) to classify 
predicted DLT rates into 3 categories (Underdosing, Target Dosing 
and Overdosing)
Interpretation and usage of Figure 2:
Figure 2 is a snapshot of stacking histogram with DLT informati on available at dose level 30 mg
for the combination studies. This figure will be updated each time new DLT information becomes 
available in the combination setting. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS-986156 
monotherapy.
When recommending the next dose level, the model will first exc lude doses that are intolerable 
(with overdosing probabilities > 35%, the rate that has been spe cified for BMS-986156 in 
combination with nivolumab). Among those qualified candidate do ses that are considered 
“tolerable”, the model will select the dose that maximizes the probability of being within the target 
toxicity range (DLT rate of 16% up to 33%). 
As illustrated in Figure 2, when there is 1 DLT observed out of 3 subjects for the dose level 30 mg, 
the distribution of predicted DLT rates will be characterized i nto possibilities falling into 
3 different categories. First, dose levels of 240 mg and 800 mg for BMS-986156 are excluded 
according to the higher-than-cutoff (0.35 for combination thera py) overdosing probabilities (0.384
for 240mg and 0.595 for 800mg). Among the remainder of tolerable dose levels (10 mg, 30 mg, and 100 mg), the BLRM-C opula model recommends the dose that maxi mizes the probability of 
being within the target dosing interval. Therefore, the model’s  recommendation would be to

escalate to 100 mg, which is associated with the highest target  dosing probability of 0.311
compared with that of 30 mg (0.295) and 10 mg (0.263).
Similarly (although not shown on Figure 2 ), according to the rules specified above, the model 
could possibly recommend to de-escalate to a lower dose level t han current treated dose level, 
extend the current dose level, or even recommend to stop and id entify a new dose level lower than 
10mg, the lowest pre-specified dose level. Please refer to description of Figure 1 for details on 
how to specify the new dose levels.

previous DLT information up to 30 mg in combination setting

Interpretation and usage of Figure 3:
Figure 3 is a snapshot with DLT information available at dose l evel 30 mg for the combination 
setting. The dose-DLT distributions calculated from the posterior samples of the model parameters 
are characterized in the format of boxplots for the pre-sp ecified dose levels. This figure will be 
updated each time there is new DLT information available.  Simi lar graphs will also be produced 
for the BMS-986156 monotherapy.
This plot supplements the information provided in Figure 1. It allows for a more in-depth and

variability in the DLT rates for each pre-specified dose level.
4.1 Illustration for BMS-986156 Monotherapy Dose Escalation under  
Different Scenarios using the BLRM Model
According to safety consideration and clinical judgement, the dose level 10 mg is recommended 
as the starting dose for BMS-986156 monotherapy. With the current BMS-986156 prior specified 
in the Section 1.2.1 (Table 2 ) and all av ailable DLT information up to 100 mg, a corresponding 
decision tree illustrating various models’ recommendations unde r all possible scenarios (for dose 
levels of 240 mg and 800 mg) is provided in  Figure 4 .
Tracing a branch of the decision tree in Figure 4 illustrates t he decision making process. Taking 
the left-most branch of the tree as an example, starting at 10 mg, there was 0 DLT observed at

10 mg in the real clinical trial, the model recommended to escalat e to 30 mg, one lev el above the 
current treated dose level according escalation rules per proto col (as detailed in Protocol Section 
5.1). Additionally, there was 0 DLT observed at 30 mg in real data , the model recommended to 
escalate further one dose level to 100 mg. A further 0 DLT observation at 100 mg enabled the 
model to make a recommendation to escalate to 240 mg, currently  240 mg is within DLT 
observation period to collect DLT information.
As illustrated in Figure 4, there are 10 potential decision path s for dose levels 240 mg and moving 
onwards up to 800 mg, as real time clinical data has been taken into consideration of this decision 
tree. During the actual clinical study, the tree would be narro wed or deepened based on actual DLT. 
The clinical team will be able to lever age this  decision tree to preview decisions at each interim 
monitoring step and to plan proactively.

APPENDIX 3 RECIST 1.1
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable t umor lesion. When CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measur able lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.
Central assessments may be planned for this study. Copies of all  scans should be kept at the site 
as part of the subject study file. At the Sponsor’s discretion,  scans may be collected centrally for 
further analysis.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized meas urable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable lesions 
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in 
the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum siz e of:
•10 mm by CT/MRI scan - (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which canno t be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
•20 mm by chest x-ray
•Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be t15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline a nd in follow-up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
•All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with t10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesi ons.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningea l disease, ascites, pleural 
or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangi tic involvement of skin or 
lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by phy sical exam that in not 
measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-2019 175
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques suc h as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined sim ple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-mea surable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described  above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in a n area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable un less there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by methods of measurements
1.4.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). Al l baseline evaluations should 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and ne ver more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used  to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesi on(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
1.4.2.1 CT/MRI scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is  based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the sl ice thickness.
1.4.2.2 Chest X-ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progr ession is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identify ing new lesions. However, lesions

Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly  defined and surrounded by 
aerated lung.
1.4.2.3 Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and t10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging , imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
1.4.2.4 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a  method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the  course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised. 
1.4.2.5 Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluat ion is not advised.
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselv es to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) f or all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
2.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structur es which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
tt15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to t he baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathologi cal and should not be 
recorded or followed.

Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) includi ng pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not r equired and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesio ns involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple e nlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify f or PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
3.1.1 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomic al structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological n odes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
tt15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathologi cal and should not be 
recorded or followed.
3.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should h ave their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e g, 2 mm). If the radi ol ogist i s 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded,  even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measure to then:
•If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has lik ely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-2019 178
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
•If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but  too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness 
(but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). 
3.1.1.3 Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions 
should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained tha t would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the  lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of  the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points  specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesion s. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)  above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non-target lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the subject also has measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-ta rget disease, there must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease  such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. 
3.2.1.2 When the subject has only non-measurable disease 
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-ta rget disease, there must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
•Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quanti fied (by definition: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied w hen assessing subjects for 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-2019 179
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measura ble disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in 
a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural  effusion from ‘trace’ to 
‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in th erapy’. 
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be con sidered to have had overall 
PD at that point. 
3.2.1.3 Tumor markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers a re initially 
above the upper normal limit, howev er, they mus t normalize in o rder for a subject to be 
considered as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differenc es in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something oth er than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-ex isting lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject’s baseline lesions show  partial or complete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, 
which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical lo cation that was notscanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease p rogression. An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan 
ordered which reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastase s are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new di sease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
3.3.1 FDG-PET evaluation
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is  sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of the qualitative assessment of FDG-PET sc anning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘n ew’ disease). New lesions on the 
basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the fol lowing algorithm: 
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:

Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up c orresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, this is PD. 
If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial positive 
FDG-PET scan).
If the positive FDG-PET at follo w-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
4 RESPONSE CRITERIA
4.1 Time point response
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified  in the protocol. 
For subjects who have measurable disease at baseline Table 4.1-1 provides a summary of the 
overall response status calculation at each time point.
Table 4.1-1: Time point response: subjects with target (+/– non-target) disease
Target lesions Non-target lesions New lesions Overall response
CR CR No CR
CR Non-CR/non-PD No PR
CR Not evaluated No PR
PR Non-PD or not all evaluated No PR
SD Non-PD or not all evaluated No SD
Not all evaluated Non-PD No NE
PD Any Yes or No PD
Any PD Yes or No PD
Any Any Yes PD
CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, NE =not evaluable.
Missing assessments and not evaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
Revised Protocol No.: 05

BMS-986156 anti-gitr
assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can 
be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion( s) would not have changed the 
assigned time point response.
4.1.1 Confirmation Scans 
• Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required at least 4 weeks later to 
ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.
4.2 Best overall response: All timepoints
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is  the best 
response recorded from the start of the study tr eatment until the date of  objectively documented 
progression based on RECIST v1.1, taking into account any requi rement for confirmation, or the 
date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first i n the study. The subject’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . 
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criter ia for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4  weeks later). 
In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpre ted as specified in Table 4.2-1.
When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the proto col specified  minimum time 
from baseline. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at le ast once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, NE = not evaluable.
aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poi nt (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD w as met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact the subject had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the orig inal CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.
4.3 Duration of response
4.3.1 Duration of overall response 
The duration of over all response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that r ecurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive dis ease the smallest measurements 
recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
4.3.2 Duration of stable disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomizatio n) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum  on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).
CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires the following:
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of  disease and disease-related 
symptoms, if present before therapy.
a) Typically [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lympho ma: in p atients with no 
pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) scan or when the PET scan was 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-2019 183
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
positive before thera py, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as 
it is PET negative.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph  nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on computed tomography (CT) scan to normal size ( d1.5 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved 
nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in  their short axis before 
treatment must have decreased to d1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therap y on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical exam ination and should be 
considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related t o lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not  always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in s ize may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged s pleen 
may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hem atopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than lymphoma.
3. If the bone marrow was involv ed by lymphoma before treatment,  the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on whic h this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is 
indeterminate by  morphology, it s hould be negative by immunohis tochemistry. A sample that 
is negative by immunohistochemistry but demonstrates a small pop ulation of clonal 
lymphocytes by flow cytometry will be considered a CR until dat a become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diame ters (SPD) of up to 6 of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses s hould be selected according 
to all of the following: they s hould be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible they s hould be from disparate regi ons of the body; and they s hould 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by t50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a P R, if the sample was positive 
before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large-cell 
lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a C R by the above criteria but 
have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be con sidered partial responders. 
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical  CR was achieved but with 
no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be c onsidered partial responders.
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.

7. FDG:
a) Typically FDG-avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatmen t PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before thera py, the post-treatment PET should  be positive in at least 
1 previously involved site.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients  without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymph oma, a PET scan is only 
indicated wit h 1 or at most 2 residual masses that have regressed by > 50% on CT; those 
w i t h  m o r e  t h a n  2  r e s i d u a l  l e s i o n s  a r e  u n l i k e l y  t o  b e  P E T  n e g a t i ve and should be 
considered partial responders.
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
1. A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to at tain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see R elapsed Disease 
[after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2. Typically FGD-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at p rior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET scan.
3. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
Lymph nodes s hould be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it shou ld only be considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes d1.0 x d1.0 cm will not be considered abnormal for relapse 
or progressive disease.
1. Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or a t the end of therapy, even if 
other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a  previously unaffected site 
should only be considered relapsed or PD after confirmation wit h other modalities. In 
patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT 
are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision s hould not be made solely on the basis of the 
PET without histologic confirmation.
2. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic  or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node wit h a diameter of the short axis o f < 1.0 cm must increase by 
t50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.
3. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single  previously identified node 
> 1 cm in its short axis.

4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG-avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner si milar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disea se. Disease that is only 
assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, 
while an a bnormality is still noted by imaging studies or physi cal examination, it is found to be 
histologically negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majorit y of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary or appropriate for use (eg, a trial in pat ients with MALT lymphoma), 
response should be assessed as above, but only using CT scans. H owever, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

APPENDIX 4 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non inflammatory etiologies should b e considered and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may b e considered for ambulatory patients with 
low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of  oral corticosteroi ds should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended. The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covere d by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 5 CHILD-PUGH SCORE
Scoring
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1-3, with 3 
indicating most severe derangement.
ParameterPoints Assigned
123
Ascites Absent Slight Moderate
Bilirubin (mg/dL) d2 2 to 3 > 3
Albumin (g/dL) > 3.5 2.8 to 3.5 < 2.8
Prothrombin Time 
(seconds over control)1-3 4 to 6 > 6
INR < 1.7 1.8 to 2.3 > 2.3
Encephalopathy None Grade 1 to 2 Grade 3 to 4
Interpretation
Chronic liver disease is classified into Child-Pugh class A to C, employing the summation of 
score from above. These scores correlate with one and two year survival:
Points Class One year survival Two year survival
5-6 A (well compensated disease) 100% 65%
7-9 B (significant functional 
compromise)80% 60%
10-15 C (decompensated disease) 45% 35%

APPENDIX 6 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 04, 22-Nov-2017
The significant change in revised protocol 04 is the extension of treatment with BMS 986156 
and nivolumab for up to 2 years. Data suggest that 2 years of P D-1 checkpoint inhibitor 
treatment may be sufficient for long-term benefit.  Revisions apply to all participants enrolled as applicable.  
Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 04
Section Number & 
TitleDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Section 3.1 Study 
Design and Duration
Treatment PhaseIncreased the number of maximum treatment 
cycles from 6 to 13.This increases the number of cycles 
to support 2 year duration
Section 3.2 Treatment 
with additional cycles 
Beyond 24 weeksAfter completion of 3 cycles (24 weeks), 
qualifying subjects may receive 3 additional 
cycles. Subjects completing 6 cycles (48 
weeks) in CR, PR or SD may be eligible for an 
additional 7 cycles.This increases the number of cycles 
to support 2 year duration of 
treatment

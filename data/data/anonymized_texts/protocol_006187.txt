 1. Background and scientific  rationale  
 
Since there are no known curative therapeutic options for SARS -CoV-2 infection (and 
the related clinical disease COVID -19) patients with potentially life -threatening disease, 
there is consi derable interest in passive transfer of immunity using plasma from patients 
who cleared virus and mounted a successful humoral immune response. Human 
convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin has been used as treatment of many 
viral illnesses and could b e rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of 
people who have recovered1. These individuals with adequate levels of IgG or IgM titers 
and confirmed clearance of virus are ideal donors of convalescent plasma. The natural 
history of this disease w ith a substantial majority clearing the disease spontaneously 
lends itself to the development of a strategy around convalescent donor plasma for 
seriously affected patients2. 
 
Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given ag ent to a 
susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due 
to that agent. Use of convalescent plasma has been studied in outbreaks of other 
respiratory infections, including the 2009 -2010 H1N1 influenza virus pandem ic, 2003 
SARS -CoV-1 epidemic, and the 2012 MERS -CoV epidemic3-6. Convalescent plasma or 
immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients 
with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulse d 
methylprednisolone6. In the 2013 African Ebola epidemic too, a non -randomized study 
in Sierra Leone revealed a significant increase in survival for those treated with 
convalescent whole blood relative to those who received standard treatment5. A meta - 
analysis of 32 studies pooling SARS coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed 
a consistent and overall statistically significant reduction in the odds of mortality 
following CP therapy, compared with placebo or no  therapy7. 
 
In the ongoing COVID -19 preliminary data have emerged suggesting clinical benefit8. 
Shen et al showed treated 5 patients with COVID -19 pneumonia with convalescent 
donor derived plasma between day 10 - 20 of hospitalization. All were severely ill with 
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (4 patients) or ECMO at the time of 
therapy. The administered donor plasma had demonstrable anti –SARS -CoV-19 
antibodies and in vitro studies demonstrated neutralizing activity. Notably all patients 
had clinical and virologi c improvement in about a week after plasma with resolution of 
fever, improved SOFA scores and SARS -CoV-2 viral clearance between 1 and 12 days 
after receipt of plasma. The results are confounded by the co -administration of antiviral 
treatment primarily wit h lopinavir/ritonavir (although this therapy was not shown to be 
effective in a randomized study)9. All patients also had an increase in neutralizing 
antibody titers. Very similar promising results have been reported by a group from China 
who reported clin ical improvement in 10 patients treated with a single 200 mL of 
convalescent  plasma.  
 
The major caveats to these data are the lack of a control group and the subsequent 
inability to determine the true clinical effect of this intervention or whether patient s might 
have recovered without this therapy. Additionally, the timing of plasma administration  
Protocol: Convalescent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection 
Protocol Version 4 dated: 3/10/2021       Page 10 of  38  
 has been pointed out as a matter of debate since it is not clear if earlier administration 
might have been associated with different clinical outco mes2. We believe that the data 
from Shen et al provide strong evidence to support the possibility of evaluating this in 
larger cohort involving patients with COVID -19 and moderate to severe illness. Passive 
antibody administration is currently the only mea ns of providing immediate immunity to 
susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for COVID -19 patients10. 
 
In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes 
time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some 
immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response.  
 
Thus, passive antibody therapy has a storied history going back to the 1890s and is 
summarized by Casadevall et al10. Prior to the development of specific anti microbial 
therapy this was in fact a mainstay of therapy. In the case of SARS -CoV-2, there is 
clear evidence of the development of neutralizing antibodies, both IgM and IgG fairly 
quickly after infection in patients who demonstrate viral clearance. In a se ries of 23 
patients, To et al showed that viral load peaked during the first week of illness then 
gradually declined over the second week. IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on 
around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion  within the 
first 3 weeks11. Most importantly, IgG and IgM antibody levels against the SARS -CoV-2 
internal nucleoprotein (NP) and the surface spike receptor binding domain (RBD) 
correlated with neutralizing activity. As more individuals contract COVID -19 and 
recover, the number of potential donors will continue to increase and make this more 
feasible for the growing number of severely ill individuals  too12. 
 
A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for 
prophylax is or earlier in the disease course than for treatment of advanced disease.  
When used for therapy, antibody is most effective when administered shortly after the 
onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in efficacy is not well understood 
but co uld reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing the initial inoculum, which is 
likely to be much smaller than that of established disease. Another explanation is that 
antibody works by modifying the inflammatory response, which is also easier durin g the 
initial immune response, at which time the patient may not be too symptomatic13. Our 
plan is to treat a majority of patients who are sick enough to warrant 
hospitalization prior to the onset of overwhelming disease. Additionally, a smaller 
cohort of patients who need ICU level care will be enrolled provided expected life 
expectancy is >72 hrs. Given the data from Shen et al we feel it is reasonable to 
treat patients who are on mechanical ventilation but not those with overwhelming 
disease.  
 
The plasma  product we administer will be collected by Versiti per AABB and GMP 
approved protocols from recovered asymptomatic individuals who have complete 
resolution from SARS -CoV-2 infection, virologic clearance and presence of 
antiviral antibody titers.

 There are news reports that convalescent plasma was used for therapy of patients with 
COVID -19 in China during the current outbreak 
(http://www.xinhuanet.com/engl ish/2020 -02/28/c_138828177.htm). Although few details 
are available from the Chinese experience and published studies involved small 
numbers of patients, the available information suggests that convalescent plasma 
administration reduces viral load and was safe.  
 
Ancillary Research Laboratory Studies:  
 
Exploring the inflammatory and hemostatic milieu in severe COVID -19: 
Evidence is accumulating that the inflammatory and hemostatic response is uniquely 
engaged in COVID -infected patients. Coagulopathy, microva scular, arterial, and venous 
thrombosis are being reported with increasing frequency14,15. The response of the 
immune and hemostatic system to COVID infection is largely unknown. We plan to 
investigate hemostatic pathways during the hospitalization phase o f patients receiving 
plasma therapies . 
 
Investigating the specificity and affinity of SARS -Co-V2 antibodies:  
Although convalescent COVID -19 sera likely have neutralizing antibodies against 
SARS2 -CoV-2, the quantity and quality of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent sera 
from each individual will vary dramatically. It is not clear which characteristics of SARS - 
CoV-2-specific antibodies in the infused plasma determine the antiviral potency.  
Moreover, as noted above administration of convalescent sera possesses risks of 
causing inadvertent side effects such as immunological reactions, transfusion -related 
acute lung injury, or antibody -dependent enhancement. In contrast,  
a human recombinant monoclonal neutralizing antibody against SARS2 -CoV-2 can be 
selected to have the characteristics associated with high antiviral potency and 
overcome the potential risks, can be produced on a large scale and safely used  
as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for SARS -CoV-2 infection. Based on our 
experience in cloning antigen -specific B cells from human patients and our studies of 
PF4/heparin -specifi c B cells, we propose two specific research analyses. First, we will 
investigate the role of isotype, specificity and affinity in determining neutralization 
potency of SARS -CoV-2-specific antibodies in COVID -19 convalescent sera and study 
the antibody resp onses in COVID -19 patients through single -cell sequencing. Secondly, 
we will clone RBD -specific antibodies from single B cells of convalescent COVID -19 
patients.  
 
The proposed  studies  will help to identify  the most  potent  sera and monoclonal  antibodies 
from convalescent COVID -19 patients for prophylaxis and/or treatment of COVID -19. 
These  approaches  will help prevent  SARS -CoV-2 spread  among  high-risk individuals  i.e. 
frontline  health  care providers  and people  that are coming  into close  contact  with patients 
and will likely be used to treat patients with  COVID -19.

 2. Known potential risks from clinical  trial 
 
a. An important theoretical risk involves the phenomenon of antibody -mediated 
enhancement of infection (ADE). ADE can occur for several viral diseases and 
involves an enhancement of disease in the presence of certain antibodies. For 
coronaviruses, several mechanisms for ADE have been described and there is 
the theoretical concern that antibodies to one type of coronavirus could enhance 
infection to another viral strain (12). It may be possible to predict the risk of ADE 
of SARS -CoV-2 experimentally, as proposed for MERS. Since the proposed use 
of convalescent plasma in the COVID -19 epidemic would rely on preparations 
with high titers of neu tralizing antibody against the same virus, SARS2 -CoV-2, 
ADE may be unlikely. The available evidence from the use of convalescent 
plasma in patients with SARS1 and MERS (13) and evidence of its use in 
patients with COVID -19 (Shen et al), suggest it is safe.  Nevertheless, caution 
and vigilance will be required as proposed in the safety end  points.  
 
b.  Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to 
SARS -CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that 
those individua ls mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them 
vulnerable to subsequent re -infection. In this regard, passive antibody 
administration before vaccination with respiratory syncytial virus was reported to 
attenuate humoral but not cellular immun ity (14). This concern could be 
investigated as part of a clinical trial by measuring immune responses in those 
exposed and treated with convalescent plasma to prevent disease. If the concern 
proved real these individuals could be vaccinated against COVID -19 when a 
vaccine becomes available. These concerns seem modest compared to the 
possibility of limiting the duration and severity of disease, and avoiding 
interventions like mechanical ventilation, ARDS and  sepsis.  
 
c.  Transfusion associated risk common to a ny blood products could also be 
associated with donor plasma including transmission of transfusion transmitted 
viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, anaphylaxis to 
transfusion, febrile transfusion reaction, transfusion related  acute lung injury 
(TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and ABO mediated 
hemolysis. In order to minimize the risks of disease transmission, standard 
pathogen reduction techniques will be utilized as per Versiti protocol. Using 
donors wh o fulfill donor eligibility requirements, blood donation, and frequent 
apheresis plasma donation with the exception of recent illness, in this case 
COVID -19 infection.

Protocol Version 4 dated: 3/10/2021       Page 13 of  38  
 3. Known potential benefits of clinical  trial 
 
A key potential benefit is treatment for established infection. Convalescent plasma 
would be administered to those with clinical disease in an effort to reduce their 
symptoms and mortality. Based on the historical experience with antibody 
administration, i t can be anticipated that antibody administration relatively early in the 
course of disease would more effective in preventing disease progression than in the 
treatment of established severe  disease.  
 
Given that historical and current anecdotal data on use  of convalescent plasma suggest 
it is safe in coronavirus infection, the high mortality of COVID -19, particularly in elderly 
and vulnerable persons, suggests that the benefits of its use in those at high risk for 
death or with early disease outweigh the ri sks. However, for all cases where 
convalescent plasma administration is considered, a risk -benefit assessment must be 
conducted to assess individual  variables.

Protocol Version 4 dated: 3/10/2021       Page 14 of  38  
 Primary Safety Objective:  
 
Evaluate the safety o f treatment with high -titer anti -SARS -CoV-2 plasma in hospitalized 
patients with COVID -19 respiratory symptoms.  
 
Primary Safety Endpoints:  
 
1. Rapid deterioration of respiratory or clinical status on transfusion of SARS -CoV-2 
convalescent plasma due to presum ed antibody dependent enhancement or 
other mechanisms. Since patients in this study are already in respiratory distress, 
further worsening of respiratory status will be defined as below and causes 
attributed by treating physician. Any escalation of oxygena tion or ventilatory 
needs within the 12 hours after plasma infusion will be considered as a 
deterioration. This includes new requirement for supplemental oxygen in a 
person not on oxygen, an increase of >25% in FiO2; need for non invasive or 
invasive mecha nical ventilation in subjects not requiring these at the time of 
infusion. In patients already on mechanical ventilation, an increase in PEEP and 
or FiO2 of >25% will also be considered a respiratory  deterioration.  
2. Cumulative incidence of all serious adverse events attributed to plasma therapy 
during the study period: transfusion reaction (fever, rash), transfusion related 
acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), 
transfusion related  infection

 5.3 Subject  Withdrawal  
 
1. Subjects or HCPOA can terminate study participation and/or withdraw consent at any time 
without  prejudice.  
2. Subjects who withdraw from the study who have received study treatment will not be 
replaced. Subjects who have never received study treatment can be  replaced.  
3. The investigator may withdraw subjects if they are lost to follow up, non -compliant with 
study procedures or if the investigator deter mines that continued participation in the study 
would be harmful to the subject or the integrity of the study  data.  
4. Discontinuation of the study: the study sponsor, FDA and IRB all have the right to 
terminate this study at any  time.  
 
6. Treatment  
 
1. Study drug:  The investigational product is anti -SARS -CoV-2 convalescent plasma 
obtained from patients identified as having recovered from COVID -19 as per Versiti 
plasma collection  protocols.  
2. Donors and samples will have been screened for transfusion -transmitted infec tions (as per 
current AABB and FDA standards) both through the use of the uniform donor 
questionnaire and FDA mandated blood donor screening tests by  Versiti.  
3. ABO compatible plasma will be used to reduce risk of hemolysis.  
 
6.1 Rationale for doses  
 
Recommended  dose will be 2 units of plasma for all patients.   
 
6.2 Study drug administration  
 
• Drug will be administered once consent, eligibility confirmation, enrollment, and 
screening/baseline procedures have been  completed.  
• Infusion rate  500 mL/hour.  
• Pretreatment to minimize transfusion reactions (e.g. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine)  may 
be given per investigator and clinical care team  discretion.  
• If an AE develops during infusion, the infusion may be slowed or stopped as per 
investigator’s  decision.  
o Most reactions to plasma are relatively minor and the infusion can generally be 
continued. Infusion site burning and non -allergic systemic effects can generally be 
managed with slowing of the infusion. Infusion can generally be continued in cases of 
itching  or hives after pausing the transfusion, administering antihistamines, and 
observing the patient for worsening  symptoms.  
o Severe allergic reactions such as, bronchospasm and hypotension, and may require 
discontinuation of the  infusion.

Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 19 of  38  
 6.3 Concomitant  medications  
 
Concomitant medications will be documented on the CRF and these include:  
 
• Prescription  medications  
• Any other clinical  trials  
• Over the counter  medications  
• Herbal treatments/nutritional  supplements  
• Blood products  administered  
 
7. Statistical  considerations  
 
Patients will be enrolled in 2 cohorts independent of each other. C ohort 1 will consist of 41 
patients who are admitted to the ICU. Cohort 2 will consist of 90 patients who are admitted to a 
non-ICU floor. The two cohorts will be analyzed independently. For sample size considerations 
please see section 7.6.  
 
For each cohort, descriptive summaries of continuous and other numeric variables will consist of 
the summary statistics: median, minimum and maximum values. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by the frequency and proportion of subjects falling into each categ ory. Unless 
otherwise indicated, percentages in tables will be column percentages, using the total number of 
observations in the population as the denominator. Exact confidence intervals for binomial 
proportions will be derived using the Clopper -Pearson me thod.  
 
7.1 Analysis of AE data  
 
Analysis of AE data will primarily be descriptive based on MedDRA coding of events. The 
proportion of subjects experiencing an SAE and the proportion experiencing a Grade 3 or higher 
event will be presented.  
 
7.2 Analysis of anti -SARS-CoV-2 titers  
 
Analysis of titers will also primarily be descriptive, at days 0,4, 7 and 14 post study treatment 
administration.  
 
7.3 Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
 
Cohort 1: Delta SOFA Score (change in SOFA score) from baseline at the time of plasma 
infusion to 96 hours post infusion (ICU cohort).  
 
The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) Score is a mortality prediction score that is 
based on the degree of dysfunction of six organ systems. The score is calculated on admission 
and every 24 hours until discharge using the worst parameters measured during the prior 24 
hours16. Calculation of SOFA score is described in Appendix 117. 
 
Cohort 2: Combined primary end point of death, intubation or ICU transfer (non -ICU cohort).  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 20 of  38  
 Primary Hypotheses:  
 
Cohort 1: the probability of decrease in SOFA score of at least 2 after 96 hours from the 
intervention is higher than 20%. An increase to 40% would be clinically meaningful.  
 
Cohort 2: the probability of death, intubation or ICU transfer is lower than 60%. A decrease to 
45% would be clinically meaningful.  
 
7.4 Analysis of primary endpoints  
 
The proportion of patients achieving the pr imary endpoint will be reported with a two -sided 95% 
exact Clopper -Pearson confidence interval. The primary hypothesis will be evaluated using an exact 
binomial test at a one -sided 2.5% significance level.  
 
7.5 Analysis of secondary endpoints  
 
7.5.1  Type and duratio n of respiratory  support  
The number of patients requiring each type of respiratory support will be tabulated. The duration of 
support will be summarized with median and inter -quartile range. For the purposes of this protocol 
respiratory support will be captured and classified in the following categories18: 
1. Supplemental Oxygen by nasal cannula, simple mask, non -rebreather mask and defined by 
flow rate in  liters/min  
2. High Flow Nasal Oxygen with flow rates and FiO2  setting  
3. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with flow, FiO2 and pressure settings  defined  
4. Mechanical Ventilation with FiO2, Pressure and ventilator settings  defined  
5. Extra corporeal Membrane Oxygenation  (ECMO).  
 
7.5.2  Overall mortality within first 60  days  
The overall survival of the s ubjects will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and presented 
with 95% confidence bands. Subjects may be censored if they had a routine discharge (not hospice, 
or another hospital), and could not be contacted for further follow -up. Overall mortalit y at 60 days 
post-intervention will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier estimate.  
 
7.5.3  Hospital LOS and in -hospital  mortality  
In-hospital mortality will be estimated as the observed proportion of subjects who died during the 
hospital stay and presented with a 95% exact Pearson confidence interval. Hospital length of stay 
will be considered only among subjects discharged alive and will be summarized with median and 
inter-quartile range.  
 
7.5.4  ICU LOS and ICU  mortality  
ICU length of stay and mortality will be consider ed in Cohort 1 and among subjects in Cohort 2 who 
are admitted to an ICU. ICU mortality will be estimated as the observed proportion of subjects who 
died during the hospital stay and presented with a 95% exact Clopper -Pearson confidence interval. 
ICU lengt h of stay will be considered only among subjects discharged alive and will be summarized 
with median and inter -quartile range.  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 21 of  38  
 7.5.5  Ventilator -free days  
Ventilator -free days will be considered only in Cohort 1. It will be defined as the number of days 
during 28 days after the intervention that the subject is alive and does not require ventilator support. 
Ventilator -free days will be summarized with median and inter -quartile range.  
 
 
7.6 Sample size  considerations  
 
The cohort sizes were select ed to achieve at least 80% power of rejecting the null hypotheses at a 
one-sided 2.5% significance level if the true probability of the primary outcome is at its clinically 
meaningful value. A single stage exact binomial study design was used.  
 
Cohort 1: W ith 41 subjects the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of ≤20% 
probability of a 2 -point decrease in SOFA at a one -sided 2.5% significance level, if the underlying 
probability is 40%. The treatment will be considered successful if 14 or  more subjects achieve the 
primary endpoint.  
 
Cohort 2: With 90 subjects the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of ≥60% 
probability of death, intubation or ICU transfer, if the underlying probability is 45%. The treatment 
will be consi dered successful if 44 or fewer subjects achieve the primary endpoint.  
 
 
8. Study procedures  
 
Consenting Process:  
 
Consent is difficult in patients with acute respiratory symptoms who are in isolation. Therefore, an 
electronic or phone call or video conference consenting process will be used to document informed 
consent from patients or HCPOA (refer to section 13.3 for  further details) . Research staff will make 
contact info available to patients who have further inquiries about the project. Once a patient 
consents to participate in the trial, a member of the study team will assign them a unique patient 
number (UPN). The se UPNs will be assigned to subjects sequentially (MCW -COV -001, MCW -COV - 
002, MCW -COV -003, etc.). Patients are enrolled on the trial once they have consented and are 
deemed eligible.  
 
Day -3 to -0: 
1. Subject informed consent (obtained before performing study  related  activities)  
2. Screening (must be completed before  enrollment)  
3. Baseline Evaluation (at screening) (much of the information will be obtained from the medical 
record)  
a. Demographics (age, sex ethnicity,  race)  
b. Medical history (timing of exposure to COVID -19 source patient if known, acute and 
chronic medical conditions, concomitant medications, allergies. Any medical condition 
arising after consent should be recorded as  AE 
c. COVID -19 symptom screen (fevers, cough, shortness of breath), onset of symptoms, 
source of  contagion  
d. Vital signs  
e. Physical  exam

Clinical  Efficacy  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 23 of  38  
 Clinical assessment will be standard of care subjective symptom assessment and physical 
examination as documented in daily progress notes. SOFA score will be documented for ICU 
resident patients.  
 
Virologic measures  
 
1. Serologic positivity and neutralization antibody titers for anti -SARS -CoV-2 at days 0, 4, 7 and 
14, whenever possible given sample availability, patient mortality, reluctance to come to 
MCW for testing.  
 
10. Risks and  benefits  
 
Potential Benefits of treatment:  
The potential benefits of antiviral treatment with anti -SARS CoV -2 plasma in patients with 
respiratory symptoms consistent with interstitial pneumonia at high risk for requiring ICU 
admission are not known. However, it is anticipated that treatment will d ecrease the risk of 
disease progression requiring ICU admission and aggressive respiratory support including 
possible mechanical ventilation (and other ICU support).  
 
Potential benefits of clinical monitoring and virologic testing:  
Subjects enrolled in the study may reduce their chances of disease progression.  
 
Potential risks:  
1. Risks of plasma: Fever, chills, rash, headache, serious allergic reactions, TRALI, TACO, 
transmission of infectious  agents  
2. Risks of phlebotomy: local discomfort, bruising, hematoma, bleeding,  fainting  
3. Total blood draws will not exceed 100 mL during the entire  study  
4. Risks of oropharyngeal and throat swab: local discomfort,  vomiting  
 
Alternatives:  
The alternative to participation in this study is routine care and or other clinical trials. 
Participation in this trial does not preclude enrollment in any other clinical trial.  
 
11. Safety measures  
 
1. Laboratory evaluations consistent with ongoing standard medical care may include radiographic 
imaging modalities such  as chest x -rays and chest  CT. 
2. Clinical assessment and monitoring for infusion reaction on day of infusion as per standard of 
care blood transfusion guidelines.  
3. Safety laboratory tests (ABO typing, pregnancy testing, CBC, CRP, and comprehensive 
metabolic p anel) will be performed at the local CLIA -certified clinical laboratory as per schedule 
of assessments in Table  1. 
 
11.1 Adverse Event  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 24 of  38  
 Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject who has received a study 
intervention and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product. An 
AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or 
not considered related to the study product.  
 
Unexpected Adverse event: (UAE) An adverse reaction attributed to  infused plasma, the nature or 
severity of which is not consistent with the risks outlined in the consent form.  
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, 
located on the CTEP web site:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
An SAE is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (immediate risk of  death)  
3. Prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
4. Persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
5. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require intervention 
or escalation of care may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defin ition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient  hospitalization.  
 
11.2.1  SAEs are reported in the following  manner:  
 
All fatal or life -threatening or unexpected and suspected SAEs will be reported to the IRB and all 
applicable agencies within 24 hours and all other SAEs (non -fatal or non -life-threatening) within 4 
calendar days of study site staff awareness.  
• Every  SAE regardless  of suspected  causality  (e.g.,  relationship  to study  drugs  or study  procedure) 
occurring  after the subject  has signed  the consent  through  the 30 days  after the last dose  of study 
drugs, AND only SAEs occurring more than 30 days after the last dose of study drugs that the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to study plasma, must be reported in the study 
database SAE section. These will also be reported to the ISM (Dr. Michael Frank as below) and 
the IRB. All transfusion related AEs and SAEs have to be reported to the hospital blood bank 
additionally in order to start a transfusion AE  investigation.  
• All grade 4 and 5 SAEs and any other expedited SAE report to IRB must al so be reported to 
FDA (MedWatch 3500A described below) within five calendar days of MCW study staff’s 
awareness.  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 25 of  38  
 • In addition:  if the SAE is unexpected  and has a suspected  relationship  to the study  drug,  site must 
create a reportable event not ice with the MCW IRB, ISM and complete a MedWatch 3500A and 
submit to  FDA:  
▪ US FDA MedWatch 3500A found  here:  
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm  
 
 
11.2.2  Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subject or Other  (UPIRSO)  
 
The Office  for Human  Research  Protections  (OHRP)  considers  unanticipated  problems  involving  risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (sIRB) - 
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant popula tion being  studied.  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research).  
• Suggest s that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or  recognized.  
 
11.2.3  Adverse Events Not Meeting SAE  Definition  
 
• Any medical  condition  that is present  at the time that the participant  is screened  will be considered 
as baseline condition and captured on the baseline CRF form, not reported as an AE. All new or 
worsening AEs that occur after starting study drug until 30 days post last dose of study plasma 
will be tracked  and followed  until resolution,  stabilization  of the event  as chronic,  subject  withdraws 
consent, or is lost to follow -up (including subjects who discontinue  early).  
• Changes in the grade of an AE will be documented in the AE CRF to allow an assessment of the 
duration  of the event  at each  level of severity  to be performed.  Information  to be collected  includes 
event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, expectedness, relationship to 
study product (assessed onl y by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the  event.  
 
11.2.4  Protocol Deviation  
 
A deviation from the IRB -approved study procedures designated as serious:  
1. Serious Protocol Deviation: protocol deviation that is also an SAE and/or compromises the 
safety, welfare or rights of subjects or  others  
2. Follow safety reporting requirements listed  above  
 
11.3 Reporting  Interval  
 
All AEs and SAEs will be documented from consenting until study completion at 60 days from study 
infusion or death or discontinuation from the study. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution 
even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period.  Resolution of an adverse event is defined as the  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 26 of  38  
 return to pre -treatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic.  
 
Investigator’s Assessment of Adverse Events  
 
The determination of seriousnes s, severity, and causality will be made by an on -site investigator who is 
qualified (licensed) to diagnose adverse event information, provide a medical evaluation of adverse 
events, and classify adverse events based upon medical judgment. This includes but  is not limited to 
physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.  
 
Assessment of Seriousness  
1. Event seriousness will be determined according to the protocol definition of an  SAE 
2. Assessment of  Severity  
 
Event severity will be assigned according to the scale below  
 
1 = Mild: Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy 
required.)  
 
2 = Moderate: Some worsening of symptoms but no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required)  
 
3 = Severe: Escalation of medic al intervention/therapy required  
 
4 = Life -threatening: Marked escalation of medical intervention/therapy required. 
5= Death  
Assessment of Association  
 
The association assessment categories that will be used for this study are:  
• Associated – The event is te mporally related to the administration of the study product and no 
other etiology explains the  event.  
• Not Associated – The event is temporally independent of the study product and/or the event 
appears to be explained by another  etiology.  
 
The investigator must provide an assessment of association or relationship of AEs to the study product 
based on:  
• Temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study  product;  
• Whether an alternative etiology has been  identified;  
• Biological  plausibility;  
• Existing therapy and/or concomitant  medications.  
 
 
12. Safety Oversight  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 27 of  38  
 12.1 Monitoring Plan  
1. All AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by protocol  team.  
2. An Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) will be appointed. The ISM is a physicia n with expertise in 
infectious diseases and whose primary responsibility is to provide timely independent safety 
monitoring. An ISM has the authority to readily access study participant records. The ISM 
reviews any SAE that occurs at the study site in real  time and provides a written assessment. 
Dr. Michael Frank, Chief, Division of Infectious Diseases, Medical College of Wisconsin 
will serve in this  role. 
Study monitoring  
a. As per ICH -GCP 5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be 
adequately monitored by the study  sponsor.  
b. Informed consent process documents for each subject needs to be  available.  
c. There is compliance with recording requirements for data  points  
d. All SAEs are reported as  required  
e. Individual subjects’ study records and s ource documents  align  
f. Investigators are in compliance with the  protocol.  
g. Regulatory requirements as per Office for Human Research Protections -OHRP), FDA, 
and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are being  followed.  
 
 
12.2 Halting Criteria for the  Study  
 
The study enrollment and dosing will be stopped, and an ad hoc review will be performed if any of the 
specific following events occur or, if in the judgment of the study physician or the ISM, subject safety is 
at risk of being compromised:

Halting Criteria/Rules for Subject Infusion  
 
Infusion of study drug will be halted in a study subject  if any of the following manifestations of 
anaphylaxis develop and will not be restarted:  
 
• Skin or mucous membrane manifestations: hives, pruritus, flushing, swollen lips, tongue or uvula 
that do not respond to standard therapy with anti -allergic and steroid  medications  
• Respiratory compromise: New onset wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia related to  infusion  
• Any other symptom or sign which in the good clinical judgment of the study clinician or supervising 
physician warrants halting the infusion. For example, manifestations of anaphylaxis and may 
warrant an immediate halt prior to meeting full SAE  criteria  
 
13. Ethics/Protection of human  subjects  
 
13.1 Ethical  Standard  
 
We will ensure that the legal and e thical obligations associated with the conduct of clinical research 
involving human subjects are met.  
 
As the Department of Health and Human Services continues to strengthen procedures for human 
subjects’ protections via new regulations, MCW will review these evolving standards in relation to the 
proposed activities and will advise the investigators on those that may apply.  
 
MCW has a Federal wide Assurance (FWA) number on file with the Office for Human Research 
Protections (OHRP).  
 
This assurance commits a research facility to conduct all human subjects’ research in accordance with 
the ethical principles in The Belmont Report and any other ethical standards recognized by OHRP. 
Finally, per OHRP regulations, the research facility will ensure that th e mandatory renewal of this 
assurance occurs at the times specified in the regulations.  
 
13.2 Institutional Review  Board  
 
MCW IRB will review this protocol and all protocol -related documents and procedures as required by 
OHRP and local requirements before subje ct enrollment. MCW IRB currently holds and will maintain a 
US FWA issued by OHRP for the entirety of this study.  
 
13.3 Informed Consent  Process  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 29 of  38  
 The informed consent process will be initiated before a potential subject or their HCPOA agrees to 
participate in the study and should continue throughout the individual’s study participation. The subject 
or HCPOA will be consented before any procedures are undertaken for the study. The process for 
consent will be documented in the research records.  
 
Two al ternative consent methods will be available for this study:  
1. Electronically: transmitting a consent form via email, obtaining e -consent utilizing an iPad, or 
utilizing a cloud -based system for delivery and communicating in -person with subjects or  HCPOA.  
2. Phone Call or Video Conference: Example – this method could include utilizing the phone in the 
subject’s room or utilizing video conferencing services such as WebEx, Skype, etc to connect with 
patient and or  HCPOA.  
 
Regardless of the method utilized , a consent form will be provided to the subject either in person by 
health care staff or electronically.  
If consent cannot be obtained electronically or in person, it is required that an impartial witness will be 
present (via phone or teleconference).  
 
When a witness is being utilized, the following must occur:  
1. The witness must be present for the entire consent discussion and confirm that the potential 
subject’s questions have been  answered.  
2. The investigator must confirm that the potential subject is willing to participate and sign the consent 
form with the witness present (via phone or  teleconference).  
3. The potential subject must confirm that he or she wishes to participate and has signed and dated 
the consent  form.  
 
Documenting Informed Consent  
1. Electr onically  
Example – The consent form can be signed, scanned, and sent via email or fax from the subject to 
the team. In addition, electronic signatures can be utilized.  
2. Photograph  
Example – The subject or research team can photograph the entire signed consent form by camera, 
cellular phone, etc. and send the picture to the research team. The picture can be taken from 
outside of the isolation area as long as the signed consent form can be seen clearly.  
3. Confirmation  
Example – The impartial witness present  for the consenting process can attest that the subject 
confirmed the he/she wished to participate in the project and signed the consent form.  
 
The method of obtaining informed consent should be included in study records along with the signed 
consent form (if available). If a signed consent form is not available for the reasons outlined in this 
document, the study record should include an explanation of which method was used for confirming 
that the subject signed the consent form as well as the explanation of why the originally signed consent 
form could not be filed.  
 
An electronic copy of the signed informed consent document will be available to the subject for their 
records. The consent will explain that subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout  the 
course of the trial. Extensive explanation and discussion of risks and possible benefits of this 
investigation will be provided to the subjects in understandable language. Adequate time will be 
provided to ensure that the subject has time to consider and discuss participation in the protocol.  
Protocol: Convale scent plasma for sars -cov-2 infection  
Protocol version 4 dated: 3/10/2021             Page 30 of  38  
 The consent will describe in detail the study interventions/products/procedures and risks/benefits 
associated with participation in the study. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected  by 
emphasizing that their access to and the quality of medical care will not be adversely affected if they 
decline to participate in this study.  
 
 
 
13.4 Subject  Confidentiality  
 
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigato rs, their staff, and the 
sponsors and their agents. No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. The results of the research study 
may be published, but sub jects’ names or identifiers will not be revealed. Records will remain 
confidential. To maintain confidentiality, the PI will be responsible for keeping records in a locked area 
and results of tests coded to prevent association with subjects’ names. Data en tered into computerized 
files will be accessible only by authorized personnel directly involved with the study and will be coded. 
Subjects’ records will be available to the FDA, the NIH, the manufacturer of the study product and their 
representatives, inve stigators at the site involved with the study, and the IRB.  
 
14. Research Sample  Disposition:  
 
Research samples will be drawn from enrolled patients throughout the course of their hospitalization to 
investigate the early immune response and the impact of treatment. In coordination with these studies, 
the development of the adaptive, or immune memory  response will be investigated. These samples will 
be drawn in coordination with clinical labs and the blood volume will be limited to 30 ml. These blood 
samples will be processed and studied at the Versiti Blood Research Institute  in the labs of Drs. Demi n 
Wang, Weiguo Cui, Renren Wen, Lisa Baumann Kreuziger, Zheng Ze, Karin Hof fmeister, and Shawn 
Jobe . Dr. Weig uo Cui as lab investigator will be in overall control of sample security and distribution to 
other investigators named above .  Immunologic and hemostatic assays will be performed on these 
samples in compliance with Medical College of Wisconsin safety guidelines. Research assays will 
include in vitro studies of lymphocyte and antibody development, mediators of the immune response 
particularly circulating cytokines, hemostasis, and platelet function.  
 
Blood samples will be obtained per Table 1 and appendix 2. This will consist of 20ml citrate (blue - 
topped) and 10ml EDTA (purple -topped) tubes. If the collected blood volume is limited  by clinical 
condition, sample collection will be limited to 10ml citrate and 10ml EDTA initially, then a 10ml citrate 
tube. Blood samples will be de -identified with only  study ID# (refer to section 8), and date/time of 
collection. These samples will be pr ocessed at Versiti Blood Research Institute to obtain platelet -poor 
plasma (PPP), platelet -rich plasma (PRP), and enriched platelet and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell (PBMC) samples. Samples will then be analyzed. Residual de -identified sample will be s tored for 
batched analyses at -70C or in liquid nitrogen.  
 
Proposed research activities will take place in the laboratories at the Versiti Blood Research Institute. 
Once collected, samples will be shipped deidentified to the Versiti BRI and received by Dr.  
ui or designee and processed further for research tests as indicated above. Collection, storage, and 
communication of research samples will be conducted in a manner that is compliant with HIPAA 
regulations.

 15. Data management and  monitoring  
 
15.1 Source Documents  
 
The primary source documents for this study will be the subjects’ medical records. If the investigators 
maintain separate research records, both the medical record and t he research records will be 
considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study. The investigator will retain a 
copy of source documents. The investigator will permit monitoring and auditing of these data, and will 
allow the sponsor, IRB  and regulatory authorities access to the original source documents. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, and recorded in 
a timely manner. Source documentation (the point of initial recording of infor mation) should support the 
data collected and entered into the study database and must be signed and dated by the person 
recording and/or reviewing the data. All data submitted should be reviewed by the site investigator and 
signed as required with written  or electronic signature, as appropriate. Data entered into the study 
database will be collected directly from subjects during study visits or will be abstracted from subjects’ 
medical records. The subjects’ medical records must record their participation in the clinical trial and 
what medications (with doses and frequency) or other medical interventions or treatments were 
administered, as well as any AEs experienced during the trial.  
 
15.2 Data Management  Plan  
 
Study data will be collected at the study site(s) and entered into the study database. Data entry is to be 
completed on an ongoing basis during the study.  
 
a. Data Capture  Methods  
 
Clinical data will be entered into a RedCAP database which includes password p rotection and internal 
quality checks to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  
 
b. Study Record Retention  
 
The PI is responsible for retaining all essential documents listed in the ICH GCP Guidelines. The FDA 
requires study record s to be retained for up to 2 years after marketing approval or disapproval (21 CFR 
312.62), or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the investigational agent for a specific indication. These record s are also to be maintained in 
compliance with IRB/IEC, state, and federal medical records retention requirements, whichever is 
longest. All stored records are to be kept confidential to the extent provided by federal, state, and local 
law. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to retain copies of source documents until receipt of written 
notification to the sponsor.  
 
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the sponsor and the 
Principal Investigator.  Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party and/or 
move them to another location, the site investigator must provide written notification of such intent to 
sponsor with the name of the person who will accept responsibility fo r the transferred records and/or 
their new location. The sponsor must be notified in writing and written permission must be received by 
the site prior to destruction or relocation of research records .

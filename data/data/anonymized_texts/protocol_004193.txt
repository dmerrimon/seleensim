To evaluate the:
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of RBP -6000, 
Relationships between RBP -6000 PK and clinical outcome data, and
Impact of RBP -6000 on health and economic outcomes.
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, open- label, long -term safet y study  in which approximately  600 subjects 
diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled (approximately  300 subject s who did not 
participate in Study  RB-US-13-0001, the double- blind, placebo -controlled efficacy  study of 
RBP -6000 [hereafter referred to as “ de novo ” subjects ],and 300 subjects who completed the RB -
US-
13-0001 study  [hereafter referred to as “roll -over” subjects]).  Subject participation will be 
based on the Investigator’s determination that initiation or continuation of study  treatment is 
appropriate; and, for subjects who participated in RB -US-13-0001, that there have been no 
significant protocol deviations or clinically  relevant adverse events (AEs) that would preclude 
inclusion
of the subject in this study . All subjects will provide written informed consent before 
any protocol -related procedures commence. At the Screening Visit (which is up to 3 day s after 
the End of Study  [EOS] Visit [Day  169 + 3] for roll -over subjects), potential subjects will be

SUBOXONE Sublingual Film Run -In:  Induction
De novo Subjects :
De novo subjects will initially  be inducted onto SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine/naloxone) 
sublingual film for 3 days according to the SUBOXONE sublingual film prescribing 
information.  T hey will recei ve their first dose of SUBOXONE sublingual film on I nduction 
Day 1after it is confirmed that the subject meets eligibility  criteria and has a Clinical Opiate 
Withdrawal Scale ( COWS )score > 12 .  Subjects will be started with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 
mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) or 4mg/1 mg and may  titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of 
buprenorphine, at app roximately  2-hour intervals, under clinical supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg based 
on therapeutic response. 
On Induction Day  2, subjects with a COWS score > 12 or subjects reporting with drawal 
signs/sy mptoms overnight will receive a dose of SUBOXONE sublingual f ilm equal to the total 
dose given on Induction Day  1 plus 4 mg. (For example, if a subject received a total dose of 8 
mg of buprenorphine on Induction Day  1, the starting dose for Induction Day 2 would be 12 mg).  
If the COWS score is still > 12 one hour later, another 4 mg dose can be given. The subject 
should not exceed a maximum dose of 16 mg buprenorphine for Induction Day  2. Subsequent 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated b y at least 1 hour from the preceding dose. 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses may  also be adjusted downward if necessary . 
On Induction Day  3, subjects will be titrated to therapeutic response based on COWS scores as 
well as ph ysician judgment. Most subjects will only  require a single dose on I nduction Day  3,
which will equal the Induction Day  2 dose or the Induction Day  2 dose plus 4 mg buprenorphine . 
Additional doses may  also be administered on Induction Day  3 (up to 24 mg/6 mg). Subsequent 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated by  at least 1 hour from the precedin g dose.  
Subjects should reach a daily  dose of between 8 mg and 24 mg buprenorphine by Induction Day  
3 and continue on that dose through the remainder of the SUBOXONE sublingual film Run -In 
period, with additional dose adjustments if necessary . 
Roll- over Subjects :
Following screening, roll -over subjects will be inducted on toSUBOXONE sublingual film to 
achieve daily  doses between 8 mg to 24 mg buprenorphine according to the SUBOXONE 
sublingual film prescribing information. 
Subjects will receive their firs t induction dose on Induction Day  1. Subjects should be started 
with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) or 4mg/1 mg and may  titrate 
upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately  2-hour intervals, under 
supervision, to a total dose of up to 8 mg/2 mg based on the control of acute withdrawal 
symptoms. 
On Induction Day  2, subj ects with a score for COWS of > 12, or subjects reporting opioid 
withdrawal signs/sy mptoms overnight, should receive a dose of study  drug equal to the total dose 
given on Induction Day  1 plus 4 mg.  If the COWS score is still >12 one hour later, another 4 mg 
dose can be given.  The subject should not exceed a maximum dose of 16 mg/4 mg for Induction 
Day 2.  Subsequent SUBOXONE sublingual film dose s must be separated by  at least 1 hour 
from the preceding dose.  SUBOXONE sublingual film doses may  also be adjusted downward if

Page 4of 168 Confidentialnecessary .  
On Induction Day  3, subjects will be titrated to therapeutic response until a therapeutic dosage is 
reached, based on COWS scores as well as ph ysician judgment. Most subjects will only  require a 
single dose on Induction Day  3 which will equal the Induction Day  2 dose or the Induction Day  2 
dose plus 4 mg. Additional doses may  also be administered on Induction Day 3 (u p to 24 mg).  
Subsequent SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated b y at least 1 hour from the 
preceding dose.  Although subjects should reach a daily  dose of between 8 mg and 24 mg by 
Induction Day  3 and continue on that dose through the remainder of the SUBOXONE sublingual 
film Run -In period, dose adjustments may  be necessary  during the Run- In period. 
Roll- over s ubjects must be titrated to a minimum dose of 8 mg SUBOXONE by  the end of the 
3-day Induction period regardless of their COWS scores and/
or the presence or absence of 
withdrawal s ymptoms.  
The SUBOXONE sublingual film(s) will be administered under the tongue, close to the base on 
the left or right side, until they  are dissolved.  If an additional sublingual film is required, it 
should be placed on the opposite side from the first film.  Subjects should be instructed to hold 
the films under the tongue until they  dissolve.  If a third film is required, it should be placed 
under the tongue after the first 2 films have dissolved.
SUBOXONE Sub lingual Film Run
-In:  Dose Adjustmen t (All Subjects)
After the daily  induction visits, all subjects will begin a 1- to 11 -day SUBOXONE sublingual 
film dose adjustment period.  Subjects will return to the clinic at 3 -to 4-day intervals for Opioid 
Craving Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ), COWS, and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) 
assessments.  SUBOXONE sublingual film will be dispensed at each visit for at home dosing.  
Beginning on the 4thday of SUBOXONE sublingual film dosing, subjects will be evaluated for 
Day -1 criteria, which are identical to the criteria required for enrollment on Day  1.  These 
criteria include the following: no allergic react ion to SUBOXONE sublingual film, a d aily dose 
of SUBOXONE sublingual film between 8 mg and 24 mg (in clusive) buprenorphine, a 
COWS 
score of ≤ 12, and an Opioid Craving VAS score of ≤ 20 mm.
Open -Label Treatment with RBP -
6000:
On Day  1 of the stud y (first dose of RBP -6000), all subjects who meet enrollment criteria will 
receive a SC injection of 300 mg of buprenorphine in RBP-6000. Subseq uent doses of RBP -6000 
may be adjusted down to 100 mg and back up to 300 mg based on the medical judgment of the 
Investigator. After injection of RBP-6000, subjects will not be permitted to receive supplemental 
SUBOXONE sublingual film during the RBP -6000 treatment period. Subjects who require 
supplemental SUBOXONE sublingual film or other sublingual buprenorphine pharmacotherap y 
during the RBP -6000 treatment period will be withdrawn from the study  and referred for 
appropriate treatment.
Subjects will retur n to the clinic for monthl y injection visits (every 28 ±2 day s) for a total of up 
to 12 injections for de novo subjects or for a total of 6 injections for roll- over subjects. 
Continuous electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recordings will be collected from at least 30 
minutes 
before each SC injection until at least 4 hours after injection using Holter monitoring devices. 
This real -time cardiovascular monitoring will be used to detect potential arrhy thmias and 
abnormal ECGs. All ECGs will be interpreted b y a central monitoring facility . Four -hour 
continuous pulse oximetry will be assessed from at least 30 minutes prior to the SC injection

Page 5of 168 Confidentialthrough 4 hours post -RBP -6000 SC injection. Subject -reported injection site pain Visual Analog 
Scale scores (VAS) will be collected at various times for 2 hours after each injection. L ocal 
injection site grading will be collected at various time points starting immediately after injection; 
the injection site will evaluated for pain, tenderness, warmth, itching, ery thema, inflammation or 
swelling, and bruising using a 4 -point severit y scale. At each visit after injections begin, the 
injection site will be assessed by site staff for potential reaction and will also be evaluated for 
evidence of attempts to remove the depot.
Subjects will return to the clinic weekly  for the first 3 months and biweekly for the rest of the 
study  period for urine drug screens (UDS), Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews, opioid 
craving VAS evaluation, COWS and subject reported outcomes (Subjective Opiate Withdrawa l 
Scale [SOWS]).  Subjects will continue to receive counseling (manual -guided behavioral 
therap y) during the study.  
Safety  assessments will be collected at each injection visit and/or at injection follow -up visits 
and will include the following: vital si gns, electronic Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale 
(eC-SSRS) responses, ECGs, laboratory  tests (hematology , chemistry , urinaly sis, and pregnancy  
test), use of concomitant medications, and the frequency  of AEs. 
Sparse PK blood samples will be collected for population PK analy sis. ECGs will be performed 
between 30 minutes and 2 hours before PK sample collection. The following health economic 
and outcome assessments will also be collected: Beck Depression Inventory  (BDI -II), brief pain 
inventory  (BPI), EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L (EQ -
5D-5L), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey , Version 2 
(SF-36v2), Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), healthcare resource utilization 
(HCRU), Treatment Effectiveness Assessment (TEA) ,and Addiction Severity  Index L ite(ASI).

Page 7of 168 ConfidentialStatistical Methods:
A Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved and before 
database lock occurs.  The SAP will provide fur ther details regarding the definition of anal ysis 
endpoints, data handling rules, and the statistical methodology  to be used to address all study  
objectives.  The SAP will also include formats for the summary and analysis tables, listings, and 
graphical di splay s.
Determination of Sample Size :
Approximately  300 de novo subjects as well as approximately  300 subjects who completed the 
RB-US-13-0001 study  will be enrolled into th is long -term safety study  to ensure 100 subjects 
reach 1 year of treatment with RBP -6000. No power anal ysis will be done corresponding to the 
sample sizes, but the large numbers proposed are clinically  acceptable to provide adequate and 
relevant clinical conclusions from this study .
Safety Analyses:
Safety  variables will include AEs, loc al injection site tolerability  (e.g., injection site grading); 
injection site pain using a subject -reported VAS; suicidality  using the eC -SSRS, concomitant 
medications; changes in clinical laboratory  results (hematology , chemistry  and urinal ysis); vital 
sign measurements; 12 -lead ECGs, phy sical examination results; body  weight, height, BM I, and 
abdominal fat measurement (waist- to-hip ratio).  Safety  variables will be analy zed on the safet y 
population using descriptive statistics for continuous endpoints (e. g., mean, median, SD, 
minimum and maximum) and frequency  counts with percentages for discrete endpoints.
Baseline is defined as the last non- missing value prior to SC injection on Day  1.  No imputation 
of missing values will be performed.
Clinical Outcomes Assessments:
COWS, SOWS and Opioid Craving VAS total scores will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum), including change from baseline.  Subjects’ 
self-
reported illicit drug use from the TLFB will be summarized as descriptive statistics.
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of urine samples negative for 
opioids, the CDF of the percentage of self- reports from the TLFB negative for illicit opioid use, 
and other outcome measures will be calcula ted.
Population PK/PD Analysis:
The population PK model established using the data collected in the double- blind, placebo -
controlled, efficacy  study (Study  RB-US-13-0001) will be refined using the sparse PK samples 
collected in the present study  to charact erize the disposition of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine following SC injections of RBP- 6000, with the assessment of potential 
covariates affecting the PK of both compounds.  Subsequently, the relationships between 
buprenorphine plasma concentrations an d clinical outcomes assessments will be investigated.  
These relationships will be initially  assessed in a descriptive manner, and, if applicable, 
appropriate PK/PD models will be developed to describe these relationships.  A stand -alone 
modeling analy sis plan will be generated, and the results will be reported in a standalone 
modeling report .

1.1 Opioid Use Disorder
Opioid use disorder, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (DSM- 5; American Ps ychiatric Association 2013), is a neurobehavioral s yndrome 
characterized b y the repeated, compulsive seeking or use of an opioid despite adverse social, 
psychological, and/or phy sical consequences.  Opioid use disorder is a medical illness with high 
costs to individuals, families, and societ y.  Direct and indirect costs attributable to illici t drug use 
are estimated in 3 principal areas: crime, productivity , and health (US Department of Justice, 
Economic Impact of Illicit Drug Use on American Society, 2011).  Approximately  one-third of 
all acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) cases diagno sed in the United States (US) 
through 2009 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 
2009) and man y cases of hepatitis C (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2000; Thomas 2001) 
were associated with injection drug use.  
The increasing abuse of and addiction to prescription opioids is another major concern.  
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Office of 
Applied Studies, the incidence of abuse of prescription opioid pain medications (narco tic 
analgesics) such as h ydrocodone, ox ycodone, meperidine, and propox yphene has risen markedl y 
in recent years (Crane 2003).  The incidence of emergency
 department (ED) visits related to 
these medications has been increasing since the 1990s and has more t han doubled between 1994 
and 2001 (Crane 2003).  The most recentl y published data from the Drug Abuse Warning 
Network ( Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2009: National Estimates of Drug -Related Emergency  
Department Visits, 2011 ) estimated that about 2.1 million ED visits resulted from drug misuse or 
abuse, which was the equivalent of 674.4 ED visits per year per 100,000 population.  Although 
the overall number of ED visits attributable to drug misuse or abuse was stable from 2004 to 
2009, increases were seen in E D visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals with no 
other drug involvement (117% increase).  An estimated 1,079,683 ED visits in 2009 involved the 
nonmedical use of prescription drugs, over -the-counter (OTC) medicines, or other t ypes of 
pharmaceut icals, representing about a quarter of all drug- related ED visits and over half of ED 
visits for drug abuse or misuse.  Pain relievers were the most common t ype of drugs reported in 
the nonmedical use category  of ED visits (47.8%).  Among specific t ypes of pain relievers, 
narcotic pain relievers such as ox ycodone, h ydrocodone, and methadone (13.7%, 8.0%, and 
5.8%, respectively) were most prevalent ( Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2009: National 
Estimates of Drug -Related Emergency  Department Visits, 2011 ).
The economic burden of prescription opioid abuse is very  high.  Total US societal costs of 
prescription opioid abuse were estimated at $55.7 billion in 2007 (US dollars in 2009).  
Workplace costs accounted for $25.6 billion (46%), health care costs accounted fo r $25.0 billion 
(45%), and criminal justice costs accounted for $5.1 billion (9%) (Birnbaum 2011).  Mean 
annual direct health care costs for opioid abusers were more than 8 times higher than for 
nonabusers.  Hospital inpatient and phy sician outpatient cost s accounted for 46% and 31% 
respectivel y, of opioid abusers' health care costs.  The high costs of opioid abuse are driven 
primarily  by high comorbidity  rates and high utilization rates of medical services and 
prescription drugs (White 2005).  It was also found that opioid use results in lower quality  of life, 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 19of 168 Confidentialincluding significantl y worse ph ysical and ps ychological health, compared with the general 
population (Ry an 1996).
Given the high costs of opioid addiction to individuals, families, and society , treatments for this 
disease therefore aim to reduce the use of prescription or illicit opioids as well as the risks 
associated with injection, including transmission of human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) and 
hepatitis C virus.  I mplantable formulations of opioid receptor partial agonists and antagonists 
represent an innovative alternative to daily  dosing regimens, and several delivery  systems are 
currentl y in clinical trials (L ing 2010, Rosenthal 2013).  The goal of this study  is to determine 
whether RBP -6000, w hich is a sustained release formulation of buprenorphine in the ATRIGEL®
delivery  system, is a safe and effective treatment for opioid use disorder.
1.2 Buprenorphine
In the central nervous s ystem (CNS), opioid receptors are found in high concentrations in the
limbic sy stem and the spinal cord. The natural ligands for these receptors are a group of 
neuropeptides known as endorphins. Opioid analgesics mimic the action of endorphins but have 
a more prolonged action because the analgesics are not subject to rapid local metabolism.
Three major opioid receptor subclasses have been identified: mu, kappa, and delta.  These 
subclasses mediate distinct actions with natural endorphins and opioid analgesics.  Different 
endorphin and opioid analgesic ligands demonstrate dif ferent binding affinities for the various 
subclasses of receptors.  
Buprenorphine is a member of the large family  of opioid analgesics used in the treatment of 
moderate and severe acute and chronic pain. Opioid receptors are found in both the CNS and the 
periphery . Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu receptor, producing a sub -maximal 
response compared to that of a full agonist. Hence, buprenorphine provides a greater margin of 
safet y regarding respiratory depression in comparison to full agonist o pioids. Buprenorphine is 
also an antagonist at the kappa receptor (Cowan 1977, Jasinski 1978).
Buprenorphine has been reported to have a lower phy sical dependence liability  than pure agonist 
analgesics such as morphine, and at a sufficient dose, it can sup press opioid withdrawal signs 
and sy mptoms for at least 24 hours.  L imited euphoric and respiratory  depressant effects have led 
to its therapeutic use as a pharmacotherap y for opioid use disorder.
Selected pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for buprenorphine when administered sublinguall y as 
buprenorphine/naloxone films are in the SUBOXONE sublingual film prescribing information 
(Appendix 7 ).  Further details on the PK of buprenorphine in the ATRIGEL delivery  systemare 
described in Section 1.4.2 .
1.3 ATRIGEL Delivery  System
The ATRIGEL Delivery  System is a sterile, pol ymeric solution of a biodegradable 
poly DL-lactide -co-glycolide (PL GH) copol ymer, dissolved in the water -misc ible, biocompatible 
solvent N -methy l pyrrolidone (NMP).  The pol ymers belong to a family  of poly α-hydroxy acids 
that are used in medical devices such as resorbable sutures and degradable drug delivery  
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 20of 168 Confidentialsystems.  Poly merization, which is initiated with gly colic acid, leads to a linear pol ymer 
containing a carbox ylic acid end group.  The ATRIGEL Delivery  System can be formulated to 
deliver different active ingredients for various lengths of time.
The ATRIGEL Delivery  System is well characterized.  I t is curre ntly used in 7 approved 
products worldwide, including 4 ELIGARD®products (subcutaneous [SC] depot formulations of 
leuprolide acetate), ATRIDOX®(doxycycline hy clate applied to the periodontal pocket), the 
ATRI SORB® Bioabsorbable Guided Tissue Regeneration Barrier for periodontal application, and 
the ATRI SORB -D Barrier (ATRISORB with doxycy cline) for periodontal guided tissue 
regeneration.
Clinical studies with these products demonstrated that the ATRIGEL Delivery  System was well 
tolerated and provided cons istent sustained release of the incorporated drug over the designated 
dosing interval.  Injection site reactions are expected to be mild and appear earl y in treatment, as 
observed in previous local irritation ATRIGEL studies ( RBP -6000 Investigator’s Brochu re[IB], 
Edition 4, 24 February  2014).
1.4 Buprenorphine in the A TRIGEL Delivery  System (RBP -6000)
RBP -6000 is a subcutaneously  injected depot product under development for the treatment of 
opioid addiction. I t contains buprenorphine in the ATRIGEL Delivery  System and provides 
sustained plasma levels of buprenorphine over a minimum of 28 day s. There is no currentl y 
approved, parenterall y administered, sustained -release buprenorphine formulation for the 
treatment of opioid use disorder. Such a formulation could offer advantages over existing 
buprenorphine products by  improving subject compliance and reducing diversion, abuse, and 
unintended exposure (e.g., in pediatric exposure), and reduce chances of swallowing drug.
The safet y profile and clinical efficacy of R BP-6000 are expected to be similar to and 
comparable with that of buprenorphine or SUBOXONE sublingual treatment.
1.4.1 Summary of Nonclinical Data
Nonclinical data suggest that toxicity  from RBP -6000 is unlikely  at the doses planned for this 
clinical study .  The no observable adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were determined to be 250 
mg/kg (rat) and 40 mg/kg (dog) following single SC injections of RBP -6000 in 4- week toxicity  
studies.  These levels are equivalent to human buprenorphine doses of 2419 mg and 1333 mg , 
respectivel y (based on 60 kg bod y weight and calculated according US Food and Drug 
Administration guidance [FDA 2005]).  These levels provide approximately  8.1x (rat) and 4.4x 
(dog) safety  margins when compared to the 300-mg buprenorphine dose in humans (based on 
60kg bod y weight and calculated according US Food and Drug Administration guidance 
[FDA 2005]).  Sy stemic effects seen in the rat and dog 4- week toxicity  studies were related to 
the pharmacology  of buprenorphine or local tolerance effects of the formulation as a result of 
high dose and volume, so the safet y margins are considered acceptable.
Chronic repeated -dose studies were conducted in rats and dogs dosed with RBP -6000 once every  
4 weeks for 6 or 9 months, respectivel y.  These studies demonstr ated s ystemic effects consistent 
with buprenorphine administration, such as stained fur, aggressive behavior, decreased activity ,

Page 21of 168 Confidentialreduced food consumption and body  weight gain, and abnormal feces.  Minimal to mild lung 
alveolar macrophage infiltration and pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis were seen with increased 
incidence in rats, but not dogs, treated with RBP- 6000.  I njection site findings were seen in both 
species, characterized microscopically  by minimal to moderate granuloma formation.  I njection 
volum es were high, being 2.73 mL/m2in rats and 3.64 mL / m2in dogs, compared with a volume 
of 0.62 mL/ m2at the highest proposed clinical dose, contributing to these local findings.  
Systemic chronic NOAELs were considered to be 10 mg/kg in rats and 40 mg/kg in dogs.  
Overall, the extensive preclinical data on both the buprenorphine and SUBOXONE products and 
nonclinical PK and toxicity  studies in rats and dogs support the clinical development of 
RBP -6000.  Sy stemic exposure to buprenorphine is not considered to pose any  significant safety  
concerns following SC administration of RBP
-6000.  Additionally, this clinical study  will be 
conducted in subjects who have a current diagnosis of opioid use disorder and who would thus 
be expected to have a certain degree of cross -tolerance to the opioid agonist effects of 
buprenorphine.  Minimal to moderate irritation at the injection site, seen in both rats and dogs, 
may warrant attention to ensure local tolerability  (RBP -6000 IB, Edition 4, 24 February  2014).
1.4.2 Summary of Pr evious Clinical Data
In the first -in-human trial to evaluate the safet y, tolerability , and PK of RBP -6000, 12 subjects 
received a single SC injection of RBP-6000 containing 20 mg of buprenorphine.  Of these 
12subjects, 6 subjects completed the study  throu gh Day  85.  The majorit y (94%) of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild, 5.4% were moderate, and 1 was severe 
in intensity .  TEAEs considered related to the study  drug included injection site pain, injection 
site warmth, and injection site br uising, ery thema, and edema.  All subjects experienced mild to 
moderate s ymptoms of withdrawal at study  entry , prior to study  drug injection, and after study  
drug injection.  One serious adverse event (SAE) was reported.  The SAE was notabl y identified 
psychosocial stressors and intermittent withdrawal, for which the subject had prolonged 
hospitalization for treatment.  This SAE was not considered to be related to the study  drug.  No 
respiratory  depression, temperature elevations, clinically  significant low ering of ox ygen 
saturation, or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were observed.  There was 1 clinicall y 
significant laboratory  adverse event (AE; elevated hepatic enz ymes), which resolved.  No 
unexpected side effects occurred in the RBP -6000 depot form ulation of buprenorphine 
(RBP -6000 IB, Edition 4, 24 February  2014).  Buprenorphine was rapidl y absorbed over the first 
day and peaked on the second day , with a slow decrease in plasma concentrations thereafter that 
is consistent with the slow release of b uprenorphine from the ATRIGEL Delivery  System.  
The PK of 50, 100, and 200 mg buprenorphine (as RBP- 6000) was also evaluated in a single -
ascending -dose study  in 51 subjects (RB -US-11
-0020).  In this study , median buprenorphine 
time to peak concentration ( tmax) in the initial burst period was observed at 24 hours for all 3 
dosages.  Buprenorphine mean plasma terminal half- life increased slightly  with the increase in 
dose from 50 mg to 200 mg (1078 hours [44.9 days] at 50 mg, 1376 hours at 100 mg, and 1573 
hours at 200 mg).  Buprenorphine exhibited overall geometric mean average concentration 
values of 0.356, 0.624, and 1.108 ng/mL, respectively  with 50, 100 and 200 mg buprenorphine 
while overall geometric mean C maxvalues of 0.999, 1.518, and 2.381 ng/mL wer e observed for 
buprenorphine doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg, respectivel y.  With an increase in dose of RBP -
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 22of 168 Confidential6000 from 50 to 200 mg, mean buprenorphine exposure parameters increased less than 
proportionally  to dose (RBP -6000 IB, Edition 4, 24 February  2014). A single SC injection of 
RBP -6000 was generall y safe and well tolerated.  A total of 46 of 51 subjects (90.2%) had at 
least 1 TEAE.  A total of 30 of 51 subjects (58.8%) had TEAEs that were related to treatment 
with RBP -6000.  The majority  of AEs were qua lified as moderate in severity  (68.6%).  
Two subjects reported TEAEs that were considered to be severe but unrelated to RBP -6000.  No 
subjects withdrew from the study  because of an AE.
The safet y profile of multiple -dose SC injections of RBP- 6000 containin g 50 mg, 100 mg, 
200
mg, and 300 mg of buprenorphine in treatment-seeking, opioid- dependent subjects in an 
open -label, multiple -dose study  has recently  been examined.  The results suggest that all doses 
were safe and well -tolerated following a 13- day induc tion and stabilization on SUBUTEX.  In 
addition, a study  investigating the blockade of subjective opioid effects demonstrated that RBP -
6000 was safe and well tolerated after the SC administration of 2 monthly  300-mg doses of 
buprenorphine in RBP -6000, foll owing a 14 -day induction and stabilization period on 
SUBOXONE Film.
1.4.3 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling of RBP
-6000
A population PK model was developed to characterize the disposition of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine following SC injection of RBP- 6000 (Nasser 2014).  This model was built 
using plasma concentration data collected in 36 opioid- dependent subjects who received single 
doses (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) of RBP -6000 in the single -ascending -dose study  (RB -US-
11-0020).  Anal ysis of the PK p rofiles of RBP -6000 revealed a complex and multi- phase 
absorption profile, presenting double peaks and a prolonged plasma terminal half -life.  These 
distinguishing features of the PK of RBP
-6000 required the development of a complex structural 
PK model acc ounting for this dual absorption process: a first absorption process that was 
associated with an initial, rapid delivery from the SC injection site, and a second absorption 
process that was associated with the slow release of buprenorphine from the ATRIGEL Delivery  
System into the sy stemic circulation.  The population PK model accuratel y predicted the PK data 
after repeated doses of RBP -6000 in the multiple ascending dose study  (RB -US-12-0005) and in 
the opioid blockade study (RB -US-13-0002). 
Another popul ation PK/PD model was developed to characterize the link between buprenorphine 
plasma concentration and mu opioid receptor occupancy  (Nasser 2014).  Individual data from 15 
heroin-dependent subjects were taken from two published clinical trials (Greenwald 2003; 
Greenwald 2007).  A saturable maximum effect (E max) model with 0.67 ng/mL  effective 
concentration at 50% of maximum (EC 50) and 91% E maxbest described mu opioid receptor 
occupancy  versus buprenorphine plasma concentrations.  At buprenorphine concentr ations 
greater than 2 ng/mL , saturation occurred on mu opioid receptor occupancy where a 4.5 -fold 
increase in observed buprenorphine concentrations resulted in observed mu opioid receptor 
occupancy  between 70% and 90%.
Positron emission tomograph y (PET) sc an data were obtained in 2 subjects participating in the 
multiple -ascending dose study  RB-US-
12-0005 (PET scan sub- study ) and receiving either 200 or 
300 mg of RBP -6000.  The PET scans were conducted at 7 day s and 28 day s post- dose following 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 23of 168 Confidentialthe 12thSC injection for the first subject receiving 200 mg, and following the 6thSC injection for 
the second subject receiving 300 mg.  Both subjects were considered to be at steady -state for 
buprenorphine at the time of the PET scan measurements.  The mu opioid rece ptor availabilities 
of four different regions in the brain were measured, and the mu opioid receptor occupancy  in 
the whole brain was calculated as described in Greenwald et al. (2003).
The subject receiving 200 mg of RBP- 6000 in the PET scan sub -study  showed 79% and 75% mu 
opioid receptor occupancy  on Day  7 and Day  28, respectivel y, following the 12thSC injection of 
RBP -6000.  The subject receiving 300 mg of RBP -6000 in the PET scan sub -study  showed 92% 
and 81% mu opioid receptor occupancy  on Day  7 and Da y 28, respectivel y, following the 6thSC 
injection of RBP -6000.  These values and the corresponding PK concentrations were in 
agreement with the model predictions and the previous individual observations used to build the 
population PK/PD model.
Linear rel ationships were found between mu opioid receptor occupancy  and opioid withdrawal 
symptoms, and between mu opioid receptor occupancy  and h ydromorphone agonist blockade, 
based on the data from 15 heroin -dependent subjects (Nasser 2014).  These data suggest t hat a 
mean buprenorphine plasma concentration of 2 ng/mL  is able to provide 70 % mu opioid 
receptor occupancy  associated with low reported agonist drug effects and withdrawal s ymptoms 
(scores ≤2).
Model simulations indicated that the desired 70% mu opioid receptor occupancy  may  be 
achieved after multiple doses of 200 mg of RBP -6000 (Nasser 2014).  The 300 mg dose was 
considered to be a full opioid blockade dose.
1.5 Rationale for Dose Selection
The results of the opioid blockade stud y (RB -US-
13-0002) showed tha t 300 mg was a full opioi d 
blocking dose (i.e., for the “drug liking” VAS scores the upper bound of the 95% confidence 
interval ≤11), which is consistent with PK/PD modeling and simulation results. The least means 
“drug liking” VAS scores in the opioid blockade study  showed that t he blockade was achieved 
from the first SC injection and was maintained after the second SC injection until week 12 (i.e., 2 
months after the second injection).
The population PK and PK/PD models presented in Section 1.4.3 were used to simulate the 
double -blind efficacy  study  (RB -US-13-0001).  The results of these simulations are display ed in 
Figure 1for the two treatment arms on RBP -6000 receiving either 6 SC injections of 300 mg 
(300 mg × 2 + 300 mg × 4), or 2 SC injections of 300 mg followed b y 4 SC injections of 100 mg 
(300 mg ×2  + 100 mg × 4).

The blue line represents the median model prediction; the yellow  areas represent the 5thand the 95th
percentiles of the predictions; -ORO: mu opioid receptor occupan cy; wks: weeks.
The PK parameters calculated from the simulated ty pical PK profile of buprenorphine are listed 
in Table 1.  Average buprenorphine plasma concentration (C avg) over the monthly  dosing interval 
was 1.9 ng/mL  after the first SC injection at 300 mg, and 3.1 ng/mL after the second SC 
injection at 300 mg. 
For the subjects receiving 6 monthly  SC injections of RBP -6000 at 300 mg, the predicted C avg
value after the 4thSC injection was 5.1 ng/mL , which is close to mean value of 4.8 ng/mL 
observed in the multiple- ascending dose stud y.  The predicted C avgvalue after the 6thSC 
injection was 6.0 ng/mL.  For the patients receiving 2 monthly  SC injections at 300 mg followed 
by 4 monthly  SC injections at 100 mg, th e predicted C avgafter the 6thSC injection was 
2.6ng/mL.  All these values were above the 2 ng/mL  threshold for achieving the desired 
efficacy .
Overall, the modeling and simulation work and the opioid blockade stud y have shown that the 
300mg SC dose is an appropriate dose to assess for efficacy . The current study  will therefore 
evaluate the long- term safety  and tolerability  of this dose. I t is recognized, however, that some 
individuals may  need lower doses based on genetic variations, abuse behavior, etc . Accordingl y, 
subsequent doses of RBP -6000 may  be adjusted down to 100 mg and back up to 300 mg based 
on the medical judgment of the Investigator.

Page 26of 168 Confidential1.6 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits
The AE profile of buprenorphine is well -characterized; commonly  reported effects include 
constipation, nausea, vomiting, and headache.  Buprenorphine is approved for use b y various 
routes of administration (e.g., SL, intramuscular [IM], intravenous [IV], transdermal, and rectal).
Studies of buprenorphine receptor binding in human subjects have consistently  and reproducibl y 
established that buprenorphine is a highl y lipophil ic, mu -opioid receptor partial agonist with 
slow receptor association and dissociation kinetics.  Buprenorphine has an improved safet y 
profile relative to mu -opioid receptor full agonists due to its partial agonist properties.  These 
attributes of buprenor phine allow it to perform well as substitution therapy  for opioid-dependent 
individuals over short -term and long -term durations.  The experiments used to establish the 
binding profile of buprenorphine were consistent across differing parenteral routes of 
administration (IV, IM, and SL ); therefore, RBP -6000 is expected to perform similarly  when 
administered as a SC depot in the ATRI GEL Delivery  System.
The efficacy  of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid dependence has been well established 
(see for exam ple, New Drug Applications 20 -732; 20- 733; 22-410).  Buprenorphine has been 
used for medically -supervised taper (i.e., detoxification) medication and as a long -term 
medication assisted therapy  (i.e., maintenance).  A recent Cochrane Review meta -analysis 
revealed that buprenorphine is statistically  significantly  superior to placebo in the retention of 
subjects and reduction of opioid- positive urine tests, and that buprenorphine and methadone may  
be equall y efficacious at adequate dose levels of both medicati ons (Mattick 2008).
A sustained- release formulation of buprenorphine using the ATRIGEL Delivery  System offers a 
number of potential benefits relative to shorter-acting formulations, including improved subject 
compliance, reduced diversion and misuse, as we ll as a reduced risk to subjects, their families, 
and the community .

Page 28of 168 Confidential3INVESTIGA TIONAL PLA N
3.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, open -label, long -term safet y study  in which approximately  600 subjects 
diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled (approximately  300 subjects who did not 
participate in the RB- US-13-0001 study  [hereafter referred to as “ de novo” sub jects] and 
approximately  300 subjects that completed the RB -US-13-0001 study  [hereafter referred to as 
“roll-over subjects”] ).  Subject participation will be based on the Investigator’s determination 
that initiation or continuation of study  treatment is ap propriate; and, that among subjects who are 
continuing from the RB
-US-13-0001 study , there have been no significant protocol deviations or 
clinically  relevant AEs that would preclude inclusion of the subject in this study . All subjects 
will need to provide written informed consent before any  protocol -
related procedures commence. 
At the Screening Visit (which is up to 3 day s after the End of Study  [EOS] Visit (Day  169 + 3]), 
for roll -over subjects), potential subjects will be reviewed for eligibility  against inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, and eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial. 
Before receiving the first injection of RBP -6000 in this safety  study , all subjects will undergo a 
Run-In period with SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual f ilm to avoid 
precipitating a withdrawal sy ndrome and to preserve the blind in subjects treated with placebo in 
the RB -US-13-0001 study . Subjects will be inducted onto SUBOXONE sublingual film 
consistent with the SUBOXONE sublingual film label; they  will th en complete a 1 to 11 day  
SUBOXONE sublingual film Dose Adjustment period ( Section 5.2.1
). SUBOXONE dose 
adjustments will be made based on COWS scores as well as ph ysician judgment ( Section 5.2.2).  
Once subjects meet the criteria (on Day  -11 to Day  -1) of no significant opioid craving ( ≤20 mm 
on the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and no significant withdrawal ( ≤ 12 on the 
Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS]) they  may  receive the first SC injection of RBP
-6000 
(containing 300 mg buprenorphine). Subjects with significant withdrawal signs/sy mptoms 
(defined as >12 on the COWS) or significant cravings for opioids (defined as >20 mm on the 
Opioid Craving VAS) after the end of the 2 -week SUBOXONE sublingual film Run -In period 
will not be eligible to continue in the study  and will be referred for treatment. 
On Day  1 of the stud y (initiation of study
 drug injections), all subjects will receive a SC injection 
of 300 mg of buprenorphine in RBP -6000. Subsequent doses of RBP -6000 may  be adjusted 
down to 100 mg and back up to 300 mg based on the medical judgment of the I nvestigator. After 
injection of RBP -6000, subjects will not be permitted to receive supplemental SU BOXONE 
sublingual film during the RBP -6000 treatment period. Subjects who require supplemental 
SUBOXONE sublingual film or other sublingual buprenorphine pharmacotherap y during the 
RBP -6000 treatment period will be withdrawn from the study  and referred for appropriate 
treatment.
Subjects will return to the clinic for monthl y injection visits (every 28 ±2 day s) for a total of up 
to 12 injections for de novo subjects or for a total of 6 injections for roll- over subjects. 
Continuous ECG recordings will be collected from at least 30 minutes before each SC injection 
until at least 4 hours after injection using Holter monitoring devices. This real -time

Page 29of 168 Confidentialcardiovascular monitoring will be used to detect potential arrhy thmias and abnormal ECGs.  All 
ECGs will be inter preted by  a central monitoring facility . Four -hour continuous pulse oximetry  
will be assessed from 30 minutes prior to the SC injection through 4 hours post RBP -6000 SC 
injection. Subject-reported injection site pain Visual Analog Scale scores (VAS) will b e 
collected at various times for 2 hours after each injection. L ocal injection site grading will be 
collected at various time points starting immediately  after injection and will be evaluated for 
pain, tenderness, warmth, itching, ery thema, inflammation or swelling, and bruising using a 4 -
point severity  scale. At each visit after injections begin, the injection site will be assessed by  site 
staff and will also be evaluated for evidence of attempts to remove the depot. 
Subjects will need to return to the cl inic weekl y for the first 3 months and biweekl y for the rest 
of the study  period for urine drug screens (UDS), Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews, 
opioid craving VAS evaluation, COWS and subject reported outcomes (Subjective Opiate 
Withdrawal Scale [SOW S]). Subjects will continue to receive counseling (manual -guided 
behavioral therap y) during the stud y. 
Safety  assessments will be collected at each injection visit and/or at injection follow -up visits 
and will include the following:  vital signs, electron ic Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale 
(eC-SSRS) responses, ECGs, laboratory  tests (hematology , chemistry , urinaly sis, and pregnancy  
test), concomitant medications, and AEs.  
Sparse PK blood samples will be collected for population PK analy sis. ECGs wi ll be performed 
between 30 minutes and 2 hours before PK sample collection. The following depression, pain, 
and health economic outcome assessments will also be collected: Beck Depression Inventory  
(BDI-II), brief pain inventory  (BPI) , EuroQol EQ -5D
-5L (EQ -5D- 5L), 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey , Version 2 (SF -36v2), Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), healthcare 
resource utilization (HCRU), Treatment Effectiveness Assessment (TEA) and Addiction Severit y 
Index L ite (ASI -Lite).
At the end of the RB P-6000 treatment period, subjects will enter a 4- week SUBOXONE
transition period/safet y follow -up where they  will receive the same dose of SUBOXONE that 
they received at Day  -1 and their ongoing treatment options will be reviewed.

Page 32of 168 Confidential3.2 Rationale for Study  Design
This study  is designed to assess the long -term safety , tolerabilit y, and clinical outcomes of 
RBP -6000 SC injections in su bjects with opioid use disorder.  The planned number of subjects 
was designed to ensure at least 100 subjects reach 1 y ear of treatment with RBP -6000 (as advised 
in the I CH-E1A Guideline -The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety : For 
Drugs Intended for Long- term Treatment of Non -Life-Threatening Conditions).  The safet y 
assessments used include evaluations of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), discontinuations from study  
due to AEs; local injection site tolerability  (e.g., injection site grading); injection site pain using a 
subject -reported VAS; suicidality  using the eC -SSRS, concomitant medications; changes in 
clinical laboratory  results; vital sign measurements; 12 -lead ECGs, and ph ysical examination 
results.  The instruments used to measure cli nical outcomes (e.g., COWS, SOWS, Opioid 
Craving VAS, and eC -SSRS) were developed to measure the specific sy mptoms exhibited by  
and the challenges facing opioid- dependent individuals.  
3.3 Stud y Duration and Dates
The expected maximum duration of participatio n for de novo subjects is up to approximately  55 
weeks consisting of up to a 7- day screening period, up to a 14 -day SUBOXONE sublingual film 
Run-In, up to a 48 -week open -label treatment period, and a 4- week follow -
up and transition 
period when subjects will receive the same dose of SUBOXONE that they  received at Day  -1 
and their ongoing treatment options will be reviewed.
The expected maximum duration of participation for roll -over subjects is up to approximately  31 
weeks, consisting of up to a 7- day screening period, up to a 14- day SUBOXONE sublingual film 
Run-In, a 24 -week open -
label treatment period, and a 4- week follow -up and transition period 
when they  will receive the same dose of SUBOXONE that they  received at Day  -1 and their 
ongoing treatment option s will be reviewed.
If a sufficient number of subjects reach 1 year of exposure to RBP -6000, the study  may  be 
stopped earl y, and all remaining subjects will complete EOS procedures and enter the 
SUBOXONE Transition Period/Safety  Follow -up.
Subjects who rec eive at least 1 dose of RBP- 6000 and discontinue the trial for an y reason will be 
required to complete the Early Termination (ET) visit.

5.2 Treatments A dministered
5.2.1 Run-In Treatment Period
5.2.1.1 SUBOXONE Sublingual Film Induction ( De novo Subjects)
De novo subjects will receive their first dose of SUBOXONE s ublingual film on I nduction 
Day 1.  Subjects will be started with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg and may  titrate 
upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately  2-hour intervals, under 
clinical supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg base d on therapeutic response. 
On Induction Day  2, subjects with a COWS score > 12, or subjects reporting withdrawal 
signs/sy mptoms overnight, will receive a dose of SUBOXONE sublingual film equal to the total 
dose given on Induction Day  1 plus 4 mg. (For exa mple, if a subject received a total dose of 8 
mg on Induction Day  1, the starting dose of buprenorphine for Induction Day  2 would be 12 mg).  
If the COWS score is still > 12 one hour later, another 4 mg dose can be given. The subject 
should not exceed a ma ximum dose of 16 mg/4 mg for Induction Day  2. Subsequent 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated b y at least 1 hour from the preceding dose. 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses may  also be adjusted downward if necessary . 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 38of 168 ConfidentialOn Induction Day 3, subjects w ill be titrated to therapeutic response based on COWS scores as 
well as ph ysician judgment. Most subjects will only  require a single dose on I nduction Day  3 
which will equal the Induction Day  2 dose or the Induction Day  2 dose plus 4 mg buprenorphine . 
Addi tional doses may also be administered on Induction Day  3 (up to 24 mg). Subsequent 
SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated by  at least 1 hour from the preceding dose.  
Subjects should reach a daily  dose of between 8 mg/2 mg and 24 mg/6 mg by  Induc tion Day  3 
and continue on that dose through the remainder of the SUBOXONE sublingual film Run -In 
period, with additional dose adjustments if necessary . 
The SUBOXONE sublingual film(s) will be administered under the tongue, close to the base on 
the left o r right side, until they  are dissolved.  If an additional sublingual film is required, it 
should be placed on the opposite side from the first film.  Subjects should be instructed to hold 
the films under the tongue until they  dissolve.  If a third film is required, it should be placed 
under the tongue after the first 2 films have dissolved.  
For more information about SUBOXONE sublingual film administration, please refer to the 
SUBOXONE Full Prescribing Information (See Appendix 7 ).
5.2.1.2 SUBOXONE Sublingual Film Induction (Roll -over Subjects)
Following screening, roll -over subjects will be inducted on SUBOXONE sublingual film to 
achieve daily  doses between 8 mg to 24 mg buprenorphine according to the SUBOXONE 
sublingual film prescribing instructions. Subjects must be titrated to a minimum dose of 8 mg 
SUBOXONE b y the end of the 3- day Induction period regardless of their COWS scores and/or 
the presence or absence of withdrawal s ymptoms.  
Subjects will receive their fir st induction dose on Induction Day  1. Subjects should be started 
with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may  titrate 
upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately  2-hour intervals, under 
supervision, to a total dose of up to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of 
acute withdrawal s ymptoms. 
On Induction Day  2, subjects with a score for COWS of > 12, or subjects reporting opioid 
withdrawal signs/sy mptoms overnight, should receive a do
se of study  drug equal to the total dose 
given on Induction Day  1 plus 4 mg.  If the COWS score is still > 12 one hour later, another 4 
mg dose can be given.  The subject should not exceed a maximum dose of 16 mg/4 mg 
buprenorphine/naloxone for Induction D ay 2.  Subsequent SUBOXONE sublingual film doses 
must be separated b y at least 1 hour from the preceding dose.  SUBOXONE sublingual film 
doses may  also be adjusted downward if necessary .  
On Induction Day  3, subjects will be titrated to therapeutic response until a therapeutic dosage is 
reached, based on COWS scores as well as ph ysician judgment. Most subjects will only  require a 
single dose on Induction Day  3 which will equal the Induction Day  2 dose or the Induction Day  2 
dose plus 4 mg. Additional dose s may  also be administered on Induction Day 3 (up to 24 mg).  
Subsequent SUBOXONE sublingual film doses must be separated b y at least 1 hour from the 
preceding dose.  Although subjects should reach a daily  dose of between 8 mg and 24 mg by

For more information about SUBOXONE sublingual film administration, please refer to the 
SUBOXONE Full Prescribing Information (See Appendix 7 ).
5.2.2 Dose Adjustment Period (All Subjects)
Beginning at Day  -11, subjects will be assessed to d etermine whether they  meet Day  -
1
/enrollment criteria as defined in Section 4.4.  Once subjects meet the enrollment criteria (no 
significant opioid craving ( ≤20 mm on the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and no 
significant withdrawal ( ≤ 12 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS]), they  are eligible 
to receive the first SC injection of RBP -6000 (containing 300 mg buprenorphine). Subjects with 
significant withdrawal signs/s ymptoms (defined as >12 on the COWS) or significant cravings for 
opioids (defined as >20 mm on the Opioid Craving VAS) after the end of the 2 -week 
SUBOXONE sublingual f ilm Run -In period will not be eligible to continue in the study  and wi ll 
be referred for treatment.  
5.2.3 Active Study Treatment
On Day  1 of the stud y (initiation of study drug injections), all subjects will receive a SC injection 
of 300 mg of buprenorphine in RBP -6000. Subsequent doses of RBP -6000 may  be adjusted 
down to 100 mg and back up to 300 mg based on the medical judgment of the I nvestigator.   All 
subjects will receive injections of RBP -6000 separated b y 28 (± 2) day s.  
After injection of RBP -6000, su bjects will not be permitted to receive supplemental 
SUBOXONE sublingual film during the RBP -6000 treatment period. Subjects who require 
supplemental SUBOXONE sublingual film or other sublingual buprenorphine pharmacotherap y 
during the RBP -6000 treatment p eriod will be withdrawn from the study  and referred for 
appropriate treatment.
A single SC dose will be injected by an individual who is medically  qualified to perform the 
procedure and delegated by  the Principal Investigator to perform the task
.  Injections of RBP -
6000 will be administered in the abdominal area below the waist but above the hip bone; more 
specificall y, injection should occur in the region where the bod y curves at the side to about 2 
inches from the middle of the abdomen with adequate amounts of subcutaneous tissue that does 
not have excessive pigment, nodules, lesions, or hair.  RBP -6000 will form a solid poly mer depot 
that contains the buprenorphine.  As the depot degrades, buprenorphine will be released into the 
systemic circulation at a consistent rate over an approximately  28-day period.  For detailed 
instructions on use, see Appendix 8 .

Page 40of 168 Confidential5.2.4 SUBOXONE Transition Period/Safety Follow- up
At the end of the RBP -6000 open -label treatment period ,subject s will enter a 4 -week 
SUBOXONE transition period/safet y follow- up where they  will receive the same dose of 
SUBOXONE that they  received at Day  -1, and their ongoing treatment options will be reviewed.
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
The study  schedule is designed so that each of the injections will be separated by  a maximum of 
30 day s (28 day s ± 2 days) and will be given on alternate sides of the subject’s abdomen (see 
Appendix 8 and the Pharmacy  Man ual for detailed information on administration).  
5.4 Method of A ssigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
When a 
de novo or roll -over subject signs the ICF, she/he will be assigned a unique subject 
number in numerical sequence, which will be used for the duratio n of the study . Roll -over 
subjects will retain the subject number assigned to them in the RB -US-13-0001 study . 
De novo
subjects will be assigned a unique subject number, consisting of the site number followed b y 9 
and a 3 digit number in numerical sequence (e.g.,the first de novo subject screened at site # 001 
will be assigned the number 0019001).  The subject number will be recorded in the source 
document and electronic case report form (eCRF).
All subjects will be assigned to receive the 300 mg RBP-
6000 dose. Subsequent doses of 
RBP -6000 may  be adjusted down to 100 mg and back up to 300 mg based on the medical 
judgment of the Investigator

will include a measurement of sy stolic and diastolic BP, pulse rate, pulse oximetry , respiratory  
rate, and oral temperature.  On the day  of RBP -6000 dosing, 4 -hour continuous pulse oximetry  
will be assessed from at least 30 minutes prior to the SC injection through 4 hours post RBP -
6000 SC injection.  Pulse oximetry  readings from within 30 minutes prior to injection and at 4 
hours post -injection will be recorde d in the source documents and CRF.
If clinicall y significant findings, as determined b y the I nvestigator or medically  qualified sub -
investigator, occur in an y vital sign measurement, that measurement will be captured as an AE 
and repeated at medically  appr opriate intervals until the value returns to an acceptable range, a 
specific diagnosis is established, or the condition is otherwise explained.
Assessments are performed at the time points detailed in the SOE ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2, 
Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 ).
6.5 Electrocardi ograms
6.5.1 12-Lead Electrocardiograms
Resting 12-
lead ECGs will be recorded with the subject in supine position following a 10 -minute 
rest period and will be performed prior to the PK blood sampling ( Appendix 6 ).
Resting 12-lead ECGs will be taken as indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , 
Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 ).  ECGs performed at screening will be recorded in 
triplicate, at approximately  2 -5 minute intervals.

Page 46of 168 ConfidentialECG intervals including HR, QT, QTcF, QTcB, RR, PR, QRS and T wave changes will be 
recorded.  ECGs will be reviewed b y the Investigator during the visits for any  immediate 
abnormalities. ECGs will also be reviewed b y a central facility.  
The findings of the ECGs as determined b y the central facility will be assess ed by  the 
Investigator and marked as normal, abnormal -not clinically  significant, or abnormal -clinicall y 
significant.  All clinicall y significant abnormalities will be captured as AEs.  In the event that a 
clinically  significant AE related to an ECG assess ment occurs during the study , the Investigator 
should contact the RBP Medical Monitor.
6.5.2 Holter Monitoring
A Holter monitor will be used to obtain continuous ECG recordings from at least 30 minutes 
before SC injection through 4 hours post SC injection dosing on study  visits as indicated in the 
SOEs ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and Appendix 5 ).  An appropriately 
trained individual will set up the Holter monitor, and a central facility  will be used to review all 
recordings.  All clinicall y significant abnormalities will be captured as AEs. Specific 12 -lead 
ECG tracings of 10
-second duration will be extracted in triplicate at the following predefined 
time points: immediately prior to injection and 4 hours post -injection.  The Holter must be 
applied prior to PK sampling for pre-sample ECG extraction.  
6.6 Clinical Laboratory  Tests
6.6.1 Laboratory Parameters
All clinical laboratory  assessments will be performed by  a clinical laboratory  accredited by  the 
College of American Pathologists or with a certificate of compliance (or certifica te of waiver for 
CLIA-waived tests) issued by  the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services or Clinical 
Laboratory  Improvement Amendments.  The laboratory  assessments will include routine and 
screening laboratory  tests.  
See the SOEs in Appendix 1 , Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and Appendix 5 for the 
timing of the specific required laboratory  tests which are listed in Table 2. 
Any abnormal hematology , chemistry , or urinal ysis test result deemed clinically  significant by  
the Investigator wil l be repeated, including test results obtained on the final study  day.  For an y 
test abnormality  deemed clinically  significant, an AE will be recorded (unless the result was 
considered erroneous) and repeat anal ysis will be performed until resolution or un til the 
Investigator determines that resolution of the laboratory  abnormality  is not expected.  
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection.  Clinical laboratory  panels 
are listed in Table 2.

All blood sampling will be by  individual venipuncture or with the use of a saline lock.  Blood 
and urine sample collection and processing procedures will be outlined in a separate reference 
manual to be provided to the site.
6.6.3 Reference Ranges
Up-to-date reference ranges for the above investigations must be obtained for the laboratory  
performing analy ses prior to the start of the study  and be updated as appropriate during the 
course of the stud y.
6.6.4 Laboratory Results Review
The Investigator will review the results and comment on the laboratory  results sheet for all 
abnormal values, identifying those that are abnormal but not clinically  significant as well as 
those that are significantly abnormal.  The Investigator will sign and date the laboratory  resul ts 
sheet to indicate that the review has taken place.
Clinical L aboratory  Changes:  It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to review the results of all 
laboratory  tests as they  become available.  This review will be documented by  the Investigator 
on the l aboratory  report.  For each abnormal laboratory  test result, the Investigator needs to 
ascertain if this is a clinically significant abnormal change from baseline for that individual 
subject. 
6.6.5 Good Laboratory Practice Compliance
Confirmation of compliance with Good Laboratory  Practice (GL P) will be obtained from the 
designated Bio- Anal ytical L aboratory  prior to the start of the study .
6.7 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for PK analy ses will be collected from subjects at the time points indicated in th e 
PK sampling schedule ( Appendix 6 ). The plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine will be quantified using specific and validated liquid chromatograph y tandem 
mass spectrometry  methods. A laboratory  manual for PK sample collection, processing, storage, 
and shipping will be supplied.
A PK sample will be taken as soon as possible after an y SAE is reported.  If possible, an 
additional sample should be collected when the SAE has been resolved.

Page 49of 168 Confidential6.8 Administration of Study  Drug
The study  drug will be assigned by  an IWRS sy stem. I njections will be administered by a 
physician or suitably -qualified designee (e.g., physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, PA) who has 
been delegated to perform the task .  Study  drug will be supplied only  to subjects participating in 
the study . The Investigator agrees not to allow the stud y drug to be administered from, nor stored 
at, an y site other than the study site agreed upon with the Sponsor.
See Appendix 7 for detailed descriptions of dosing for the SUBOXONE sublingual film.   
Detailed inst ructions for the preparation and administration of RBP- 6000 are in Appendix 8 .
If at an injection visit there is a safet y concern with administration of RBP -6000 or placebo, after 
discussion with the medical mon itor or sponsor, dosing can be delayed up to one week.  In the 
event this occurs, the subsequent doses will be delay ed.  There must be at least 26 day s between 
injections of study medication.
All used sy ringe components will be disposed of into an appropriate secure biohazard container 
or per the SOPs at the study  site.
All used I MP packaging (e.g., carton, foil pouch) will be retained at the study  site until the CRA 
conducts a visit to perform reconciliation.  After the reconciliation is completed, the use d IMP 
packaging may  then be disposed of per the SOPs at the study  site.
Unused IMP and returned SUBOXONE sublingual film must be available for verification by  the 
Sponsor’s site monitor during on -site monitoring visits.  The return of unused or used return ed 
IMP for destruction will be documented on the drug return form.
6.9 Safet y and Suicidality  Assessments
Safety  will be assessed by  AEs, vital signs, continuous pulse oximetry , ECGs, clinical laboratory  
assessments, local injection site grading scale, injection site pain VAS, and eC -SSRS responses.  
See the SOE for specific timing of assessments ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 
4, and Appendix 5 ).
6.9.1 Local Injection Site Tolerability
6.9.1.1 Injection Site Grading
Local injection site grading will be performed b y the Investigator or a tra ined and qualified 
health care professional, according to the SOE in Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and
Appendix 5 .  Injection sites will be assessed for pain, tenderness, ery thema/redness, induration, 
or swelling.  Local injection site tolerability  will be assigned a severit y grade, including none 
(grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe (grade 3), or potentially life threatening 
(grade 4) utilizing the Injection Site Grading Scale in Appendix 15.  The local injection site 
grading assessment will be completed electronically  on injecti on day s immediatel y after each 
injection (within 10 minutes) and at 4 hours (± 30 minutes) and 24 hours (± 4 hours) after each 
injection.

Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 50of 168 Confidential6.9.1.2 Injection Site Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
Injection site pain will be assessed b y the subject at each injection visit electronically  with a 
100mm VAS scale, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents maximum pain ( Appendix 16).  
The injection site- pain VAS scores will be obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 
1 minute and then at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes (±5 minutes).  The timing of the Injection 
Site Pain VAS should be measured from the end of the injection.  In addition to rating pain levels 
by marking on the line the point they  feel best re presents their perception of their current state, 
the subject will also answer the following question with either a Yes or No: Are you currentl y 
experiencing an y burning or stinging at the injection site?
6.9.2 Suicidality
6.9.2.1 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The e C-SSRS will be administered according to the SOE in Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 
3, 
Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 .  The e C-SSRS is a questionnaire designed for assessment of 
suicidal ideation and behavior in adolescents and adults (Posner 2011).  The questionnaire will 
be administered as an electronic, self -
rated version (eC- SSRS).  Clinical trial versions of the 
questionnaire are available for trial screening and follow up visits.  A sample section from the 
Baseline/Screening eC -SSRS and the follow up eC -SSRS are presented in Appendix 10 and 
Appendix 11, respectively.  
If a subject becomes suicidal during the stud y, the investigator should provide the appropriate 
treatment to the subject.  If the suicidality  is deemed to be related to IMP and it is within 14 day s 
of an injection, the depot may  be removed ( Section 6.14.1).
The eC -SSRS should be completed prior to SUBOXONE and RBP- 6000 injection and at 
approximately  the same time each day  ±2 hours.
If, there is a
positive on the eC -SSRS after screening the subject will be evaluated by  the 
investigator for continuation in the study .  If needed, the investigator can consult with the 
medical monitor on continuation in the study  of subjects with a positive eC -SSRS.
6.10 Adverse Events A ssessments
6.10.1 Definition
In accordance with ICH and US FDA guidance, any  untoward medical occurrence incurred by  a 
subject that occurs after the first study -related procedure to the completion of the protocol -
defined safety surveillance period a nd is associated with the use of the drug, regardless of the 
presence of causal relationship, is a reportable AE.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test abnormalities, are 
considered AEs if they :
Result in discontinuation fr om the study ,
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 51of 168 ConfidentialRequire treatment or an y other therapeutic intervention,
Require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to 
confirm the abnormality ), or
Are associated with clinical signs or sy mptoms that would have a sign ificant clinical 
impact, as determined b y the I nvestigator.
6.10.2 Performing Adverse Events Assessments
The Investigator is ultimately responsible for assessing and reporting all AEs as outlined in the 
protocol.  The assessment of AEs may  be delegated to a medic ally qualified sub- investigator, 
trained on this study  protocol, who is listed on the FDA Form 1572 or equivalent document, and 
on the delegation of authority  form.
AEs should be volunteered by  the subject or solicited from the subject using a standard 
statement, obtained from examination of the subject at a clinic visit, or from observations of 
clinically  significant laboratory  values or special examination abnormal values.  If an event 
assessed b y one of the study scales requires intervention, or if in th e opinion of the Investigator, 
it is clinically  significant, then it will be reported as an AE.
All AEs are to be assessed and recorded in a timely manner and followed to resolution or until 
the Investigator determines that there is not an anticipated reso lution.  Each AE is to be 
documented with reference to severity , date of occurrence, duration, treatment, and outcome.  
Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or non -serious.  In addition, the 
Investigator must assess whether the AE is d rug-related or not.  Changes in severit y of AEs 
should be documented as one event at the maximum severity  that occurred during the study .
6.10.3 Timing
AEs will be captured from the time the subject gives informed consent until the subject 
completes the study .
Surgical procedures, planned before enrollment of the subject in the study, are not considered 
AEs if the condition was known before study  inclusion.  I n this case the medical condition 
should be reported in the subject’s medical history.  
If a subject expe riences the onset of an SAE within 30 day s following study  completion and in 
the opinion of the Investigator, that SAE is associated with the study, it will be followed and 
reported as described in Section 6.10.9.2.
If a SAE oc curs a PK sample will be taken as soon as possible after the event is reported.  If 
possible, an additional sample should be collected when the SAE has been resolved.
6.10.4 Severity
Adverse events with changes in severity should be documented as one event at the maximum 
severit y.
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 52of 168 ConfidentialIntensit y Definition
Mild Causes transient or mild discomfort ; no limitation of usual activities; no 
medical intervention required
Moderate Causes mild to moderate limitation in activity ; some limitation of usual 
activities: no or min imal medical intervention or therap y is required.
Severe Causes marked limitation in activity ; some assistance is usually  required; 
medical intervention or therap y is required; hospitalization is probable.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the int ensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively  minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event 
outcome or a ction criteria usually  associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations.
6.10.5 Relationship
The Investigator or a medically  qualified sub -investigator, trained on this study  protocol, listed 
on the 1572 form or equivalent document and on the delegation of authority form is responsible 
for determining the AE relationship to the investigational product.
The following categories will be used to def ine the relationship of an AE to the administration of 
the investigational product:
Not Related: Data are available to identify  a clear alternative cause for the AE other than 
the investigational product.
Related: The cause of the AE is related to the in vestigational product and cannot be 
reasonabl y explained by  other factors (e.g., the subject’s clinical state, 
concomitant therap y, and/or other interventions).
6.10.6 Expectedness
An unexpected AE is an y AE, the nature and severity of which is not consistent w ith the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an investigational product or 
product label/summary  of product characteristics for an approved product).
6.10.7 Clinical Significance
The Investigator or medically  qualified sub -investigato r, trained on this study  protocol, listed on 
the 1572 form or equivalent document and on the delegation of authorit y form is responsible for 
determining clinical significance of abnormal assessment results (e.g., laboratory or ECG results) 
for the subject.
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 53of 168 Confidential6.10.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Changes in laboratory  values or vital signs, or other safety  parameters (e.g., ECG, neurological 
and clinical s ymptom assessments) as noted in the protocol are a subset of AEs and are 
reportable onl y if considered to be clinically  significant by  the investigator or medicall y qualified 
sub-investigator except that:
•Baseline assessments are differentiated from AE/sy mptoms that are incurred post 
informed consent.  These baseline lab assessments, if determined to be clinicall y 
significant abnormal values, reflect the status of the subject prior to study  participation.  
These clinicall y significant pre -dose abnormal assessments without clinical sy mptoms 
will not be reported as AEs. 
6.10.9 Serious Adverse Events
6.10.9.1 Definition
A SAE is de fined as a ny AE occurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following outcomes: 
death, 
life-threatening AE,
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
a persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or
a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
“Important medical events may  be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention t o 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.” 
6.10.9.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor by  the Investigator or designee by  email or fax within 
24 hours of discovery , using the form provided by the Sponsor.  The SAE report should also be 
emailed to the Sponsor Medical Monitor.

be contacted:
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 54of 168 ConfidentialThe Investigator or designee must inform the IRB immediately  regarding any  AE (does not have 
to be causall y related) that is both serious and unexpected; or that represents a series of AEs that 
on anal ysis is unanticipated, or occurs at an unanticipated frequency , or otherwise represents an 
unanticipated safet y risk to the study  subject. The IRB may  subsequently  choose to modify  the 
informed consent or request changes to the proto col or I nvestigator’s Brochure.  A PK sample 
will be taken as soon as possible after an y SAE is reported. If possible, an additional sample 
should be collected when the SAE has been resolved.
6.10.10 Treatment -Emergent Adverse E vents
A TEAE is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study  drug or was present prior 
to the initiation of study  drug, but increased in frequency  or severit y following initiation of 
treatment, regardless of causality .
6.10.11 Procedures and Follow -Upof Subjects with Ongoing SAEs or Experiencing 
SAEs after Completion of or Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects with SAEs ongoing at the end of the study  or after ET will be followed by  the 
Investigator until stabilization or resolution.  If a subject experi ences the onset of an SAE within 
a period of 30 days following stud y completion or withdrawal and, in the opinion of the 
Investigator or medically qualified sub -investigator, it is associated with the study , it will be 
followed up and reported as described for other SAEs.
6.10.12 Pregnancy
If a female subject believes she is pregnant (e.g., missed period, self -administered pregnancy  
test) the subject will be instructed to return to the clinical unit within 48 hours to undergo a 
serum pregnancy test.  If a pregnancy in a subject is confirmed at an y time during the stud y 
through a serum pregnancy  performed by  the study  laboratory , the subject will be discontinued 
from the study  and will undergo all final study  visit procedures (with the exception of a urine 
pregnancy  test).  If the partner of a stud y subject becomes pregnant, the pregnancy  will be 
reported to the clinical unit within 48 hours of the subject’s knowledge of the pregnancy .  
Allconfirmed pregnancies that occur within this study  will be followed until resolution (i.e., 
termination [voluntary  or spontaneous] or birth).  
Pregnancy  ([study  subject or the partner of a study subject] [without associated unexpected or 
adverse sequelae]) is not a reportable AE but must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
the Investigator or study  staff first being aware of the subject’s condition.

Page 55of 168 Confidential6.11 Clinical Outcome Assessments
Clinical o utcome assessments will include the UDS for opioids and other drugs; self -reported use 
of illicit opioids, other drugs, and alcohol on t he TLFB; COWS, SOWS, and Opioid Craving 
VAS.
6.11.1 Timeline Followback Interview
The TLFB Interview will be administered according to the SOE in Appendix 1 , Appendix 2, 
Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 . The TLFB Interview is a method to assess recent drug 
use and will be administered electronicall y.  The questionnaire should be administered by an 
interviewer.  The interview instrument asks subjects to retrospectivel y estimate their drug use in 
the 30 day s prior to screen at the screening visit and since the last visit at all subsequent v isits.  
Only  occurrence of use is captured (i.e., used or did not use) (Fals- Stewart 2000). The interview 
takes approximately  10-30minutes to complete and is appropriate for males and females 14 
years of age and older.  Drugs to be assessed in this study  include opioids, methadone, 
buprenorphine, cocaine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines/methamphetamine, 
phency clidine, and ethanol ( Appendix 17
).
The timeline followback interview should be completed prior to SUBOXONE and RBP
-6000 
injection and at approximately  the same time each day  ± 2 hours.
6.11.2 Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale 
The Opioid Craving VAS will be administered electronicall y according to the SOE in Appendix 
1, Appendix 2 , Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and Appendix 5 .  A VAS is an instrument that 
measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and 
cannot easil y be directl y measured.  The amount of opioid craving that a subject feels for illicit 
opioids (not the buprenorphine used for t
reatment of opioid use disorder) can be recorded along a 
continuum from “no craving at all” to “strongest craving ever” (McMillan and Gilmore -Thomas 
1996).  Operationally , the VAS is a horizontal line, 100 millimeters (mm) in length, anchored by  
word descr iptors at each end, as illustrated in Appendix 14 .  The subject indicates the point on 
the line that he/she feels represents his/her perception of their current state.  The VAS score is 
the difference from the l eft hand end of the line to the point that the subject marks and will be 
electronically  calculated.
6.11.3 Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale 
The COWS assessment will be administered electronically  according to the SOE in 
Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 .  The COWS is an 11 -item, validated 
instrument used to assess sy mptoms of opiate withdrawal (Wesson 2003 , Tompkins 2009).  The 
score is the sum of the response to each of the 11 items.  The COWS is sometimes used by  
clinicians treating subjects with buprenorphine.  A score of 5 to 12 is considered mild, 13 to 24 is 
moderate, 25 to 36 is moderatel y severe, and a score of exceeding 36 is considered severe 
withdrawal.  COWS scores will be electronically  calculated.  Each subject should be assessed by  
the same qualified and trained individuals throughout the course of the study  as much as 
possible.  This scale is presented in Appendix 12
.

The SOWS (Handlesman 1987) will be administered electronicall y according to the SOE in 
Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5.  The SOWS is a 16 -item 
scale completed b y the subject and used to assess the subject’s perception of opiate withdrawal 
symptoms. SOWS scores will be electronically  calculated.  This scale is presented in Appendix 
13.
6.12 Health Economics and Outcomes A ssessments
Health economics and outcomes assessments will include: EQ 5D- 5L, SF-36v2, MSQ, HCRU, 
TEA, ASI -Lite,BDI-II, 
and BPI. 
All questionnaires will be completed at the appropriate study  visits as indicated in the following 
sections .
6.12.1 EuroQoL -5 Dimensions -5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) and EQ -VAS
The EQ -5D
-5L will be used to record subjects’ health -related quality  of life throughout the study  
at the time points indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and
Appendix 5 ).  It will be administered electronically . 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a widely -used, generic health
-related quality  of life instrument, which consists 
of 2 sections:  the EQ -
5D-5L descriptive s ystem and the EQ visual analogue sc ale (EQ VAS)
(Appendix 18).  The EQ -
5D-5L is comprised of 5 questions/dimensions (mobility , self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression) each of which can take 1 of 5 
responses.  The responses record 5 levels of severity  (no problems/slight problems/moderate 
problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension.  EQ -5D -5L 
health states can be converted to a single summary index (range: 0 -1) by using value sets th at 
attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension.  The EQ -VAS is a standard, vertical, 20 -
cm visual analogue scale and will be used for recording a subject’s rating for their current health -
related quality of life state (Herdman 2007).  
6.12.2 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
-36 (SF -36v2)
The SF -36v2 is a generic, subject- reported outcome instrument used to assess quality  of life, 
which will be administered electronicall y at the time points indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 ). 
TheSF-36v2 is a 36- question instrument, which assesses 8 health concepts: 1) limitations in 
physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of 
physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of phy sical health 
problems; 4) bodily  pain; 5) general mental health (psy chological distress and well -being); 6) 
limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy  and 
fatigue); and 8) general health perceptio ns (Appendix 19 ).  The scale score of each domain is 
calculated based on the summed s
core across items included in the domain and is rescaled to 0 to 
100 with higher score sindicating better health state s.

Page 57of 168 ConfidentialThe S F-36v2 provides scores for each of the eight health domains and ps ychometrically -based 
physical component summary  (PCS) and mental component summary  (MCS) scores. The 
physical functioning, role phy sical, bodily  pain, and general health can be used to const ruct a 
PCS score, while the vitality , social functioning, role emotional, and mental health scales are 
used to construct the MCS Scores (Ware 2007).
6.12.3 Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)
The MSQ is a single -item, patient- rated questionnaire (Appendix 20 ) that evaluates patient 
satisfaction with opioid medication. (Vernon 2010).  Medication satisfaction will be measured 
with the MSQ at the time points indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4, 
andAppendix 5 ) electronically .
6.12.4 Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) Questionnaire
The Healthcare Resource Utilization questionnaire will be completed b y the I nvestigator or 
designee at the time points indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , 
Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 ).  The HCRU will be used to collect current health insurance status, 
ho
spitalizations; residential substance abuse treatment; general practitioner, specialist, and 
counseling visits; and ED visits ( Appendix 21).  It will be administered electronicall y.
The outpatient services captu red on this questionnaire are ones conducted outside the study .  
Visits to the study  site for scheduled study  visits should not be reported here.
6.12.5 Treatment Effectiveness Assessment (TEA)
The TEA is a patient -reported instrument which will be measur ed at th e time points indicated in 
the SOEs ( Appendix 1, Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5).
The TEA is a 4 -item scale completed by  the subject and used to assess the subject’s perception 
of treatment effectiveness (L ing 2012).  Patients respond to the TEA questions providing 
both 
numerical responses and brief feedback about their situation on four domains: substance use 
(drugs, alcohol, tobacco), health (e.g., ph ysical, emotional health), lifesty le (e.g., housing or 
living situation, family , employ ment, relationships), and com munity  (e.g., obey ing laws and 
becoming a responsible member of societ y).  The TEA scale is presented in Appendix 22.
6.12.6 Addiction Severity Index (ASI) Lite
The ASI Lite is a patient-reported instrument that is con ducted via interview by  a team member 
trained in the administration of the ASI  Lite.  ASI Lite will be administered at the time points 
indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 ).  Given the nature 
of the ASI Lite, this instrument can be administered after injection, and is recommended for 
administra tion between the 2 hour injection site pain VAS and 4 hour local injection site grading 
assessments. 
The ASI Lite, in an interview used to assess the subject’s addiction severity, covers 7potential 
problem areas: medical, employment/support status, alcoh ol, drug, legal, family /social, and 
psychiatric problems (Strain 1996). The ASI Lite interview text is presented in Appendix 23
. The 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 58of 168 ConfidentialASI obtains lifetime information about problem behaviors, as well as problems within the 
previous 30 day s. Of note, some items of the ASI Lite are onl y asked once at the initial visit; at 
subsequent time points only  items indicated in the questionnaire should be administered. 
Below is a brief description of each of the scales that will be included within the trial:  
The medical status section of the ASI gathers basic information about the patient's medical 
history . It addresses information about lifetime hospitalizations, long -term medical problems and 
recent ph ysical ailments.  Th e employ ment/support status section of the ASI gathers information 
about the resources a patient can record on a job application, as well as his or her current sources 
of income. Man y items have a 30 -day recall period regarding current employ ment. The 
drug/alcohol section of the ASI gathers information about the patient's substance abuse history . It 
addresses information about current and lifetime substance abuse, consequences of abuse, 
periods of abstinence, treatment episodes, and financial burden of subs tance abuse. While 
lifetime versions of these items are also available, this would only  be assessed at first interview.  
The legal status section of the ASI gathers information about the patient's legal history . It 
addresses information about probation or parole, charges, convictions, incarcerations or 
detainments, and illegal activities.  The family /social relationships section is designed to 
summarize the psy chiatric, alcohol and drug abuse problems of the patient's relatives in each of 
the specified cate gories.  The psy chiatric problem section gathers information on psy chiatric 
symptoms experienced by  the patient.
6.12.7 Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI -II)
Depression is highl y prevalent in patients with opioid use disorders.  Studies have been 
conducted using buprenorphine as a treatment for major depressive disorder. 
The Beck Depression Inventory  II (BD I-II) is used to measure the severit y of depression in 
adult s and adolescents.  The BDI -II is scored on a 4 point L ikert sc ale, each item ranging from 0 -
3; ithas a 2 week recall period, can be self -administered or administered b y interview and takes 
5-10 minutes to complete. 
The strengths of the BDI- II include its ease of use; also, it is widely  known and the result s are 
easy to score and interpret. The BD I-II has been successfull y used to discriminate and measure 
depression in chronic pain patients on opioid therapy  (Geisser 1997, Farren 2002, McCauley  
2014).  
The BD I-II assessment will be administered electronically according to the SOE in Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 .  This scale is presented in Appendix 24. 
Roll- over subjects who did not complete the BDI -II at EOS/Day  169 will complete this 
assessment at the screening visit.
6.12.8 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form
A substantial number of patients in the USwith opioid use disorder began by  using prescription 
pain medications and subsequently  developed dependence. Many  of these patients are concerned 
at the beginning of t
herapy  that their pain may  worsen when they  are no longer taking their 
opioid medication.  
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 59of 168 ConfidentialThe Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI -SF) is used to measure the severity  of pain and the 
impact of pain on dail y functions in adults. The BPI -SF has a 24- hour r ecall period and can be 
self-administered or administered by  an interviewer. It takes approximately 5 minutes to 
complete an instrument. 
The BPI has been widely used to measure pain severity  among opioid users (Rosenblum 2003).  
BPI-SF consists of a combination of y es/no questions, an item based on human figure drawing, 
open -ended questions, and items based on a numeric rating scale.  Key  strengths of the BPI -SF 
are that it is eas y to administer and can provide rapidassessment of pain. BPI  has been translated 
in many  languages and is widely  used. It captures all the components of pain: structural, intensity  
and its effect on patients.  
The BPI assessment will be administered electronically  according to the SOE in Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5.  This scale is presented in Appendix 25 . 
Roll-over subjects who did not complete the BPI at EOS/Day  169 will complete this assessment 
at the screening visit.
6.13 Concomitant Medicat ion A ssessments
The Investigator or designee will record an y concomitant therapies given for 30 day s prior to the 
start of and during the course of the stud y on the concomitant medication page of the subject’s 
source documentation and CRF. Any  changes in c oncomitant therap y during the stud y will also 
be documented, including cessation of therap y, initiation of therap y, and dose changes.
6.14 Removal of Subjects from the Study
Subjects will be free to withdraw at an y time for any  reason, or they  may  be withdrawn if 
necessary , to protect their health and safet y or the integrit y of the stud y data.  
The Investigator or medically  qualified sub -investigator may  choose to withdraw a subject from 
the study  at an y time.  Reasons for removing a subject from the stud y ma y include, but are not 
limited to the following:
•Protocol deviation that might compromise data integrity , protocol compliance, or subject 
safet y,
•An AE is reported that compromises or potentially  compromises subject safet y,
•The Sponsor or Investigator termin ates the stud y, or
The subject requests to be discontinued from the study  (i.e., subject declines further stud y 
participation).
If a subject withdraws prematurel y from the stud y after receiving IMP, the primary  reason for 
withdrawal will be documented as 1 of the above, lost to follow -up, or other in the source 
documentation. 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 60of 168 ConfidentialIn the event a subject is lost to follow up, the site staff must make reasonable attempts to contact 
the subject.  A minimum of 2 documented telephone calls followed b y a certified m ailed letter is 
considered reasonable.
6.14.1 Early Removal of RBP -6000
In the event of an emergency  or if a subject withdraws or is withdrawn within the first 14 days of 
receiving an injection of RBP- 6000, subjects may  have the option to have the depot surgicall y 
removed b y a ph ysician delegated to perform surgery . The medicall y responsible physician 
should carefull y discuss this option with subjects given the use of ATRIGEL Delivery  System 
and the feasibility  of extracting the depot. The surgical procedure requi res a small incision in the 
abdomen where the depot was placed, removal of the depot with forceps, and suturing to close 
the incision.  The subject should have the EOS assessments performed at the time of early  
removal of RBP -6000. Subjects that have had a n RBP -6000 depot removed should have follow -
up telephone contact(s) within 7 to 14 day s to assess status and for resolution of related AEs. In 
the event a subject cannot be contacted for the follow- up telephone contact, a minimum of 2 
documented telephone calls followed by  a certified mailed letter is considered reasonable. At this 
point, the subject may  be considered lost to follow -up.
The extracted RBP -6000 depot will be disposed of into an appropriate ,secure biohazard 
container per the standard operatin g procedures (SOPs) at the clinical site. 
Detailed RBP -6000 depot removal instructions are in Appendix 8 .
6.14.2 Stopping Rules
The Investigator must contact the Sponsor immediately  to discuss whether to suspend dosing if 
an AE or laboratory  abnormalities indicates that continued dosing of subsequent subjects would 
not be tolerated or would jeopardize the subjects’ safet y.  The Sponsor alone may suspend dosing 
at an y time for an y reason.
Factors that must be considered for suspension of dosing include the frequency , severit y, clinical 
significance, possible causality, and anticipated reversibility  of all observed AEs or laboratory  
abnormalities for each specific SC injection group.  If dosing is suspended, the I RB will be 
notified in accordance with I RB requirements.
6.14.3 Screen Failures
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is documented in 
writing (i.e., the subject signs the ICF)but who did not receive study  medication.
Rescreening of a de novo subject may  be permitted after consultation with the study medical 
monitor.

6.15.1 Counseling/Behavioral Therapy
After enrollment, subjects will receive manual- guided, individual behavioral therap yonce a 
week to accompan y the pha rmacotherap yas indicated in the SOEs ( Appendix 2 , Appendix 3, 
Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5).  Behavioral therapy will continue through the end of the stud y 
(EOS/ET visit) at a minimum frequency
 of once a week.  Additional behavioral counse ling 
above this standard frequency , as well as the reason(s) that additional counseling was pr ovided, 
will be documented.  Behavioral therap y can be complete by an y appropriately trained staff 
member at the site.
An Individual Drug Counseling (IDC) reference manual will be provided to each site.  
6.15.2 Unscheduled Visits
If unscheduled visits occur, the Investigator must record the following in the subject’s source 
documentation:
Any AEs
Reason for unscheduled visit
Recording of an y changes or additions to concomitant medications dose or regimen
COWS (if deemed appropriate)
Any clinical assessments deeme d appropriate for the clinical care of the subject
Unscheduled visits should not alter the timing of the routine study  schedule.
6.15.3 Additional Care of Study Subjects Following Completion of the Study
Each subject will be evaluated on his or her final study  day.  Subjects who experience SAEs at 
the EOS, or experience the onset of an SAE after the final visit, will be followed up as described 
in Section 6.10.11.  No other additional care of study  subjects will take pl ace following 
completion of the study . 
6.15.4 Treating Toxicity
Treatment of suspected RBP -6000 toxicity  should be at the judgment of the Investigator or 
medically -qualified sub -investigator and may  include an attempt to remove the depot if toxicity  
is discovere d within the first 14 days post injection.  Subjects who have had RBP -6000 removed 
will be followed up according to the procedures described in the SOE (EOS/ET Visit; Appendix 
3and Appendix 5 ) and Section 6.14.
6.15.5 Ancillary Medications
Treatment of signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal after enrollment can be treated with 
ancillary  medications allowed by  the protocol, as cli nically  indicated by  the Investigator or 
physician Sub- Investigator.  Subjects whose s ymptoms are not manageable will be discontinued

6.16 Appropriateness of Measurements
Within the study  population of opioid -dependent subjects, certa in common signs and s ymptoms 
are display ed that must be evaluated for safet y and efficacy of treatment during clinical trials.  
The instruments used (e.g., COWS, SOWS, Opioid Craving VAS, and eC -SSRS) were 
developed to measure the specific s ymptoms exhibit ed by  and challenges facing opioid-
dependent individuals.

8.1 Qualit y Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  centers, review of protocol procedures with the investigators 
and associated personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by  the Sponsor, and direct 
transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a central laboratory  into the Sponsor’s (or 
designee’s) database.  Written instructions will be provided for stud y drug preparation and 
dosing, collection, preparation, and shipment of blood, plasma, and urine s amples.  Guidelines 
for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study  personnel before the start of the 
study .  The Sponsor (or designee) will review eCRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-
site monitoring visits and after transmission to the Sponsor (or designee).  Any discrepancies will 
be resolved with the Investigator or suitabl y qualified designee, as appropriate.
8.2 Qualit y Assurance
This study  will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable regulations and 
guidelines.  
In accordance with the standards defined in Sponsor SOPs and applicable regulatory  
requirements, clinical studies sponsored b y Sponsor are subject to Sponsor Quali ty Audits at the 
study  sites that will be conducted by  personnel from an appropriate unit.  Site audits will be 
made periodically  by the Sponsor’s (or contractor’s) qualified compliance auditing team, which 
is an independent function from the study  conduct team.  Audits will include review of, but are 
not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and 
comparison of eCRFs with source documents.  The investigator agrees to participate with audits 
conducted at a reas onable time in a reasonable manner.  Full consultation with the I nvestigator 
will be made prior to and during such an audit, which will be conducted according to the Quality

9.1 General Considerations
A Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved and before 
database lock occurs.  The SAP wil l provide further details regarding the definition of anal ysis 
endpoints, data handling rules, and the statistical methodology  to be used to address all study  
objectives.  The SAP will also include formats for the summary and analysis tables, listings, and
graphical display s.
This section describes methods for sample size determination, anal ysis populations, and planned 
analyses for, safet y, PK, and clinical outcomes endpoints.  Additional unplanned analyses may 
be required after all planned anal yses have been completed.  Any  unplanned anal yses will be 
clearl y identified in the clinical study report.  Any deviations from the analy ses described below 
will be included in the SAP, which will form Appendix 16.1.9 of the clinical study  report.
Continuous variable s will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as means, standard 
deviations (SD), medians, minimums, and maximums.  Categorical variables will be reported as 
frequency  counts (including number missing) and the percentage of subjects in correspondi ng 
categories.  Individual subject data will be presented by subject in data listings.  Data listings will 
include all data collected from the initial screening visit to the end of study  for all subjects 
enrolled.  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size
There is no formal sample size calculation. Approximately  300 de novo subjects as well as 
approximately  300 subjects who completed the RB -US-13-
0001 efficacy  study  will be enrolled 
into this study  to ensure at least 100 subjects reach 1 y ear of treatment with RBP -6000.

Demographic and baseline characteristics (gender, r ace, age, weight, height) will be summarized 
by treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Qualitative variables (gender, race) will be 
summarized using frequencies while quantitative variables (age, weight, height) will be 
summarized using mean, SD, m edian, minimum, and maximum.
9.5 Primary  Analysis
9.5.1 Safety Endpoints
Safety  variables will include AEs, local injection site tolerability  (e.g., injection site grading); 
injection site pain using a subject -reported VAS; suicidality  using the eC -SSRS, concomitant
medications; changes in clinical laboratory  results (hematology , chemistry  and urinal ysis); vital 
sign measurements; 12 -lead ECGs, phy sical examination results; body  weight, height, BM I, and 
abdominal fat measurement (waist- to-hip ratio). Safet y variables will be analy zed using the 
safet y population. 
Baseline is defined as the last non- missing value prior to SC injection on Day  1.  No imputation 
of missing values will be performed.
9.5.1.1 Adverse Events
All AEs will be coded using the most up- to-date version of the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) and reported to the FDA. AEs that began more than 30 day s 
after the last study  subject assessment day  will not be included in the safet y anal ysis. Onl y 
TEAEs occurring post administration of RBP-6000 will be included in the safet y analysis (See 
Section 6.10.10).
The incidence of AEs (number and percent of subjects reporting the AE at least once during the 
study ) will be summarized for all AEs, by  therelationship to study drug and by  severit y.
9.5.1.2 Laboratory Data
At each visit where clinical laboratory  assessments are conducted, summary statistics for the 
absolute laboratory  value and the changes from baseline will be presented.  
9.5.1.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs measurements will be a ssessed for clinical relevance and be performed as deemed 
medically  necessary  by research personnel.  Oral temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate will 
be taken after the subject has completed a minimum 3- minute rest in the supine position.  
Systolic and diastolic BP measurements will be assessed while supine throughout the trial.
9.5.1.4 Other Variables Related to Safety
Results from 12- lead ECGs will be categorized as normal, abnormal clinically  significant, or 
abnormal not clinicall y significant and will b e summarized by  time point using frequency  counts

summarized by  time point using descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum).  
Additional analy sis of E CG parameters will be outlined in the SAP.
Medical history  will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by  treatment group as described 
for AEs ( Section 9.5.1.1).  Bod y weight, height, BMI , and abdominal fat measur ement (waist- to-
hip ratio) will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, 
maximum), including change from baseline.
Total eC -SSRS scores will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, 
minimum, maximum), incl
uding change from baseline.  Subjects’ self- reported illicit drug use 
from the TLFB will be summarized as descriptive statistics.
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the most recent version of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Drug dict ionary .  Incidence (number and percent of subjects 
reporting the medication at least once during the study ) will be summarized for all concomitant 
medications.
Local injection site tolerability  as assessed b y the Injection Site Grading scale will be 
summar ized by  category  and severit y using frequency counts and percentages similar to 
summaries for AEs ( Section 9.5.1.1).  I njection Site Pain VAS scores will be summarized by  
dose, injection, and time point after in jection.  The burning/stinging categorical variable 
(Yes/No) will be summarized by  percent of responses in each treatment.
9.6 Secondary  Analysis
9.6.1 Clinical Outcomes Assessments
COWS, SOWS and Opioid Craving VAS total scores will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum), including change from baseline. Subjects’ 
self-reported illicit drug use from the TLFB will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of urine s amples negative for 
opioids, the CDF of the percentage of self- reports from the TLFB negative for illicit opioid use, 
and other outcome measures will be calculated.  
9.7 Other A nalyses
9.7.1 PK/PD Modeling
The population PK model established using the data collecte d in the double -blind, placebo -
controlled, efficacy  study (Study  RB-US-
13-0001) will be refined using the sparse PK samples 
collected in the present study  to characterize the disposition of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine following SC injections of RBP- 6000, with the assessment of potential 
covariates affecting the PK of both compounds.  Subsequently, the relationships between 
buprenorphine plasma concentrations and clinical outcomes assessments will be investigated.  
These relationships will be initiall y assessed in a descriptive manner, and, if applicable, 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 68of 168 Confidentialappropriate PK/PD models will be developed to describe these relationships.  A stand -alone 
modeling analy sis plan will be generated, and the results will be reported in a standalone 
modeling report . 
9.7.2 Health Economic and Outcomes Assessment
The health economic and outcomes research endpoints for this study  are:
EQ-5D- 5L
SF-36v2 
MSQ 
HCRU 
TEA
ASI Lite
BDI-II
BPI
Summary  scores for these measures will be calculated, as appropriate. Categorical variables will 
be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Continuous measures will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) as 
appropriate. An anal ysis of change will be conducted. A stand- alone statisti cal anal ysis plan will 
be developed prior to database lock for health economics and outcomes research assessments. 
A separate stand -alone SAP will be developed prior to database lock with full detail regarding 
health economics and outcomes anal yses.
9.8 Handling of Missing Data
For dichotomous outcome measures such as UDS results (negative; non -negative) and self -
reports for illicit opioid use (negative; non -negative), any  missing observation will be recorded 
as “non -negative.” For all continuous endpoints (e.g., COWS, SOWS, and VAS), the missing 
data mechanism will be assumed to be either missing completely  at random (MCAR) or missing 
at random (MAR).  The missing data will not be imputed because the analysis method, mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM), d oes not require any  imputation and no sensitivity  
analyses will be performed on these variables.  For time -to-event variables, if the event of 
interest is not observed prior to withdrawal or end of treatment, the observations will be censored 
at the time of withdrawal or at the end of treatment.   For example, if some subjects still have not 
had a urine sample negative for opioids combined with self- reports negative for illicit opioid use 
when the stud y ends or at the time of withdrawal from the study, then the time to first urine 
sample negative for opioids combined with self-reports negative for illicit opioid use will be 
censored at the last time they  were assessed.
9.9 Subjects Who are Withdrawn from the Study
Subjects who withdraw after receiving RBP -6000 wi ll not be replaced.

laboratory  that is certified and accredited to perform the assigned assessments.
Collection of safet y laboratory samples is described in Sectio n 6.6.2 .  The Clinical L aboratory  
will provide normal ranges and collection, processing, and shipping instructions to the sites in a 
separate laboratory  reference manual.
10.2 Institutional Review Board or Independen t Ethics Committee 
Approval
The protocol will be reviewed b y an independent, appropriatel y constituted, centralized IRB/ 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  Study  enrolment and protocol related procedures, which 
do not form part of the subject’s normal cl inical treatment, will not be performed until the 
IRB/IEC of record has provided written approval of the protocol or a modification thereof.  The 
IRB/IEC must be constituted and operate in accordance with the principles and requirements of 
ICH GCP.
Study  drug can only  be supplied to the I nvestigator after documentation on all ethical and legal 
requirements for starting the study  has been received by  the Sponsor.  This documentation must 
also include an IRB/IEC membership list that contains member’s occupati ons.  If the IRB/ IEC 
will not disclose the names of the committee members, the IRB/IEC Federalwide Assurance 
Number may  be accepted as a substitute for this list.  Formal approval by  the I RB/IEC should 
mention the study  title, study  code, study  site (or re gion or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), 
and an y other documents reviewed.  It must mention the date on which the decision was made 
and must be officiall y signed by a committee member.

Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 71of 168 Confidential10.3 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The Investigator is responsible for e nsuring that the clinical study  is performed in accordance 
with the protocol, current I CH GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory  and country -specific 
requirements.  GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality  standard for designing, 
conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects.  
Compliance with this standard provides the public assurance that the rights, safet y, and 
well-being of stud y subjects are protected and that the clinical study data are credible.
10.4 Subject Information and Consent
Prior to the subject incurring the first stud y related procedure, the Investigator or designated 
individual will explain to each subject the nature of the study , its purpose, procedures, expected 
duration, alternat ive therapies available, and the benefits and risks involved in study  
participation. It should also be mentioned that all informed consent documents and other 
documents used in the conduct of the study  have been approved by  an IRB/IEC.
In the case of a non -medically  qualified person conducting the consent process, he/she should 
have read y access to a medicall y qualified investigator to whom an y questions from the study 
subject may  be referred. Subjects will be given consent documents to review and the oppor tunity  
to ask questions. Subjects will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study  at an y time 
without prejudice. 
After this explanation and before an y stud y-specific procedures have been performed, the subject 
will voluntarily  sign and date the ICF to indicate he/she wishes to participate in study .  The 
Investigator or the individual designated to conduct the consent discussion for the Investigator 
will also sign and date the I CF. The time (hour and minute) the consent is signed must also be 
recorded in the subject’s source notes, b y the person obtaining consent from the subject. Verbal 
informed consent followed by  a signed consent short form is not acceptable to Sponsor.
Prior to participation in the study , the subject will receive a cop y of the signed and dated I CF 
along with an emergency card with contact information for the Investigator and site staff in the 
event of a medical emergency  during the study .
10.5 Subject Confidentiality
All subject -identify ing documentation generated in this study  must be considered confidential 
and must not be disclosed to any  persons not directly  concerned with the study  without written 
permission from the subject.  However, authorized regulatory  officials and Sponsor personnel (or 
their representatives) will be allow ed full access to inspect and cop y the records.  All subject 
bodily  fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely  in accordance with this 
protocol and the informed consent signed b y the subject, unless otherwise agreed to in writing b y 
the Sponsor.
Each subject will be identified by  initials and an assigned subject number when reporting study  
information to any  entity  outside of the study  center.  Data containing subject identification will 
not be removed from the study  center without subject identifiers having been redacted.

Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 72of 168 ConfidentialA Certificate of Confidentiality  will be obtained for this study  prior to subject screening.
10.6 Stud y Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Sponsor procedures, the clinical monitor(s) 
will periodica lly contact the site, including conducting on- site visits at intervals agreed by  the 
Investigator and documented in the Clinical Monitoring Plan and the Site Initiation Visit Report.  
The clinical monitor(s) will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to discuss the protocol 
and data collection procedures with site personnel.  I n accordance with applicable regulations 
and GCP guidelines, the Investigator shall make available for direct access all study -related 
records upon request of the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s agents, clinical monitor(s), auditors, and/or 
IRB/IEC.  The Sponsor’s monitors will visit the site during the stud y in addition to maintaining 
frequent telephone and written communication.  The extent, nature, and frequency  of on- site 
visits will be based on such considerations as the study  objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose 
of the study , study  design complexity , and enrolment rate.  
The Investigator must allow the clinical monitor(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the clinical monitor(s) to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.
10.6.1 Study and Site Closure
Upon completion of the study , study  closeout activities must be conducted by  the Sponsor or its 
designee in conju nction with the I nvestigator, as appropriate.
In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to temporaril y suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study  at an y time and for any reason.  If such action is taken, the Sponsor will discuss this with 
the Investig ator (including the reason[s] for taking such action) at that time.  The Sponsor will 
also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of the study  and the 
reason(s) for the action.  If required b y applicable regulations, the Investi gator must inform the 
IRB/IEC promptly  and provide the reason(s) for the suspension or termination.  I f the stud y is 
prematurel y discontinued, all study  data and study  drug remaining on site must be returned to the 
Sponsor or its designee.
10.7 Case Report Forms and Study  Records
The Investigator is responsible for the quality  of the data recorded in the electronic Case Report 
Forms (eCRFs).  The data recorded should be a complete and accurate account of the subject’s 
record collected during the study .  Study  data are not to be gathered directly  onto the eCRF but 
must be gathered onto primary  source documents at the clinical site. Completion of source 
documents will precede the completion of the eCRF.  Source documents may  be electronic, hard 
copy , or a combination of both.  Source documents are defined as the results of original 
observations and activities of a clinical investigation. Source documents will include, but are not 
limited to, progress notes, electronic data, screening logs, and recorded data from aut omated 
instruments. All source documents pertaining to this study  will be maintained by  the 
investigators and made available for direct inspection by  the authorized study  personnel outlined

Page 73of 168 Confidentialin the I CF. The ePRO tablet will be considered the source document for individual ePRO 
elements such as stud y-specific scales when collected directl y onto the tablet.
Data collection will be completed according to the guidelines provided b y Sponsor or its 
designee.  
For all subjects who signed an informed consent, all r equired data are to be recorded using 
source documents and reported on the eCRF, except for study  scales that are record ed directl y on 
the ePRO tablet.   Site staff will receive training on the eCRF completion guidelines and 
requirements for source document ation.
Completed eCRFs will be reviewed b y the stud y monitor in line with CRF completion guidelines 
for the stud y to ensure completeness and consistency.  The stud y monitor will review every 
subject’s eCRF with source data verification for at least all cri tical data points.  The source data 
verification plan for this study  will define the level of source data verification required for 
non-critical data points.  Screen failure data and source documents require only  source data 
verification for critical data points such as informed consent, demographics, AEs, reason for 
termination, i.e., inclusion/exclusion.  Any  discrepancies found during the eCRF review will be 
clarified b y the Investigator or designated individual.  This includes eCRF reviews at the site b y 
Sponsor or its designee, or during quality  assurance review of the data.  
An explanation must be documented for an y missing data.  An y changes to information in the 
study  progress notes and other source documents will be initialled and dated on the day  the 
change is made b y a site staff member authorized to make the change.  Changes will be made by  
striking a single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly 
entering the correct data (e.g., wrong data right data) .  If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation by  the 
clinician.
The Investigator must sign and date a declaration attesting to his/her responsibility  for the quality  
of all data recorded, and that the data represents a complete and accurate record of each subject’s 
participation in the study .  
All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made b y the Investigator or designated 
individual.  The I nvestigator or designa ted individual must adjust the eCRF (if applicable) and 
complete the query .
10.8 Data Monitoring Committee
Not applicable; there will be no data monitoring committee for this study .
10.9 Protocol Deviations
This study  is intended to be conducted as described in this protocol.  At the outset of the study , a 
process for defining and handling protocol deviations will be established.  This will include 
determining which violations will be designated “key ” and require immediate notification to the 
Sponsor.  I n the event of a deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 74of 168 Confidentialmistake, the Investigator or designated individual must contact the Sponsor at the earliest 
possible time by  telephone.  This will allow an early  joint decision regarding the subject’s 
conti nuation in the study .  This decision will be documented by  the Investigator and the Sponsor, 
and reviewed b y the monitor.  Deviations from the protocol are to be documented.  The 
Investigator or designated individual will be responsible for identify ing and reporting all 
deviations, which are defined as isolated occurrences involving a procedure that did not follow 
the study  protocol or study -specific procedure.  Deviations will be reported as required to the 
IRB and in the final study report.
10.10 Access to Sour ce Documentation
The Investigator must agree to complete a subject identification and enrolment log to permit eas y 
identification of each subject during and after the study .  This document will be reviewed by  the 
Sponsor site contact for completeness.  The subject identification and enrollment log will be 
treated as confidential and will be filed by  the Investigator in the stud y center file.  To ensure 
subject confidentiality , no copy  will be made.  All reports and communications relating to the 
study  will identify  subjects by  initials and assigned number only .  The Investigator must also 
complete a subject -screening log, which reports on all subjects who were seen to determine 
eligibility  for inclusion in the study .
At a minimum, source documentation must b e available for the following to confirm data 
collected in the eCRF: subject identification, eligibility , and study  identification; study  
discussion and date of informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety  and efficacy  parameters 
as required b y the protocol; record of all AEs; concomitant medications; study  drug 
administered; date of study  completion or earl y discontinuation, and reason for early 
discontinuation if applicable.
10.11 Data Generation and A nalysis
10.11.1 Data Collection and Data Management
Study  specific data that has been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database b y individual(s) designated b y the Investigator in accordance with the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  Data is verified electronically  using a series of on- line progr ammed edit checks that 
have been created b y the CDM (Clinical Data Manager) and programmed by  the Clinical Data 
Programmer or Designee.  Data discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team 
and investigated b y the CRA and Site Study  Coo rdinator.  CRAs will review and verify  all data 
collected in the eCRF against source documentation during scheduled monitoring visits.  The 
CRA will work closely  with the Site Study  Coordinator to address any  discrepancies which have 
been found so that proper resolutions can be made and documented into the clinical database.  
An audit trail within the sy stem will track all changes made to the data.
10.11.2 Database Quality Assurance 
The clinical database will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values 
requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries 
requiring clarification will be generated and addressed by  the investigational site.  Only  
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Page 75of 168 Confidentialauthorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical databa se, and all corrections will be 
documented in an audit trail.  
10.12 Retention of Data
All documents pertaining to the study , including all versions of the approved study  protocol, 
copy  of the informed consent document and Health I nsurance Portability  and Accountability  Act 
documents, completed eCRFs, source documents (subject records, subject diaries, hospital 
records, laboratory  records, drug accountability  records, etc.), and other study -related documents 
will be retained in the permanent archives of the stud y site.
The Investigator must therefore notify  and obtain approval in writing from the Sponsor prior to 
destruction of an y stud y records or provide an opportunity for the Sponsor to collect such 
records.  If the investigator withdraws from the study  (e.g., relocation, retirement) all study -
related records should be transferred, in a written agreement with the Sponsor, to a mutually  
agreed upon designee within a Sponsor- specified timeframe.
10.13 Financial Disclosure
RBP requires, for each study , the disclosure of any financial interests from each investigator or 
sub-investigator, including financial interests of the spouse and each dependent child of the 
investigator who is directly  involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects that 
could affect the reliability  of data submitted to regulatory  authorities. The collection of this 
financial interest information at the start of the study , as well as an y updates should this 
information change, is required by the FDA when submitting a marketing application and is in 
line with the GCP requirement to consider an y potential conflicts of interest.
10.14 Publication and Disclosure Policy
A clinical study  report will be prepared following completion of the study .  The report will be a 
record of the total study  conduct and will be subject to Sponsor approval and restrictions on 
distribution/disclosure.  
The study  data will be owned by  Sponsor.  Publication of any  and all data will be at the 
discretion of Sponsor.  The Investigator will not disseminate, present, or publish any  of the stud y 
data without the prior written approval of Sponsor to do so.

------------------------------------- CONTRAINDICATIONS ------------------------------------
Hyperse nsitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone. (4)
------------------------------- WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -----------------------------
Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. 
Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient’s level of sta bility is 
essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or 
without appropriate patient follow -up visits. (5.1) 
Significant respiratory depression and death have occurred in association 
with buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) 
route in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants 
(including alcohol). (5.2)
Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, SUBOXONE sublingual film, 
or both in situations of concomitant prescription. (5.3)Store SUBOX ONE sublingual film safely out of the sight and reach of 
children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory 
depression in children. (5.4)  
Chronic administration produces opioid -type physical dependence.  
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dose taper may result in opioid 
withdrawal syndrome. (5.5)
Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and 
evaluate suspected hepatic events. (5.6)
Do not administer SUBOXONE sublingual film to patients with known 
hypersensitivit y to buprenorphine or naloxone. (5.7)
An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse 
of SUBOXONE sublingual film by individuals physically dependent on full 
opioid agonists or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects
of other opioids have subsided. (5.8)
Neonatal withdrawal has been reported following use of buprenorphine 
by the mother during pregnancy. (5.9) 
SUBOXONE sublingual film is not appropriate as an analgesic. There have 
been reported deaths of opioid naïve individuals who received a 2 mg 
sublingual dose. (5.10)
Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
SUBOXONE sublingual film is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part 
of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. 
Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codif ied at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this 
product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying 
requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent 
to pre scribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique 
identification number that must be included on every prescription.   
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
2.1 Induction
Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long -or short -
acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.  To 
avoid precipitating an opioid withdrawal syndrome, the first dose of buprenorphine/naloxone shoul d be 
started only when objective signs of moderate withdrawal appear.
On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg /2 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended.  
Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/ 0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxo ne and 
may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2 -hour intervals, under 
supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal 
symptoms.  
On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg /4 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended. 
Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is 
not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow -up visits.
Patients dependent on methadone or long -acting opioid products
Patients dependent upon methadone or long -acting opioid products may be more susceptible to 
precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short -acting opioid products.  
Buprenorphine/nalox one combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well -
controlled studies for induction in patients on long -acting opioid products, and contain naloxone, which 
is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precip itated and prolonged 
withdrawal.  For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long -
acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions.  Following induction, the 
patient may then be transitioned to once -daily SUBOXONE sublingual film .
Patients dependent on heroin or other short -acting opioid products 
Patients dependent on heroin or short -acting opioid products may be inducted with either SUBOXONE 
sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monoth erapy.  The first dose of SUBOXONE sublingual 
film or buprenorphine should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal 
appear, and not less than 6 hours after the patient last used an opioid.
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 101of 168It is recommended that an adequate mainte nance dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as 
rapidly as possible.  In some studies, a too -gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop -
out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.
2.2 Maintenance 
The dosage of SUBOXONE sublingual film from Day 3 onwards should be progressively adjusted in 
increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the 
patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and sympto ms.
After treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of SUBOXONE sublingual film is 
generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per 
day depending on the individual patient and clinical r esponse.  The recommended target dosage of 
SUBOXONE sublingual film during maintenance is 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single 
daily dose.  Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg daily have not been demonstrated to provide a clinical 
advantage. 
2.3 Method of Administration
Do not cut, chew, or swallow SUBOXONE sublingual film.  Place the SUBOXONE sublingual film under the 
tongue, close to the base on the left or right side.  If an additional sublingual film is necessary to achieve 
the prescribed dose, place the additional sublingual film sublingually on the opposite side from the first 
film.  Place the sublingual film in a manner to minimize overlapping as much as possible.  The sublingual 
film must be kept under the tongue until the film is completely dissolved.  SUBOXONE sublingual film 
should NOT be moved after placement. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the 
patient. 
2.4 Clinical Supervision
Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupe rvised 
administration as the patient’s clinical stability permits. SUBOXONE sublingual film is subject to 
diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, 
consider the patient’s level of stability, the secu rity of his or her home situation, and other factors likely 
to affect the ability to manage supplies of take -home medication.
Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of 
treatment) based upon th e individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in 
consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or 
without appropriate patient follow -up visits. Periodic assessment i s necessary to determine compliance 
with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.
Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not 
indicate illicit drug use , less frequent follow -up visits may be appropriate. A once -monthly visit schedule 
may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their 
treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy sh ould be based on the 
physician’s evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:
1. Absence of medication toxicity.
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 102of 1682. Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects.
3. Responsible handling of medications by the patient.
4. Patient’s co mpliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery -oriented activities, 
psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities).
5. Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use). 
If treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re -evaluate the appropriateness of 
continuing the current treatment. 
2.5 Patients With Hepatic Impairment 
Because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated, severe hepatic 
impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, 
and moderate hepatic impairment also results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a greater extent 
than buprenorphine, the combination product should g enerally be avoided in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] .
2.6 Unstable Patients
Physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriate ly provide further management for 
particular patients.  For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or 
unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the 
expertise to manage the patient.  In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the 
patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment.  Decisions should be based 
on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the be ginning of treatment.
Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be 
provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.
2.7 Stopping Treatment
The decision to discontinue therapy wi th SUBOXONE sublingual film after a period of maintenance 
should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.  Taper patients to avoid opioid withdrawal 
signs and symptoms .

Confidential Page 103of 1682.8 Switching Between Buprenorphine or Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and 
SUBOXONE Sublingual Film
Patients being switched between buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine only sublingual tablets 
and SUBOXONE sublingual film should be started on the corresponding dosage of the previously 
administered product.  Ho wever, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between 
products.  Not all strengths and combinations of the SUBOXONE sublingual films are bioequivalent to 
the SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets as observed in pharmacokineti c studies 
[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  Therefore, systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may 
be different when patients are switched from tablets to film or vice -versa. Patients should be monitored 
for symptoms related to over -dosing or u nder- dosing.
2.9 Switching Between SUBOXONE Sublingual Film Strengths
As indicated in Table 1, the sizes and the compositions of the four units of SUBOXONE sublingual films, 
i.e., 
2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg and the 12 mg/3 mg units, are different from one another. If 
patients switch between various combinations of lower and higher strength units of SUBOXONE 
sublingual films to obtain the same total dose, (e.g., from three 4 mg/1 mg units to a single 12 mg/3 mg 
unit, or vice -versa), systemic exposur es of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different and patients 
should be monitored for over -dosing or under -dosing.  For this reason, pharmacist should not substitute 
one or more film strengths for another without approval of the prescriber.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
SUBOXONE sublingual film should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be 
hypersensitive to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, 
have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Abuse Potential 
Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense 
buprenorphine with appropriate precau tions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure 
appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the 
patient’s level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or 
without appropriate patient follow -up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)] .
5.2 Respiratory Depression 
Buprenorphine, particularly when taken by the IV route, in combination with benzodiazepines or other 
CNS depressants (including al cohol), has been associated with significant respiratory depression and 
death.  Many, but not all, post -marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the 
concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by self -injection. D eaths have 
also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other 
depressants such as alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs.  Patients should be warned of the potential 
danger of self- administration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with 
SUBOXONE sublingual film [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re -establishment of adequate 
ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required.  Naloxone may be of value for the 
management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may 
be necessary.
SUBOXONE sublingual film should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory 
function (e .g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, 
hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre -existing respiratory depression).
5.3 CNS Depression 
Patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, 
benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, or other CNS depressants 
(including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression.  Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, 
SUBOXONE sublingual film, or both in situatio ns of concomitant prescription [see Drug Interactions 
(7.3)] .
5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure
Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally 
exposed to it.  Store buprenorphine -containing medica tions safely out of the sight and reach of children.
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 105of 1685.5 Dependence
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu- opioid receptor and chronic administration produces 
physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid taper.  The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists 
and may be delayed in onset.  Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids.  This 
should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is 
concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence 
(9.3)].
5.6 Hepatitis, Hepatic Events
Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice hav e been observed in individuals receiving 
buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post -marketing adverse event reports.  The spectrum of 
abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports 
of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy.  In many 
cases, the presence of pre -existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C 
virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic dr ugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may 
have played a causative or contributory role.  In other cases, insufficient data were available to 
determine the etiology of the abnormality.  Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration 
of acute hepatit is in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary.  The 
possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the 
hepatic abnormality in some cases.  Liver function tests, prior to initiati on of treatment are 
recommended to establish a baseline.  Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also 
recommended.  A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is 
suspected.  Depending on the case, SUBOXON E sublingual film may need to be carefully discontinued to 
prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict 
monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 
5.7 Allergic Reactions 
Cases of hypersensitivity t o buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both 
in clinical trials and in the post -marketing experience.  Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, 
and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms inc lude rashes, 
hives, and pruritus.  A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to 
the use of SUBOXONE sublingual film. 
5.8 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms 
Because it contains naloxone, SUBOXONE s ublingual film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and 
symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, 
morphine, or methadone.  Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, SUBOXONE 
subling ual film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered 
sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 
RBP -6000 Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 106of 1685.9 Neonatal Withdrawal
Neonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treate d with buprenorphine during 
pregnancy.  From post -marketing reports, the time to onset of neonatal withdrawal signs ranged from 
Day 1 to Day 8 of life with most cases occurring on Day 1.  Adverse events associated with the neonatal 
withdrawal syndrome incl uded hypertonia, neonatal tremor, neonatal agitation, and myoclonus, and 
there have been reports of convulsions, apnea, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. 
5.10 Use in Opioid Naïve Patients
There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of 
buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. SUBOXONE sublingual film is not appropriate as an 
analgesic.
5.11 Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function
Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  Because hepatic 
impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, 
the doses of buprenorphine and na loxone in this fixed -dose combination product cannot be individually 
titrated. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher 
levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an i ncreased risk of 
precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with 
buprenorphine’s efficacy throughout treatment.  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the 
differential reduction of naloxone clearance compare d to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment.  Therefore, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not 
recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due 
to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products may be 
used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have 
initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Howeve r, patients should be 
carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with 
buprenorphine’s efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
5.12 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery 
SUBOXONE sublingua l film may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of 
potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment 
induction and dose adjustment.  Patients should be cautioned about driv ing or operating hazardous 
machinery until they are reasonably certain that SUBOXONE sublingual film therapy does not adversely 
affect his or her ability to engage in such activities.  
5.13 Orthostatic Hypotension
Like other opioids, SUBOXONE sublingual f ilm may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory 
patients.
5.14 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure 
Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with 
caution in patients with head injury, intrac ranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal 
pressure may be increased.  Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of 
consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.

Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 107of 1685.15 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure
Bupren orphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus 
should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.
5.16 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions
As with other opioids, buprenorphi ne may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute 
abdominal conditions.
5.17 General Precautions
SUBOXONE sublingual film should be administered with caution in debilitated patients and those with 
myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or 
coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; 
or kyphoscoliosis.
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
Because clinical trials are conducted under wid ely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in 
the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and 
may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
The sa fety of SUBOXONE sublingual film is supported by clinical trials using SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) 
sublingual tablets and SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets, and other trials 
using buprenorphine sublingual solutions, as well as an open -label study in 194 patients treated with 
SUBOXONE sublingual film.  In total, safety data from clinical studies are available from over 3000 
opioid -dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of 
opioid dependence. Few differences in the adverse event profile were noted among SUBOXONE 
sublingual film, SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets, SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) 
sublingual tablets and a buprenorphine ethanolic sublingual solution.  
The most comm on adverse event (>1%) associated with the sublingual administration of the SUBOXONE 
sublingual film was oral hypoesthesia. Other adverse events were constipation, glossodynia, oral 
mucosal erythema, vomiting, intoxication, disturbance in attention, palpit ations, insomnia, withdrawal 
syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and blurred vision.
Other adverse event data were derived from larger, controlled studies of SUBOXONE (buprenorphine 
and naloxone) and SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) tablets and of buprenorphine sublingual sol ution.  In a 
comparative study of SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) and SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) 
sublingual tablets, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg/4 mg SUBOXONE 
(buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets or 16 mg SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) sublingual tablets.  
The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4 week study of 
SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets and SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) sublingual 
tablets.

The safety of SUBOXONE sublingual film during treatment induction is supported by a clinical trial using 16 
patients treated with SUBOXONE sublingual film and 18 treated with a buprenorphine -only sublingual film.  
Few differences in the adverse event profiles were noted between SUBOXO NE sublingual film and the 
buprenorphine -only sublingual film.  
The most common adverse event occurring during treatment induction and the 3 days following induction 
using SUBOXONE sublingual film was restlessness. Other adverse events were anxiety, piloe rection, 
stomach discomfort, irritability, headache, rhinorrhea, cold sweat, arthralgia, and lacrimation increased.
Four subjects left the study early on the first day of sublingual film administration.  However, there was 
not evidence to suggest that any of the four subjects experienced precipitated withdrawal secondary to 
the administration of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films.

Confidential Page 111of 1686.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post -approval us e of SUBOXONE sublingual 
film. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not 
always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
The most frequently rep orted postmarketing adverse events were peripheral edema, stomatitis, 
glossitis, and tongue disorder. 
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Cytochrome P -450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Inhibitors and Inducers
Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CY P3A4; therefore, 
potential interactions may occur when SUBOXONE sublingual film is given concurrently with agents that 
affect CYP3A4 activity.  The concomitant use of SUBOXONE sublingual film with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., 
azole antifungals such as ketocona zole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease 
inhibitors) should be monitored and may require dose- reduction of one or both agents.
The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied; therefore, it is 
recommende d that patients receiving SUBOXONE sublingual film be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of opioid withdrawal if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
rifampicin) are co -administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
7.2 Antiretrovirals
Three classes of antiretroviral agents have been evaluated for CYP3A4 interactions with buprenorphine.  
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme 
pathway, thus no interaction s with buprenorphine are expected.  Non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine and etravirine are 
known CYP3A inducers whereas delaviridine is a CYP3A inhibitor. Significant pharmac okinetic 
interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and buprenorphine have been shown in 
clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant 
pharmacodynamic effects. It is recommended that patients who are on chronic buprenorphine 
treatment have their dose monitored if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.  Studies have 
shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, 
lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonav ir) have little effect on buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant 
pharmacodynamic effects.  Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and 
atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine and patie nts in 
one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in post -marketing 
reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.  
Monitoring of patients taking buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir is 
recommended, and dose reduction of buprenorphine may be warranted.
7.3 Benzodiazepines
There have been a number of post -marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the 
concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines.  In many, but not all, of these cases, 
buprenorphine was misused by self -injection.  Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of 
benzodiazepines and buprenorphine altered the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine -induced 
respiratory depression, making the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full

benzodiazepines or other drugs that act on the CNS, regard less of whether these drugs are taken on the 
advice of a physician or are being abused/misused.  Patients should be warned that it is extremely 
dangerous to self -administer non- prescribed benzodiazepines while taking SUBOXONE sublingual film, 
and should al so be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with SUBOXONE sublingual film only 
as directed by their physician.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Pregnancy Category C.
Risk Summary 
There are no adequate and well- controlled studies of SUBO XONE sublingual film or 
buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. Limited published data on use of buprenorphine, the 
active ingredient in SUBOXONE, in pregnancy, have not shown an increased risk of major malformations. 
All pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background risk of 2 -4% for major birth defects, and 
15-20% for pregnancy loss. Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified 
adverse events at clinically relevant doses. Pre -and postnatal development studies in rat s demonstrated 
dystocia, increased neonatal deaths, and developmental delays. No clear teratogenic effects were seen 
with a range of doses equivalent to or greater than the human dose. However, in a few studies, some 
events such as acephalus, omphalocele, and skeletal abnormalities were observed but these findings 
were not clearly treatment -related. Embryofetal death was also observed in both rats and rabbits.
SUBOXONE sublingual film should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies t he 
potential risk to the fetus. 
Clinical Considerations
Disease -associated maternal and embryo- fetal risk
Opioid dependence in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes such as low birth 
weight, preterm birth, and fetal death.
Fetal/neonat al adverse reactions
Neonatal abstinence syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who were on buprenorphine 
maintenance treatment. Observe newborns for poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and 
seizures, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Labor or Delivery
As with all opioids, use of buprenorphine prior to delivery may result in respiratory depression in the 
newborn. Closely monitor neonates for signs of respiratory depression. An opioid antagonist such as
naloxone should be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate.
Data
Human Data
Studies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine 
during pregnancy. Limited published data on malf ormations from trials, observational studies, case 
series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of major 
malformations. Based on these studies the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is not clear and 
there does not appear to be a dose -response relationship.

Confidential Page 113of 168Animal Data
Effects on embryo -fetal development were studied in Sprague -Dawley rats and Russian white rabbits 
following oral (1:1) and intramuscular (IM) (3:2) administration of mixtures of buprenorphi ne and 
naloxone.  Following oral administration to rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at 
buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (estimated exposure 
approximately 150 times and 50 times, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 
16 mg on a mg/m² basis).  No definitive drug- related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and 
rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 20 times and 35 times, 
respectively, the recommended human daily dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis).  Acephalus was observed 
in one rabbit fetus from the low -dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from 
the same litter in the mid -dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high -dose group.  
Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose -related post -implantation losses, 
evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers 
of fetuses, were observed at dos es of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 
6times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis).  In the rabbit, 
increased post -implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day.  Following IM 
admin istration in the rat and the rabbit, post -implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live 
fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day.  
Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous (SC) doses up t o 5 
mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 3 and 6 times, respectively, the recommended 
human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis), after IVdoses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated 
exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, respec tively, the recommended human daily 
sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated 
exposure was approximately 95 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a 
mg/m2basis) and 25 mg/ kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the 
recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis). Significant increases in skeletal 
abnormalities (e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco -lumbar ribs) were noted in ra ts after SC
administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 0.6 times the 
recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis), but were not observed at oral 
doses up to 160 mg/kg/day.  Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of 5 
mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual 
dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis) or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure 
was approxima tely equal to the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis) 
were not statistically significant.
In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre -implantation losses at oral doses of 1 
mg/kg/day or greater and post -implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 
mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily 
sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis).
Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine 5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis).  
Fertility, peri -, and post -natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in 
neonatal mo rtality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the recommended 
human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis), after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up 
(approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis), 
and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.06 times the recommended human daily 
sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m² basis).  An apparent lack of milk production during these studies 
likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices.  Delays in the occurrence of

8.3 Nursing Mothers
Risk Summary
Based on two studies in 13 lactating women, buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine are 
present in low levels in human milk and infant urine, and available data have not shown adverse 
reactions in breastfed inf ants. There are no data on the combination product buprenorphine/naloxone 
in breastfeeding, however oral absorption of naloxone is minimal. Caution should be exercised when 
SUBOXONE is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of 
breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SUBOXONE and any 
potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal 
condition.
Clinical Considerations
Advise the nursing mother tak ing SUBOXONE to monitor the infant for increased drowsiness and 
breathing difficulties.
Data
Based on limited data from a study of 6 lactating women who were taking a median oral dose of 
buprenorphine of 0.29 mg/kg/day 5 -8 days after delivery, breast milk contained a median infant dose of 
0.42 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, which are equal to 0.2% 
and 0.12% of the maternal weight -adjusted dose.
Based on limited data from a study of 7 lactating women who were taking a me dian oral dose of 
buprenorphine of 7 mg/day an average of 1.12 months after delivery, the mean milk concentrations of 
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were 3.65 mcg/L and 1.94 mcg/L respectively. Based on the 
limited data from this study, and assuming mi lk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively breastfed 
infant would receive an estimated mean of 0.55 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.29 mcg/kg/day of 
norbuprenorphine, which are 0.38% and 0.18% of the maternal weight -adjusted dose.
No adverse reactio ns were observed in the infants in these two studies.
8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of SUBOXONE sublingual film have not been established in pediatric 
patients.  This product is not appropriate for the treatment of neonatal abstinence synd rome in 
neonates, because it contains naloxone, an opioid antagonist. 
8.5 Geriatric Use
Clinical studies of SUBOXONE sublingual film, SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual 
tablets, or SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) sublingual tablets did not include s ufficient numbers of subjects 
aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently than younger subjects.  Other 
reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients.  In general, dos e selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low 
end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac 
function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Confidential Page 115of 1688.6 Hepatic Imp airment
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone has been 
evaluated in a pharmacokinetic study. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. While no 
clinically significant changes have been observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment; the plasma 
levels have been shown to be higher and half -life values have been shown to be longer for both 
buprenorphine and naloxone in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The magnitude 
of the effec ts on naloxone are greater than that on buprenorphine in both moderately and severely 
impaired subjects. The difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are 
greater in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in subjects with m oderate hepatic impairment, 
and therefore the clinical impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Buprenorphine/naloxone products 
should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)].   
8.7 Renal Impairment 
No differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics wer e observed between 9 dialysis -dependent and 
6normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine.  The effects of renal failure on 
naloxone pharmacokinetics are unknown.
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
9.1 Controlled Substance
Buprenorphine is a Schedule III narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act.
Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this 
product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain quali fying 
requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent 
to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique 
identification number that must be included on every prescription.
9.2 Abuse
 Buprenorphine, like morphine and other opioids, has the potential for being abused and is 
subject to criminal diversion. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine 
in situations when the clinician is con cerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.  
Healthcare professionals should contact their state professional licensing board or state controlled 
substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of thi s product.
 Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids 
should be provided with or referred for more intensive and structured treatment.  
 Abuse of buprenorphine poses a risk of overdose and death.  This risk is increased with the 
abuse of buprenorphine and alcohol and other substances, especially benzodiazepines.
 The physician may be able to more easily detect misuse or diversion by maintaining records of 
medication prescribed including date, dose, quantity, fre quency of refills, and renewal requests of 
medication prescribed.
 Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re- evaluation of 
therapy, and proper handling and storage of the medication are appropriate measures that help to lim it 
abuse of opioid drugs.

Clinical Study Protocol: RB -US-13-0003 14 April 2015
Confidential Page 116of 1689.3 Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu- opioid receptor and chronic administration produces 
physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by moderate withdrawal signs and symptoms 
upon abrupt discontin uation or rapid taper.  The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with 
full agonists and may be delayed in onset [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] .
A neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in the infants of women treated with 
bupreno rphine during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] .
10 OVERDOSAGE
The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, respiratory 
depression, and death. 
In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac statu s of the patient should be monitored 
carefully.  When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the 
re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution 
of assiste d or controlled ventilation.  Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures 
should be employed as indicated.
In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re -establishment of adequate 
ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required.  Naloxone may be of value for the 
management of buprenorphine overdose.  Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may 
be necessary.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
SUBOXONE sublingual film contains buprenorphine and naloxone.  Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at 
the mu -opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa -opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist 
at mu -opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically 
dependent on full opioid agonists when administered parenterally.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 Subjective Effects :
Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest 
that sublingual bupreno rphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling 
effect. 
In opioid -experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of 
buprenorphine/naloxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between 
doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone.   
Opioid agonist ceiling -effects were also observed in a double -blind, parallel group, dose -ranging 
comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo and a 
full agonist control at various doses.  The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of 
at least one week to 16 opioid -experienced subjects who were not physically dependent.  Both active 
drugs produced typical o pioid agonist effects.  For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, 
buprenorphine produced a dose -related response.  However, in each case, there was a dose that 
produced no further effect.  In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist co ntrol always produced the 
greatest effects.  Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of 
buprenorphine (8 -32mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours 
after drug administration.  The ons et of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with 
the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine 
compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.HO

Confidential Page 118of 168 Physiologic Effects:
Buprenorphine in I V (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses has been administered to 
opioid -experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, 
and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence.  
Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment 
conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O 2saturation, or skin temperature across 
time.  Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values).  Minimum and 
maximum effects were similar across all treatments.  Subjects remained responsive to low voice and 
responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were 
observed. 
The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a 
double -blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual 
solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral meth adone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non -dependent, opioid -
experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported 
more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs 
decre ased O 2saturation to the same degree.
Effect of Naloxone:
Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of buprenorphine tablets 
and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets were similar at equivalent s of buprenorphine.  Naloxone ha d no 
clinically significant effect when administered by the sublingual route, although blood levels of the drug 
were measurable.  Buprenorphine/naloxone, when administered sublingually to an opioid -dependent 
cohort, was recognized as an opioid agonist, whe reas when administered intramuscularly, combinations 
of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist actions similar to naloxone.  This finding 
suggests that the naloxone in buprenorphine/naloxone tablets may deter injection of 
buprenorphine/nalo xone tablets by persons with active substantial heroin or other full mu -opioid 
dependence.  However, clinicians should be aware that some opioid -dependent persons, particularly 
those with a low level of full mu -opioid physical dependence or those whose opi oid physical 
dependence is predominantly to buprenorphine, abuse buprenorphine/naloxone combinations by the 
intravenous or intranasal route.  In methadone -maintained patients and heroin -dependent subjects, IV 
administration of buprenorphine/naloxone combin ations precipitated opioid withdrawal signs and 
symptoms and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric.  In morphine -stabilized subjects, 
intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist 
and withdrawal signs and symptoms that were ratio -dependent; the most intense withdrawal signs and 
symptoms were produced by 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, less intense by an 8:1 ratio.

Confidential Page 119of 16812.3 Pharmacokinetics
Absorption:  
In pharmacokinetic studies, the 2 mg/0.5 mg and 4 mg/1 mg doses administered as SUBOXONE 
sublingual films showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose ofSUBOXONE 
(buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets, whereas the 8 mg/2 mg and 12 mg/3 mg doses 
administered as SUBOXONE sublingual films s howed higher relative bioavailability for both 
buprenorphine and naloxone compared to the same total dose ofSUBOXONE (buprenorphine and 
naloxone) sublingual tablets.  A combination of one 8 mg/2 mg and two 2 mg/0.5 mg SUBOXONE 
sublingual films (total dose of 12 mg/ 3 mg) showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total 
dose ofSUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.6 and 2.7)].
Distribution: 
Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein bound, p rimarily to alpha and beta globulin.
Naloxone is approximately 45% protein bound, primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Buprenorphine undergoes both N -dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation.  The N -
dealkylation pathway is mediated primarily by the CYP3A4.  Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, 
can further undergo glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors in 
vitro ; however, it has not been studied clinically for opioid -like activity. Naloxone undergoes direct 
glucu ronidation to naloxone -3-glucuronide as well as N- dealkylation, and reduction of the 6 -oxo group.
Elimination:
A mass balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and 
feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing.   Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of 
buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites.  In urine, most of 
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine was conjugated (buprenorphine, 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; 
norbup renorphine, 2.7% free and 11% conjugated).  In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine, 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 21% free 
and 2% conjugated). Based on all studies performed with SUBOXONE sub lingual film, buprenorphine has 
a mean elimination half -life from plasma ranging from 24 to 42 hours and naloxone has a mean 
elimination half -life from plasma ranging from 2 to 12 hours.
 Drug -drug Interactions:
CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers:  Subjects rec eiving SUBOXONE sublingual film should be monitored if 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., 
erythromycin) or HIV protease inhibitors and may require dose -reduction of one or both agents.  T he 
interaction of buprenorphine with all CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied, therefore it is 
recommended that patients receiving SUBOXONE sublingual film be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of opioid withdrawal if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) 
are co -administered [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor and its major metabolite, 
norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitrostudies employing 
human liver microsomes. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic doses are not expected to raise significant drug -drug 
interaction concerns.

Hepatic Impairment : In a pharmacokinetic study, the disposition of buprenorphine and naloxone were 
determined after administering a SUBOXONE 2.0/0.5 mg (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) sublingual tablet in 
subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child -Pugh criteria. The disposition 
of buprenorphine and naloxone in patients with hepatic impairment were compared to disposition in 
subjects with normal hepatic function. 
In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, the changes in mean C max,AUC 0-last, and half -life values of both 
buprenorphine and naloxone were not clinically significant. No dosing adjustment is needed in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment.
For subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, mean C max, AUC 0-last, and half -life values of 
both buprenorphine and naloxone were increased; the effects on naloxone are greater than that on 
buprenorphine (Table 4).

Half-life 57% 122%
The difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are greater in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment than subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore the clinical 
impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment. Buprenorphine/naloxone products should be avoided in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
HCV infection: In subjects with HCV infection but no sign of hepatic impairment, the changes in the 
mean C max, AUC 0-last, and half -life values of buprenorphine and nalo xone were not clinically significant in 
comparison to healthy subjects without HCV infection.  No dosing adjustment is needed in patients with 
HCV infection.

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Carcinogenicity:   
Carcinogenicity data on SUBOXONE sublingual film are not available.
A carcinogenicity study of buprenorphine/naloxone (4:1 ratio of the free bases) was performed in 
Alderley Park rats.  Buprenorphine/naloxone was administered in the diet at doses of a pproximately 7, 
31, and 123 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks (estimated exposure was approximately 4, 18, and 44 times the 
recommended human sublingual dose of 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on buprenorphine 
AUC comparisons).  A statistically significant i ncrease in Leydig cell adenomas was observed in all dose 
groups.  No other drug -related tumors were noted.
Carcinogenicity studies of buprenorphine were conducted in Sprague -Dawley rats and CD -1 mice. 
Buprenorphine was administered in the diet to rats at d oses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day (estimated 
exposure was approximately 0.4, 3, and 35 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 
mg on a mg/m2basis) for 27 months.  As in the buprenorphine/naloxone carcinogenicity study in rat, 
statisticall y significant dose -related increases in Leydig cell tumors occurred.  In an 86 -week study in 
CD-1mice, buprenorphine was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (estimated 
exposure was approximately 30 times the recommended human daily subli ngual dose of 16 mg on a 
mg/m2basis).
Mutagenicity:
The 4:1 combination of buprenorphine and naloxone was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay 
(Ames test) using four strains of S. typhimurium and two strains of E. coli. The combination was not 
clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in an IV micronucleus test in the 
rat. 
Buprenorphine was studied in a series of tests utilizing gene, chromosome, and DNA interactions in both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.  Results were negative in yeast ( S. cerevisiae) for recombinant, gene 
convertant, or forward mutations; negative in Bacillus subtilis “rec” assay, negative for clastogenicity in 
CHO cells, Chinese hamster bone marrow and spermatogonia cells, and negative in the mouse 
lymphoma L5178Y assay.
Results were equivocal in the Ames test: negative in studies in two laboratories, but positive for frame 
shift mutation at a high dose (5mg/plate) in a third study.  Results were positive in the Green -Tweets ( E. 
coli) survival tes t, positive in a DNA synthesis inhibition (DSI) test with testicular tissue from mice, for 
both in vivo and in vitro incorporation of [3H]thymidine, and positive in unscheduled DNA synthesis 
(UDS) test using testicular cells from mice.
Impairment of Fertil ity: 
Dietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater (equivalent to 
approximately 47 mg/kg/day or greater; estimated exposure approximately 28 times the recommended 
human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis) produced a reduction in fertility demonstrated 
by reduced female conception rates.  A dietary dose of 100 ppm (equivalent to approximately 10 
mg/kg/day; estimated exposure approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose 
of 16 mg on a mg/m2basis) had no adverse effect on fertility.

RBP -6000 PRE PARATION AND DOSING PROCEDURE
100 MG BUPRENORPHINE
300 MG BUPRENORPHINE
IMPORTANT:  Onl y qualified study personnel can prepare the study drug. Protective gloves 
(latex or nitrile) should be worn when preparing and dosing RBP -6000.  Remove the product 
from the refrigerator at least 15 minutes before use to allow the product to reach room 
temperature before dosing.  Product may  be left at room temperature up to 8 hours prior to use.  
If product is not used that day  it should be marked appropriatel y.  
  
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AS DIRECTED TO ENSURE PROPER DOSING
Preparation of the Product Prior to Administration: 
The following components will be used in the preparation of RBP -6000:
•One sealed foil pouch containing a s yringe pre -filled with RBP -6000 and an oxygen 
absorber pack. 
•One sterile 19 -gauge, one -inch h ypodermic safety needle
1.On a clean field, open the foil pouch and remove the contents. Discard the oxy gen absorber 
pack.   The pouch must be retained for accountability .
2.Un-cap the pre -
filled R BP-6000 sy ringe and attach the safet y needle cartridge by pushing in 
and turning the needle until it is finger tight. Do not strip the threaded fitting b y over -
tightening the needle. Position the sheath at 90 degrees to the needle.  Pull off the needle 
cartridge cover.   More complete documentation on the usage of the SurGuard2 safety  needle 
can be found in the included instruction sheet. 
3.While holding the sy ringe verticall y with the tip upwards, expel air bubbles by  stroking the 
plunger up and down.
4.The product is now read y for administration.  Carefully recap the needle.
Administration Procedure:
IMPORTANT: Once prepared (removed from foil pouch), the product must be 
administered within a maximum of 30 minutes.
Choose an injection site below the wa ist but above the hip bone; from where the body  curves at 
the side to about 2 inches from the middle of the abdomen with adequate amounts of 
subcutaneous tissue that does not have excessive pigment, nodules, lesions, or hair.  Since y ou 
can vary  the inject ion site with a subcutaneous injection, choose an area that has not recently  
been used.  
Possible injection site locations and an injection rotation pattern are shown in Figure 4.

Confidential Page 125of 168Figure 4 Injection Loca tions
1.Cleanse the injection -site area with an alcohol swab.  
2.Using the thumb and forefinger of your non -dominant hand, grab and bunch the area of skin 
around the injection site.
3.Using your dominant hand, insert approximately half the ne edle length quickly . The 
approximate angle you use will depend on the amount and fullness of the subcutaneous tissue 
and the length of the needle.
4. After the needle is inserted, release the skin with y our nondominant hand.
5. Pull back on the plunger to chec k for blood.  If blood is present in the sy ringe, do not inject.  
Withdraw the needle and discard all components safel y in an appropriate biohazard 
container.  Repeat the “Preparation of the Product Prior to Administration” procedures and 
the “Administrati on Procedure ” using a different abdominal injection site with another 
syringe of RBP -6000 and associated components.
6. Inject the product using a slow, steady  push. Press down on the plunger until the sy ringe is 
empty .
7.Withdraw the needle at the same angle used for insertion. Do not rub the injection area.  If 
there is bleeding, appl y minimal pressure with a gauze pad or bandage.  Engage the safet y 
sheath on the needle as per the SurGuard2 needle instructions.  
8.Discard all components safel y in an appropri ate biohazard container.HipbonesWaist

In the event of an emergency  or if a subject withdraws or is withdrawn within the first 14 days of 
receiving an injection of RBP- 6000, subjects may  have the option to have the depot su rgicall y 
removed b y a ph ysician delegated to perform surgery . The medicall y responsible physician 
should carefull y discuss this option with subjects given the use of ATRIGEL Delivery  System 
and the feasibility  of extracting the depot.
The following surgic al procedure should be followed:
1. Palpate the depot and surrounding area to confirm its exact location.
2. Cleanse the area with an antiseptic solution (e.g. , Betadine).  
3. Infiltrate the area with a local anesthesia (e.g. ,Lidocaine 1% or a lidocaine /adrenaline 
[epinephrine] mixture )and wait for it to take effect.
4. Cover the area with a sterile drape.
5. Incise the skin up to the subcutaneous tissues using a scalpel. 
6. U sing blunt and sharp dissection, identify  the plane between the depot and sur rounding 
subcutaneous tissues.  Once the plane is identified, separate the superficial 25% of the 
circumference of the depot with blunt dissection. 
7. Gently  lift the incised ellipse of skin and depot with forceps.  
8. Once the depot is removed, ensure h emostasis, and close the skin with non -absorbable 
sutures.  
9. The extracted RBP -6000 depot will be disposed of into an appropriate ,secure biohazard 
container per the SOP at the clinical site.

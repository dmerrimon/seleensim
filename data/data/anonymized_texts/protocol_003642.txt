training as part of the Site Initiation Visit (SIV) by the sponsor .  
5.0 Justification for the Design of the Clinical Study  
Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic disturbance occurring in the neonatal period, which 
can lead to neonatal morbidity and developmental sequelae. Screening at -risk infants and the 
management of low blood glucose levels in the first hours to days of life is a frequent issue in the 
care of newborn infant. Transitional neonatal hypoglycemia usually resolves within 2 or 3 days of 
age. Severe prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia can cause seizures, brain damage, and 
neurodevelopmental impairment. Signs of neon atal hypoglycemia are non -specific, and babies 
with hypoglycemia are frequently asymptomatic. Therefore, it is common to screen babies 
considered at high risk for neonatal hypoglycemia with repeated blood glucose measurements. 
Usually, plasma or serum samp les are used for routine blood glucose estimation in a hospital 
laboratory. However, such an approach using a laboratory -based testing method is not practical in 
acute situations due to the delayed turnaround time. Therefore, BGMS are frequently used for t he 
bedside estimation of blood glucose levels. Rapid measurement time, smaller volume of required 
blood samples, and enhanced usability are the main benefits of using BGMS compared with 
laboratory -based testing. Most BGMS that are currently used are initia lly developed for monitoring 
blood glucose levels in adult patients with diabetes. Neonatal blood differs from adult blood in two 
major aspects —it has lower concentrations of blood glucose and a wider range of hematocrit levels  
(Adamkin 2011; BAPM 2017; Ha rris et al 2012; Lucas et al 1988; Movalia and Ogino 2006; 
Nuntnarumit et al 2011 ; Roth -Kleiner et al 2010; Rozance 2006) .

Page 11 of 42 The CONTOUR  NEXT  and CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMS s are investigational BGMS s 
comprised of the blood glucose meter, the compatible test strips, and control solutions. They are 
automated   systems intended for the quantitative   measurement of glucose   in  neonatal  blood, 
venous blood, fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the fingertip or palm. The system is 
intended to be used for self -testing by lay persons with diabetes and for near -patient testing by 
HCP s to monitor  the effectiveness of diabetes control . Its use in this trial is for the quantitative 
measurement of  glucose levels  in neonat es from fresh capillary whole blood drawn from the heel  
by HCP s in a clinical setting . 
This investigational clinical trial will evaluate the performance of two BGMS s, CONTOUR  NEXT  
BGMS and CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMS s, in neonat es within a hospital ward, e.g. 
routine/newborn nurseries, S pecial Care Nurserie s (SCN) , Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ). 
The BGMS will be used by a POC operator in a clinical setting using residual heel-stick capillary  
blood samples from neonates  who underwent routine prescribed testing . The residual blood no 
longer needed for clinical purposes will be used for this study.  
6.0 Risks and benefits of the investigational device and clinical investigation  
Risks  
This is a low risk study.  Residual b lood samples will ONLY be tested  for the study if the neonate  
is having prescribed blood tests done as ordered  by their physician. Therefore, there will be no 
additional blood samples collected  for this study.  All testing procedures with the investigational 
device will be perfomed by the study staff in a laboratory setting and at no point will the neontate  
come in contact with the Investigational device or any other study -related material . There is no 
discomfort to the  neonate as only residual blood will be collected . 
There are no risks to patients associated with this study except for the potential for loss of 
confidentiality.  Measures will be taken to minimize this risk by de -identifying study samples.  
Without the identification list that is exclusively stored at the site, connection between personal 
data and study data is not possible.  
Benefits   
There are no direct benefits to the subject (neonate) for donation of residual blood samples for this 
study except to contribute to a study that provides information on the performance of two BGMS s 
when measuring glucose in capillary blood by HCPs within a clinical setting . Subjects will not 
receive compensation . 
There are no anticipated adverse device effects.

Page 12 of 42 7.0 Objectives and Hypotheses  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of CONTOUR  NEXT  and 
CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs with residual heel-stick capillary blood samples from neonat es, 
i.e. babies who are less than 28 days old . The performance of the BGMS  will be analyzed according 
to the following objectives :  
7.1 Primary Objective : The accuracy criteria below are taken from CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood 
Glucose Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved Guideline – Third Edition . 
CLSI document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 
2013.   
7.1.1 At least 95% of all blood glucose results shall fall within ±12 .5% of reference values 
(laboratory method) for glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L)  and 
within ±12 mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L)  at glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL  (5.55 
mmol/L) . 
Note: Sat isfying Criterion  7.1.1  would also satisfy the ISO 15917 :2013  criteria of 
obtaining the ±15% of reference values (laboratory method) for glucose 
concentration ≥100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L)  and within ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 mmol/L)  at 
glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L).  
7.1.2 At least 98% of values sh all be within ±20% of reference values (laboratory method) 
for glucose concentration ≥75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L)  and within ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 
mmol/L)  at glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L) . 
7.2 Other Objectives:  
• Evaluate the performance of both BGMSs for neonates who are <24 hours old. Compute 
differences between BGMS and laboratory blood glucose measurements and plot them against 
hematocrit results.  
• Evaluate the performance of both BGMSs with blood samples from babies in the NICU .  
• Compute differences between BGMS and laboratory blood glucose measurements and plot 
them against bilirubin  results , for those subjects where bilirubin measurements were recorded 
(when available) . 
8.0 Clinical Study Design  
8.1 This is an open label , prospective, single arm study .   The results of the study devices will 
be compared to the laboratory analyzer results from the same blood sample . 
8.2 For each BGMS, 120 evaluable samples (N=240 evalu able results  due to  duplicate testing ) 
are required . Therefore at least 120 subjects will be enrolled.  Up to 200 subjects may be 
enrolled to obtain the required number of samples.

Page 13 of 42 8.3 Randomization : 
8.3.1 Since two BGM Ss will be tested in the study, the order of testing the study devices 
will be randomized.   
8.3.2 Three strip lots (per BGMS) will be tested, with each sample tested with one lot.  
The strip lots will be randomized.  
8.4 The results from these two BGMS s will not be compared to each other.  
8.5 The study design follows  CLSI - POCT12 -A3:2013 and ISO 20916:2019(E)  to ensure it is 
scientifically robust and valid.  
8.6 Subjects  with non -evaluable data will be replaced as needed to obtain N=120 samples, and 
N= 240 results (duplicate results) for each BGMS.

11.0 Procedures  
11.1 Summary  
Laboratory professionals will test the glucose concentration of residual capillary whole blood 
samples, collected (into a tube) from neonatal heel -sticks only,  using the CONTOUR  NEXT  and 
CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs. The investigational site will enroll neonates from hospital 
wards (e,g, routine/newborn nurseries, SCN, NICU). For subject safety and ethical reasons, only 
those neonates already scheduled to have blood samples obtained for prescribed testing (by the 
hospital staff), will be enrolled into this study.   No neonate will have heel -stick blood collected 
solely for the purpose of this study.  
A minimum of 10 capillary whole  blood samples (from residual neonatal heel -stick) will be tested 
in duplicate on  both BGMSs. A sub -group of at least 5 of these blood samples will be from  neonates 
who are less than 24 hours of age. A sub -group of at least 5 blood samples will be from  neonates 
in the NICU. These two sub -group s’ samples are permitted to overlap.  
Up to  50uL of whole blood will be removed from the subject's sample tube , and will be used for 
completing a total of 4 tests using both BGMSs (two tests with CONTOUR  NEXT  BGMS and 
two tests with CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMS), and a hematocrit measurement . Each subject 
sample will be tested using both BGMS as per the randomization schedule. After completion of 
the BGMS testing, each meter will be cleaned and disinfected as per the procedures in Appendix 
A.

Page 16 of 42 The site staff will use their Laboratory Glucose Analyzer (approved by the Sponsor) for the 
laboratory assessment of blood glucose samples tested in duplicate  as part of prescribed testing  of 
the same sample . The laboratory duplicate results will be averaged . In cases where the prescribed 
test for the sample is a bilirubin analysis, the results of this test will be recorded as part of the study 
data.  
During the study, three test strip lots will be used for each BGMS. The test strip lots will be 
arbitrarily designated  as green, blue , or red to easily identify the bottles during the study. See Table 
1 for the description of test strip distribution during the study . Blood samples will be assigned to 
one of three test strip lots . The assignment will be made in a rotating order following the random 
order in which samples are  received.  For each sample, t he order of testing each of the two 
BGMSs will also be randomized.

11.2 Study Staff Training  
The site study staff will be given copies of the protocol and meter instructional material (UG). 
They will participate in a training session conducted by the Ascensia Study  team or designee.  The 
training will be documented, and t he following will be reviewed:  
11.2.1  Protocol & CRF s 
11.2.2  Meter Instructions for Use (UG)  
11.2.3  Meter control solution testing  
11.2.4  Error messages and troubleshooting  
11.2.5  GCP 
11.2.6  Practice using  the CONTOUR  NEXT  and CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs  
11.2.7  Practice preparing and reading hematocrit samples   
 
11.3 Meter Control Solution  Testing  
Control testing on the study BGMS will occur after they arrive at the site and before the trial 
starts.  
Protocol /CIP: GCA -PRO -2021 -003-01 - Amendment 1      Ascensia Diabetes Ca re 
Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 17 of 42 11.3.1  The site staff will equally distribute (approximately) the strip lots for control 
testing . 
11.3.2  The site staff will perform 3 control tests (one each of low, normal , and high) on 
each BGMS assigned for the study.   
11.3.3  Results will be recorded  and compared to  the control ranges  listed on the test 
strip bottle.  
11.3.4  If results are out of range, troubleshooting will be performed (see UG) , and the test 
will be repeated for a total of up to 3 attempts.  
11.3.5  If the meter tests are out of range after troubleshooting is complete, the meter will be 
removed from the study, and the Ascensia Study Manager will be notified.  
Additionally, this will be documented on the ‘Device Deficiency Reporting Form ’. 
11.4 Blood  Glucose  Testing  
11.4.1  No blood will be taken from study subjects solely for this study. Neonatal 
blood will be collected for prescribed testing and residual blood from the 
sample will be used for this study. Blood will be collected following HCP's 
orders by nursing/phlebotomy staff using standard heel puncture techniques. 
All samples will be transported to the laboratory per standard practice and 
submitted for prescribed clinical testing. Samples will be collected according 
to hospital standards and procedures and will be collected into a tube 
containing anticoagulants (lithium heparin).  
11.4.2  Neon atal  blood  samples  will be inspected  to verify if the  volume  drawn was 
sufficient  to complete  both prescribed clinical and investigational testing by 
laboratory personnel. Samples that do  not have sufficient volume to complete 
the required investigational testing will not be used for the clinical trial.  
11.4.3  If sufficient volume is available, this is the time of enrollment.  N o more than 
the agreed amount (50 uL) of capillary  whole blood will be removed from the 
original sample to perform blood glucose testing on two investigational 
BGMSsand a hematocrit  measurement .  
11.4.4  The collected samples will be used within a maximum of 5 h of sample 
collection  time, and will be kept at room temperature (23 ± 5 °C) before 
evaluation . 
11.4.5  Each blood sample for the study will be assigned an ID that is not traceable to 
the identity of the subject. The first digit will indicate the site ID followed by 
three digits indicating the sample ID as follows: X -001, X -002, X -003, and so 
on. 
11.4.6  Strip lot (color  code ) will be determined via a randomization schedule provided by 
the Sponsor. The testing order of the meter will also be based on a randomization 
schedule. Note that one CONTOUR  NEXT  and one CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  
BGMS per subject will be used and the meters will be disinfected after use as per 
procedures listed in Appendix A . 
Protocol /CIP: GCA -PRO -2021 -003-01 - Amendment 1      Ascensia Diabetes Ca re 
Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 18 of 42 11.4.7  For each subject, a CONTOUR  NEXT BGMS, and a CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  
BGMS will be brought to the testing area. A test strip (as assigned for the given 
BGMS) will be inserted into each of the 2 meters (same  color code strip lot for both 
meters).  
11.4.8  A drop of blood will be placed on a piece of Parafilm (or other non -absorbent 
material) and immediately tested with the first  a n d  s e c o n d  meter.  
11.4.9  The test strips in the two meters will then be replaced , to prepare the meters for 
duplicate testing .  
11.4.10  A new drop of blood will be placed on the Parafilm and immediately tested with the 
first and second meter .  
11.4.11  A hematocrit measurement (%) will also be performed . (See Section 11.6.)  
11.4.12  The blood (from the same sample as used in meter testing) will be centrifuged within 
10 minutes of BG testing  for separation into plasma .  
11.4.13  The start time of centrifugation will be recorded. Centrifugation must be performed 
within 10 minutes of the first -meter assay.  
11.4.14  The plasma will be tested in duplicate with the laboratory analyzer within 60 minutes 
of the meter test. If greater than 60 minutes of the meter test , plasma samples may 
be refrigerated.  
11.5 Errors  
11.5.1  If the meter reports an error code during blood glucose testing, the instructions 
shown in the UG should be followed.  Re -testing is recommended (per the UG).  The 
reason for the repeated test will be documented in the comments section of the form. 
No more than a  total of 3 attempts are allowed.  
11.5.2  The study staff will record all meter error codes as appropriate for the meter tests as 
it occurs.  
11.6 Hematocrit  
11.6.1  At least one hematocrit tube, but preferably t wo, will be filled with the residual 
whole blood and then centrifuged.   
11.6.2  The hematocrit will be measured from only one tube; the second tube will be 
collected as a backup in case the first tube is not measurable (i.e., tube spun out, 
broken tube, clay seal compromised, etc.).  Additional details regarding hematocrit 
measurements are found in Appendix D.

Page 19 of 42 11.7 Testing Schematic  
Table 2.  Sample Testing Schematic  
Step  Test/action  Description  
1 Sample prep  ▪ Ensure  collection of residual neonatal  sample in collection tube  containing 
anticogulant (lithium/heparin) . 
▪ Confirm sufficient blood volume to perform all testing  procedures .  
▪ If so, then aliquot up to  50 uL into microtube and cover.  
2 Testing prep Assign one CONTOUR  NEXT meter and one CONTOUR  PLUS  ELITE  
meter to the patient sample.   
▪ Follow the strip lot randomization (red, gree n, blue) and get the test strip 
bottle for the respective meter.  
▪ Get a piece of parafilm.  
▪ For steps 3 and 4, follow meter test order per randomiz ation  schedule.  
3  Meter Test  1 ▪ Put a test strip into each meter.  
▪ Immediately place 1 drop of blood on the parafilm and test with both 
meters. Record results.  
▪ In case of error, may repeat 2 more times with a new blood drop.  
▪ Record time of successful meter test s.  
4 Meter Test 2 ▪ Replace test strips , and p lace new blood drop on parafilm to repeat Step 3 
for duplicate testing.  
5 Hematocrit  ▪ Using the blood from the same collection tube, fill up to 2 hematocrit tubes.  
▪ Perform hematocrit measurement, and r ecord result s. 
6 Centrifugation  ▪ Centrifuge blood, and record start time. ( The centrifugation start time must  
be within 10 min of meter tests).  
7 Laboratory 
tests* ▪ Perform blood glucose testing of plasma sample on laboratory analyzer  
(Cobas) in duplicate .   
▪ Record results . 
* Pre -study and on-study serum control testing on Cobas: See 11.8 and Appendix C.  
11.8 Accuracy and Precision of Cobas  6000   
Performance of the Cobas  6000  will be tracked by two methods . The primary method will be  the 
instrument QC check procedure regularly applied by the clinical site. In addition, serum controls 
will be provided by Ascensia for internal research purposes only, and will not impact the study 
data or data collection . See Appendix C for further details.   
 
11.9 Bilirubin Data   
Bilirubin data will be collected to assess potential interference with elevated bilirubin levels 
occurring in neonates. In cases where the prescribed test for the sample is a bilirubin analysis, the 
results of this test will be recorded as part of the study data  from the hospital records . 
No bilirubin test will be performed on study samples just for the purpose of this study.  Thus, not 
all study samples may have bilirubin data.

11.10  Temperature and Humidity Logs  
• The study staff will measure the temperature /humidity in the meter testing area once during 
the day that meter testing occurs and record the results on the appropriate log form .  
• Study staff will maintain a temperature log for the storage of investigational materials 
including the meters, test strips, controls, and serum controls.  
12.0 Monitoring Plan  
12.1 A monitoring plan will be completed by the Study Manager/designee prior to the study . 
12.2 The study manager or designee will conduct the SIV. The frequency of the number of 
monitoring visits by sponsor  personnel or designee(s) will be based on the monitoring plan 
and will include at least 1 -3 monitoring visit s and a close -out visit.  
12.3 Sponsor  representatives may observe some study testing as part of study monitoring. This 
will be done under supervision of the Investigator . 
12.4 Sponsor  representatives will maintain subject confidentiality , and will not interfere with the 
rights of human subjects  or safety , or  bias study conduct.  
13.0 Statistical Plan  
13.1 Sample  Size 
13.1.1  The sample size requirement is based on the primary objective, section 7.0. 
13.1.2  There will be a minimum of N = 120 study samples entered into the study.  The 
meter results will be taken in duplicate, so that the total sample size of meter results 
will be at least 2*120 = 240.  
13.1.3  With a sample size of n = 240 results, there is approximately a 95% chance that at 
least  228  of those results (95% of 240) will be "accurate" (errors within either ±12 
mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L)  when the comparator result is < 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L) , 
or ±12.5% when the comparator result is ≥ 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L ) if the  
evaluation (meter)  system has a 96.77% chance of yielding an "accurate"  result.  
13.1.4  Conversely, there is about a 95% chance of obtaining fewer than 228 "accurate" 
results if the system only has an approximately 92.03% chance of yielding an 
accurate result.  
13.1.5  Note that each glucose result obtained with the evaluation devices will be considered 
either 'accurate' or 'not accurate ’, where accuracy depends on the particular test 
criterion as described in section 7.0 of this protocol.

Page 21 of 42 13.2 Blood Glucose  Measurements  
Data analysis follows analyses and presentations described in CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood Glucose 
Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved Guideline – Third Edition . CLSI 
document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2013.  
The unit conversion formula for blood glucose is the following:  
Xmmol/L = Ymg/dL / 18.016  
13.3 Bland -Altman  Plots  
Modified Bland -Altman plots (the difference between each evaluation device results and reference 
results plotted against reference results) will be constructed.  
13.4 Weighted Least Squares Regression  
Weighted least squares regressions of meter results against comparator results will be performed.  
If M represents the meter result, and C the comparator result, the linear model can be expressed as:  
𝑴= 𝜷𝟎+𝜷𝟏𝑪+𝜺 
𝜺~𝑵(𝟎,𝒄𝒗∗𝑪) 
The parameter cv is the coefficient of variation, which is assumed to be constant across the glucose 
range.  The weighting function will be:  
𝒘=𝑪−𝟐 
This weighting function is used to account for the constant cv nature of glucose measurement 
(Draper and Smith, 1998).  
13.5 Accuracy Analyses  
13.5.1  Two sets of metrics will be calculated:  
Relative (Percent) Difference (RD) for reference result  ≥ threshold glucose:  
𝑹𝑫 =𝑴−𝑪
𝑪𝟏𝟎𝟎 % 
where: M = strip/meter result and C = comparator or reference method result.  
 
Difference (D) for reference result < threshold  glucose:  
𝑫=𝑴−𝑪 
Protocol /CIP: GCA -PRO -2021 -003-01 - Amendment 1      Ascensia Diabetes Ca re 
Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 22 of 42 13.5.2  Primary objective :  
The threshold glucose value is 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L).  Accuracy will be assessed using the 
CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood Glucose Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved 
Guideline – Third Edition . CLSI document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute; 2013.  
i.e.,  D within ±12 mg/dL ( ±0.67 mmol/L)  for comparator result < 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L)   and 
RD within ±12.5%  for comparator result ≥ 100  mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) . 
For RD, the percent of results within  ±5%,  ±10%,  ±12.5%,  ±15% and  ±20% will be computed.  
For D, the percent less than or equal to ±5 mg/dL  (±0.28mmol /L), ±10 mg/dL  (±0.56 mmol /L), 
±12.0 mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L) , ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 mmol/L) , and ±20 mg/dL  (±1.11 mmol/L)  will 
be computed.  
The RD and D distribution tables will be constructed using a threshold of 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) .  
As discussed in section 13.1 (Sample Size),  with n =240, the critical number (minimum) of 
accurate results is 228, which yields approximately 95% chance of satisfying the criterion if the 
actual probability that any result will be accurate is at least  96.77%. Symbolically, this criterion 
is equivalent  to tes ting the  hypothesis:  
 
H0 : Prob{accurate}< 96.77% versus  the alternative:  
H1  :  Prob{accurate } ≥   96.77%  
This test has a power of about 95%, with n =240, to reject H 0 if the actual probability of obtaining 
an accurate result is 96.77%. Conversely, there is about a 95% chance that the null will NOT be 
rejected if the actual probability that a result with the evaluation device would satisfy this definition 
of accuracy is only about   92.03%.  
13.5.3  The s econd part of the primary objective   
The second part of the primary objective states that at least 98% of the n = 240 results must fall 
within ±15 mg/dL (±0.83 mmol/L)  of the comparator result (comparator < 75 mg/dL /4.16 mmol/L )) 
or ±20% of the comparator result (comparator ≥ 75 mg/dL /4.16 mmol/L ).  Thus, with n = 240, 
there must be at least 236 BGMS results satisfying this requirement.  This is equivalent to testing 
the hypotheses:  
H0: Prob{accurate}< 98.33% versus  the alternative:  
H1:        Prob{accurate } ≥   98.33%  
There is approximately a 95% chance of rejecting H0 in favor of H1 if the actual probability that a 
meter measurement would satisfy the ±15mg/dL or 20% is 98.33%.  Conversely, there is about a 
95% chance that the null will NOT be rejected if the actual probability that a result with the 
evaluation device would satisfy this definition of accuracy is only about   96.23%.   It is possible

Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 23 of 42 that the sample size after the study is completed may not be exactly 240.  The critical values will 
be approximately 95% or 98% of results (first and second parts of primary objective, respectively), 
and the associated hypotheses will be adjusted to reflec t the change while maintaining no more 
than a 95% chance of rejecting the null hypotheses.  
13.6 Neonates < 24 hrs. old and Neonates in NICU  – Other Objectives  
In addition to the neonates less than 28 days of age, additional analyses of data from neonatal 
subjects ≤ 24 hrs. old  and neonates in NICU will be performed.  
13.6.1  Specifically, differences in BG results between BGMS and reference laboratory 
instrument will be plotted against the laboratory instrument results (modified Bland -
Altman plot).  
13.6.2  There must be at least 5 subjects <24 hrs. old and 5 subjects in NICU enrolled to 
perform this analysis. These groups may have any or all subjects in common.  
13.7 Hematocrit Analysis – Other Objectives  
13.7.1  Hematocrit will be measured for each subject. Mean, median, minimum, 
maximum, and standard deviation, will be computed for hematocrit 
determinations.  
13.7.2  The effect of hematocrit on meter results will be presented via regression of 
differences between the meter and laboratory BG measurements against 
hematocrit.  
13.8 Bilirubin Analysis – Other Objectives   
For neonates who would have bilirubin results, regression analysis will be used to assess the effects 
of bilirubin on the difference between meter and laboratory reference method blood glucose 
measurements.  
There must be at least 3 subjects enrolled with bilirubin recorded to perform this analysis.  If fewer 
than 3, then the results will be reported in a table.  
13.9 Temperature and Humidity  
Mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum room temperature, and humidity will 
be computed.  
13.10  Data Evaluability  
Blood glucose data will be considered not evaluable for the following reasons:  
• Samples with no associated or valid hematocrit value.  
• Samples with no associated or valid Cobas 6000  value.  
Protocol /CIP: GCA -PRO -2021 -003-01 - Amendment 1      Ascensia Diabetes Ca re 
Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 24 of 42 • Failure to begin to separate the plasma from the red cells within 10 minutes of 
obtaining the first meter test.  
• The collected samples exceed a maximum of 5 h of sample withdrawal time, and 
will be kept at room temperature  (23 ± 5 °C) before evaluation.  
• For a given sample, the meter is missing a replicate.  
• Results of the g lucose analyzer blood sample  are not within ±4% of each other, 
100* (Rep2 -Rep1)/Rep1, or ±4mg/dL  (0.22mmol/L)  of each other (Rep2 -Rep1) 
if the average falls below 100mg/dL  (5.5mmol/L) . 
14.0 Data Management  
14.1 A unique number will identify each subject/sample. The unique number will be entered on 
the CRFs. The site will create a procedure to de -identify subjects from samples so that the 
staff members documenting subject names will not have access to sample resul ts and the 
staff members testing the samples will not have access to subject names. A master list of 
subject names,  with their subject  IDs, will be kept by the Investigator at the study site until 
the study has been closed.  
14.2 Study personnel will complete and sign all appropriate forms in compliance with GCP. 
CRFs should be completed legibly, in black or blue ink. If it is necessary to make 
corrections, a single line should be drawn through the original entry, the new entry is written 
in, and the correction initialed and dated by the individual correcting the CRF.  
14.3 Study  data will be primarily collected through an electronic data capture ( EDC ) system 
used by Ascensia. The d ata will be recorded on forms by designated study  staff that will 
serve as source documents and entered into the  EDC system. All source forms will be 
retained by the site.  
14.4 In addition to data collection, the EDC system will be used for data cleaning as well as 
monitoring operations. Site users will be trained on this system before the start of the study 
and their access to EDC system will be contingent upon successful comple tion of training 
requirements.    
15.0 Amendments to the Protocol  
15.1 Any change to this protocol requires a protocol amendment (or revision) unless the IRB 
agrees to an administrative change (for minor changes).

15.4.1  Substantial amendments to the conduct of the clinical trial may arise from changes 
to the protocol or from new information relating to the scientific documents in 
support of the trial. Substantial changes require notification to the overseeing IRB 
before implementation. For any questions on whether a change would be considered 
substantial, consult with the respective IRB.  
15.4.2  Amendments to the trial are regarded as “substantial” where they are likely to have 
a significant impact on the:  
• Safety, health or rights or physical or mental integrity of the subjects , 
• Scientific value of the trial including robustness or reliability of the data 
generated by the study , 
• Conduct or management of the trial , 
• Quality or safety of any investigational product used in the tria l. 
15.4.3  An amendment is only to be regarded as “substantial” when one or more of the above 
criteria are met but the IRB  may have additional requirements that shall be 
considered.  
15.4.4  Examples of substantial amendments may include (but are not limited to):  
• New tests  
• Increase in the number of visits due to safety issues associated with the 
ongoing trial  
• Change of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Change in the number of participants  
• Updated PI

Page 29 of 42 20.1 Since the subject is a neonate, the subject ’s parent/guardian - Legally Authorized 
Representative (LAR)  - will complete the informed consent process before performing any 
study procedures.  
20.2 The LAR  will be informed about the study objectives, investigational devices, study 
procedures, expected study duration, and risks of study participation.  
20.3 Study participation is voluntary. The information will be given in written form (ICF) as 
well as verbally by the investigator.  
20.4 The s ubject ’s LAR will sign and date the ICF.  The ICF will then be dated and signed by 
the investigator.  
20.5 The investigator will retain the original of the documents.  The subject ’s LAR will receive 
a copy of the ICF and if applicable, insurance terms and conditions.  
21.0 Adverse events  and adverse device effects  
The procedures to be performed under this protocol are considered to be of low risk since the 
glucose testing procedures will use residual samples which are remnants of neonatal  blood 
collected as part of routine prescribed practice.  
Due to the nature of this study, no adverse events (AE) are expected as per the following:  
21.1 This study only includes residual ( ‘left-over’) samples of blood collected by standard, 
approved technique for prescribed tests.  
21.2 No neonate will be exposed to any of the BGMS at any point; all study activities will be 
conducted in the institution’s lab.  
21.3 The samples will be de -identified in order to protect the confidentiality of the subjects. 
Confidentiality issues are mitigated due to the fact that the nursing staff overseeing the 
babies will not be informed of any study results , and samples will be de -identified prior to 
being given to the laboratory staff who perform study testing    
21.4 Regardless  of the above, any experience that the investigator considers to be an A E will be 
documented and reported immediately to Ascensia .

 Appendix B  - Instructions for Processing of Blood for the glucose analyzer  
 
Processing of Neonatal  Blood for laboratory glucose  analysis  
Once collected, process the microtainer tube for laboratory glucose analysis as follows:   
• Label all tubes with the subject number using a Sharpie®-like marker.   
• Gently invert the microtainer tube several times to mix the anticoagulant.  
• Centrifuge the whole blood immediately to separate the plasma from the red blood cells.  The 
centrifugation start time must occur within 1 0 minutes of the first meter blood test.  The timing 
of all meter testing/centrifugation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
• It is recommended that after centrifugation, the plasma is transferred from the microtainer tube 
to a small clean tube or container with a cap.   Ensure the tube is labeled and the cap is secured , 
and proceed  with the site’s laboratory glucose analyzer procedures .  
• The plasma will be tested in duplicate with the laboratory analyzer within 60 minutes of 
the meter test. If greater than 60 minutes of the meter test, plasma samples may be 
refrigerated .  
• Insufficient (or suspected to be insufficient) samples, missing samples, and other sample issues 
should be recorded in the CRF and on the glucose analyzer  printout , as appropriate.  If a sample 
is hemolyzed, record it in the CRF.

 Appendix C - Instructions for Tracking Accuracy and Precision of the 
Laboratory Glucose Analyzer  
Procedure for Tracking Accuracy and Precision of Site Laboratory Analyzer  
Performance of the Cobas 6000  will be assessed to ensure accuracy.  Analyzer performance will 
be tracked by two methods: the Laboratory Analyzer QC procedure regularly applied by the 
clinical site , and the testing of serum controls provided by Ascensia . 
The following are the procedures required for each method:  
I. Laboratory Analyzer QC Procedure  
The Cobas 6000  will be maintained and operated according to the instructions in the 
manufacturer’s operating manual by the site’s lab specifications/SOP previously reviewed by ADC. 
Before the study begins, the analyzer will be set up and the appropriate maintenance will be 
performed.  
The site will perform glucose analyzer control tests in accordance with the site ’s quality control 
check  procedures and requirements.  Site staff will keep a log for the analyzer, including daily 
operational checks and maintenance.  
II. Ascensia Serum Controls1 
A set of three  serum control levels will be provided to the investigator to document the 
performance of the Cobas 6000  at each BG level.  These ser um controls have been assayed by a 
method traceable to one proposed for use as a national glucose reference method.  
Serum Control Testing Schedule:  
• Pre-study: The controls will be assayed (singlet readings) on the  Laboratory Analyzer for 
at least three runs prior to the assay of subject samples. The runs will occur over at least 
three days, if possible.  The data will be sent to the Ascensia Study Ma nager, or designee, 
for review before the study begins.  
• Once the study begins, serum control testing should be completed on each Analyzer on the 
Monday and Friday of the first week , and then on one day for each week that the study 
continues.   
• Record all data on the CRF.  One reading will be recorded for each control level (for a total 
of 3 readings per run).   
 
 
1 Caution: The serum glucose traceability controls are human serum -based and must be handled using universal 
precautions.

Proper Handling of Ascensia Serum Controls  
Ascensia  completed the characterization of serum controls purchased from Bio -Techne® (formerly 
Bionostics). During the characterization, staff observed that sample stratification during thawing 
can occur if the control vials are not handled judiciously. The recommended procedure is as 
follows.  
• Store the frozen controls in a -20C freezer upon arrival.  
• Thaw the frozen control amber glass vials at 2 -8ºC for 2 -3 days in the refrigerator.  Each 
vial holds approximately 2.0 mL.  
• Before opening, mix the vials well by gently inverting them at least 10 times.  
• Prepare an aliquot of each level in capped microcentrifuge tubes.  Cap tightly.  We prefer 
Fisherbrand™ Microcentrifuge 0.5mL tubes (PN 02 -681-333) with O -ring seal caps (PN 
02-681-358).  
• Store any remaining control in the amber glass vials at 2 -8ºC. 
• Before running a control sample on the laboratory analyzer, mix the aliquot tubes by gently 
inverting them.  
• At the beginning of each day, remix the amber glass vials and refill the aliquot tubes.  When 
not in use, store the aliquots at 2 -8ºC. 
• The thawed control use life is two weeks.  Discard all thawed control —aliquot tubes and 
amber glass vials —after two weeks.  
• Since slow thawing for 2 -3 days is recommended, it is advisable to keep an extra thawed 
set available for testing.

 Appendix D - Instructions for Hematocrit Sample Preparation and Testing  
 
Staff will follow the instruction s in the hematocrit reader user manual.   
1. At least one microhematocrit tube , but preferably two,  will be filled with  residual capillary 
blood from each subject sample.  One tube will be measured , and the result recorded on the 
form.  The second tube is a backup and will be measured only if the first tube was not adequate 
for measurement , or is broken.     
• Ensure the tube setting on the Hemata Stat II ™ is set to 0.5 mm ID (inner diameter ). 
• Samples collected from residual capillary blood (heel -stick) will be collected in treated 
micro -hematocrit tubes.     
2. Place a microhematocrit tube against the surface of the blood drop.  
3. Fill the microhematocrit tube about halfway.  Do not over -fill.  Then immediately place one of 
the microhematocrit tube openings in the clay sealant.  Press into the clay 2 -3 times to make 
sure enough sealant is transferred.  
4. Place the sealed microhematocrit tube into the Hematastat II ™ micro -centrifuge.  Note: it is 
very important to place the microhematocrit tube in centrifuge rotor with clay side down .  
Balance the rotor with another hematocrit tube containing  water.  
5. Click run to s pin for the preset 60 seconds.   
6. Measure hematocrit using the Hematastat reader or other hematocrit reader approved by the 
sponsor.  
7. Summary of Instructions for the Hematastat reader : 
• After collection and centrifugation of hematocrit, place tube in the reader  slot, with clay 
side to the left.  Press enter to read.  
• Slide the marker on the reader to the exact line where the clay and red blood cells meet.  
Press enter to “enter  interface : sealant/RBCs.”    
• Then move the marker to the exact line where the red blood cells meet the plasma . Press 
enter to “enter interface: RBCs/plasma.”   
• Slide the marker to the exact line where the plasma  ends. Press enter to “enter interface: 
plasma/air.”  
• The result in the display is the hematocrit percentage for that sample.  
8. Record hematocrit result on the appropriate form.

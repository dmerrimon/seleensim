 Study Duration of Treatment : 
Approxim ately 3 months  
Criteria for Evaluation : 
The primary endpoints are as follows:  
• Effectiveness : 
o Overall comfort averaged over all scheduled follow -up visits  
o Vision averaged over all scheduled follow -up visits  
o The pr oportion of eyes with a maximum degree of  front surface deposits grade of < 2 over all 
scheduled follow -up visits   
• Safety : 
o The
 proportion of eyes with any slit -lamp findings greater than Grade 2 over all follow -up visits  
Statistical Methods:  
• Continuous variables will be summarized using the sample size, mean, standard deviations, median, 
minimum , and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and 
percentages.  
• Each primary endpoint will be evaluated statistically using a one -sided non- inferiority test with a 
one-sided alp ha risk of 0.025. For overall comfort and dryness, each non- inferiority hypothesis will 
be tested using an analysis of variance model including the fixed factor s of treatment , site, and lens 
group with a non -inferiority margin of -5 points. For front surfa ce deposits, the non- inferiority 
hypothesis will be tested using a one -sided Newcombe- Wilson 97.5% lower confidence limit with a 
non-inferiority mar gin of -10%.  For slit- lamp findings, the non- inferiority hypothesis will be  tested 
using a one -sided New comb e-Wilson 97.5% upper confidence limit with a non- inferiority margin of 
5%. 
Sample Size Calculations : 
Approximately 30 Test group subjects will be completed for each lens group in the table of lens types 
above. For each lens type, the probability of observing at least one subject- level event will be 0.95 when 
the probability of an event is 0.1. When the sample size is 150  subjects in each treatment group, the 
overall power of the trial will be 95%. To allow for losses of up to 10%, approximately 34 0 subject s 
(680 eyes) will be enrolled.

 requirements and clinical investigation procedures; requiring a F inancial Disclosure by 
Investigators; using standardized training materials for all trial personnel; and by 
scheduling regular monitoring visits will be conducted to verify a dherence to the CIP and 
source data.  
This clinical investigation is double -masked.  The Investigator and site staff, with the 
exception of an unmasked designee, will be masked (blinded) to the subject’s treatment group. An unmasked designee will be assigned at each site and will be responsible for all 
study materials accountability, including dispensation to and collection of study supplies 
from  subjects. Subjects are to be instructed not to discuss or show the dispensed study 
materials to the Investigator  or masked site staff during the study. The Investigator and all 
other study personnel will remain masked until database lock. The subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either the T est or Control solution using a Randomization and 
Trial Supply Management (RTSM) system.  
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double- masked, parallel -group, bilateral clinical trial.  
3.1 Description of Study Design  
The study is designed to examine whether BL -3100- NBR03  multi- purpose solution 
cleaning and disinfect ing solution is non- inferior to renu® Advanced Formula multi -
purpose solution in sev eral primary endpoints. 
Approximately 340 subjects ( 680 eyes)  will be enrolled in this three-month multicenter, 
randomized, double- masked, parallel -group, bilateral  study at approximately 22 
investigative sites in the United States (US) . Approximately one- half (50%) of the eligible 
subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch +  Lomb  investigational BL-3100- NBR03  
multi- purpose solution (Test), and approximat ely one-half (50%) of the eligible subjects 
will be randomized to receive renu® Advanced Formula mult i-purpose solution (Control). 
In addition, all subjects will be dispensed three new  pairs (including two back- up pairs)  of 
their habitual lenses at the beginning of the study for daily wear , and scheduled replacement 
lenses  at the 1 -Month and 2-Month Follow-up Visits. 
All subjects will be seen for a Screening/Dispensing Visit, at which the informed consent  
form (ICF),  including the  Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) , will 
be obtained and eligibility will be assessed . If eligible, subjec ts will be dispensed three new  
pairs of their habitual lenses and a Study Kit containing a cleaning and disinfecting solution 
according to the subject’s  random ly assigned treatment .  Subjects may  also be dispensed a 
supply of Bausch + Lomb renu® Contact Lens Moisture Drops  to be used on an as needed 
basis . Subjects must NOT us e ANY other cleaning and disinfecting solution or rewetting 
drops during the study.   
Subjects are to wear their study lenses on a daily wear bas is and  are to use the Test or 
Control m ulti-purpose solution and care regimen after removing the lenses each day. 
Subjects will return their worn lenses  to the unmasked designee  at each monthly follow-up 
visit and  will return their used and unused study solutions to the unmasked designee at the  
three- month follow -up visit ( or early study termination/suspension visit) for return to the 
Sponsor.   Eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of five  lens groups based on their habitual contact 
lenses. Subjects  will be randomized to receive  either th e Test or Control multi-purpose

3.2 Informed Consent Process  
Voluntary written informed consent must be obtained from every subject prior to the 
initiation of any study related activities. The Investigator must have a defined process for 
obtaining consent. Subjects must be given ample time to read, understand, and a sk 
questions, in order to consider voluntary participation. The subject must indicate voluntary consent by providing a written signed and dated ICF. A copy of the signed and dated ICF must be provided to the subject, and the original document must be filed in the subject’s 
study records. 
The ICF must meet all applicable local laws and be written in language that the subject 
understands. Subjects must be informed that their participation in the study is voluntary and that their decision to withdraw from participation at any time during the study will not impact any aspect of their standard care. Subjects will be provided with contact information 
for the appropriate individuals should questions or concerns arise after signing the ICF during the clinical study.  
Subjects must also be informed that their records may be accessed by appropriate 
authorities and Sponsor -designated personnel. The Investigator must ensure all procedures 
and practices are in place to protect the privacy and the best interest of the subj ect. 
3.3 Selection of Study Population  
Recruitment for the  study may start at any point after the Investigator agrees, in writing, to 
participate in the study. Written ICF, including HIPAA, enrollment in the study, or  
dispensing of study products cannot begin until the Investigator has received Institutional 
Revi ew Board (IRB ) and Sponsor  approval to conduct the study. The Sponsor and IRB 
must approve any advertising used to recruit subjects prior to use of that advertising. 
All consented subjects must be accounted for, whether or not they participate in the study. 
The Sponsor will record  information for each potential study subject who signs an ICF . 
Once a potential subject is consented , the ir information will be recor ded in the 
Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM ) system and the Investigator should 
proceed with screening procedures. 
Potential subjects will be  classified  as eligible or “Screen Fail ures.” A subject deemed  a 
Screen Fail ure cannot participate in the study since he/she has not met the study inclusion 
criteria or has met the exclusion criter ia. Electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) must not be 
completed for subjects  who are Screen Failures ; however, the copy of their signed ICF and 
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 20 of 80 
Confidential  
 any information collected as part of screening (e.g., source documents, etc .) must be kept 
in their m edical recor ds. 
Once a subject  is randomized  to a treatment group, the individual is considered active and 
must be accounted for at every visit until exited (completed or discontinued) from the 
study, even if they are not dispensed study materials. Refer to Section 3.3.4 for subjects  
determined to be lost to follow-up.

If a subject meets all the inclusion criteria and does not meet  any of the exclusion criteria, 
the subject is eligible for entry into the study. Ineligible subjects MUST NOT be enrolled 
in this study. Any subject enrolled in the study who later is found to have not met the 
eligibility criteria at entry will be discontinued.  
3.3.2 Subject Completion  
A subject has completed the study when the individual has completed the Exit Visit 
procedures at the 3- Month Follow -up Visit .  Subjects who require further follow -up f or an  
adverse event ( AE) will be  followed according to Sections 3.3.3. and 7.0.  
3.3.3 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject MAY be discontinued (at the discretion of the Investigator, the Sponsor, and/or the IRB ) prior to the final study visit for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:  
• An AE occurring during the course of the study, which precludes continued treatment or follow-up 
• Persistent grade 3 or 4 slit-lamp findings 
• Persistent study related symptoms/complaints  
• Unacceptable distance lens visual acuity ( VA) 
• Unacceptable lens centration  
• Unacceptable lens movement  
• Failure to follow study procedures 
A subject MUST be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal  
• Death  
• Investigator decision that it is not in the best medical interest of the subject to continue participation in the investigation 
• Lost to follow-up (refer to Section 3.3.4) 
• Either  eye is discontinued 
• Becomes pregnant during the study 
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, schedule a final study visit, obtain as much follow -up data as possible, and to retrieve all 
study material s. Adverse events will be followed as described in Section 7.0.  
Subject discontinuations  must be documented clearly on the source document and 
applicable eCRF. The Investigator should indicate the PRIMARY (one) reason that the 
subject was discontinued for each eye. Subjects who voluntarily withdraw from the study are not required to provide a reason for their decision but should be encouraged to share 
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 23 of 80 
Confidential  
 this information. Subjects that are discontinued from the study foll owing randomization 
will not be replaced.  
Exit Visit assessments should be completed for early discontinued subjects , if possible. 
At the final study visit, all study subjects who are discontinuing should be examined to 
ensure that their ocular health is consistent with pre -study, baseline conditions. Any 
adverse effects determined to have been reasonably caused by participation in the  study 
will be followed per the standard of care. Particip ation in the study will not impact post-
study choices of study subjects for correcting their vision using marketed products (e.g., 
contact lenses and contact lens care solutions). 
Whether a subject completes or is discontinued from the study, they will be directed by the 
Investigator to resume their habitual lens care regimen.   
3.3.4 Lost to Follow- up 
Subjects who did not return for scheduled follow-up visits, as defined by the visit window , 
and could not  be contacted  via two telephone calls and one letter with delivery 
confirmation , are to be considered lost to follow -up. All  attempts to contact the subject 
should be documented and kept with the subject’s source documentation, and the 
applicable e CRFs will be completed.  If the Investigator determines that a subject has been 
lost to follow -up, t he “study exit  date” should be recorded as the last successful contact or 
the date a certified letter  was sent . Just prior to database loc k, the database will be reviewed 
for all lost to follow -up entries to confirm, once again, that contact with the subject was 
never made.  A study participant may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
3.4 Investigators 
The study will be conducted at approximately 22 investigative sites located in the US  by 
Investigators who are determined by Bausch + Lomb to be suitably qualified by training and experience to conduct this study. This will include appropriate current state licensing 
and study- specifi c training. Principal Investigators will sign the Device I nvestigator 
Agreement form prior to the start of the study. Investigators will be compensated for their 
services with appropriate standard professional rates. Compensation will not be dependent 
on the study outcomes.  
Each Investigator should enroll approximately 15 subjects , 30 eyes.  In the event that 
selected sites do not meet full enrollment, the Sponsor may decide to increase enrollment 
as needed at other currently active sites and/or additional site(s) may be added to satisfy the enrollment requirements of the study.  
3.5 Finances  
The study will be  financed through Bausch & Lomb C orporate Research  & Development.

Bausch & Lomb Incorporated 
Clinical Trial Materials Supply Chain 
 
1400 North Goodman Street Rochest er, NY 14609 
The study will use a randomization t rial supply m anagement (RTSM) system. All clinical 
supply kit orders, shipments, receipts, and subject dispensation will be tracked in the RTSM system. The clinical supply label includes a unique kit number and a labeling and packaging batch number for material lot number traceability. 
4.6 Masking/Unmasking  
Study solutions will be provided in sealed opaque white boxes with Study Kit numbers 
preprinted on them.  
 
This is a double -masked study. The Investigator and Sponsor  or their representatives  
involved in the conduct of the study will be masked to the study cleaning and disinfecting 
solutions. These procedures are intended to reduce or eliminate bias that might  impact 
study outcomes and their interpretation. 
The randomization schedule will be created by an unmasked statistician not otherwise 
involved in the study and uploaded into the  RTSM  system . Personnel involved with any 
repackaging / relabeling  of clinical trial material will also be unmasked.  A C linical Mo nitor 
will become unmasked during product reconciliation, at the conclusion of each site’s 
participation in the study and prior to locking the database.  Unmasked designees at the site will manage dispens ing and return of study solutions, study contact lenses  and related 
supplies.  
Study solutions will be provided in sealed opaque white boxes with Study Kit numbers 
preprinted on them. Subjects are not to show or discuss the study the study solution 
appearance with the Investigator or site staff unless instr ucted to do so.  Subjects m ay 
discuss any questions they have with the unmasked designee at the site. 
 In the event that unmasking of a subject’s randomly assigned treatment is required, the 
Investigator (or other designee) is required to contact the Medical Monitor to request permi ssion to unmask.  The Medical Monitor will contact the Sponsor designee and obtain 
approval to grant permission to unmask.  Upon receipt of authorization from the Sponsor designee, the Medical Monitor will advise the Investigator (or other qualified  designee) to 
log into the RTSM system  and unmask the subject.  If the Medical Monitor cannot be 
contacted, the Investigator (or other qualified designee) should then contact the Sponsor designee who can authorize the unmasking of a subject.  In the event that th e Medical 
Monitor or Sponsor designee cannot be contacted , and the Investigator (or other qualified 
designee) deems the unmasking emergent , the Investigator  may log into the RTSM  system 
without authorization and unmask the subjec t. Whether unmasking occurs  inadvertently or 
intentionally, the Inves tigator must notify the Medical Monitor or Sponsor designee  as soon 
as possible after unmasking. In addition, the Investigator must record the date, time, and reason for unmasking the study treatment in the source documentation.

 4.7 Product Replacement  
Any additional/replacement (in the case of loss or damage) Test or C ontrol study solutions 
must be ordered through the RTSM  system . 
5.0 SAFETY AND EFF ECTIVENESS  VARIABLES  
Key s afety variables and the primary effectiveness variables are presented below . A full 
list and description of all safety and efficacy variables  and study procedures are provided 
in Appendix A (Schedule of Visits and Parameters) and Appendix B (Methods of Clinical 
Evaluation). A s ummary of the planned statistical analys es is presented in Section 8. 0. 
Product risks are also described in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.1 Key Safety Variables 
The safety of the Test and Control solutions will be determined by the following parameters:  
• The primary saf ety endpoint will be the proportion of eyes with any slit-lamp findings 
greater than grade 2  over all follow-up visits. 
• Adverse Events  will also be evaluated. Information  regarding any subject - or 
Investigator- reported AEs will be obtained at each follow -up visit. The rate of adverse 
events is not a primary endpoint and is not associated with a predefined success criterion.  
5.2 Primary Effectiveness  Variables  
The effectiveness  of the Test and Control solutions will be determined by the following 
parameters: 
• Overall comfort averaged over all scheduled follow-up visits 
• Vision  averaged over all scheduled follow-up visits 
• The proportion of eyes with a maximum degree of front surface deposits grade of < 2 
over all scheduled follow-up visits. 
5.3 Risk Assessmen t an d Mitigation 
Laboratory, pre- clinical studie s and a preliminary clinical study  have evaluated BL3100-
NBR03 m ulti-purp ose disinfection solution and/or its components . The results support the 
safety  of the formulation for the further evaluation for the proposed use.  
The clinical procedures  required in Protocol 914 are routinely performed and are standard 
of care for contact lens wearers. The subjects will be informed of any potential study specific risks in the ICF or if new risks become apparent during the study. Upon review of the clinical and preclinical data no additional risk s were identified over the standard contact 
lens and care solution use. Risk mitigation includes period ic assessments of ocular health 
by vision care specialists throughout the s tudy, oversight by the study S ponsor, its 
representatives and the Medical Monit or, and well -defined procedures for the management 
of adverse events, should they occur.     
Anticipated serious adverse device effects are presented in Section  7.1.4.1. Additio nal 
descriptions of the risk s and benefits  to subject  safety associated with we aring contact

should an AE be present at an Unscheduled visit . Visits intended to fulfill scheduled vis it 
requirements that fall outside the designated scheduled visit range are not Unscheduled Visits. In these cases, the visit data will b e collected and transcribed to the appropriate 
scheduled visit e CRF s.  
If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a  given visit timeframe, the data from the visit 
that is intended to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit should be captured on the visit e CRF. Where such a determination cannot be made, the first visit within the 
scheduled visit interval will be used for completion of the protocol required scheduled visit eCRF. Data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit inte rval will be captured on 
an Unscheduled Visit e CRF.

6.2 Study Completion / Early Study Terminations / Suspensions  
6.2.1 Study Completion  
For purposes of the Investigator notifying the IRB, the study is complete when all 
subjects at the si tes have b een exited.  Sponsor approval is required prior to IRB 
notification.  
6.2.2 Early Study Termination/Suspension  
If during the study it becomes evident to the Sponsor that the study should be stopped 
prematurely or placed on hold, appropriate notification will be given to the Investigator(s) , 
IRBs, and FDA,  as applicable. Bausch + Lomb will instruct the Investigators to stop/restart

 6.4 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed using lens wear parameter data.  
6.5 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the Sponsor and the IRB and agreed to by the 
Investigator .  It is a Sponsor expectation that Investigators will follow the protocol and 
procedures as written.  Th e Sponsor will not grant  protocol waivers for this study .  The 
Investigator may implement a deviation from the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to study subjects without prior IRB/EC approval.  As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation, as well as the reasons for it should be submitted to the IRB/EC for review and approval.  It should also be submitted to the Sponsor for 
agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.   
In the event a protocol deviation occu rs, the date of and reason for deviations must be 
documented in all cases.  Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the rights or 
safety of the subject or the integrity of the study must be reported by the Investigator to the IRB/EC and Medical Monitor immediately.  Reporting of all other protocol deviations must 
adher e to the requirements of the governing IRB/EC. Unless the protocol deviations put 
the subject at  risk or the subject’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the 
study, s ubjects  may continue to participate until the end of the study. 
 Site Corre ctive Action P lans will be developed and completed as deemed necessary by the  
Sponsor, Sponsor Designee (e.g., Contract Research Organization, CRO ) for sites or 
Investigator s who de viate from this protocol in a way that adversely affects  the rights, 
safety or well -being of the subject(s) and/or the quality or integrity of data. The  Site 
Corrective Action Plan will outline the deviation and the site’s corrective and/or  remedial 
action s. Decisions regarding critical deviations that merit Investigator di squalification and 
site closure will be made by the Sponsor and documented in the Trial Master File.  
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Introduction to Adverse Event Definitions  
AEs, Serious AEs  (SAEs), Significant Non-Serious AEs, Non -Significant Non-Serious 
Adverse Events , Adverse Device Effects  and Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect s 
are defined in this section and in the Protocol’s Glossary.  
An AE is any  untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device , comparator, or the procedures 
involved. For users or other persons, this  definition is restricted to events not related to 
investigational me dical devices.  
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition s 
An AE that  (related or not related to the investigational test articles , comparator products  
or study procedures): 
o Led to death  
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 40 of 80 
Confidential  
 o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
‒ A life -threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness); or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization; or 
‒ Medical or surg ical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: A planned hospitalization for a pre -existi ng condition, or a procedure 
required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events may include  but are not limited to  any hazardous, sight- threatening 
conditions occurring after exposure to the investigational test article  or control product  
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes: 
o Central or para- central locati on 
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane 
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter  
o Associated with iritis  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure  
o Culture positive for microorganisms 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits 
NOTE: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal 
infiltrates, active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior 
corneal to mid- stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival 
and lid edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or 
mucopurulent discharge, tearing, and photophobia.
 
• Any central or par acentral (within the central 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that 
results in permanent opacification ( such as corneal scar or  vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea  
• Permanent l oss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA  
• All cases of iritis.  
7.1.2 Significant Non- Serious Adverse Event  Definition s 
A significant non- serious adverse event is an AE that does not meet the serious criteria, is 
considered significant by the Sponsor, and requires expedited repor ting to the S ponsor (see 
Section 7.2.1.) . These events include but are not limited to:

• A temporary loss of two or more lines of BSCVA (for greater than or equal to 2 
weeks)  
• Neovascularization cases Grade 2 or greater  (if not within 6 mm of the cornea) 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of greater than 
or equal to 2 weeks.  
7.1.3 Non-Significant Non- Serious Adverse Events Definition s 
A non- significant non- serious adverse event may include but are not limited to the 
following and does not require expedited reporting: 
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis;  
• Viral Conjunctivi tis; 
• Allergic Conjunctivitis;  
• Corneal Edema;  
• Contact Lens Related Papillary Conjunctivitis; and  
• Loss of Contrast Sensitivity . 
7.1.4 Adverse Device E ffect (ADE) Definition s 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an  AE that is  assessed to be related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition also  includes any e vent 
resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
7.1.4.1 Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  (ASADE)  Definition  
An a nticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an ADE that first meets the 
serious criteri a (see Section 7.1.1) and which , by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome, 
has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. A SADEs include  but 
are not limited to :  
 
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis  
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by removing the lens 
7.1.4.2 Unanticipat ed Serious Adverse Device E ffect (U SADE)  Definitions  
An unanticipated serious ocular or non -ocular adverse device effect (USADE) is an adverse 
event related to the use of  an investigational medical device that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event as described in section  7.1.1 and 
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 42 of 80 
Confidential  
 which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current 
version of the risk analysis report.  
This definition includes but is not limited to AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.  
This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.  USADEs include but are not limited to : 
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in perm anent opacification (s uch as corneal scar or  vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea 
• Permanent loss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA  
• All cases of iritis.  
7.1.5 Rela tionship Definition: Study Device and/or Other Study Materials  
• Related: There is at least a reason able possibility that the AE  is related to the 
study device  (study solution) and/or r ewetting drops . Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or association between the study device and/or r ewetting drops and the AE.   
• Not related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE  is related 
to the study device  (study solution)  and/or r ewetting drops. This ass essment 
implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to the study device and/or r ewetting drops and a more likely or 
certain alternative etiology exists.  
7.1.6 Severity  Definitions  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or  symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may int erfere with daily activities bu t can 
be relieved by simple therapeutic care.  
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
7.2 Procedures for Evaluati ng Adverse Events  
Throughout the course of this study all efforts will be made to remain alert to reportable AEs. If an AE occurs the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  All SAEs, ocular and systemic, must be recorded and 
reporte d as required. 
All reportable A Es occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes . This may imply that follow- up will continue after the 
subject has left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by the Sponsor. 
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 43 of 80 
Confidential  
 Ocular AEs of possible clinical significance should be photo-documented and shared with 
the Medical Monitor in electronic form.  
When evaluating for reportable AEs, the Investigator should refer to the definitions for 
AEs to determine : 
a) whether the event is serious (refer to  Section 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.)  
b) whether the event is severe (refer to Section 7. 1.6.) 
c) whether the event is s ignificant (refer to Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3.) 
d) whether the event is related to the study device (refer to Section 7.1.5.) 
7.2.1 Procedures for Reporting Serious or Significant Adverse Events  
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non -Serious Ocular AE requi res expeditious 
handling and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows:  
• The event m ust be reported to the Medical Monitor  
(  within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness of the event via facsimile/email transmission  on a paper  SAE or 
Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form signed by the Investigator. 
• The Medical Monitor will email a copy of the form (within 24 hours) to  all 
p
arties listed below: 
o   
  
  
     
  
Inve
stigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document 
the even
t before initially notifying the Medical Monitor of an SAE  or a Significant 
Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant information such as hospital records and 
autopsy reports should be provided to the Medical Monitor  as soon as they are 
available.  
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the 
subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE  or Significant 
Non-Serious AE  until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized . 
This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, 
and that additional evaluations may be requested by the Sponsor. 
• Ensure that the subject ’s identity is protected and the subject ’s identifier s in the 
clinical trial are properly mentioned on the form.  
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY 
LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL.  
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non- Serious AE Report  Form , 
if applicable, each time the subject  is seen during the management of the event 
and at resolution of the event.  All updated report forms should be submitted by 
the site to the Medical Monitor  within 24 hours.  The Medical Monitor should 
distribute the updated reports to appropriate S ponsor personnel. Whenever 

Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:19 JAN  2023  Page 44 of 80 
Confidential  
 possible, it is suggested that the Investigator take photographs of all ocular AEs 
of possible clinical significance and forward them to the Medical Monitor. 
• Events requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by the Sponsor. Upon 
review of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations 
representatives may contact the Investigator to request further information concerning the treatment . 
• Report all USADEs to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days following 
awareness of the U SADE or according to the established reporting procedures 
of the IRB, whichever is shorter. 
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the AE to the Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations.  Expense incurred for study related medi cal treatment will be paid by Bausch +Lomb Clinical Operations. 
7.2.2 Procedures for Reporting Off- Site Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device 
Effect s 
When participating in multicenter clinical investigations, Investigators may receive off -site 
USADE reports. These are Sponsor reports of U SADEs which occurred at o ther clinical 
sites for the same trial, or in different trials using the same investigational test article  or 
comparator , that met the criteria for reporting to a regulatory agency. These should be 
reporte d to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days or per their established reporting 
procedures, whichever is shorter. 
7.2.3 Device Deficiencies : Definition and Reporting Procedures  
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report any complaints/ deficiencies or 
malfunctions experienced with the study solution  during this trial to the Me dical Monitor  
promptly. The  Sponsor and Medical Monitor  shall review all device deficiencies and, upon 
the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional information related to the safety repo rting of a particular event. 
Report device deficiencies within 24 hours of knowledge to: 
o  
  
  
The Medical Monitor will distribute, within 24 hours of knowledge, all device deficiencies to the S
ponsor.  
The Sponsor shall review all device  deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to a n SAE. In the event of a disagreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator(s), the Sponsor shall communicate both opinions to the reviewing IRB per their established reporting procedures and the healt h authority.

 7.2.4 Procedures for Culturing  of Co rneal U lcer or Suspected O cular I nfection  
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated . Cultures 
should be taken from the cul -de-sac, lower eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B, Section 8.0). 
When a culture is obtained, the contact  lenses and contact lens cases w hich were being 
utilized by the subject at the time of the AE should be collected from the subject for 
culturing and processing by the local clinical laboratory designated by the site. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies ( e.g., lenses, lens cases, and/or 
lens case solutions) are for information only. Because microbes may be introduced into 
subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiolo gy or direction of organism transmission.  
The ocular cultures, along with the associated contact lenses and contact lens cases, will be sent to the local clinical laboratory designated by the site for analysis. The clinical laboratory will report the culture results to the Investigator who will record the results in the eCRF.  
7.2.5 Guidelines for Reporting Pregnancies  
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period). Female subjects who become pregnant during the study will be followed until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant or fetus (in case s of miscarriage or ther apeutic abortion) at 
term. Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a Pregnancy Report  and submitted to the 
Medical M onitor via facsimile or email transmission within 24  hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness o f the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to 
the Sponsor as per the distribution listed below. All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies  will be reported on a  paper Pregnancy Outcome Report  and submitted to 
the Medical Monitor via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome is learned. The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to the Sponsor as per the distribution 
listed below. 
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy, for medical reasons, will be recorded as an SAE. Any serious complication or event resulting from the pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor  within 24 hours 
on the SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form  along with the Pregnancy Report 
Form . 
The contact for  reporting pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes are:

 8.3 Sample Size 
Estimates of standard deviations and proportions were obtained from Bausch + Lomb 
Study #872.5 
The sample size calculations assume that the unit of analysis will be the eye and that the 
outcomes from each subject’s eyes will be independent. 
Sample size calculations were completed using nQuery software, Version 9.  
8.3.1 Overall Co mfort  
When the sample size in each group is 300 eyes (150 subjects ), a two -group one-sided 
0.025 significance level t -test will have 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the 
test is not non- inferior to the  standard (the difference in means, μT -μS, is - 5 or farther from 
zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the T est is non-
inferior, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0 and the common standard 
deviation is 13.264. 
8.3.2 Vision  
When the sample size in each g roup is 300 eyes (150 subjects), a two -group one-sided 
0.025 significance level t -test will have 9 9% power to reject the null hypothesis that the 
test is not non- inferior to the standard (the difference in means, μT -μS, is -5 or farther from 
zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the  non- inferior, 
assuming that the expected difference in means is 0 and the common standard deviation is 
11.7. 
8.3.3 Front Surface Deposits  
With 300 eyes (150 subjects) in each group, the observed one -sided 97.5% confidence 
interval will be expected to exceed - 0.1 with 99% power when the Standard proportion, π₀, 
is 0.942 and the  Test expected proportion, π₁, is 0.942; results are based on 100,000 
simulations using the Newcombe -Wilson score6 method to construct the confidence 
interval .6  
8.3.4 Slit-Lamp Findings Greater than Grade 2  
With 300 eyes (150 subjects) in each group, the observed one -sided 97.5% confidence 
interval will be expected to be less than 0.05 with 99%  power when the Standard 
proportion, π₀, is 0.008 and the Test expected proportion, π₁, is 0.008; results are based on 
100,000 simulations using the Newcombe -Wilson score method to construct the 
confidence interval.  
8.3.5 Lens Groups   
For each lens group in Table , at least approximately 30 test group subjects will complete 
the study. For a sample size of 30, the probability of observing at least one complication  
will be  at least 95% when the true complication rate is 10% or greater .   
8.3.6 Overall Power  
If the four primary endpoints are independent, then the overall power of the study is 99% 
x 99% x 99% x 99% = 96%.

 8.3.7 Enrollment Target s 
Approximately 300 subjects (150 in each treatment group) will complete the trial. Allowing 
for up to 10% losses and for equal enrollment across sites, the enrollment target will be 
approximately 340 subjects (680 eyes). 
To allow for approximately 30 completed test group subjects per lens group, each lens  
group will enroll approximately 34 test group subjects. 
8.4 Randomization 
An unmasked statistician who is not otherwise involved in the trial will create the 
randomization schedule. 
Each subject will be randomized to one of the treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio (Test to 
Control). Randomization will be man aged using a RTSM system. The randomization will 
be stratified by lens group and investigational site.   
Efforts will be made to enroll subjects in at least three of the lens strata within each site to 
minimize confounding between site and lens group.  Whi le the target enrollment for each 
lens group is approximately 68 subjects, some lens strata may be difficult to enroll.   
8.5 Study Populations  
8.5.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT P opulation will consist of all randomized subjects for subject level summar ies 
and, for eye level summaries, both of their eyes. Subjects will be included in ITT Population summaries according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. 
8.5.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP Population will consist of all ITT Popula tion subjects without important (major) 
protocol deviations for subject level summaries and, for eye level summaries, both of their 
eyes. Important protocol deviation categories are defined in Section 8.6.5 below . Subjects 
will be included in PP Population summaries according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. The membership of the  PP population will be determined 
prior to unmasking. 
8.5.3 Safety Population 
The Safety Population will consist of all dispensed subjects and, for eye level summaries, 
both of their eyes. Subjects will be included in Safety summaries according to the treatment that they received. If a subject receives mor e than one treatment and one of those treatments 
is the Test solution, then the subject will be included in Safety Population summaries under 
the Test treatment group.

 8.6 Statistical Analysis  
8.6.1 Methods of Analysis 
8.6.1.1 General Methods  
Continuous data will be summarized using sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum,  and maximum. Categorical data will be presented using the total counts 
for each category and corresponding percentages. The denominator for each percentage 
will be the number of subjects or eyes with non- missing data  unless otherw ise indicated.  
As is customary for contact lens solution trials, eyes will be treated as independent sampling units in eye level analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Listings of data will be produced in addition to tables of summary statistics.  
8.6.1.2 Overall Comfort 
At each follow -up visit, overall comfort will be assessed for each eye on a scale from 0 to 
100, with 100 denoting the most favorable response. For each eye, mean overall comfort 
over all follow -up visits will be computed as the average of the non- missing  values over 
all scheduled follow-up visits. Missing data will not be imputed for the primary analysis. 
Mean overall comfort over all follow -up visits will be summarized at the eye level by 
treatment using continuous summary statistics for the ITT Set in a  table. A one-sided lower 
97.5% confidence limit around the difference in means between the T est and Control 
treatment groups, computed using an analysis of variance model including the fixed factor s 
of tre atment , site, and lens group will be displayed. If  the lower confidence limit is greater 
than - 5.0, then the null hypothesis that the test solution is not non inferior will be rejected, 
and the test solution will be statistically successful in this outcome.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the PP Population will be analyzed for this endpoint.  
8.6.1.3 Vision  
At each follow -up visit, vision will be assessed for each eye on a scale from 0 to 100, with 
100 denoting the most favorable response. Vision  will be analyzed using the methods 
described above for overall comfort.  8.6.1.4 Front Surface Deposits  
At each follow -up vis
 it, the degree of front surface deposits will be graded  for each eye as 
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Using only the non- missing observations from scheduled follow-up visits 
without imputation, each eye will be classified with respect to the maximum grade of front 
surface d eposits ( < 2, > 2)  observed over all f ollow-up visits. Maximum Front Surface 
Deposits O ver All Follow -up V isits ( < 2, > 2) will be summarized at the eye level by 
treatment using categorical summary statistics for the ITT Set in a table. A one-sided lower 
97.5% confidence limit around the difference in “< 2” proportions between the T est and 
Control treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score method.  
If the lower confidence limit is gr eater than -10.0% or if no deposits with grade greater 
than 2 are observed in either treatment group, then the null hypothesis that the T est sol ution 
is not noninferior will be rejected, and the T est solution  will be statistically successful in 
this outcom e. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the PP Population will be analyzed for this endpoint.

Confidential  
 8.6.1.5 Graded Slit -Lamp Findings > Grade 2 
At each follow -up visit, graded slit -lamp f indings will be assessed for each eye using 
Grades 0 through 4. Using only the non- missing observations from all visits, each eye will 
be classified with respect to findings greater than grade 2 at any visit (Absent, Present). 
Greater t han grade 2 findings (Absent, Present) will be summarized at the eye level by 
treatment using categorical summar y statistics for the Safety Set in a table. A one-sided 
upper 97.5% confidence limit around the difference in “Present” proportions between the 
Test and C ontrol treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score 
method. If the upper confi dence limit is less th an 5.0%  or if no findings greater than grade 
2 are observed in either treatment group, then the null hypothesis that the Test solution is 
not noninferior will be rejected,  and the T est solution will be statistically successful in this  
outcome. 
8.6.1.6 Subject Assessment  
At the Exit visit, s ubjects will report  their level of agreement  with each of a series of twelve  
statement s in the Subject Assessment Questionnaire . Responses will be on a scale of one 
(strongly disagree)  through six (strongly agree). These  values  will be dichotomized  for 
analysis , with responses of one through three being mapped to the category of “Disagree” 
and responses of four through six being mapped to “Agree.”  
Statistical testing will proceed  in two hierarchical  families  of twelve  statistical tests  each 
(one test per statement) , with the null hypotheses of the first family eligible for rejection if 
all the primary endpoints are met.  
The first family will employ  a one- sided exact binomial test to compare the proportion of  
respondents in the Test group agreeing with each  statement to 0.5.  
The second family will employ a one-sided chi -square test  to compare the proportion of 
respondents agreeing with each statement between the treatment groups.  Within each family of hypothesis tests, the P -values will be adjusted for multiplicity u sing 
the Holm method. Adjusted one -sided P-values less than 0.025 will show statistical 
significance.  
The responses to each statement will be summarized categorically (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Agree, 
Disagree) by treatment group in a table for the ITT Set . The adjusted P -values from the 
statistical tests  will also be displayed  along with an indicator of statistical significance . If 
the statistical tests in a family are not eligible for rejection due to hi erarchy, then the 
adjusted P -values for that family wil l not be displayed. 
8.6.2 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) terminology. Descripti ons of AEs will 
include the date of onset, the date the AE end ed, the severity of the AE, the relationship to 
the study device, the action taken regarding study medication usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported treatment- emergent A Es (TEAEs ) will be 
summarized by the number of subjects  reporting AEs, system organ class, severity, 
seriousness, and relationship to study device. TEAEs are those AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study device use.  
Study #914  - Protocol

Confidential  
 Adverse events will be  summarized by treatment group and severity. Each subje ct will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with 
the highest severity within each category. 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study 
medication. Each subject will be co unted only once within a system organ class or a 
preferred term by using the AEs with the greatest relationship within each category. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing 
verbatim given the Investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, action taken, and device relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial use of the randomized study device. 
Serious adverse events (S AEs) will be tabulated by subject within treatment groups. 
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who 
experienced SAEs will also be provided.  
8.6.3 Subject De mographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
and overall,  for the ITT, PP, and Safety Populations. 
8.6.4 Subject Discontinuation 
The reasons for study discontinuation will be summ arized by treatment and overall,  for the 
ITT Population. 
8.6.5 Protocol Deviations 
Important (major) protocol deviations will be summarized by category and treatment group 
for the ITT Population in a table.  
Categories of important protocol deviations will inclu de the following. 
• Ineligibility  at screening /dispensing but randomized 
• Not dispensed study treatment 
• Misrandomization  
• Dispensing of the incorrect solution 
• Dispensing and use of lenses from the incorrect lens group 
• Use of medications that could potentially affect any of the primary effectiveness 
endpoints 
• Failure to comply with the procedures used to assess the primary effectiveness endpoints, such as missing the scheduled visit or failing to complete the procedure in accordance with instructions 
Additional important protocol deviation categories may be added prior to unmasking. 
8.6.6 Treatment Compliance 
As is customary for contact lens solution trials, treatment compliance will not be 
summarized . 
8.6.7 Treatment Exposure 
As is customary for contact lens solution trials , treatment exposure will not be summarized .

 8.6.8 Missing Data 
Imputation of missing data is not conservative in a non- inferiority analysis setting. 
Therefore, primary effectiveness analyses will be completed without imputation of missing 
data.  
The effects of missing data on the primary effectiveness endpoint  analyses will be explored 
by considering best - and worst -case imputation scenarios  and tipping point analysis  with 
the ITT Set .7 
8.6.9 Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the four co -primary endpoints to 
be statistically significant for overall success to be achieved. Failure of any one of the 
primary endpoints will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary effectiveness endpoints. If the primary endpoints a re met, then s tatistical testing of the supportive 
effectiveness endpoints will proceed in two hierarchical families  with Holm multiplicity 
adjustments applied within each family . 
8.6.10 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.

Confidential  APPENDIX B:  METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATION  
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover.  Equipment and Instrumentation used to perform clinical ev aluations should be 
maintained and calibrated per  the investigative site’s procedures.   
1.0 Visual Acuity/Refraction  
It is essential that a standard procedure be used to obtain VA measurements. The VA and refraction measurements should be obtained by a physician, optometrist, or trained technician. All VA/Refraction must be measured using a phoropter in 0.25 D steps. One 
standard logMAR, chart high 90% contrast, with Sloan letters will be used to obtain the VA measurements in this study. The following VA equipment from Precision Vision, Inc. will be used  in this study: 90% high c ontrast 6.5 feet (2.0 meters) testing distance 
Translucent Chart (CAT. NO. 2103- 2), and the Precision Vision Small Illuminator Cabinet 
(CAT. NO. 914). 
1.1 Illumination of the logMAR  Chart and Room Illumination 
The internal illumin ati
 on of the logMAR chart should be turned on. This will provide the 
nominal contrast for each of the charts. Room illumination should be turned off , to 
ensure that the illumination is consistent for each me asurement. Ambient sources of light 
in the room, such as computer monitors, should be turned off or covered. A small source 
of illumination may be used to allow recording of data and to ensure that it is not difficult or dangerous for staff or subjects to move around the testing area, but these light sources should not be placed so that they are directed toward the subject during testing. The room lighting and any ambient sources should be consistent in their use and placement at each subject visit throughout the course of this study. 
1.2 Determination of Visual Acuity  
The s
ubject should be seated so that the distance from the subject’s eyes to the logMAR  
chart is 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart should be at eye level for the subject. The logMAR 
charts have two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters  (0.3 logMAR) to 62 letters ( -
0.3 logMAR). It is recommended that one letter sequence is used for the right eye, and the second letter sequence is used for the left eye, to minimize learning effects at each visit. Care should be taken to completely occlude the eye not being measured.  
Since the test distance of the chart is not at optical infinity, refractive power compensation 
is required to simulate optical infinity. The VA should be measured through the phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of +0.50 D to compensate for the reduced test distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters).  
If all letters are correctly identified on any given line, then the subject is encouraged to read 
the
 next smaller line. When the subject says they cannot read a letter, they should be 
required to guess. A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter. A scoring sheet for each eye is provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified. The subject continues reading down the chart to the last letter of a given line, until the subject has 
missed 3 letters on a line with 5 letters . The incorrect letters can occur at the beginning, 
middle, or end of this line and do not have to be consecutive.

Confidential  1.3 Recording and Scoring logMAR Values 
Using the Spons or supplied recording/scoring sheet, an example of which is shown below, 
the tester will record the actual VA measure.  
The number of letters CORRECT will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet in the far 
right box on the corresponding line. The lines will then be added up and the “TOTAL” number of letters correctly identified will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet. The “TOTAL” is the number that will be entered onto the e CRF.  
Example of Distance VA:  
In the example below, all letters in lines 1  through 6 were read correctly. Line 7 had 4 
correct responses, and line 8 had only 1 correct response. After line 8, the VA test would be considered complete. In this example, the total letters correctly identified is 32. This number is recorded in the space marked “TOTAL” and also recorded on the e CRF.

exacerbated with staring .  
2 - one stable dry (non-wetting) area of some magnitude.  
3 - more than one stable dry (non- wetting) area of some magnitude .  
4 - non- wettable lens surface .  
 4.0  Method for the Examination, Description and Classification of Lens Fit at all Visits The following procedure has been developed to assist in the examination, description, and 
classification of contact lenses fit at all visits in the Investigator’s office.  
Materials needed:   Slit
 -Lamp  
Procedure:   Each lens should be examined on the eye using the slit -lamp employing a 7X to 15X 
magnification.  
Lens fit will be assessed  utilizing the scales below: 
I. Lens Centration  
Enter Rating 0 – 3: 
Qualitative  Lens  Centration  
• Compare lens edge overlap  of limbus  in all visible  sectors.  
• The centration  diagram  is pictured  as lateral  decentration  toward  9:00 on the clock  dial. 
Centration  assessment  applies  to all clock  hours. 
o If the limbus  is an ill-defined  band, assess from  the center  of the band. 
o If the contact  lens edge translates  with blinking, assess to the average lens edge 
position. 
o Centration  assessment  applies  to primary  gaze.  
o  If the inferior  edge of the contact  lens is not visible , gently pull the lower  eyelid 
away. 
• Rate and record  lens centration  on a scale of 0 to 3 based  on the following lens diagrams 
and descri ptors: 
 
0) Equal Overlap 360 degrees 
1) Maximum overlap ≤ 2/3 in any sector  
2) Maximum overlap > 2/3 in any sector 
3) Any Corneal Exposure 
. 
II. Lens Movement  
• As the subject  blinks normally, observe le ns movement, with  particular  attention  to the 
Study #914  - Protocol  
19 JAN  2023  Page B-12 
Confidential  inferior portion of the lens.  
o All movement depicted  in the diagram  belo w is from  the absolute centered  
position. 
o All movement descriptions apply from  the various decentered  positions. 
o Corneal  exposure in  any sector  is an unacceptable fit. 
o If the inferior edge of  the contact  lens is not visible,  gently pull the lower  eyelid 
away.  
 
• Rate and  record  lens movement  on a scale of -2 to  +2 based  on the following lens  
diagrams an d descriptors: 
 
-2 -  No  observable movement ( perform  Josephson push-up test, see below) 
-1 -  Minimal; Just observable movement, lens returns to origin. 
 0 -  Optimal/Free  movement, lens returns  to origin.   
+1 - Substantial movement; but le ns does not immediately  return  to origin. 
+2 - Excessive movement; lens does not return  to origin, may result  in corneal  
exposur e.

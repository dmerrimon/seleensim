1. PURPOSE:  
1.1. This study is designed to demonstrate that the AF Prototype Cushion (AF Proto ) 
can reduce seating fatigue and improve human performance in aircraft seating.  
 
2. SCOPE :   
2.1. For testing of the AF Proto  and its ability to  increase comfort  in a pilot’s seat in a 
B52 bomber, by combating seating fatigue and improving human performance  
for flights up to 12 hours in duration .

 Page 4 of 7 6.4.3.1. The subject  will be performing tasks meant to maintain their focus and 
be actively thinking, including video games, flight simulator, puzzles, 
etc. 
6.4.4.  The subject  will be strapped into the test seat and a timer will be started to 
begin the trial.  
6.4.4.1. If the subject  experiences any adverse events, harm, or no longer 
wishes to participate, the trial will be terminated immediately and the 
subject  will receive appropriate care as necessary.  
6.4.5.  The subject  will have the start trial Subjective Fatigue Survey 
administered.  
6.4.6.  The subject will perform the task as described in 6.4.3.1 while strapped 
into the test seat for up to 12 hours.  
6.4.6.1. The subject is allowed minimal short breaks to use the restroom during 
the trial.  
6.4.6.2. The subjects will be instructed to bring a meal and it will be consumed 
while strapped into the test seat. 
6.4.7.  The mid -trial Subjective Fatigue Survey will be administered in the 
middle of the trial time.  
6.4.8.  At the end of the trial time,  while still strapped into the test seat, the 
subject  will have the end -trial Subjective Fatigue Survey administered . 
6.4.9.  The subject  will again be provided with a device to take the post -trial 
PVT.  
6.4.10.  The subject  will be assigned another time to complete their second trial.

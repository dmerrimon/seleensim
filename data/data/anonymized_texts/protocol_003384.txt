1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA  
This pilot  trial seeks to evaluate the feasibility  of implanting and retrieving at least  1 implantable 
microdevice in patients with early stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) who are 
candidates for neoadjuvant therapy or upfront surgery. The overarching development plan, if 
proven feasible in this pilot, would be to test whether in vivo chemotherapy  sensitivity  assessed 
by an implantable microdevice (the “device”) correlates with response to standard of care, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early stage TNBC. The study has 
been amended to include 2 cohorts.  In Cohort  1, patients will have the microdevice placed prior 
to breast  surgery  and in the absence of neoadjuvant  chemotherapy. Removal  of the device with 
the entire tumor will be used to confirm our ability to pathologically correlate in vivo tumor 
response  to the individual drug regimens included on the  microdevice. In  Cohort 2, patients will 
have the device placed,  retrieved 1 day later  by core biopsy  and proceed on  to standard of care 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In exploratory objectives, in vivo chemotherapy sensitivity to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) as defined by a panel of prespecified biomarkers related to apoptosis, DNA  damage and proliferation will be analyzed for correlation with 
pathologic complete response as defined by residual cancer burden (RCB 0/1) following a 
standard of care, neoadjuvant, AC -based chemotherapy regimen for patients in Cohort 2.  
Exploratory endpoints include the subanalyses to evaluate the device‟s ability to correlate 
response  from taxane/platinum therapy,  to investigate the intervariability of  the measurements by 
device and within a device and to evaluate pathologist interobserver variability. We will also 
evaluate the safety of implanting and retrieving the device. The protocol schema is shown in

 2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
Primary Objective:  
• To determine the feasibility of  implanting and retrieving  at least  1 device  in patients with 
early stage triple- negative breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or upfront surgery. Three devices will be implanted in the patient unless 
otherwise limited by tumor size, where fewer may be placed.  
Secondary  Objectives:  
• To describe  the safety  and possible toxicity  of implanting and retrieving  at least  1 device 
in patients with early stage breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or upfront surgery.  
• To preliminarily assess in vivo chemotherapy  sensitivity  to AC  as predicted by the device 
correlates with residual cancer burden (RCB) 0/1 following standard of care, AC -based 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with early stage TNBC who receive 
neoadjuvant therapy (Cohort 2).  
• To evaluate whether in vivo chemotherapy sensitivity to paclitaxel and carboplatin as 
predicted by the device correlates with RCB 0/1 for patients with early stage TNBC 
receiving standard of care neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  with AC followed  by paclitaxel  + 
carboplatin (Cohort 2).  
• To evaluate whether in vivo chemotherapy sensitivity to AC combination at baseline 
correlates with  biomarkers of  response  in vivo following  systemic administration  of AC for 
those patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy.  
• To evaluate the reproducibility  of data from replicate drug/drug combinations in each 
device and across devices in the case where  more than one device is retrieved.  
• To define  the inter-observer variability between  pathologists for  the assessment  of 
phenotypic response in native tumor tissue  
• To determine the accuracy by which tissue responses can be co -localized with the 
specific drug regimens on the microdevice,  both in the setting of extracting the device 
surgically with the entire tumor, as well as extracting the device percutaneously.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Efforts to  personalize treatment  by in vitro tumor  assays to  predict  chemotherapy  sensitivity have 
been ongoing across solid  tumors for  many  years.  However,  these methods have been limited  in 
their usefulness to date. In  fact, the American Society  of Clinical Oncology  issued a statement in 
2011 which recommended against the use of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays 
(CSRA) to select chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients outside of the clinical trial 
setting. [1]This practice guideline is based on the lack of evidence that any available CSRA demonstrated improved outcomes (i.e., overall survival, response to therapy, disease free 
survival, progression free survival, local tumor control or treatment toxicity) when used to make 
chemotherapy decisions rather than empiric choice based upon clinical trial literature.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 15- 127 A(6)  
Approval date: 22 -Nov-2017  
Page  9 of 31  
 However,  it has been  recognized that an in vitro  strategy  could have potential  clinical importance 
and further development of models to individualize chemotherapy choice are a priority.  
Unfortunately, in vitro models are unable to  recapitulate the exact  microenvironment  in which  a 
tumor exists. Development of cell line and xenograft models take time that makes real -time 
decision making based upon results less practical. In addition, limited resources may result in 
difficulty bringing patient -derived xenograft models to practice on a larger scale.  
There is an unmet need for an in vivo, chemosensitivity assay that could simply and quickly 
predict benefit from a particular treatment for patients with solid tumor malignancy. Kibur has 
invented an implantable microdevice which  may serve  as a rapid screen  for multiple  single  agent 
or combination therapy regimens in vivo, reflecting the native tumor and patient 
microenvironment.  
In this pilot first -in-human trial, we propose studying whether this device may be placed within a 
breast primary tumor, successfully retrieved (either through radiology -guided retrieval process 
prior to  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  or at the  time of definitive  breast surgery) and yield evaluable 
tumor  tissue  for readout  of drug sensitivity. Secondary  exploratory endpoints will  evaluate whether 
the device has the ability  to predict RCB 0/1 for patients receiving standard of care, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer in Cohort 2.  
Neoadjuvant  chemotherapy 
The goal of systemic chemotherapy  for the  treatment  of early  stage breast  cancer is to eradicate 
micrometastases and improve overall survival. In addition to this objective, the primary  aim of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer is to improve surgical 
outcomes in patients for whom a primary  surgical approach is not feasible or for those patients 
who desire  breast conservation. The  standard, highly  effective  chemotherapy  regimens typically 
used in the adjuvant, post -operative setting are instead administered preoperatively to facilitate 
surgery. To date, survival outcomes for chemotherapy given in the pre - or post -op setting have 
been comparable.  
There is a trend  towards increased usage  of neoadjuvant  therapy for  patients with  triple  negative 
(TNBC)  breast  cancers,  in part because these  cancers are  most  likely  to show good locoregional 
responses.  
Triple  Negative Breast  Cancer  
Two recent randomized phase 2 studies have  demonstrated  higher pCR rates with  the addition of 
carboplatin to an anthracycline-  and taxane- containing regimen for the neoadjuvant treatment of 
patients with early stage triple negative breast  cancer.  The GeparSixto study  randomized a cohort 
of 315 patients with TNBC to  weekly liposomal  doxorubicin + paclitaxel with  bevacizumab, with  or 
without weekly carboplatin.[4] The addition of carboplatin was associated with a significantly higher pCR rate (57% vs. 43%, OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.24- 3.04).  These results were later confirmed 
by CALGB  40603, a randomized phase 2 trial which utilized a more conventional backbone 
chemotherapy regimen (weekly paclitaxel followed by dose  dense AC) and randomized 443 
women with TNBC to the addition of carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks concurrently  with 
paclitaxel.[5] Despite the slight variations in backbone chemotherapy, the addition of carboplatin was also associated with a higher pCR rate (54% vs. 41%, OR 1.71). Recently, the GeparSixto  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

trial reported that the addition of carboplatin improved disease free survival as compared to the 
non-platinum containing  control  arm (85.8% vs. 76.1%; HR 0.56 p=0.035) (von Minckwitz et al, 
Abstract S2 -04 SABCS 2015). These results are supportive of the antitumor activity associated 
with platinum agents for the treatment of TNBC and the addition of carboplatin to weekly 
paclitaxel as part of a neoadjuvant regimen is a reasonable option for patients with stage II -III 
TNBC. However, platinum -based chemotherapy regimens have not replaced acceptable 
anthracycline-  and taxane- based regimens for  the treatment  of early  stage breast  cancer,  nor has 
neoadjuvant administration of chemotherapy become a standard for all triple -negative breast 
cancers. The incorporation of platinum to ddAC -T presents one additional reasonable option for 
treatment of early stage TNBC.  
Neoadjuvant  treatment allows  for an early evaluation of the effectiveness  of systemic  therapy 
from clinical observation, radiographic findings and ultimately pathologic response evaluations at 
the time of definitive  breast  surgery  (i.e., pathologic complete response).  Additionally, in  the HER2 
and TNBC subtypes of  breast  cancer,  pathologic complete response has been shown to correlate 
with survival outcomes. [6]These features make the neoadjuvant space an appealing setting for 
the conduct of clinical trials in which tissue acquisition is required to identify tumor - or patient - 
specific biomarkers.  
An implantable  microdevice to predict  in vivo chemotherapy  sensitivity 
 
Kibur Medical has developed a rapid parallel in vivo assay that consists of an implantable 
microscale device that is placed inside the native tumor microenvironment. This device  
contains 16 reservoirs, each with a unique single agent or drug combination in microdose 
amounts of less than one millionth of a systemic patient dose. The device is implanted directly 
into the tumor during a biopsy procedure, and remains in situ for ~24 hours ( Figure 2). Drugs 
from each reservoir are released during this time into distinct regions of  tumor tissue,  
effectively creating in vivo micro -reactors for the interaction of tumor with a specific drug. 
Crosstalk between drugs from different reservoirs is eliminated by appropriate spatial 
separation of reservoirs and by drug formulation and other techniques. The microdevice is of 
cylindrical shape measuring 820µ m in diameter, and is delivered through an 18 gauge biopsy 
needle.  
 
 
Figure  2: Concept  for in-vivo drug sensitivity assay:  Device is implanted directly into tissue.  During  implantation,  drugs  diffuse into 
confined  regions  of tumor.  Each such region  can be assayed  independently  to assess  the tumor -specific  response of a given drug. 
Follow  ing incubation,  a second  biopsy  procedure is administered in  which a coring needle selectively  retrieves  a small  column  of 
tissue  that immediately  surrounds  the device. This  tissue  contains  the regions  of drug diffusion and is  sufficient for  determination of 
efficacy of drugs.

Figure  3: Removal  of drug -exposed 
tumor region by a coring needle. 
The device and the region of drug 
distribution w  as removed by a 13-  
gauge  coring needle  after 20-24 h for 
pure and formulated drug contents. 
More than 99% of drug was removed, 
as measured by autofluorescence of 
pure doxorubicin.  The device with surrounding tissue is excised using a larger 
coring biopsy needle (~7- 12 gauge) which is  inserted into  
the tumor and positioned concentric to the device using 
ultrasound imaging. The coring needle then protrudes over 
and beyond the device, capturing the device itself and a 
cylindrical column of tissue of 1.6mm thickness and 4- 5mm 
length,  including  ~400µ m thickness  radially outward  from 
the device along its entire length. This represents virtually  
the entire region of drug distribution over the incubation 
period of 1 day and is thus sufficient for examining drug 
effect. The drug amounts that were released from reservoirs into tissue are removed almost entirely during the retrieval 
procedure, along with the tumor tissue that was exposed to 
these compounds.  In this manner, Kibur investigators were 
capable of gathering in vivo phenotypic data on the action of a large number of anti -cancer single agents or combinations 
within 1 day inside the tumor microenvironment, all without systemic or residual exposure to the drugs tested.  
The local concentration of drug released into distinct regions of tumor tissue can be  measured 
by drug autofluorescence (A -D) or mass spectrometry tissue imaging (E, F), and can be 
observed at different time points (J) as shown in Figure 4 . 
Figure  4: A-I: Anti-cancer  drugs  are delivered into confined regions  of tumor.  Detection by fluorescence:  (A) Doxorubicin (B) 
Sunitinib (C) Lapatinib.  (D) Cetuximab  conjugated  w ith Alexa488.  Detection by MALDI  mass  spectrometry:  (E) Gemcitabine  and 
(F) Docetaxel.  (J): Image  compares  the release of a microdose  of sunitinib at 3 time points,  demonstrating expanded  but confined 
region  of tissue  distribution  even at longer  time points.  Scale bar = 300 μm. 
 
A small region of tissue is removed from the tumor and analyzed by multi -parameter 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine anti -neoplastic effect for each treatment being 
evaluated on the device at the end of the device implantation period.  Multiple  biomarkers can 
be used to understand the specific effect of drug on tumor tissue.

Modified Device:  
 
We have studied our methodology  and outcomes of  first patient accruals on study  and have noted 
that the microdevice, although successfully retrieved, would often become dislodged from 
surrounding tumor tissue during retrieval process. In response to this, in collaboration with Kibur, 
we have developed a modified microdevice that seeks to address the difficulties with tissue 
retention and biopsy retrieval incurred with the previous device design ( Figure 7). There are 3 
modifications featured on the new microdevice design:  
• The back  of the microdevice features a barb which  restricts axial  movement  and keeps the 
device locked onto tissue more tightly.  
• The diameter  of the cylindrical section bearing the reservoirs  is reduced  from 820 µm to 720 
µm. 
• The tip of the microdevice is conical, allowing for better penetration into tissue and lower 
associated tissue  damage.  This also provides a tighter  encapsulation of the device with tissue.  
 
All methods of device insertion and specimen analysis remain unchanged and have been 
successfully piloted preclinically (Figure 8). Radiology has modified retrieval methodology to 
minimize  disruption to device/tumor  relationship as a result  of the biopsy  procedure and pathology 
has optimized specimen  handling techniques. These modifications are  not thought to  alter the risk 
level of the  protocol. While the design of the  microdevice  has been  changed, it is composed  from 
the same inert polymer that the original device was made.

Rationale 
This first  in human pilot study  will preliminarily  assess the  feasibility  of implanting and retrieving  at 
least 1 device from  the breast in patients  with early stage breast cancer and to assess  whether 
the Kibur device and the in vivo measurements it produces correlate with pathologic response to 
chemotherapy. Pathologic response will be measured by residual cancer burden.  The patient 
population includes patients with breast cancer receiving standard of care, neoadjuvant anthracycline- and taxane- based chemotherapy for T2 N  any, triple negative breast cancer. The 
Kibur  device measurements linked to the AC wells will be used to test our primary  hypotheses.  To 
date, there  are no  available methods for predicting an individual  patient‟s or tumor‟s response  to 
therapy which recapitulates the in vivo complexities of both the tumor and its microenvironment.  
Individual patient  derived xenograft  or cell line models are costly, time consuming and difficult  to 
scale into clinical practice.  
If the readout obtained from the Kibur device is shown to be feasible and correlated with chemotherapy  sensitivity  in vivo, this pilot trial will lead  to a larger  study  to validate findings and 
investigate the use of the device in making individual treatment decisions.  
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This study will assess the feasibility of implanting and retrieving at least 1 device in patients with 
early stage breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy  or upfront surgery. 
We will also obtain preliminary data regarding the ability  of the Kibur device,  an in vivo indicator  of 
chemotherapy sensitivity, to predict response to neoadjuvant AC in patients with early stage breast cancer receiving systemic,  standard of care, pre- operative anthracycline- and taxane- 
based chemotherapy as defined by residual cancer burden (RCB) 0/1. RCB is an accepted measure of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy which correlates with survival (  Appendix 
B).[7] Twelve patients with early stage triple negative breast cancer, who are candidates for 
upfront surgery (Cohort 1)  or neoadjuvant therapy (Cohort 2) will be accrued.

 Patients with early stage TNBC with  primary tumors greater than or equal to 1 cm  in size are 
candidates for this protocol. Patients may  be accrued to one of two  Cohorts. Appropriateness for 
one cohort  over the other  will depend on whether  patient  will pursue a neoadjuvant  chemotherapy 
approach (Cohort 2) or elect to proceed directly to surgery and defer chemotherapy to the post - 
operative setting (Cohort 1). This decision will be made in a multidisciplinary way with input from 
Breast Surgery  and Breast Medical  Oncology, taking into account patient preference as well. The 
infrastructure for this multidisciplinary approach is already in place within the Breast Disease 
Management Team.  
 
 
Cohort  1: Upfront  Surgery  
In this cohort, patients will undergo placement of 3 devices within the tumor unless limited by 
tumor size,  where  fewer may  be placed. In patients undergoing a lumpectomy  the devices may  be 
placed at the time of wire or seed localization. Each device has several wells loaded with single 
agent and combination therapy. The devices will be retrieved 1 day  later at the time of definitive 
breast surgery  (breast conservation or mastectomy  per standard of care). The sample will be sent 
to pathology fresh and if a device is encountered intra -operatively, the device will be separately 
delivered to pathology. Study team will coordinate scheduling such that Dr. Elizabeth Morris is available for placing the device and Dr. Hannah Wen is available in the Pathology Department to help in tissue handling appropriately. Specimen radiograph to confirm removal of devices will be performed in pathology. Devices and a small amount of surrounding tumor will be sent to Reis - 
Filho‟s laboratory  where tumor analyses will be performed to evaluate an apoptotic index  defined 
by cleaved caspase 3, Ki67 labeling index, phospho- H2AX  score, and RAD51 score to estimate 
response to therapy. The patient will then proceed on to adjuvant therapy at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.  
Cohort  2: Neoadjuvant  Therapy  
In this cohort, patients will undergo placement of 3 devices prior to systemic therapy, unless limited by tumor size, where fewer may be placed. Each device has several wells loaded with single agent and combination therapy. The devices will be retrieved 1 day later by  core needle 
biopsy. The sample will be sent to pathology fresh and if a device is encountered intra - 
operatively, the device will be separately delivered to pathology. Study team will coordinate scheduling such that Dr. Elizabeth Morris is available for  placing the device  and Dr. Hannah Wen 
is available in the Pathology Department to help in tissue handling appropriately. Specimen 
radiograph to confirm removal of devices will be performed in pathology. Devices and a small 
amount of surrounding tumor will be sent to Reis -Filho‟s laboratory.  
Tumor analyses will  be performed to evaluate  an apoptotic index  defined by  cleaved  caspase  3, 
Ki67 labeling index, phospho- H2AX  score, and RAD51 score to estimate response to therapy. 
Patients will go on to receive standard of care neoadjuvant therapy.  A research biopsy will be 
performed  following AC treatment.  RCB will be determined by the study  pathologist  at the time of 
definitive surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
All analyses will be primarily  descriptive and graphical  in nature.  The primary  endpoint  will be to 
evaluate the feasibility of the device. We have defined feasibility as the ability  to implant and

Page  15 of 31  
 retrieve at least one device. Numerous secondary  and exploratory  analyses are planned. We will 
evaluate the safety  and toxicity  of implanting and removing the device as well as our ability  to 
determine tissue  response to the agents incorporated in the device, both by core biopsy  or at time 
of definitive surgery. We will explore whether  in vivo chemotherapy  sensitivity to AC as predicted 
by the device  correlates with  residual  cancer burden (RCB) 0/1  following  standard of care.  In this 
patient population, we estimate that standard neoadjuvant regimens will achieve RCB 0/1 in 50% 
of patients. Similar analyses  to evaluate the sensitivity of subtype -specific  regimens will be done 
in the TNBC subsets. In addition, we will evaluate  whether AC chemotherapy  sensitivity in vivo at 
baseline (measured by apoptotic index defined by cleaved caspase 3, Ki67 labeling index, 
phospho- H2AX  score and RAD51 score in the area closest to the AC wells of the device) is 
correlated with the same measures obtained from tumor biopsy after  AC therapy. Exploratory 
endpoints will evaluate the reproducibility of each device and across devices, as well as interobserver variability.  
4.2 Intervention  
Patients will be offered participation in this trial by their Breast Surgeon or Breast  Medical 
Oncologist once a determination of neoadjuvant or upfront surgery has been made. Eligible 
patients who give informed consent will be referred to Breast Radiology for implantation of 3 
devices within the primary  tumor unless limited by  tumor size, where fewer may  be placed. Each 
device has 16  wells;  the 8 drug regimens shown below will be loaded in duplicate on each  device.  
 
Kibur  Drug  Wells  
1. Doxorubicin  and cyclophosphamide  (AC) 
2. Doxorubicin  (A) 
3. Paclitaxel  (T) 
4. Paclitaxel  (T) and carboplatin  (Pl) 
5. Carboplatin  (Pl) 
6.  AC + paclitaxel  + carboplatin  (AC-TPl) 
7. Gemcitabine  (G) 
8. Eribulin  (E) 
 
The 3 devices will be implanted into the primary tumor by a Breast Radiologist trained in this 
method on Monday through Thursdays. Women accrued to the trial will be scheduled for 
appointments on  two consecutive  days;  Cohort  1 will have device placement  followed  by definitive 
surgery the next day. Cohort 2 will have device insertion one day, followed by a removal the next 
day. Three devices  will be implanted into  each tumor. The technique involved with device 
insertion is equivalent  to placement  of a radioactive seed using ultrasound guidance or placement 
of a localizing clip after ultrasound guided biopsy, which is standard practice.  On the day of 
implantation, the biopsy proven cancer will first be localized with real time sonography. The skin 
will be cleansed with Betadine and 8 cc of 1% lidocaine will be used for superficial and deep 
anesthesia. A  skin nick may be made. There will be one insertion site for local anesthesia and 
efforts will be made to place all devices through the same needle insertion. The 18 gauge spinal 
needle will then be inserted through the skin and  directed into the cancer where the device will be 
deployed. Each device will be loaded into an 18 gauge spinal needle. Three separate 18 gauge 
spinal needles will be used; each will insert one device into the tumor.

 Cohort  1 
 
Patients on Cohort 1 will proceed to surgery as previously scheduled, the day after device 
placement. The type of surgery, either a lumpectomy or mastectomy will be at the surgeon‟s 
discretion. In the setting of a lumpectomy, non- palpable tumor will be localized with a radioactive 
seed the day prior to surgery at which point the devices  will be placed. The surgery will proceed 
as routine except that the tumor will be sent to pathology  freshly. A  specimen radiograph of 
lumpectomies will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon to confirm retrieval of the radioactive seed  or biopsy  marker.  If on this radiograph the devices are  not evident,  the additional 
shave margins that  are taken as per  routine will also  be radio graphed in pathology  to determine if 
the devices are present. If the devices are not accounted for, no additional tissue will be excised 
from the patient and a post excision mammogram  will performed postoperatively when tolerable 
to the patient to confirm  a retained device. In patients  undergoing a mastectomy, the breast will 
be delivered  to pathology  where  it will undergo X- ray to determine device presence. If a device is 
encountered intraoperatively it will be placed in a container and sent to pathology.  
 
Cohort  2 
 
Patients on  Cohort 2 will return  to Breast Radiology  to have the devices retrieved 1 day following 
implantation. The device  with surrounding tissue will be excised using a ~7-12 gauge core biopsy 
needle, which will be inserted into the tumor and positioned concentric to the device using stereotactic or ultrasound guidance. Study radiologists have undergone dedicated training for 
device removal  under ultrasound guidance.  Devices with  empty  reservoirs  have been  placed in a 
chicken breast to simulate the breast tissue. Each radiologist has successfully removed three 
devices from these models using a 7 -12 vacuum needle on several occasions. Device removal 
under stereotactic guidance models standard practices for breast tumor biopsies. The decision 
about the method  for device retrieval  will be based on the  visibility  of the device within the  tumor. 
Based on phantom studies, it is expected  that ultrasound will be feasible in  the majority  of cases. 
Ultrasound has the advantage of real time visualization and the ability  to line up the device with 
the opening of the biopsy  needle. However in the event that the device is not able to be seen on 
ultrasound, stereotactic biopsy will be performed for device retrieval.  All devices have markers 
that will be easily  seen with x -ray and therefore can undergo stereotactic biopsy.  It is expected 
that all devices can be removed with either of these methods. 
For ultrasound guided device removal,  the target  will first be localized  sonographically.  The breast 
will be cleansed with Betadine, and 3 cc of 1% lidocaine and 10 cc of 1% lidocaine with 
epinephrine (unless contraindicated) will be used for deep anesthesia. A  skin nick  will be made 
with a scalpel. A  vacuum assisted  needle will be inserted  and its accurate position confirmed  with 
sonographic images. Multiple samples will be taken  at each  site in order to  attempt removal  of all 
three devices. A  maximum of three insertions  will be  performed with procedure time not 
exceeding 30 minutes. The specimens will be delivered for analysis.  
 
For device removal under stereotactic guidance, a preliminary grid localizing film will be obtained to localize and the skin marked. The patient will then be positioned on the stereotactic table or chair  and the target localized with digital images.  The breast  will be cleansed with Betadine,  and 3 
cc of 1% lidocaine will be used for superficial anesthesia and 10 cc of 1% lidocaine (with epinephrine) will be used for deep anesthesia. A  skin nick will be made with a scalpel. A 7 -12

Page  17 of 31  
 gauge probe will be inserted and its accurate position confirmed with images. Multiple samples 
will be taken in order to attempt  removal  of all  three  devices.  If possible,  the same  incision  will be 
used to retrieve all three devices. However, depending on the distance between three devices, 
separate  skin incisions and biopsy  devices may  be required. The procedure time will not exceed 
30 minutes.  
 
Following  the ultrasound or stereotactic guided procedure,  pressure  will be held on the site(s)  until 
bleeding ceases. The area(s) will be cleansed and Steri -Strips applied. Post biopsy instructions 
will be given verbally and in writing.  
Informed  consent  will be obtained prior to both  device  implantation  and removal.  Risks of  either 
procedure include bleeding and infection.  
In the event that a device cannot be retrieved, we do not expect side effects from prolonged 
incubation. The  device consists of a polyaryletherketone (PEEK) polymer which has 
demonstrated long- term safety and biocompatibility in multiple biomedical applications, such as 
trauma, orthopedic and spinal implants.[8]  A close comparable for the Kibur device is the “Cassi 
Beacon” tissue marker, an  FDA-approved  fiducial  marker used  for long -term localization  of breast 
tumors (http://scionmedtech.com/products/breast -biopsy/cassi -beacon/ ). The Cassi Beacon is 
structurally very similar to the Kibur device (composed of PEKK) though it is more than 4 times 
larger by volume (cylindrical shape, 1.5mm in diameter and 5mm long).  If devices cannot be 
retrieved 1 day  following implantation, they  will be removed from the patient along with the 
remainder of the tumor during surgical tumor resection which is maximally 6 months after 
implantation. In  the rare circumstance where  a patient did not have  device retrieved  on Day 2  and 
has unresectable disease at the time of completion of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
the study  surgeon will discuss alternative  options for  device removal  with the  patient. It is possible 
that additional neoadjuvant therapy may  be given  to facilitate  curative resection which  may extend 
the time the device is in place to >6 months. It is also possible that the device is intentionally and 
knowingly left in situ if the risks of surgery were to outweigh the benefit.  
Following device retrieval, or definitive surgery, the tumor -device specimens will be sent to the 
research laboratory of Dr. Reis -Filho. Specimens  will be fixed in buffered formalin for 16 hours 
and subsequently processed and embedded in paraffin for histochemical and 
immunohistochemical analysis. Tissue sectioning will be performed essentially as described by Jonas et  al., to ensure  that at least  5 sections centered on each  reservoir  are cut. One section  will 
be stained with hematoxylin- and-eosin and the remaining sections will be subjected to IHC or 
immunofluorescence using antibodies against cleaved caspase 3, Ki67, RAD51, γH2AX, and 
Geminin as previously described. (Jonas O et al, Sci Transl Med 2014)[9]  
 
Quantification of the IHC and immunofluorescence results will be performed by two trained 
pathologists with experience and expertise in breast cancer. The regions in tissue directly perpendicular to the reservoirs will be quantified for the presence of morphologically unequivocal neoplastic cells expressing Caspase 3, Ki67, phospho- H2AX  foci, RAD51 foci and Geminin.  
To determine the impact of each therapeutic agent or drug combination on apoptosis, caspase 3 
expression will be analyzed. Only cytoplasmic and/ or nuclear expression will be considered 
specific. The apoptotic index (AI) will be calculated as the number of Caspase 3- positive 
morphologically  unequivocal  cells/  1000 morphologically  unequivocal  neoplastic cells (Jonas O et 
al, Sci Transl  Med 2014). To define the  impact of each therapeutic agent or drug combination  on 
proliferation, the Ki67 labeling index in tumor tissue around each reservoir will be calculated,  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

 through the analysis of at least 1000 morphologically unequivocal cells, as previously described. 
[10-12]To determine the DNA  damage induced by each therapeutic agent or drug combination, 
sections will be subjected to immunofluorescence with antibodies against phospho- H2AX as 
previously described [9]. We will capture representative images from tissue adjacent to each reservoir on a confocal  microscope, and  nuclei  from 500  morphologically  unequivocal  cells will be 
analyzed per reservoir. A  cell will be considered positive if at least one 1 discrete phospho -H2AX 
focus is identified. The phospho- H2AX  index will be calculated as the number of phospho -H2AX - 
positive morphologically unequivocal neoplastic  cells/ total number of morphologically 
unequivocal neoplastic cells analyzed. To determine whether each therapeutic agent or drug combination induce DNA damage that is corrected by homologous recombination DNA  repair, 
RAD51 and Geminin expression will be analyzed by double- immunofluorescence, as previously 
described. For this, immunofluorescence images will be captured on a confocal microscope, and nuclei from 500 morphologically unequivocal cells will be analyzed per reservoir. A  cell will be 
counted as being RAD51 positive if there is at least 1 distinct focus per nucleus as previously 
described. Given that homologous recombination DNA  repair preferentially  happens during S/ G2 
phases of  the cell cycle,  the RAD51  score  will be assessed  as the percentage of Geminin- positive 
cells that are also positive for RAD51. Samples where the device reservoir was located within a 
highly necrotic tumor region (i.e. >50% of the tissue adjacent to the reservoir is necrotic) or a  
stroma -rich area (i.e. >50%  of the cells in  the tissue  adjacent  to the reservoir are  stromal  cells) will 
be considered not informative. For each reservoir, the AI, Ki67 labeling index, phospho- H2AX  foci 
score and RAD51 score will be recorded.  
 
These results  will not be used to determine patient  treatment  and are for research purposes  only. 
The patient  may undergo  any necessary  preparatory  procedures or  tests in  anticipation of 
beginning standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy during this protocol period.  
Adverse event  data will be collected with respect  to relatedness to the device implantation, 
incubation and retrieval.  
Following  retrieval, patients on Cohort 1 will proceed to receive standard of care adjuvant therapy 
at the discretion of their treating medical oncologist.  
If treated on Cohort 2, patients will proceed to receive a standard of care, neoadjuvant 
anthracycline-  based  chemotherapy  regimen as appropriate for their specific tumor histology, co-  
morbidities and  pre-existing conditions.  Pre-operative chemotherapy  may be administered  at local 
physician practices outside of MSK.  
 
 
Options  for neoadjuvant  regimens  include the following:  
1) Dose dense AC (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) IV  q2 weeks x4 followed by weekly 
paclitaxel x12 + carboplatin IV  every 3  weeks x4.[5] Growth factor  support  will be used for 
dose dense AC per standard of care.

Page  19 of 31  
 2) Dose dense AC (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) IV  q2 weeks x4 followed by weekly 
paclitaxel x12 + carboplatin weekly x12. Growth factor  support  will be used for dose dense 
AC per standard of care.  
3) Dose dense AC (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) IV  q2 weeks x4 (for those patients 
unable to receive  taxanes or platinums).  Growth  factor support  will be used  for dose  dense 
AC per standard of care.  
Dose  adjustments and  modifications will be guided by standard clinical  practice. If a  patient  will 
not receive taxane or platinum in the judgment of the treating physician, they may have the 
opportunity  to participate  on this trial following  discussion  with and at the discretion of the study 
PI. In the case of allergy, substitution or discontinuation is permitted.  
For patients on  Cohort  2, a research  core biopsy  will be performed following AC chemotherapy 
and prior to  beginning taxane- based  treatment.  This biopsy  will be performed in the time period 
immediately following the final AC infusion and up to 2 days later.  
Patients will proceed to definitive surgery at MSK within 4 weeks of their last neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy  dose.  The choice for breast  conservation or mastectomy  will be decided upon by 
the patient and her breast surgeon based upon clinical and radiographic findings and personal 
preference.  
At the time of breast surgery, pathologic complete response will be determined by standard Dept 
of Pathology  methods and a residual  cancer  burden score  will be assigned by a study  pathologist. 
Correlations between AC and residual cancer burden 0/  1 will be evaluated for all evaluable 
patients.  
Additional adjuvant  chemotherapy,  radiation  therapy  or endocrine  therapy  may be given  at the 
discretion of the treating oncologist.

current primary breast cancer.  
• Severe acute  or chronic medical  or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality 
that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational

into this  
 
6.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
Women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  Patients will be recruited for 
enrollment on this trial primarily through referrals from their primary oncologists  and surgeons. 
The clinical trial will be listed on the clinicaltrials.gov website as well as on the MSKCC website. 
Patients will not be paid for participation in this study.  Prior to enrollment on the study, the 
physician will discuss the  study protocol in detail with the patient, including possible toxicities. An 
informed consent will be reviewed by the physician with the patient.  
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient‟s treatment team, the 
protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). If 
the investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient‟s medical  records 
for suitable research study participants  and discuss  the study and their potential for  enrolling in 
the research study. Potential subjects contacted by their treating physician will be referred to the 
investigator/research staff of the study.  
The principal  investigator  may also screen the medical  records of  patients with  whom they  do not 
have a treatment relationship for the  limited  purpose of identifying patients who would  be eligible 
to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact information in order to approach these 
patients regarding the possibility of enrolling in the study.  
During  the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and  the patient, the patient 
may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the recruitment and 
enrollment process.  The investigator/research staff may also review portions of their medical 
records at MSKCC in order to further assess eligibility. They  will use  the information provided by 
the patient and/or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and to contact the patient 
regarding study enrollment. If the patient turns out to be ineligible for the research study, the 
research staff will destroy all information collected on the patient during the initial conversation 
and medical  records review,  except  for any information that must be maintained for screening log 
purposes.  
In most cases, the initial contact with the prospective subject will be conducted either by the 
treatment team,  investigator or the research  staff working  in consultation with the treatment  team. 
The recruitment  process outlined presents no more  than minimal risk to the privacy  of the patients 
who are screened and minimal PHI  will be maintained as part of a screening log. For these 
reasons, we seek a (partial) limited waiver of authorization for the purposes of (1) reviewing 
medical records to identify potential research subjects and obtain information relevant to the enrollment process; (2)  conversing with patients regarding possible enrollment; (3) handling of

Cycle  #4 of AC: 
• Research biopsy  of tumor  following  final AC and prior  to receiving  first dose  of taxane- 
based therapy. This biopsy will occur in the time period ranging from immediately 
following  infusion of final AC to  2 days following final infusion. Radiology  will provide a 
clinical estimate of tumor size at time of biopsy.  
After  all planned neoadjuvant  chemotherapy:  
Proceed to definitive  surgery  within  4 weeks  of last dose  of chemotherapy.  
Post- Operative Surgery  visit: 
• Toxicity review  
8.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS 
 
Anticipated adverse events are those that may be expected from tissue biopsy. This m Kiay 
include pain, bleeding, bruising, and infection or wound healing complications. We do not expect 
side effects from the  device or from prolonged incubation in the event that it is not successfully 
retrieved the day following implantation. The device consists of a polyaryletherketone (PEEK) 
polymer which has demonstrated long- term safety and biocompatibility in multiple biomedical 
applications,  such as trauma,  orthopedic and spinal  implants.[8] A  close comparable for the Kibur 
device is the “Cassi Beacon” tissue marker, an FDA- approved fiducial marker used for long- term 
localization of breast tumors. ( http://scionmedtech.com/products/breast -biopsy/cassi- beacon/ ) 
The Cassi Beacon is structurally  very similar to  the Kibur device (composed of PEKK) though  it is 
more than 4 times larger by volume (cylindrical shape, 1.5mm in diameter and 5mm long). If 
devices cannot be retrieved, they  will be removed from patient along with the remainder of the 
tumor  during surgical  tumor  resection  which  is maximally  6 months after  implantation. The device 
is not expected to interfere with neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

10.0 CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
The following  events  may result  in the removal  of patients  from the study:  
• Inability  to comply  with protocol  requirements  
• Patients  whose  health  would  be jeopardized  by continued participation  
• Withdrawal  of informed  consent  (subject‟s  decision  to withdraw  for any reason)  
• Discretion  of the Investigator  
 
If a patient  is removed  based on the criteria  above,  we will replace  the patient.  
 
11.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This is a pilot study  in 12 patients with early  stage triple negative breast cancer to examine the 
feasibility of using the Kibur device that aims to test for in vivo drug sensitivity. With results from 
this study,  we plan to open a larger  trial in  order  to examine whether data  obtained from the  Kibur 
device is correlated with clinical outcome  as defined by pathologic complete response  measured 
by residual cancer burden (RCB 0/1).  
Patients in this trial will be a mix  of TNBC patients who 1) will have the microdevice implanted 
prior to breast surgery, in the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patients who 2) will 
have the device placed and retrieved on a core biopsy the following day, then receive 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to definitive breast surgery.  For the first type of patient, the 
device will be retrieved from the surgical tumor specimen.  For the second type of patient, the 
device will be retrieved via core biopsy. To  date, we have  recruited 4  patients where the device 
has been retrieved by core.  The sample  size for each  type of patient is not  explicitly  delineated. 
Rather,  recruitment  will continue until we have 12 patients of  any of the two types.  Analyses on 
feasibility will be done on all 12 patients together.  
Our decision to deem this pilot study  feasible will be based on the ability  to implant, retrieve at 
least  one device,  and collect  evaluable tumor  tissue  for readout  on drug sensitivity.  If we are able 
to collect  data from at least  6 out of the 12 patients,  we will deem  this study  feasible to conduct  in 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

 a larger  cohort  of patients.  There  is a .62 probability  that we will be able to collect  data from at 
least 6  patients assuming a .50 binomial  probability. The below table shows the  probability  of 
having a successful trial under higher assumed probabilities of .60, .70, and .80.  
True underlying rate of success Probability  of observing 6 or more  successes

.70 .96 
.80 ~1.0 
 
The sample size for this pilot is limited due to practical and budgetary constraints.  As such, our 
analyses will be primarily descriptive  and graphical  in nature. All primary  and secondary  analyses 
will be based on the TNBC patients enrolled (n=12), unless other noted below.  
We will summarize  the safety  and toxicity  of implanting and retrieving  the device(s).  
In the second  group of patients (candidates for  neoadjuvant  therapy)  AC chemotherapy  sensitivity 
in vivo (measured by apoptotic index defined by cleaved caspase 3, Ki67 labeling index,  
phospho- H2AX  score and RAD51 score in the area closest to the AC wells of the device) is 
correlated with RCB 0/1 using graphical methods, such as boxplots.  In this second group of 
patients,  we will also evaluate the correlation between AC chemotherapy  sensitivity  (as measured 
by the apoptosis index, Ki67 labeling index, phospho- H2AX  score and RAD51 score) assessed 
prior to treatment  (in vivo) and assessed following AC treatment  (the same  4 measures assessed 
in the research biopsy specimen). This also will be done graphically.  
There is likely  to be more than one set of values obtained for each patient. This is because each 
well is in duplicate and there  can be up  to 3 devices retrieved per  patient,  thereby  creating up to 6 
data points per biomarker per patient. In addition, two pathologists will review the readout from 
each device, bringing the maximum number of replicates possible up to 12 per biomarker per 
patient. For the main analyses, we will use the average value.  However, we will also investigate 
the intervariability of the measurements by device and within a device. We will also evaluate 
pathologist interobserver variability. This will be done graphically  and if warranted, by  calculating 
the concordance correlation coefficient. These studies of variability will be especially valuable when designing a larger trial. In addition to our exploratory  studies on intervariability, we will 
assess the quality of data in terms of the ability to successfully obtain the four measurements of interest.  
There are several  exploratory  hypotheses.  We will correlate device readouts at  the paclitaxel and 
carboplatin wells with RCB 0/1 in TNBC patients who receive AC followed by paclitaxel and 
carboplatin. We will evaluate this graphically and if warranted, using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
We expect  to complete accrual  of 12 patients  in the next 12 months.  
Note:  In this amendment  (September  2016)  we are opening recruitment  to include TNBC patients 
who will have the microdevice implanted prior to breast surgery.  The biostatistics text above has 
been edited to reflect this change.

Not applicable  
13.0 DAT A M ANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of the RSA 
include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring,  problem resolution and prioritization, and  coordinate the activities of  the protocol  study 
team.  
 
The data collected for this study will be entered into the CRDB, a secure database. Source 
documentation will be available to support the computerized patient record.  
13.1 Quality Assurance 
 
Regular registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and  
completeness of registration data. Routine data quality  reports will be  generated to  assess 
missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations 
and follow -up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential 
problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance audits will be conducted  by the 
study team, at a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if indicated. 
13.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
were  approved  by the National  Cancer Institute in September  2001. The plans address the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled ―Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials ‖ which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM Plans at  
MSKCC were established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm l

 There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, 
safety and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and 
staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, 
plus there are two  institutional  committees that  are responsible for  monitoring the activities 
of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety  Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center„s Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board.  
 
During the  protocol development and  review process, each protocol will  be assessed for 
its level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponsored, in- house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI  cooperative group, etc.) will be 
addressed and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
 
 
 
14.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
Prior  to the enrollment  of each patient,  the risks,  benefits and  objectives of  the study  will 
be reviewed with the participant, including a discussion of the possible side effects.  
Alternative options  will be reviewed,  including standard therapy  outside of a clinical trial, 
as appropriate. Financial costs and burdens of the trial will be reviewed, including a 
detailed discussion of the tests that  will be the financial  responsibility  of the study,  and the 
tests which will be the financial responsibility of the patient.  
14.1 Privacy 
 
MSK‟s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to  a completed  and signed Research  Authorization  form. The use and disclosure 
of protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A  Research Authorization form must be completed by the Principal 
Investigator and approved by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).  
14.2 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• An adverse  event  that results in  inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity or  substantial  disruption of  the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Important Medical  Events (IME)  that may not result in  death,  be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition

• To i nvestigate the effect of twice daily nebulized  doses of RPL554, as 
compared to placebo, when administered in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol 
on morning trough FEV 1 (mean of values 11 and 12 hours after last dose of 
RPL554) on Day 4  
• To investigate the eff ect of twice daily nebulized  doses of RPL554, as 
compared to placebo, when administered in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol on average (measured as AUC ) FEV
1 over 4 and 12 hours after the morning 
dose on Day 3  
• To assess the bronchodilator effect on peak F EV 1 measured within 4 hours after 
the evening dos e of RPL554 on Day 3  
• To analyze plasma concentrations and assess the steady state pharmacokinetics 
of RPL554 when administered in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol

in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol 
• To determine the onset of action of RPL554 when administered with 
tiotropium/olodaterol (after the first dose)  
• To investigate the effects of RPL554 on specific airway conductance (sG aw) 
and lung volumes (residual volume [RV], functional residual capacity [FRC]) when administered in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol  
Exploratory Objectives  
• To assess the dose response of RPL554 on peak and average (measured as AUC over 12 hours) on Day 3, and morning trough FEV
1 (mean of values at 11 and 
12 hours after last dose of RPL554) on Day 4, when dosed in addition to tiotropium/olodaterol  
• To examine the effect of RPL554 on top of tiotropium/olodaterol on average (measured as AUC) FEV

Study Design and Methodology:  This is a Phase II, randomized , double blind, placebo controlled, complete block 
three -way crossover study to investigate combination treatment with nebulized  
RPL554 and tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® in patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is planned to randomize  
approximately 70 patients at up to four study centers .  
Patients will be screened for eligibility, including a reversibility test with 
salbutamol/albuterol and ipratropium between 7 and 14 days before the first dose of 
study treatment. Eligible patients will then attend three separate treatment periods (Treatment Periods 1 to 3), with each lasting 3  days and separated by a 7 to 14-day 
washout period.  
During each treatment period, patients will be present at the study center  from the 
morning of Day 1 until the morning of Day 4. Patients will be randomized  pre-dose 
on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1.  
At Screening, patients will be assessed for eligibility into the study, including Holter monitoring, and reversibility testing with two puffs of salbutamol/albuterol followed 
by two puffs of ipratropi um. Eligible patients will have all prior COPD medications 
discontinued, with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids, and placed on 
ipratropium and salbutamol/albuterol to use on a regular or as -needed basis (as per 
Investigator) throughout the study exc ept during the treatment periods.  
During each treatment period, patients will be dosed with tiotropium/olodaterol 
Respimat® once daily each morning (Day 1 to Day 3) and either RPL554 or placebo 
twice daily (in the morning and evening) for total of six doses of RPL554 or placebo 
in each treatment period.  
The pre -dose FEV 1 at Day 1 of Treatment Period 2 and Day 1 of Treatment Period  3 
must be within ±20% of the pre -dose FEV 1 at Day 1 of Treatment Period  1, in order 
to ensure consistent baseline FEV 1 for each study treatment.  
The following provides a brief overview of the major procedures to be performed during each treatment period.  
The following will be performed at Day 1:  
• Measurements of lung function (FEV 1 and forced vital capacity [FVC]) by 
spirometry pre -dose and up to 12 hours post -dose 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) pre- dose and at 2 and 4 hours post -dose and 
vital sign (supine) measurements pre -dose and up to 12 hours post -dose  
• Measurement of lung vo lumes by whole body plethysmography pre -dose and 
1.25 hours post -dose 
The following will be performed on Day 2 of each treatment period:  
• Measurement of lung function (FEV 1 and FVC) by spirometry pre- dose and for 
up to 12 hours post -dose 
• 12-lead ECG pre-dose and at 2 hours post dose and vital sign (supine) 
measurements pre -dose and up to 12  hours post -dose  
The following will be performed at Day 3 of each treatment period:  
• Measurements of lung function (FEV 1 and FVC) by spirometry pre -dose and up 
to 24 hours post dose  
• 12-lead ECG measurements pre- dose, 2 hours post -dose and 24 hours 
post- dose.  
• Measurement of lung volumes by whole body plethysmography pre -dose and at 
1.25 hours, 8.25 and 12.25 hours post -dose 
• Vital signs (supine) done pre -dose, up to 8 hours post dose and 24 hours 
post- dose   
• Pharmacokinetic blood sampling pre -dose and up to 12 hours post dose  
• 24-hour Holter monitor placed

28 May 2018 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 66 Study Procedures:  • Laboratory safety tests ( hematology  and biochemistry) at 24 hours post -dose 
The final assessments and Holter removal will be performed prior to discharge from 
the study center  on Day 4.  
Adverse events and concomitant medications/therapies will be recorded throughout the study.  
Number of Patients Planned:  Approximately 70 evaluabl e patients  
Main Criteria for Eligibility: Inclusion Criteria  
Male and female patients with moderate to severe COPD, with a post -bronchodilator 
FEV 1 of 30 to 70% of predicted. They must have a baseline increase in FEV 1 of 
>150 mL after use of two puffs each of salbutamol/albuterol and ipratropium. They 
must have at least a 10 pack -year smoking history , and may be a  former  smoker or 
current smoker.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Patients must be clinically stable without recent COPD exacerbations or 
hospitalizations . They must not have uncontrolled disease or chronic heart failure.  
Study Treatments:  All study treatments will be administered using the inhaled route.  
Patients will receive the following three dose treatment combinations in a 
randomized  sequence during Treatment Periods 1 to 3:  
Tiotropium/olodaterol 5 µg /5 µg  once daily + RPL554 6 mg twice daily   
Tiotropium/olodaterol 5 µg /5 µg once daily + Placebo twice daily  
Tiotropium/olodaterol 5 µg /5 µg once daily + RPL554 1.5 mg twice daily  
Each morning during each 3-day period, the tiotropium/olodaterol will be 
administered first followed immediately (starting within 2  minutes) by the nebulized  
study medication  (RPL554 or placebo). The study medication  only will be repeated 
in the evening on Day 1, Day  2, and 3, 12 hours after the morning dose.  
The tiotropium/olodaterol will be administered open label and the study medication  
will be administered double blind.  
The study medication  will be administered u sing a standard Jet nebulizer  and 
compressor .  
The RPL554 formulation is a sterile suspension supplied in a 2.5 mL dose in amber glass vials containing sterile micronized  RPL554 in pH 7 phosphate buffered saline , 
and containing surfactants to aid suspensio n. The placebo is the same as the RPL554 
suspension except that the active RPL554 ingredient is omitted, i.e. it consists of pH 7 phosphate buffered saline and surfactants only.
 
Duration of Treatment : The approximate planned duration of participation for each patient will be up to 
61 days: 7 to 14-day screening period, up to 9 days treatment (three treatment periods 
of 3 days each separated by 7 to 14  days) and an end of study visit 4 to 10 days after 
the last treatment visit (Day 4 of Treatment Period 3).  
Statistical Methods:  Treatments will be compared using analysis of covariance adjusting for treatment, period, patient and baseline. Multiplicative models will be used for FEV
1 and 
outcome from whole body plethysmography and additive models for blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG heart rate. RPL554 doses  will first be compared to placebo using 
a closed test procedure starting with the highest dose of RPL554.  
Sample Size:  This i s a complete block three -way crossover study. Assuming a residual coefficient 
of variation of 6% for peak FEV 1, 70 patients will give an 80% power to detect a 
pairwise difference in FEV 1 of 50 mL.

1.1 Disease and Study Medication Review  
RPL554, a small molecule isoquinolone derivative, is a dual inhibitor of two isoforms (type 3 
and 4) of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) family of enzymes. PDE3 and PDE4 are known to have a role in modulating the inflammatory airway response in respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. In 
general, PDE3 inhibitors act as bronchodilators (through interaction with smooth muscle cells), whilst PDE4 inhibitors have anti- inflammatory properties and there is also evidence to suggest 
that combined inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 can have additive or synergistic anti -inflammatory 
and bronchodilator effects (reviewed by Abbott -Banner & Page, 2014). Pharmacological 
evidence from pre -clinical experiments with dual PDE3/4 inhibitors suggests that RPL554 may 
have potential therapeutic activity in COPD, cystic fibrosis and possibly asthma .  
PDE4 inhibitors (administered orally) have exhibited anti -inflammatory actions; however, they 
have been associated with unfavorable gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, em esis, 
diarrhea , abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss (Harbinson et al, 1997; van 
Schalkwyk  et al, 2005; Compton et al, 2001; Rabe et al, 2005; Rennard et al, 2006; Calverley 
et al, 2007; Gamble et al, 2003; Grootendorst et al, 2007). Dual PDE3/PDE4 inhibitors (administered by inhalation) have exhibited both bronchodilator and anti -inflammatory actions, 
with a more favorable side effect profile (Ukena et al, 1995). It is plausible that increased 
efficacy with reduced side effects may be achievabl e with administration of a dual PDE3/4 
inhibitor by the inhaled route compared to orally administered PDE3 or PDE4 inhibitors. It has also been demonstrated in tracheal ring preparations that RPL554 causes a synergistic bronchodilator effect when added to antimuscarinic agents, as well as additive properties with βa
2-agonists (Calzetta et al, 2013; Calzetta et al, 2015).  
The safety, bronchodilator, bronchoprotective and anti -inflammatory activities of RPL554 
have been evaluated in clinical studies involving over 730 subjects. Initially, five studies were 
done in healthy subjects, patients with mild -moderate persistent asthma and those with allergic 
rhinitis and COPD, using a nebulized solution in citrate/phosphate buffered saline at pH 3.2 
(Francio si et al, 2013; summarized  in the Investigator ’s Brochure). Systemic exposure 
following inhalation using this solution formulation was low and somewhat variable, with maximum concentration (C
max) values ranging from about 0.9 ng/mL following administration  
at 0.018 mg/kg to about 4 ng/mL at 0.072 mg/kg. Area under the curve (AUC) 0-t values ranged 
from about 1.5 ng.h/mL to 11 ng.h/mL over the same dose range. Mean half -life values ranged 
from approximately 3 to 7 hours. 
RPL554 delivered as a nebulized  soluti on was well tolerated. Adverse events were generally 
mild and generally of equal frequency between placebo and active treatment groups. RPL554 
produced a rapid bronchodilation in both COPD and asthmatic patients and increased the provocative concentration of methacholine chloride causing a fall in FEV
1 of 20% from 
placebo (PC 20MCh) by 1.5 doubling doses compared with placebo (95%  confidence interval 
[CI]:  0.63- 2.28; p=0.004). In healthy subjects, RPL554 also produced a significant inhibition 
of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced recruitment of the total number of inflammatory cells 
to the airways, measured in the sputum  (p=0.002), as well as an inhibition of the absolute 
numbers of neutrophils (p=0.002), eosinophils (p=0.001), lymphocytes (p=0.001)  and 
macrophages (p=0.04) in sputum. 
RPL554 has subsequently been re -formulated in a neutral pH phosphate buffered suspension 
formulation for nebulization . This formulation has been tested in seven completed clinical 
studies:

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 66 1. Study RPL554-007- 2014 was a Phase I study in which single and multiple ascending 
doses up to 24 mg were administered to healthy subjects and COPD patients ( RPL554-
007-2014 Clinical Study Report, 2016) . No maximum tolerated dose of RPL554 could 
be determined  and t here was a large bronchodilator response observed. Pharmacokinetics 
demonstrated a terminal serum half -life of about 10 to 12 hours. 
2. Study RPL554-008- 2014 was a Phase II crossover study  that enrolled patients with mild  
to moderate chronic asthma who received four si ngle doses of RPL554 (0.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 
6 mg and 24 mg), two doses of nebulized salbuta mol/albuterol (2.5 mg and 7.5 mg) and 
placebo. RPL554 produced a dose -dependent bronchodilation with a magnitude that was 
comparable to a maximal dose of salbut amol/albute rol, but with fewer of the well 
described salbut amol/albuterol side effects (e.g. hypokalemia , tachycardia, tremor and 
palpitations) (Bjermer et al, 2016).  
3. Study RPL554 -009- 2015 was a Phase II crossover study in moderate to severe COPD 
patients who receiv ed salbutamol /albuterol (200 µ g), ipratropium (40 µg) or placebo 
using a pressurized  metered dose inhaler (pMDI) followed immediately by nebulized 
RPL554 (6 mg) or placebo. RPL554 alone was as effective as standard of care 
bronchodilators, and importantly produced significant additive bronchodilation. Indeed, there was an approximately 60% additional increase in peak forced expired volume in 1 secon d (FEV
1) in COPD patients administered RPPL554 in addition to either 
salbutamol/albuterol or ipratropium (RPL554-009-2015 Clinical Study Report, 2017). 
4. Study RPL554- PK-101 was a Phase I study of the oral bioavailability of RPL554 in 
healthy subjects . Subje cts were randomized to RPL554 6 mg given with, or without, a 
charcoal block. The study demonstrated a low oral bioavailability of 10.6% and a 
terminal half -life of 11.9 hours  (RPL554- PK-101 Clinical Study Report, 2017). 
5. Study RPL554 -CO-202 was a Phase II c rossover study in patients with moderate to 
severe COPD who received tiotropium 18 µg once daily, plus RPL554 1.5 mg, RPL554 
6 mg or placebo twice daily  for 3 days. This study demonstrated a significant increase in 
peak FEV 1 (103 mL  and 127 mL for RPL554 1.5 mg and 6 mg, respectively) as compared 
to tiotropium + placebo. There was also significant improvement in both trough FEV 1 
and lung volumes , including residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity 
(FRC). The time of onset of RPL554 + tiotropium was dramatically faster than with tiotropium alone (4.2 versus 37 minutes)  (Clinical Study Report pending). 
6. Study RPL554 -CO-203 was a Phase II parallel group study in 403 patients with COPD 
who were administered either placebo or RPL554 at doses ranging from 0.75 mg to 6 mg over 4 weeks. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in peak FEV
1 
compared to placebo were observed in all active dose groups at all time points. Secondary endpoints of average FEV
1, COPD symptoms and quality of life were also met (Clinical 
Study Report pending).   
7. Study RPL554-010- 2015 was a Phase II crossover study in adult patients with cystic 
fibrosis. Patien ts received a single dose of RPL554, 1.5 mg, 6 mg, or placebo. This study 
demonstrated a significant increase (6.6%) in peak FEV 1, as well as demonstrating 
pharmacokinetic levels that were similar to that seen in patients  with COPD. RPL554 
was well tolerated in these patients (Clinical Study Report pending). 
RPL554 was well tolerated in all seven  studies, with adverse event rates that were similar to 
the subjects treated with placebo.  
All clinical studies with the solution formulation , and with the first t hree studies above for the 
suspension, are described in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 66 This study is intended to examine the dose ranging effect of RPL554 when dosed on top of the 
combination of a long acting anti -muscarinic receptor antagonist (tiotropium)  and a long acting 
β2-agonist (olodaterol) whilst dosing the RPL554 to steady state blood levels. 
1.2  Summary of Risks and Benefits  
Data from non- clinical studies suggested a potential for hypotension and tachycardia. However, 
in the clinical studies to date RPL554 has been well tolerated in moderate to severe COPD 
patients, healthy subjects, asthmatics and allergic rhinitics. The most common adverse events 
that have been reported at least twice in subjects who have received single or multiple doses of the neb ulized  suspension of RPL554 were generally mild and in descending order of frequency 
are headache, cough, dizziness, and palpitations. Adverse events for single and multiple dose studies are summarized  in Investigator’s Brochure Section 6.3.  
The suspension formulation of RPL554 is pH balanced, and has favorable non- clinical 
toxicology and pharmacokinetic data.  
There has been no evidence of significant adverse events related to the cardiovascular or 
gastrointestinal systems, except associated with an increase in heart rate at high doses (12  mg 
to 24 mg). These small increases in heart rate may relate to the PDE3 inhibitory activity of the compound. In single dose studies there appears to be an increase in the rate of headache, which is most pro nounced at doses over 6 mg. There was no other apparent dose related adverse 
events, with the exception of palpitations in patients dosed at 24 mg. In particular, Holter findings have indicated no arrhythmogenic potential in the completed studies. Results from 
multiple dose data in patients with COPD suggests a transient increase in dizziness, the majority of which occurred during spirometry or dosing; otherwise, the rate of adverse events was similar in RPL554 and placebo treated patients. There was an app arent increase in mild 
adverse events in healthy subjects treated with high doses of RPL554, which may be associated with the higher serum levels in healthy subjects than in those with obstructive lung disease. 
As RPL554 is planned in this study to be administered for only 6 days (12 doses) over two 
treatment periods (placebo is administered in the third treatment period), any benefit to the patients will be restricted to the immediate short- term.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan Description 
This is a Phase II, randomized , double blind, placebo controlled, complete block three- way 
crossover study to investigate treatment with nebulized RPL554 and tiotropium/olodaterol 
Respimat® in patients with moderate to severe COPD. It is planned to randomize approximately 
70 patients at up to four study centers . The study comprises the following, as shown in Figure 
1: Screening, three treatment periods each lasting 3 days and an end of study visit. The 
procedures performed at each visit are summarized  in Section  6 and the study assessments are 
described in Section  7. 
Figure 1 Study Flow Chart  
 
  
                      7 to 14 days                                     7 to 14 days                                 7 to 14 days                               4  to 10 days     
 
      
 Patients will be screened for eligibility, including a reversibility test with salbutamol (in UK) 
/albuterol (in US) and ipratropium between 7 and 14 days before the first dose of study 
treatment.  
Eligible patients will then attend the clinic for three separate treatment periods (Treatment Periods 1 to 3), with each lasting 3 days and separated by a 7 to 14- day washout period (taken 
from last dose of study medication ). Patients will be randomized pre-dose on Day 1 of 
Treatment Period  1. During each treatment period, patients will be present at the s tudy center  
from the morning of Day 1 until the morning of Day 4. 
 
In each treatment period, patients will receive an open label dose of tiotropium/olodaterol from a Respimat
® device followed immediately (starting within 2 minutes) by a double-blind dose 
of either RPL554 or placebo (depending on treatment sequence) from a nebulizer in the 
morning on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3. The dose of RPL554 or placebo will be repeated in the evening on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3.  
The assessments performed in each treat ment period will be the same. Lung function (FEV
1 
and forced vital capacity [FVC]) will be measured by spirometry pre- dose and up to 12 hours 
post- dose on Day s 1 and 2  and up to 24 hours post -morning dose on Day 3 (i.e.  Day 4). Whole 
body plethysmography will be performed pre -dose and 1.25 hours post -dose on Day 1, and  
pre-dose and 1.25, 8.25 and 12.25 hours post -dose on Day 3. Vital signs will be measured 
pre-dose and up to 12 hours post -dose on Day  1, up to 12 hours post -dose on Day  2 and up to 
24 hours post- dose on Day  3 (i.e. Day 4). Electrocardiograms (ECG)  assessments will be

Patients will be discharged from the study center  on the morning of Day 4, and after Treatment 
Period 3 will then attend an end of study visit between 4 and 10 days later. 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design, including the Choice of Control Groups 
The purpose of the study is to investigate if RPL554 has an additive bronchodilator effect when 
administered in combination with a commonly used anticholinergic/β -agonist combination 
medication, tiotropium/olodaterol, in this patie nt population. 
A total of approximately 70 male or female COPD patients  aged 40 to 80 years (inclusive) will 
be randomized. All patients will receive three combinations of study medication (1.5 mg 
RPL554, 6 mg RPL554 and placebo) in a randomized, crossover  design; therefore, each patient 
will act as his or her own control in the study. This design makes it possible to obtain unbiased inferences about differences between treatments, based on intra- patient differences. Study 
medication  will be administered do uble blind to minimize  any potential bias in the overall 
assessment of treatment effect and safety.  
The washout period between the three treatment  periods has been selected based upon the 
available pharmacokinetics of RPL554 in healthy volunteers, and patient s with asthma or 
COPD. Five half -lives is considered as the time for elimination of RPL554t from the body. In 
this study, a washout period of 7 to 14 days from the last dose of study medications has been deemed adequate to ensure there was no overlap between the pharmacokinetic profiles of treatments with RPL554 in consecutive treatment periods. Whilst tiotropium has a prolonged terminal half -life of 5 to 6 days, the clinical bronchodilator effects are gone before this 
timepoint. As such, and in the absence of measuring pharmacokinetic levels of tiotropium, this was felt to be an adequate washout between treatment periods.  
Study treatment administration, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability assessments will be performed whilst patients are resident at the study center . This is to ensure standardized  
conditions for dosing and other study procedures. The pre -dose FEV
1 on Day 1 of both 
Treatment Period 2 and Treatment Period 3 must be within ±20% of the pre -dose FEV 1 on 
Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 in order to ensure consistent baseline FEV 1 for each study 
treatment. If the FEV 1 is greater than 20% different then the start of the treatment period must 
be rescheduled.  
3.3 Planned Duration of the Study  
The approximate planned duration for each patient could be up to 61 days: 7 to 14 days screening, up to 9 days treatment (three treatment periods of 3 days each separated by 7 to 14 days) and an end of study visit 4 to 10 days after the last treatment visit (Day 4 of Treatment Period 3). Repeat, rescheduled and unscheduled visits are permitted at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
3.4 Definition of the End of the Study  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the end of study visit of the last patient in the 
study.

compliance reasons. Should the Investigator decide it is necessary to withdraw any patient for specific reasons, this should be recorded in writing and transmitted to the patient in question. Such reasons for withdrawal are expected to be medical or related to lack of co -operation by 
the patient.  
The patient has the right to withdraw at any time and for any reason, without explanation and without jeopardizing any subsequent treatment by the clinician, if applicable. However, anyone 
withdrawing should be encouraged to offer an explanation for their withdrawal, particularly if it relates or is perceived to relate in any way to the study treatment, or to the cond uct of the 
study. Patients can also be withdrawn in case of protocol violations and non- compliance.  
If a patient withdraws following Randomization, every attempt should be made to contact the 
patient to determine the reason for withdrawal and to complete t he recording of any available 
efficacy data and all adverse event data. The reasons for withdrawal and results of all relevant 
RPL554 -CO-204

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 66 tests will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). These patients should have an 
end of study visit unless it is c onsidered by the Investigator that they require greater medical 
supervision and/or investigations and in which case an unscheduled visit prior to and in addition to the scheduled follow up visit may be performed.  
If a patient had signed a consent form but  withdrew from the study without receiving any study 
treatment, no further follow- up is necessary.  
4.3.3 Study Discontinuation  
Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the 
study 
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of RPL554 
• Serious failure of the Investigator to comply with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) or local regulations  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, the 
ethics committee or any national regulatory officials  
• Major, repeated, non-adherence to the protocol  
The Sponsor must be informed immediately in the event of any major protocol deviation or 
serious breach of GCP. 
Study termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the conditions set forth 
in ICH GCP. The decision to discontinue the study is at the discretion of the Sponsor, the 
Investigator, the regulatory authority or ethics committee and should if possible be taken by mutual agreement. A record of such a discussion will be prepared and stored in the Study File. The Sponsor will ensur e the regulatory authorities and ethics committees are notified.  
4.3.4 Replacement Policy  
It is planned to have 70 evaluable  patients  (i.e., completing at least two treatment periods) . 
Withdrawn patients may need to be replaced to meet this target.

5.1 Study Treatments  Administered  
Patients will receive the three treatment combinations shown in Table 1 in a randomized 
sequence during Treatment Periods 1 to 3. All study treatments will be administered using the 
inhaled route. In each case, the Respimat® medication  will be administered first,  followed 
immediately (within 2 minutes) by the study medication  (RPL554 or placebo) . The Respimat® 
medication  will be open label and the study medication  will be double blind.

RPL554 and placebo are manufactured using aseptic  manufacturing  techniques in accordance 
with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines.  
RPL554 is  supplied as a sterile , micronized  suspension in pH 7 phosphate buffered saline with 
surfactants to aid suspension. Two concentrations of RPL554 (0.6 mg/ mL and 2.4 mg/ mL) and 
a placebo will be provided as a nominal 2.5 mL fill in amber glass vials  sealed with an ethylene 
tetrafluoroethylene coated rubber stopper and flip tear -up cap. The placebo is the same as the 
RPL554 suspension except that the active RPL554 ingredient is omitted. 
5.2.2 Tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® 
Tiotropium/olodaterol ( Stiolto® in US, Spiolto® in UK) Respimat® (Boehringer Ingelheim

28 May 2018 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 66 anticholinergic and β 2-agonist combination for the treatment of COPD  (see Section 14.2) . This 
medication will be provided by the study center .  
5.3 Preparation and Labelling  
5.3.1 Nebulized  RPL554 and Placebo 
Vials of RPL554 and placebo will be packed as patient kits, one kit per period, each containing 
six vials, and labelled in compliance with GMP, released by a qualified person, where 
appropriate, and then shipped to the study center . 
RPL554 and placebo are a unit dose 2.5 mL volume and will be prepared (poured into a 
nebulizer  cup) by an unblinded individual who will not disclose the nature (appearance)  of 
study treatment to the blinded Investigator and study center  staff. The dose will be poured into 
a nebulizer cup, with is covered with tape to mask  the color of the content. 
5.3.2 Tiotropium/olodaterol 
Each tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® will be labelled by the site with the randomization 
number and in accordance with local regulations. 
5.4 Selection of Doses, Dosing Schedule and Route of Administration  
5.4.1 Selection of Doses in t he Study  
The dose of tiotropium/olodaterol, 5 µg /5 µg once daily  (administered as two inhalations of 
2.5 µg /2.5 µg each) , is the approved dose for this medication.  
The doses of RPL554 have been selected based on the results from prior studies  investigating 
single and multiple ascending doses in healthy subjects, single doses in asthmatics, 
single/multiple ascending doses in COPD patients, and 3 days of dosing in COPD patients. These doses were demonstrated to be both effective as a bronchodilator and wel l tolerated.  
5.4.2 Selection and Timing of Dose for each Patient  
The first dose of each treatment period (Day 1) should be given at approximately the same time of day (±1 hour). All subsequent doses should be given at 12-hour intervals (±30 minutes) 
relative to the Day 1 first dose. The first dose should be given between 7 and 11 am.  
For each morning dose, the tiotropium/olodaterol will be given first, followed immediately (starting within 2 minutes) by nebulized RPL554 or placebo. The evening dose (RPL554 or 
placebo only) is given 12 hours (±30 minutes) after the morning dose. 
5.4.2.1 Nebulized  RPL554 and Placebo 
RPL554 and placebo will be administered by inhalation of an aerosol generated by a reusable 
PARI LC Sprint
® jet nebulizer, with an exhalation filter,  attached to a compressor (PARI 
TurboBOY® SX in the UK or a PARI VIOS Pro® in the US). Wherever possible, the same 
compressor unit should be used for each dose for a given a patient.  
The dosing cup on each nebulizer will be obscured with opaque tape by study center  
personnel to visually blind the study medication .  
The end time of nebulization  (sputtering) will be considered Time 0 for the purposes of 
scheduling all post -dose study procedures. Nebulization  time should be approximately 
5 minutes and may not exceed 10 minutes. Patients must wear a protective gown on Day 3 
RPL554 -CO-204

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 66 during the dosing procedure to prevent contamination of the cannula for pharmacokinetic 
samples. Patients should be dosed in a well-ventila ted environment, and away from other 
patients . 
The following must be recorded in the eCRF: 
• Compressor unit number 
• Start and end times of nebulization (times will be rounded down to the nearest minute) 
• The volume of residual product at the end of nebulization   
5.4.2.2 Tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® 
Prior to use of the Respimat®, patients will be instructed in the proper use of the device, 
including the requirement to inhale slowly through their mouth (see instructions in Section 
14.2). They will be instructed to hold their breath for 10 seconds, or as long as comfortable. A second inhalation is required to get the entire dose. The time of dosing will be recorded in the 
eCRF. The tiotropium/olodaterol is administered as two inhalations. 
5.4.3 Route of Administration  
All study treatments  will be dosed via inhalation. RPL554 is administered as a nebulized 
suspension. Tiotropium/olodaterol uses the Respimat
® Soft Mist™ inhaler.  
5.5 Storage 
RPL554 and placebo should be stored below 25°C (77°F) and should not be frozen. The expiry 
date will be indicated on the carton  label.  
Tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® should be at room temperature, 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)  
(see Section  14.2). 
Temperature logs should be maintained in areas where study treatment is stored. If temperature conditions have been seriously compromised or any study treatment has not been stored appropriately, this should be documented, and the study treatment quarantined until the Sponsor has been notified and confirmed whether it may be used.  
Study treatments will be stored under the control of the Investigator or designee in a secure 
facility appropriate for the advised storage conditions. Study treatments that are to be returned 
by the Investigator/staff or have expired must be stored separately from the unused study treatments.  
5.6 Accountability  
The Investigator will be responsible for the dispensing, inventory and accountability of study treatment, exercising accepted  medical and pharmaceutical practices and ensuring that an 
accurate, timely record of the disposition is maintained. The study treatment supplies and inventory must be available for inspection by the designated representatives of the Sponsor upon request. 
Upon receipt of the study medication (RPL554 and placebo), the Investigator or designee will 
inspect the contents and return the completed acknowledgement of receipt. Copies of all study medication inventory  records must be retained for accountability of study products and 
supplies. Accountability must be documented from the time of initial receipt at the study center  
to their final removal from the center .  
RPL554 -CO-204 
Versio n 1.0    
28 May 2018 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 66 Written records must also be maintained to confirm the purpose and reason for any study 
medication disposal, e.g. the amount contaminated, broken, or lost, and the name/signature of 
the personnel responsible for reporting the event.  
At the end of the study, the unused study medication  can be destroyed locally after 
accountability has been verified  and w ritten authorization has been provided by the Sponsor.  
5.7 Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
All patients consented will be assigned a patient identification number upon signing of the informed consent using the following convention: XXX -YYY where XXX is the center  
number and YYY is the patient number (001, 002, etc.). 
Patients  will receive three different treatment combinations in the study ( See Section  5.1).  
Patients will be equally randomized to one of six treatment sequences (using a Latin Square 
design with the three different potential treatment  combinations) before the first study 
treatment administration in Treatment Period 1.  
5.8 Blinding  
Tiotropium/olodaterol will be used in trade dress and will not be blinded.    RPL554 and placebo will be administered double blind. The placebo is the same as the active 
medication (RPL554) except for the omission of the active ingredient. Because a visually 
matching placebo could not be developed, the dosing cup on each nebulizer administered at 
the study center  will be obscured with opaque tape to visually blind the study medication. 
The study personnel pouring the RPL554 and placebo into the nebulizer will therefore not be 
blinded to the study medication  identity. This individual needs to be separate from other study 
center  staff participating in the stud y, and may not reveal the appearance of the nebulizer 
contents to the patient or the blinded study staff. To ensure proper blinding, the Sponsor, Investiga tor (defined as Principal Investigator and all study physicians), all patients and all 
other research personnel (except bioanalytical personnel performing the pharmacokinetic assays and the unblinded study staff) will therefore be blinded to the treatment allocation.  
The blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment would be dictated by knowing 
the treatment status of the patient. If the blind needs to be broken, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor as soon as feasible. The Investigato r may unblind the investigational 
product immediately if he/she feels it is necessary prior to contacting the Sponsor. However, the Investigator should promptly document and explain to the Sponsor any premature 
unblinding. Otherwise, all blinding will be maintained until all queries are resolved and the 
database is locked.    Blind break envelopes will be provided to the site and must be kept in a 
secure access area.  
5.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapies and Medications  
5.9.1 Prior and Concomitant COPD Medications  
All prior therapies for COPD taken in the 3 months prior to the first study treatment 
administration and all concomitant COPD therapies will be recorded in the eCRF, with the medication, dose, route and s tart and stop date(s) and time(s) clearly recorded t o document all 
required washout periods and compliance with the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 66 The following therapies are restricted or prohibited during the study as indicated: 
• Oral therapies for COPD (e.g. oral steroids, theophylline, and roflumilast ) are not allowed 
in the 3 months prior to Screening and throughout the study. Inhaled steroids may continue 
during the study at a maintenance dose 
• Terbutaline is not allowed beginning the day prior to Screening 
• Pulmonary rehabilitation programs should not  be started or completed during participation 
in the study, although an ongoing maintenance program is acceptable in accordance with Exclusion Criterion #9  
• Oxygen therapy and non- selective oral β-blockers are Exclusion Criteria and are not to be 
used at any time during the study 
• Oral mucolytics and ocular β-blockers are allowed  
• All long acting (once or twice daily) bronchodilators (long acting muscarinic anta gonists 
[LAMA], long acting β
2-agonists [LABA], or combinations with an inhaled steroid) are to 
be discontinued prior to the Screening visit and are not allowed during the study. The 
withhold period prior to Screening is as follows: 
o Once daily bronchodilat ors – at least 48 hours prior 
o Twice daily bronchodilators – at least 24 hours prior  
• Patients taking LAMAs and LABAs should be placed on short acting bronchodilators 
(e.g. salbutamol/albuterol, ipratropium or Combivent®) as per the discretion of the 
Invest igator. These can be dosed on a regularly scheduled basis or as needed.  
• Patients taking inhaled corticosteroids may continue their medication only if the dose is stable from at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and is expected to remain stable.  
• Patients taking LABA/inhaled steroid combination products should be prescribed the inhaled steroid at the same or equivalent dose contained in the combination product to allow continuation of steroid use regularly throughout the study whilst stopping the LABA component.  Inhaled steroid medication should be procured via prescription for patients 
requiring its use; it will not be supplied by the Sponsor.  
• No scheduled use of salbutamol/albuterol or ipratropium is allowed during the 3- day 
treatment periods; but may be us ed as a rescue medication (see Section  5.10). 
Salbutamol/albuterol and ipratropium (or Combivent
®) must be withheld for at least 8 hours 
prior to spirometry (per below), and this is to be confirmed in the eCRF at the start of each treatment period. If this withhold is not met, the patient should be rescheduled for a repeat visit within permitted windows. Short acting bronchodilators should be withheld as 
follows: 
o 8 hours prior to pre- reversibility spirometry for Screening  
o 8 hours prior to pre-dose spirometry for Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 
o Post dose: 
- Day 1 until after +12 hours spirometry 
- Day 2 until after + 12 hours spirometry 
- Day 3 until after + 24 hours spirometry (Day 4 morning) 
If following the above requirements provide inadequate symptom control, patients should 
contact the Investigator.

Patients may continue other prescribed non- respiratory therapies during the study that th e 
Investigator considers to neither compromise subject safety nor affect study data. Such other 
prior prescription or non- prescription medications (medication, dose, route, treatment duration 
and indication)  taken 3 months before the first study treatment administration must be recorded 
in order to confirm compliance with the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.  
All concomitant medications must also be documented on the eCRF.  
5.10 Rescue Medications  
Short acting bronchodilators may be used as rescue medication. Rescue medication will be 
sourced by the study center  and dispensed at the Screening visit. Rescue medication use during 
each treatment period must be separately documented on the eCRF (medicat ion, dose, route, 
date and time of each administration). Protocol procedures  must still continue even if rescue 
medication has been taken. Salbutamol/albuterol is to be used for primary rescue use.

The study will consist of the following:  
• Screening will take place in the period between 7 and 14 days prior to the first study 
treatment administration. Screening procedures may be performed as a single visit or more 
than one visit. Since the Holter monitor is to be removed after 24 hours, patients will return one day after placement.  
• Three treatment periods, each 3 days in duration and separated by 7 to 14 days (from last dose of study medication  on Day 3 of each treatment period)  
• An end of study visit between 4 and 10 days after the completion of Treatment Period 3 
Eligible patients may be re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Repeat, rescheduled, and unscheduled visits and procedures are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
The overall sched ule of assessments at each visit is shown in Table 3 and the schedule of 
assessments on each day of each treatment period is shown in Table 4. Assessments are listed 
by visit in Section  1.1 to Section  6.4 and are described in Section  7. 
Post- dose assessments should be performed in the following order: 1) ECG, 2) vital signs, 
3) pharmacokinetic blood sample, 4) spirometry ( prioritized  on the timepoint).

The following restrictions in relation to dosing should be adhered to: 
• Patients should refrain, where possible, from xanthine (chocolate, caffeine containing 
drinks and food), for at least 24 hours before and during all visits. Decaffeinated beverages 
are permitted  
• Patients should refrain from alcohol for 24 hours before and during all visits (including visits for safety laboratory tests) and until all procedures for that study visit are completed  
• Patients must fast (water permitted) from 2 hours pre -dose until 1 hour post-dose  
• Patients should refrain from smoking from 1 hour pre-dose , and at least 1 hour before any 
measurement o f lung function 
• Patients should refrain from strenuous exercise for 72 hours prior to all study visits and should undertake no unaccustomed strenuous exercise from Screening until the end of study visit 
6.2 Screening  
Written informed consent will be obtained b y the Investigator as specified in Section  10.3 prior 
to any study related procedures being performed. This typically will need to be performed pri or 
to the Screening visit to allow for discontinuation of any prohibited medications (see Section  5.9). Screening procedures may be performed over more than 1 day.   
Patients will be screened to determine eligibility against the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria between 7  and 14 days before the first dose of study treatment. There are no fasting 
requirements for the Screening visit. Patients must observe the medication restrictions described in Section  5.9.1, and other restrictions described in Section 1.1To account for diurnal 
variability in pulmonary function, the Screening visit is to take place in the morning. 
The following assessments will be performed, generally in the order indicated (to the extent 
feasible):  
• Obtain informed consent (if not done prior to Screening) 
• Recording of demographic information, including height and weight 
• Recording of medical/surgical and disease history

7.1 Demographics, Baseline Characteristics and Eligibility Assessments  
Safety assessments (laboratory safety assessments, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG and physical 
examination) will be performed at Screening as part of the eligibility assessment as described 
in Section   7.1.1 to Section  7.4.6. 
7.1.1 Demographic Variables 
Demographic variables, including date of birth, sex, height, weight, BMI (weight  [kg]/height [m]
2), race and smoking status will be collected at Screening.  
7.1.2 Medical and Disease History  
All active medical conditions and all surgeries will be recorded at Screening. Disease history, including date of diagnosis will also be recorded.  
7.1.3 Reversibility Test 
Reversibility in response to salbutamol/albuterol will be assessed at Screening as an eligibility 
measure. Spirometry (FEV
1 and FVC) assessment before and after two puffs (200 µg) of 
salbutamol/albuterol and two puffs (40 µg) of ipratropium, each administered using a pMDI 
will be performed.  
Three technically acceptable measurements should be made and recorded in the eCRF. Spirometry assessments may be performed up to eight times to obtain three acceptable readings according to ATS guidelines (Miller et al, 2005). The highest reading from each assessment 
will be used for calculation of predicted values and increase from baseline.  
The following must be confirmed for inclusion: 
• Post-bronchodilator FEV
1/FVC ratio of ≤0.70 
• Post-bronchodilator FEV 1 ≥30 % and ≤70% of predicted normal* 
• Demonstrates ≥150 mL increase from pre-bronchodilator FEV 1  
*National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III (Hankinson et al, 1999) 
will be used as a reference for normal predicted values.  
7.1.4 Screening Laboratory Assessments  
At Screening, blood samples will be taken and tested at the laboratory for human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology. Note: Patien ts who received a 
hepatitis B vaccination and are positive for hepatitis B surface antibody, but are negative for 
both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody, do not need to be excluded from the study. 
A chest X -ray (post -anterior) must be performed at Screening or in the 12 months prior to 
Screening.  
An alcohol breath test will be performed by the study center  at Screening.  
Unscheduled and/or repeat testing may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.

during the study recorded as described in Section 5.9.1.  
Other prior medications will be separately recorded at Screening and co ncomitant use during 
the study recorded as described in Section  5.9.2. 
7.1.6 Eligibility Check  
Patients will be confirmed as eligible according to the In clusion and Exclusion Criteria from 
assessments made at Screening with a final check of all results pre- dose in Treatment Period  1. 
7.2 Efficacy/ Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
7.2.1 Pulmonary Function Tests  
Spirometry (FEV 1 and FVC) will be performed at Screening, the end of study visit and the 
following time points in each treatment period:  
• Day 1: 1 hour and immediately pre-dose; 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 
hours post-dose 
• Day 2: pre-dose; 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3 4 hours and 12 hours post-dose 
• Day 3: pre -dose; 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 23 and 24 hours 
post-dose. 
Post- dose measurements will be taken in relation to the morning dose of tiotropium/olodaterol 
and RPL554 or placebo. The 12-hour measurement will therefore be taken pre- dose before the 
evening dose of RPL554 or placebo. The 24-hour measurement on Day 3 will be taken in the 
morning on Day 4 prior to discharge from the study center . 
Spirometry assessments will be made in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines 
(Miller  et al, 2005). At all timepoints, three technically acceptable measurements should be 
made and recorded. Spirometry assessments may be performed up to eight times to obtain three acceptable readings. The highest F EV
1 and FVC readings from each assessment will be used 
for analysis even if the FEV 1 and FVC values come from two different forced exhalations. 
7.2.2 Whole Body Plethysmography 
Whole body plethysmography training and assessment for ability to perform the procedure will be conducted at Screening. 
Whole body plethysmography will be performed pre-dose and 1.25 hours post-dose on Day 1, 
and pre -dose and 1.25, 8.25 and 12.25 hours post- dose on Day 3 of each treatment period.  
Assessments will be made in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines , including the use of 
appropriate quality control measures to minimize  data variability and error  (Wanger et al, 2005; 
see Quality Control section for plethysmography on pp. 514-515).  
Patients  will be placed on a body box for plethysmographic determination of lung volumes, to 
include RV and  FRC. Additionally, measurements will be made of sG
aw. 
 
7.2.3 Dyspnea  Scale 
An 11-point Likert scale will be utilized , which will be anchored from 0: “no shortness  of 
breath ” to 10: “the worst shortness of breath that you can imagine”  (Davis et al., 2006). This 
RPL554 -CO-204 
Versio n 1.0    
28 May 2018

It will be administered on Day 1 pre -dose and 5, 15, and 30 minutes post -dose; and on Day 3 
pre-dose and 5, 15, 30 minutes and 24 hours post-dose. 
7.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on samples taken from patients on Day 3 of each 
treatment period. Blood samples (4 mL at each time point) will be collected at the following 
timepoints: pre -dose, 5, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours post-dose.  
Samples will be collected by venipuncture or via indwelling cannula in the forearm into lithium 
heparin tubes and will be im mediately chilled (ice bath). The blood will be centrifuged within 
15 minutes of collection. The plasma will be separated in a refrigerated centrifuge (about 4°C) at 1100g for 15 minutes and transferred into polypropylene tubes. After each blood collection, the plasma will be dispensed into two aliquots. After appropriate labelling, the plasma samples will be stored at, or below -20°C. The plasma samples will then be transported in dry ice to an external laboratory where they will be stored at or below -20°C until they are submitted for 
analysis with a validated method. Analysis will be performed by a central laboratory. 
7.4 Safety Assessments 
7.4.1 Adverse Events  
7.4.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
An adverse event  is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a patient, or worsening 
in a patient, during a clinical study, whether or not considered related to the study medication. 
An adverse event may be any of the following: 
• A new illness  
• An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a 
concomitant illness  
• Unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study medication  
• A combination of one or more of the above factors 
No causal relationship with the study medication is implied by the use of the term “adverse event.” An exacerbation of a pre -existing condition or illness is defined as a more frequent 
occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre- existing condition or illness during the 
study. Planned or elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre -existing conditions that have 
not worsened are not adverse events. However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an adverse event (if the event fits the serious criteria, such as an extended hospitalization , it will be considered to be serious). Conditions leading to unplanned surgical 
procedures may be adverse events.  
An adverse reaction is defined as all untoward and unintended responses to study medication 
related to any dose administered. 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse experience that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, OR  
RPL554 -CO-204 
Versio n 1.0    
28 May 2018 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 66 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other medical events*  
*Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization  may be considered a SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgement, they 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. 
An unexpected adverse reaction  is an adverse reaction in which the nature or severity of which 
is not consistent with the I nvestigator Brochure. 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  (SUSAR) is any suspected adverse reaction 
related to the study medication  that is both unexpected and serious. 
Standard procedures for emergency care should be followed for any individual adverse event, 
whenever clinically needed (decision to be taken by the Investigator). 
7.4.1.2 Recording and Assessing Adverse Events  
All adverse events, whether reported spontaneously by the patient, in response to open 
questioning on treatment days or observed by the Investigator or his/her staff, will be recorded 
from informed consent until the end of study visit. The start and stop time will be recorded and adverse events will be assessed by the Investigator for the following:  
7.4.1.2.1 Severity  
Mild:   Resolved without treatment  
Moderate:  Resolved or was tolerated with specific treatment without affecting study 
activities  
Severe:  Did not resolve or was not tolerated with treatment 
7.4.1.2.2 Chronicity 
Single occasion: Single event with limited duration  
Intermittent:  Several epi sodes of an event, each of limited duration 
Persistent:  Event which remained indefinitely  
7.4.1.2.3 Causality 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between the study medication and each adverse event, and answer "yes" or "no" to the question, "Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study medication?"
 
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for study procedures, additional study medication, and other medication. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship is implied as "yes". 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Section 14.3. 
7.4.1.2.4 Action and Outcome 
• Action taken with study medication (none, study medication stopped, study medication 
temporarily interrupted)  
RPL554 -CO-204 
Versio n 1.0    
28 May 2018 
Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 66 • Other actions (none, concomitant medication, study discontinuation, hospitalization , other)  
• The outcome and date of outcome according to the following definitions: 
- Recovered or resolved (adverse event disappeared)  
- Recovering or resolving (patient is recovering)  
- Not recovered or not resolved (adverse event remains without signs of 
improvement) 
- Recovered or resolved with sequelae (adverse event has resulted in permanent 
disability or incapacity)  
- Fatal  
- Unknown (only applicable if patient has been lost to follow-up) 
• Seriousness (yes or no) 
7.4.1.3 Reporting Procedure for SAEs 
The Investigator must report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as practical, but in call cases 
within 24 hours of awareness. Any fatal SAEs notified in the 28-day period after the last dose 
of study drug must also be reported 
SUSARs will be determined by the  Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
SAEs will be reported to the ethics committee(s) /institutional review board(s)  and regulatory 
authority( is) according to local requirements.  
All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation  has been 
reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical procedures 
as indicated, and/or referral to the patient’s general physician or a medical specialist.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that an y necessary additional therapeutic 
measures and follow-up procedures are performed. 
7.4.2 Pregnancy  
All female patients of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at Screening. 
Samples will be taken and handled according to the laboratory manual and analyzed  at an 
approved central laboratory. 
Urine pregnancy tests will also be performed by the study center  at Screening (confirmed to be 
negative prior to the chest X -ray), on Day 1 of each treatment period and at the end of study 
visit.  
Should a fem ale patient become pregnant , or if a male patient father s a child during the study 
or in the 30 days after the end of the study , the Investigator  must be informed  immediately. 
The Investigator will report this information to the Sponsor within 7 days of aw areness. The 
Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to ascertain the progress and outcome of the 
pregnancy. If the outcome meets the criteria for immediate classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth 
defect), the Investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. 
7.4.3 Laboratory Safety Assessments 
In addition to the laboratory tests detailed in Section 7.4.3.1 to Section  7.4.3.3, unscheduled 
and/or repeat testing may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. Any additional 
laboratory results will also be merged into the final database. Laboratory results will be

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 66 provided to the Investigator for each patient and each visit. The Investigator should assign 
whether each abnormal result is not clinically significant or a clinically significant by manually 
annotating a print out of the results.  
Samples will be taken and handled according to the laboratory manual and analyzed  at an 
approved central laboratory. 
7.4.3.1 Hematology  
The following will be measured at Screening, on Day 4 of each treatment period and at the end 
of study visit: Hemoglobin , hematocrit , total white cell count, leukocyte differential count and 
platelet count.  
At each timepoint, a sample of venous blood will be collected in a collection tube containing 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA).  
7.4.3.2 Biochemistry  
The following will be measured at Screening, on Day 4 of each treatment period and at the end of study visit : creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
alanine transaminase, gamma -GT, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, thyroid stimulating 
hormone, triiodothyronine and thyroxine, glucose, potassium, sodium  and calcium .  
Additionally, follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH)  will be measured at Screening, where 
appropriate, to confirm post-menopausal status.  
At each timepoint, a sample of venous blood will be collected in a vacutainer collection tube.  
7.4.3.3 Urinalysis  
A midstream ur ine sample will be collected in a sterile container at Screening and at the end of 
study visit. The following will be tested: leu cocytes, blood, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, 
protein and glucose.  
If urinalysis on Dipstick is positive for leucocytes and/or blood/ hemoglobin , a microscopic 
examination including erythrocytes, leucocytes, bacteria, casts, epithelial cells and crystals will 
be performed.  
7.4.4 Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at Screening, the end of study visit and the following time points in each treatment period:  
• Day 1: pre-dose; 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours post-dose  
• Day 2: pre-dose; 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 12 hours post-dose 
• Day 3; pre-dose; 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose 
Post- dose measurements will be taken in relation to the morning dose of tiotropium/olodaterol 
and RPL554 or placebo. The 12-hour measurement will therefore be taken pre- dose before the 
evening dose of RPL554 or placebo. The 24-hour measurement on Day 3 will be  taken in the 
morning on Day 4 prior to discharge from the study center . 
At each timepoint, supine vital signs will be assessed whilst the patient has been at rest for at least 5 minutes.

skin, thyroid gland, neurological system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, abdomen 
[liver and spleen], lymph nodes and extremities)  will be performed at Screening. Results will 
be recorded in the eCR F as normal, abnormal not clinically significant or abnormal clinically 
significant and abnormal results described. The full physical examination will be repeated at the end of study visit, and any changes only recorded. 
A brief physical examination, inclu ding assessments of the skin, respiratory system, 
cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). will be performed pre -dose on Day 1 
and prior to discharge from the study center  on Day 4. 
7.4.6 12-Lead ECG  
12-lead ECGs will be performed at Screening, the  end of study visit and the following time 
points in each treatment period: 
• Day 1: pre-dose and 2 and 4 hours post-dose 
• Day 2: pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose 
• Day 3: pre-dose and 2 and 24 hours post- morning dose  
Post- dose measurements will be taken in relat ion to the morning dose of tiotropium/olodaterol 
and RPL554 or placebo. The 24-hour measurement at the end of each treatment period will be 
taken in the morning on Day 4 prior to discharge from the study center . 
Each 12 -lead ECG should be taken after at le ast 5 minutes in the supine position. An overall 
assessment (normal, abnormal not clinically significant or abnormal clinically significant) will be recorded in the eCRF by the Investigator.  
Each 12 -lead ECG recording will be sent to a central vendor for interpretation.  
7.4.7 Holter Monitoring  
12-lead Holter monitors will be used to perform 24-hour Holter monitoring. A Holter monitor 
will be placed at Screening . Monitoring will be ambulatory and will be recorded as an 
outpatient and the monitor will be removed at the study center  after 24 hours. The Screening 
Holter report must have a minimum of 18  hours recording that is evaluable for rhythm analysis

The Sponsor, or its designee may conduct a quality assurance audit. An inspection of this study 
may also be carried out by regulatory authorities at their discretion. Such audits or inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his time and the time of his staff to the auditor or inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
8.2 Monitoring  and Source Document Verification  
The study will be monitored by a monitor approved by the Sponsor. During these visits, all 
procedures will be monitored for compliance with the protocol. Source documents will be reviewed and compared with the data entries in the eCRFs to ensure consistency.  The Sponsor 
will ensure that the study is monitored in accordance with the principles of ICH GCP. The frequency of monitoring visits will be determined, in part, by the rate of patient recruitment.  
The following are examples of items that will be reviewed at these visits: 
• Compliance with the protocol 
• Consent procedure 
• Source documents 
• Adverse event procedures 
• Storage and accountability of materials  
The monitoring visits also provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to ensure that timely 
patient accrual and the other Investigator’s obligations and all applicable requirements are being fulfilled. 
The Investigator must permit the study monitor, the ethics committee, the Sponsor’s auditors 
and representatives from regulatory authorities direct access to all source documents for confirmation of the accuracy and reliability of data contained within the  eCRFs (source 
document verification). Patient confidentiality will be protected at all times.  
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activities of a clinical investigation, including medical notes. All source documents produced in this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection. The original signed informed consent form for each patient will be retained by the Investigator and the second signed original given to the patient.  
Source data include, but is not limited to, the following and will be identified in a source data 
location log: 
• Screening/enrolment log  
• Medical notes - which should be updated after each visit to include visit dates, medical 
history, diagnosis of COPD, concomitant medication, any clinically relevant findings of 
clinical examinations or clinically relevant adverse events/medication changes, SAEs and 
information on patient withdrawal

The study monitor will carry out source document verification at regular intervals. This is an 
essential element of quality control, as it allows the rectification of transcription errors and omissions.  
8.3 Data Management and Coding  
Data for each patient will be recorded in an e CRF . Data collection must be completed for each 
patient  who signs an informed consent form and receives at least one dose of study medication . 
eCRFs will be designed and produced by the Sponsor or designee and should be completed in accordance with instructions. The Investigator is responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate medical records from which accurate information will be transcribed directly into the eCRFs using a secure internet  connection. The eCRFs should be filled out completely by the 
Investigator or designee as stated on the delegation of responsibilities form. The eCRF system will be Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations 21 Part 11 compliant. 
The eCRFs must be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator. 
Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. Validation 
includes, but is not limited to, validity checks (e.g. range checks), consistency checks and customized  checks (logical checks between variables to ensure that study data are accurately 
reported) for eCRF data and external data. A majority of edit checks will be triggered during 
data entry and will therefore facilitate efficient ‘point of entry’ data cleanin g.  
Data management personnel will perform both manual eCRF review and review of additional electronic edit checks to ensure that the data are complete, consistent and reasonable. The electronic edit checks will run continually throughout the course of the  study and the issues 
will be reviewed manually online to determine what action needs to be taken. 
Manual queries may be added to the system by clinical data management or study monitor. 
Clinical data managers and study monitors are able to remotely and pr oactively monitor the 
patient  eCRFs to improve data quality. 
External data ( laboratory safety , Holter, 12 -lead ECG and pharmacokinetic  data) will be 
transferred electronically into the study database. Discrepancies will be queried to the site and/or the la boratory until the electronic data and the database are reconciled.  
All updates to queried data will be made by authorized study center  personnel only and all 
modifications to the database will be recorded in an audit trail. Once all the queries have been  
resolved, eCRFs will be locked by password protection. Any changes to locked eCRFs will be approved by the Investigator. 
Once the full set of eCRFs have been completed and locked, the Sponsor will authorize 
database lock and all electronic data will be sent to the designated statistician for analysis.  
Subsequent changes to the database will then only be made only by written agreement of the 
Sponsor. 
Adverse events will be coded from the verbatim description (Investigator term) using the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) ([specify version] or later). Prior and

9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A detailed plan describing 
the analyses to be conducted will be defined before the first patient is enrolled and will include 
the determination of rules for major and minor protocol deviations. Any deviation from the analysis specified in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan  will be detailed and justified in 
the clinical study report.  
9.2 Populations to be Analyzed  
Allocation of patients to the analysis populations (and whether any patients or specific data from a patient will be excluded) will be determined at the pre -database lock meeting.  
The full analysis set will consist of all randomized patients with sufficient data collected after 
intake of study treatment to compute the pharmacodynamic parameters on at least two treatment periods. A completer analysis set will consist of  all randomized patients that 
complete all treatment period s. 
The safety set will consist of all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study 
treatment during at least one visit.  
The pharmacokinetic data set will consist of all randomized patie nts with blood sampling 
performed after at least one dose of RPL544 and with data sufficient to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters.  
9.3 Study Endpoints   
9.3.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is peak FEV
1 (measured in first 4 hours after morning dosing). This  will 
be measured after dosing on Day 3. 
The primary comparisons are RPL554 6mg + tiotropium/olodaterol vs RPL554 placebo + 
tiotropium/olodaterol, followed by RPL554 1.5 mg + tiotropium/olodaterol vs RPL554 placebo + tiotropium/olodaterol.

1 on Day 4 (mean of -1 and 0 time prior to dosing) 
• Determination of AUC 0-4h FEV 1 after morning dosing on Day 3 
• Peak FEV 1 (measured in first 4 hours after dosing) and AUC 0-12h FEV 1. These will be 
measured after dosing on Day 1  
• Change from baseline in AUC 0-12h FEV 1 measured on Day 3 
• Change from pre-evening dose FEV 1 on Day 3 (peak over 4 hours) 
• Determination of onset of action (>10% increase in FEV 1, from pre -first dose, censored 
at 120 minutes) on Day 1 
• RV, FRC and sG aw at 1.25 hours on Day 1 and 1.25, 8.25 and 12.25 hours after dosing

9.4 Statistical Methods  
In general, unless stated otherwise, continuous variables will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics (number of patients, mean, standard devi ation, median, minimum and maximum 
values) and for categorical (nominal) variables, the number and percentage of patients will be 
used.  
All hypothesis testing will be done using two- sided alternative hypotheses. P -values less than 
5% will be considered st atistically significant.  
9.4.1 Patient Disposition  
The number of patients enrolled, randomized, completed or withdrawn (with reason for 
withdrawal) will be summarized . 
9.4.2 Protocol Deviations 
All protocol deviations collected will be divided into critical, major or  minor categories. Prior 
to database lock protocol deviations will be reviewed and consequences for inclusion of 
patients in various analysis population sets determined and documented. 
9.4.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseli ne characteristics (including pre - and post -bronchodilator FEV 1 [both 
in liters  and in percentage of predicted normal], post -bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC, FEV 1 
reversibility, duration of COPD [time since diagnosis], smoking habits including number of 
pack years , number of patients taking COPD medications by therapeutic class) will be listed 
and summarized  appropriately.  
Medical history, prior and concomitant medications, viral serology results, alcohol breath test results, pregnancy test results from females an d chest X- ray findings will be listed.  
9.4.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance  
All administration of study treatment will be done at the clinic under supervision of the study staff; therefore, no formal analysis of compliance will be performed. The RPL 554 exposure 
will be estimated based on residual volume in the nebulizer cup.

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 66 9.4.5 Efficacy/Pharmacodynamics  
FEV 1 and FVC will be summarized  as actual and change from baseline using descriptive 
statistics over time.  
The peak effect on FEV 1 during these time intervals will be computed as the maximum value 
in the 4 hours after dosing. The average effect will be calculated as the AUC divided by the 
length of the time interval of interest. For analysis, the peak, average and trough FEV 1 will be  
divided by the pre-dose Day 1 baseline value.  
Computed pharmacodynamic parameters for FEV 1 will be compared between the three study 
treatments using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with fixed factors for treatment, 
period and patient, and using the pre-dose Day 1 baseline value as a covariate. FEV 1 will be 
analyzed  using multiplicative models, which means that data (dependent and baseline) are 
logged prior to analysis and the result then transformed back to the linear scale giving treatment differences as ratios of geometric means.  
Primarily the combination RPL554+tiotropium/olodaterol w ill be compared to tiotropium/  
olodaterol alone for each of the two doses of RPL554. Results of the comparisons will be expressed as the mean geometric ratio with 95% confidence intervals and associated, 2-sided, p-value.  
Onset of action will be summarize d by treatment and a Kaplan -Meier plot illustrating time to 
onset constructed. Outcomes from the whole body plethysmography at 1.25 hours post -dose on Day 1 and 1.25, 
8.25 and 12.25 hours post -dose on Day 3 will be compared in the same way as FEV
1 using 
multiplicative ANOVA models. The baseline of the visit (pre -first dose in a treatment period) 
will be used as covariate in these models.  
The use of rescue medication during the study visits will be summarized  by treatment, and, if 
appropriate, a Kaplan -Meier  plot illustrating time to first use of rescue constructed.  
9.4.6 Pharmacokinetics  
The following steady state pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from plasma 
concentrations of RPL554 using standard non- compartmental methods.  
• AUC 0-12h represent s the area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 to 12 hours 
after dose on Day 3. The AUC 0-12h value in indicative of the steady state AUC Ƭ for a twice 
daily dosage regimen of RPL554 for the study cohort 
• Cmax denotes the highest plasma concentration measured 
• tmax denotes the time point corresponding to C max 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized  by dose level using descriptive statistics (n, 
geometric mean, coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, maximu m and median for AUC 
parameters, C max, n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median for 
tmax).  
9.4.7 Safety  
Safety data including safety laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG and Holter parameters, vital signs 
and physical examinations, will be summarized  by treatment group and time point of collection, 
when appropriate. For continuous variables, the change from baseline (pre -dose at each 
treatment period) to each post -dose time point will also be calculated and summarized . Data 
will further be illustrated by shift tables (showing changes from low/normal/high) and shift

Coded adverse event terms will be presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term and summarized  by treatment group. A summary table by treatment group with total number 
and number of patients with adverse events, SAEs, adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment, causally related adverse events and severe adverse events will be produced. Further, SAEs, causally related adverse events and adverse event of each intensity will be 
summarized  by SOC and preferred term.   
9.4.8 Handling of Withdrawals or Missing Data 
Patients withdra wn after only one treatment period will not be included in the efficacy analyses. 
Imputation of data for calculation of average (AUC) effects for FEV
1 will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan. No other imputation of missing data will be performed . 
All available data from all dosed patients who have received study treatment will be listed and summarized . Any unscheduled or unplanned readings will be presented within the patient 
listings, but only the scheduled readings will be used in any summaries . If a visit is rescheduled 
due to variability in FEV
1 or other reason, the rescheduled visit will be listed and summarized  
as the valid visit.  
9.4.9 Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analysis is planned for the study. 
9.5 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a complete block three- way crossover study. Assuming a residual CV of 6% for peak 
FEV 1, 70 patients will give an 80% power to detect a pairwise difference in peak FEV 1 of 5.1%. 
Assuming a mean baseline FEV 1 of 1.3 liters  this will correspond to a d ifference of about 
50 mL.

10.1 Guidelines  
The study will be performed in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the principles outlined 
in the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), the protocol and applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.2 Ethics and Regulatory Approval 
The Sponsor will supply all background data necessary to enable submission to the appropriate 
ethics committee s and regulatory authorit ies. The study will not commence before formal 
ethical and regulatory approvals have been granted. 
All changes or revisions of this protocol will be documented. The reason for the amendment 
will be stated. The Sponsor will ensure ethical and regulatory approval is obtained for all 
substantial amendments to the original approved documents. 
10.3 Informed Conse nt Process  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain written informed consent from patients. All 
consent documentation must be in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP. Each patient is requested to sign and date the informed consent f orm after (s)he has received and 
read the patient information sheet and received an explanation of what the study involves, including but not limited to: the objectives, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences and the patient’s rights and responsibilities. Patients will be given adequate time to evaluate the information given to them before signing the informed consent form. 
One original of the signed informed consent form must remain on file and must be available 
for verification by the study monitor at any time. A second original of the informed consent form plus the patient information sheet must be given to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative.  
10.4 Patient Confidentiality  
Data collected during this study may be used to support the development, registration or marketing of the study medication . The Sponsor will control all data collected during the study  
and will abide by the European Union Directive on Data Privacy concerning the processing and use of patient’s personal data. For  the purpose of data privacy legislation, the Sponsor will 
be the data controller.  
After patients have consented to take part in the study , their medical records and the data 
collected during the study will be reviewed by the Sponsor and/or its representat ives. These 
records and data may, in addition, be reviewed by the following: independent auditors who validate the data on behalf of the Sponsor; regulatory authorities and the ethics committee which gave its approval for this study to proceed. 
Although pa tients will be known by a unique number, their initials will also be collected and 
used to assist the Investigator to reconcile data clarification forms, for example, that the results 
of study assessments are assigned to the correct patient. The results of  this study containing the 
unique number, but not the patient’s initials and relevant medical information may be recorded and transferred to and used in other countries throughout the world, which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the European Union. The purpose of any such transfer would be to support regulatory submissions made by the Sponsor in such countries.

14.1 Birth Control Methods Fo r Women of Childbearing Potential Which May 
Be Considered As Highly Effective 
(Adapted from the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group, Heads of Medicines Agencies, 2014)  
 
I. Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing pot ential : 
1. Premenopausal female with one of the following: 
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Documentation can come from the study center  staff’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
2. Premenarchal  
3. Postmenopausal female  
Females who are postmenopausal (age -related amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months and 
increased FSH  >40 mIU/mL), or who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary to confirm 
postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening. 
Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception 
methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
II. Methods  
For the purpose of this guidance, methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per  
year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control  
methods. Such methods include: 
• Combined ( oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception  associated with 
inhibition of ovulation: 
- Oral 
- Intravaginal 
- Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation

Verona Pharma plc  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 66 14.3 Interpreting Adverse Event Causality   
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable possibility” 
that an adverse event may have been caused by the study medication.  
• Time Course. Exposure to suspect study medication. Has the subject actually received the suspect study medication? Did the adverse event occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect study medication?  
• Consistency with known study medication profile. Was the adverse event consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect study medication (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? OR Could the adverse event be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?  
• Dechallenge experience. Did the adverse event resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect study medication? 
• No alternative cause. The adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors 
• Rechallenge experience. Did the adverse event reoccur if the suspected study medication 
was reintroduced after having been stopped Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory 
investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship? 
A "reasonable possibility" could be considered to exist for a n adverse event where one or more 
of these factors exist.  
In contrast, there would not be a "reasonable possibility" of causality if none of the above criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course, but any dechallenge ( if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the adverse events.  
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the study medication? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a "reasonable possibility" of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect s hould be classified 
as no reasonable possibility.

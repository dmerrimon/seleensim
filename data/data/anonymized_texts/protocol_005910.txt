of ZELTIQ. 1. Introduction   
1.1. Background  
 
Fat reduction and body contouring procedures, which include invasive, minimally -
invasive, and non -invasive procedures, have become increasingly popular aesthetic 
procedures. Patients who are obese and do not have specific  fat bulges but require 
significant fat reduction to achieve aesthetic results are candidates for invasive and 
minimally -invasive procedures, such as liposuction and laser -assisted liposuction. 
Although effective at reducing fat, these invasive and minimally -invasive procedures 
involve significant patient pain, expense, downtime, and the risks typically associated with 
surgical procedures. As a result, patients who do not require significant fat reduction to 
achieve meaningful aesthetic results typically seek non -invasive fat reduction and body 
contouring procedures to avoid the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated 
with invasive and minimally -invasive procedures.  
 
ZELTIQ Aesthetics has  developed and commercialized a technology to non -invasively 
reduce subcutaneous fat.  The technology utilizes the sensitivity of fat cells to cold injury 
in order to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue without affecting the skin or other 
surrounding tissue s. Termed cryolipolysis, this technology enables a non -invasive 
alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through cellular apoptosis. The CoolSculpting 
System, which is cleared for use in the United States  for fat layer reduction through cold -
assisted lip olysis, has been clinically proven to reduce fat bulges, a llowing patients to 
achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, 
and risks associated with existing  invasive and minimally -invasive procedures.   
 
Allergan commercialized a first in class, injectable drug  called KYBELLA® (deoxycholic 
acid), indicated for improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe convexity or 
fullness associated with submental fat in adults .  Administrations are given at intervals of 
no less than 4 weeks until the desired result is achieved, up to a maximum of 6 treatment 
sessions.  The total dose of KYBELLA® administered in each treatment session and the 
overall number of treatments are both t ailored to the individual patient based on the 
amount and distribution of SMF as well as the patient’s desired result . This minima lly 
invasive procedure is another treatment option for patients looking to reduce the double -
chin appearance.   
 
Both CoolS culpting and KYBELLA® are important treatment option s for aesthetically -
minded patients who are interested in reducing submental fat using minimally invasive 
interventions . 
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous fat

of ZELTIQ. reduction in the submental area  in subjects initially with extreme submental fullness  
(Grade 4)  based on the Clinician Reported -Submental Fat Rating Scale ( CR-SMFRS), 
using sequential treatments of CoolSculpting (with the CoolMini applicator ) and 
KYBELLA®.  
 
 
 
  
 
In this study, subjects will receive two CoolSculpting treatments sessions each consisting 
of one cooling cycle with CoolMini, spaced 6 weeks apart, followed by at least one and up 
to two (2) KYBELLA® treatment sessions 6 weeks post the final CoolMini treatment, 
spaced 4-7 weeks apart.   
 
After the completion of all treatment  visits, subjects will be followed for 12 weeks post -
final treatment.  Safety information will be collected at study visits .  Primary efficacy 
assessment will be evaluated at 12 -weeks post -final treatment .   
 
Results from this clinic al trial will be used to provide feasibility data on the use of both 
CoolSculpting and KYBELLA® treatments sequentially  to improve the treatment 
approach and availability for extreme submental fullness.

• At the discretion of the investigator, to pical or local anesthesia ( e.g., topical  or 
injectable lidocaine preparations without epinephrine, ice) may be applied in the 
planned treatment area and any medications will be recorded on the appropriate 
case report form (CRF).  
 
•   
 
 A grid, 
specifically developed to be applied to  the treatment area to guide the placement of 
injections , will be used.  
 
• For each KYBELLA® injection, the investigator will palpate the treatment area to 
determine the approximate thickness of the targeted SMF and inject KYBELLA® 
into fat tissue at a dept h of approximately mid -way into the SMF.  
 
• If at any time resistance is met as the needle is inserted, indicating the possibility 
of contact with fascial or nonfat tissue, the needle will be withdrawn to an 
appropriate depth before the injection is given.  
 
• Upon needle withdrawal, pressure will be applied to each injection site as 
necessary to minimize bleeding; an adhesive dressing may be applied.  Upon 
completion of the injections, the area may be gently massaged.  
 
• At each treatment session, the investigato r will determine the number and locations 
of injections.  He or she will evaluate each planned injection location to avoid sites  
for which an injection may not be appropriate (e.g., nodule formation, significant 
residual inflammation, other adverse event t hat warrants a delay, or lack of SMF).  
 
• 
 
 
Subjects may be discharged from the research facility approximately 3 0 minutes after 
KYBELLA® is administered, provided it is medically appropriate to do so.  
 
At no time is the dilution of KYBELLA® permitted.

of ZELTIQ. 2.13.2. Clinician Evaluation using CR -SMFRS 
The primary measure will be clinician  live assessment of the patient’s 
severity of submental fat as determined by the CR -SMFRS (Table 3).   
The CR-SMFRS score will be based on the investigator’s clinical evalu ation 
of the subject, including  palpation of the chin and neck area; anterior, 
oblique, and profile views of the chin and neck; and  observation of pronation, 
supination, and lateral movement of the head. The score will be  determined 
using the rating scale definitions and  the representative photographs 
associated with  each score. The final  score will be determined while the 
subject’s head is in the Frankfort plane  posture as described in the CR -
SMFRS. The score will be recorded a s a whole number.

A series of photos of the treatment areas will be obtained at the pre-
treatment , prior to first K YBELLA® injection (Treatment visit 3)  and final 
follow-up visits, using custom standardized setup, lighting, and camera 
settings to ensure consistency. All photographs will be captured at fixed 
angles and posture  (Frankfort plane) . Using a series of pre -determine d 
markings on the floor, the photographer will position the camera at the pre -
determined reference points to ensure that the reproduction ratio and focal

of ZELTIQ. distance are maintained throughout the image series during the study.   During 
follow-up visits, the ph otographer will re -align subjects by referencing 
baseline images.   
2.13.4. Ultrasound Measurements   
Ultrasounds will be performed  by a qualified representative of the sponsor.    
 
After treatment sites have been identified, the ultrasound measurement 
locations wil l be marked.  Up to 3 measurement locations will be marked on 
the intended treatment area .  A template may be created prior to treatment to 
mark the locations for ultrasound measurements.  This template 
(transparency) will be created using external landmar ks (e.g., skin 
imperfections) as reference points, identifying the peak of the bulge and the 
locations for ultrasound measurements .  At follow -up visits, the template will 
be used to mark the locations for ultras ound measurements. A SonoSite  
TITAN® ultrasound system (or equivalent approved by Sponsor ) will be used 
in this study.  A high frequency linear transducer array (L38/10 -5: 38-mm 
broadband, 10 -5 MHz, optimized for breast, small parts, interventional, 
musculoskeletal and vascular imaging)  provides sufficient spatial resolution 
to visualize anatomical features for image plane alignment for fat layer 
measurement.  Stored images will be transferred to an off -line PC based 
image analysis tool for fat layer measurements.  These files will be stored by 
the Sponsor  and indexed by subject identifier.  Standardized techniques for 
obtaining images will be used to ensure consistency throughout the study.  
 
The individual (s) analyzing the images will b e presented with two series  of 
images for each measureme nt site, the pre-treatment and the final post-
treatment series, and asked to measure the depth of fat layer in each image.  
The order in which the images are presented will be randomized by subject .    
2.13.5. Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS)   
Subject’s assessment of ov erall satisfaction with their face and chin using the 
SSRS will be obtained at Screening (baseline score), at Treatment Visit 3 
(prior to first KYBELLA® treatment) and at the final 12 -week follow -up 
visit.   
SSRS is a subject self -rating scale, scored on a 7 -point scale with  
0=extremely dissatisfied, 1=di ssatisfied, 2=slightly dissatisfied, 3=neither 
satisfied not dissatisfied, 4=slightly satisfied, 5=satisfied, and 6=extremely 
satisfied.

The objective of this study is to e valuate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous fat layer 
reduction in the submental area on subjects with extreme submental fullness defined by 
the CR-SMFRS as Grade 4 using CoolSculpting and KYBELLA® in sequence. 
2.14.1. Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoint s of the study will be defined as follows : 
• Safety endpoint:  incidence of device, drug or procedure -related adverse  
events.   
 
• Efficacy endpoint:  
1. The reduction, from baseline  (CR-SMFRS =4)  to final follow -up, 
of submental fat (SMF) as assessed by the proportion of subjects who 
have at least a 1 -grade improvement on the Clinician Reported Submental 
Fat Rating Scale ( CR-SMFRS), and 
 
2. The reduction, from baseline  (CR-SMFRS=4)  to final follow -up, 
of SMF as assessed by the proportion of subjects who have at least a 2 -
grade improvement on the CR-SMFRS. 
 
2.14.2. Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints in the study are as follows:  
1. Reduction in fat layer thickness, as measured by ultrasound at Week 
12 post-final treatment . 
2. Subject satisfaction as assessed by Subject Self -Rating Scale scores .  
 
2.15. Statistical Analysis Plan  
2.15.1. Statistical Methods: Overall Plan  
Data will be summarized based on the nature of the data.  Dichotomous (e.g. , 
gender, independent photographic review) and ordinal (e.g. , Fitzpatrick Skin 
type) data will be tabulated by cat egory.  The mean, standard deviation , 
maximum , and minimum will be tabulated for continuous data (e.g. , age, fat 
thickness).  The significance level will be two -sided 0.05 for all statistical 
tests.

Scale 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in subcutaneous fat layer  in the 
submental area  as measured between the  baseline and final post-treatment 
visit CR-Submental Fat Rating Scale scores.  Since weight change may affect 
the fat layer thickness , the analysis will be based on the evaluation of the PP 
population, i.e. treated subjects followed through to the final post -treatment 
visit who did not bec ome pregnant, and with weight change of no more than 
5 percent at the final post-treatment  visit.   
 
2.15.3.3. Secondary Endpoint: Ultrasound  
A secondary efficacy endpoint is the change in subcutaneous fat layer as 
measured between the pre - and final post -treatment visit images.  Since 
weight change may affect the fat layer thickness, the analysis will be based 
on the evaluation of the PP population, i.e. treated subjects followed through 
to the final post -treatment visit who did not become pregnant, and with 
weight change of no more than 5 percent at the final post -treatment visit.     
2.15.3.4. Secondary Endpoint: Subject  Self-Rating Scale  
 
 
 
2.15.3.5. Sample Size Requirement  
Up to twenty (20) subjects is thought to be appropriate to provide feasibility 
information regarding safety and efficacy of submental treatment  using 
CoolMini vacuum applicator  and KYBELLA® sequentially .     
2.16. Missing Data Handling  
In general, no imputation for missing data will be made. Data will be analyzed “as -is” 
where subjects with missing data not being included in the analysis.  
2.17. Protocol Adherence  
The study investigators are responsible for performing the study in compliance with the 
protocol.   Non -adherence to th e protocol is to be classified as a protocol violation  or 
protocol deviation, as defined below.  
 
Protocol Violation

Non-adherence to the protocol that may result in significant additional risk to the subject 
(e.g., enrollment of a subject who does not meet the study criteria).  Or, non -adherence to 
Good Clinical Practices (GCP) that may impact patient safety (e.g., failure to obtain 
proper consent prior to performing study procedures).  Violations should be reported to 
the study Sponsor within 5 working  days and reported to the IRB per IRB guidelines . 
 
Protocol Deviation  
 
Non-adherence to study procedures which does not result in additional risk to the subject 
(e.g., subject missed visit).  Protocol deviations are not required to be reported to the 
IRB; however, they must be recorded on the study case report forms and may be reported 
and reviewed in conjunction with the progress report as part of the annual review process.  
 
2.18. Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AE) will be assessed continuously throughout the st udy. An AE is 
defined in accordance with ISO 14155 as any untoward medical occurrence , unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings)  in 
study participant s, users, or other persons  temporally associated with the use of study 
treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.  
 
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study treatment are not considered 
AEs unless the condition recurs after the patient has  recovered from the pre -existing 
condition or the condition worsens in intensity or frequency during the study.  
 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study beginning with signing of informed consent. 
At each post -baseline visit, the investigator will begi n querying for AEs by asking each 
patient a general, non -directed question such as “Have you had any changes to your 
condition since  your last visit?” Previous AEs and changes in therapy/concomitant 
medications are to be  updated. Directed questioning and e xamination will then be done as 
appropriate. All  reportable AEs and clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings 
will be documented on  the appropriate CRF.  
 
Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver,  
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any 
designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, 
considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the  
participant to discontinue the study

This document and the contents hereof are considered proprietary and confidential information of ZELTIQ Aesthetics, 
Inc.  Disclosure to unauthorized individuals or dissemination, publication or copying is prohibited without prior written consent 
of ZELTIQ. Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
 
Any sign, symptom, or disease in a study subject that occurs during the course of a 
clinical trial that is determined by the Investigator  to have a causal relationship or 
possible causal relationship with the device under investigation.  This definition inc ludes 
any AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, 
implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 
device as well as any event resulting from use error (per ISO 62366) or f rom intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
 
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined in accordance with ISO 14155 as “an  
adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences c haracteristic of a 
serious adverse event.”  
 
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (U SADE) 
 
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE) is defined in accordance with  
ISO 14155 as “any serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity, 
or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.” The  
investigator is to consult the IDFU for anticipated risks or anticipated AEs.  
 
Device Deficiency  
 
A device deficiency is defined in accordance  with ISO 14155 as “inadequacy of a 
medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or 
performance.” Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate 
labeling. 
 
If a device deficiency occurs, the i nvestigator will notify the Sponsor  using the fax 
number or email on the front page of the protocol. Device deficiencies shall be 
documented throughout the study and appropriately managed by the Sponsor . The 
Sponsor shall review all device deficiencies and  determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to an SADE. These shall be reported to the regulatory 
authorities and IRBs/ECs as required by national regulations.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
An SAE is defined in accordance with ISO 14155 as an AE that:  
 
1. Led to death

of ZELTIQ. 2. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the patient, that either resulted in:  
a. a life-threatening illness or injury, or  
b. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
c. inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, or  
d. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function,  
or 
e. led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect 
NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition,  or a procedure required by 
the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
 
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
 
All AEs and SAEs from the signing of the ICF until the last follow-up visit will be 
collected at the timepoints specified in the schedule of activities, and as observed or 
reported spontaneously by study participants.   
 
Medical occurrences that begin after signing of infor med consent and before 
administration of study t reatment will be recorded as an AE on the appropriate CRF . 
 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of 
learning about the report . All non-serious AEs related to the devices used in the study, as 
well as Device Complaints, will be reported to the sponsor within 7 working days . The 
investigator will submit any updates on these events to the sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available . 
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study participants. 
However,  if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a 
participant has  completed the final visit of the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to  the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly report the event to the  sponsor. 
 
Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended 
and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire 
about possible AEs . 
 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs

This document and the contents hereof are considered proprietary and confidential information of ZELTIQ Aesthetics, 
Inc.  Disclosure to unauthorized individuals or dissemination, publication or copying is prohibited without prior written consent 
of ZELTIQ. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant  at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event  is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. 
 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental  
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to  
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
Reportable Incide nts 
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs ) and unanticipated  adverse device effects (UADEs) must 
be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the Sponsor . 
All adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be 
recorded on  the appropriate CRF, irrespective of relationship to CoolSculpting and 
KYBELLA®, as well as the K YBELLA® skin grid.  Medically significant adverse events 
will be followed until resolved or considered stable. For each event, the investigator will 
record a d escription, dates of onset and resolution, severity, and relationship to 
CoolSculpting, KYBELLA® and KYBELLA® skin grid. The investigator may b e 
required to provide follow -up information.  
Any adverse event that results in withdrawal from the study must be reported to the 
Sponsor after the decision to withdraw the subject is made.  
Any death occurring during the study must be reported to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of 
the discovery of the event. This includes any death that occurs within 30 days after the 
subject's final visit, irrespective of when the final visit occurs.  
Assessment of Severity  
Severity of adverse events will be determined using the f ollowing scale:  
• Mild: Event that is easily tolerated and may require only minimal  treatment 
or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere  with 
usual activities of daily living.

of ZELTIQ. • Moderate : Events that  interfere with usual activities  of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm  to the 
research participant.  It is usually alleviated with additional specific  
therapeutic intervention.  
• Severe: Event that is incapacitating, with inability to work  and do the 
usual activities of daily living, or  significantly affects clinical status . This 
may require intensive therapeutic  intervention.  
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The investi gator will also consult the investigator’s brochure and/or product 
information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an asses sment of causality.  
• For each AE/SAE, there are 5 levels of causality, as follows:  
• Not related  
• Unlikely 
• Possible 
• Probable 
• Causal relationship

of ZELTIQ. • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in th e initial report to the sponsor. However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causa lity in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
The investigator will determine the relationship of each adverse event to CoolSculpting 
and/or KYBELLA® using the question: "Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by treatment with CoolSculpting and/or KYBELLA®? Answer 
'yes' or 'no' for each adverse event."  
The guideline below should be used to consider relatedness:  
For a “no causal relationship” assessment, the adverse event:  
• May be judged to be due to extraneous causes such as disease or 
environment or toxic factors  
• May be judged to be due to the subject's clinical state or other therapy 
being administered    
• Is not biologically plausible  
• Does not reappear or worsen when CoolSculpting and/or KYBELLA® is 
re-administered  
• Does not follow a temporal sequence from treatment with C oolSculpting 
or administration of KYBELLA® 
For a causal relationship (including unlikely, probable and possible assessments) 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
CoolSculpting,  KYBELLA® and/or the KYBELLA® Grid.   The adverse event:  
• Follows a temporal sequence from treatment with C oolSculpting and/or 
administration of KYBELLA® 
• Is a known response to CoolSculpting and/or KYBELLA® based on 
clinical or nonclinical data

KYBELLA® tx or reduction in total dose of KYBELLA® 
• Reappears or worsens when CoolSculpting and/or KYBELLA® is re-   
administered  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor  within 1 working day of 
discovery or notification of the event and according to IEC/IRB requirements an d the 
institution at which the study is conducted,  if applicable. Serious adverse event information 
and any follow -up information will be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Form and 
transmitted to the Sponsor  using the contact information provided by the Sponsor. Note 
that for each drug/device used in this study, a separate SA E form and contact information 
will be used . The Sponsor  will be responsible for evaluating and reporting any serious 
adverse events and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations.  
Safety Monitoring Considerations  
If an adverse event occurs that in the judgment of the investigator represents a potential 
risk for new subjects, the investigator will contact the Sponsor  within 1 working day after 
becoming aware of the event . 
A full reporting of the event shall be provided within 10 working days of the event.  The 
Sponsor is then responsible for notifying the IRB, as required.  
Pregnancy  
o Details of all pregnancies in female participa nts will be collected after the start of study 
treatment through the duration of the pregnancy.  
o If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy.  
o If a female of childbearing potential beco mes pregnant during the study, the 
investigator should notify the participant’ s physician that the participant may have been 
treated with KYBELLA® and/or CoolSculpting  and exit the participant from the study.  
o Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs .

of ZELTIQ. 6.1. Benefits  
Fat reduction in the treat ment area is anticipated to provide an aesthetic benefit and the 
use of this minimally -invasive drug and non-invasive device will eliminate the need for 
an invasive  procedure that requires anesthesia or recovery time.  Furthermore, the results 
of this study will help in the development of optimal treatment regimens for specific 
submental fullness severities.   Considering the number of surgical procedures performed 
for the removal of fat each year ( over 1.8 million procedures worldwide, according to the 
2016 International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Biennial Global Survey) , the use 
of such a minimally -invasive and non-invasive procedure has the potential to 
significantly reduce the incidence of complications and post -surgical limitations 
associated with those procedures.  
6.2. Risks 
Although this study presents minimal risks to the subject, there is the potential for some 
risk when a ny medical procedure is performe d.  
 
Anticipated Device Effects  
 
 These are known effects of the CoolSculpting  Procedure, previously recorded in prior 
studies as transient and/or temporary effects related to the cold application and/or vacuum 
pressure inherent in the treatment. Anticipat ed effects of the device which will not be 
considered adverse events include:  
 
• inflammation of the subcutaneous fat layer, which is a desired effect of the procedure;  
• sensations of coldness, stinging, burning, pinching, or pressure associated with 
placement of the applicator and the initiation of the cold treatment;  
• known skin effects (e.g., blanching ; erythema, bruising, purpura, petechiae, swelling, 
discomfort, tenderness, or soreness at the treatment site , all mild to moderate in 
nature) which ar e temporary effects that resolve spontaneously shortly after the 
procedure;  
• localized sensory changes (e.g., numbness, tingling) at the treatment area  resolving 
within 12 weeks of the procedure.

Severe Bruising  The appearance of bruising (purple discoloration); purpura 
(purple colored spots or patches); or petechiae (pin point red 
dots) that is rated as severe by the investigator ;  
Prolonged Bruising  Bruising lasting longer tha n 1 month 
Severe Erythema  The appearance of erythema (redness) that is rated as severe 
by the investigator  
Prolonged erythema  Erythema lasting longer than 2 weeks.  
Severe Swelling The appearance of swelling (edema) that is rated as severe by 
the investigator  
Prolonged swelling  Swelling lasting longer than 1 month.  
First Degree Burn  
 A first-degree burn is superficial  and causes local 
inflammation of the skin. The inflammation is characterized 
by pain, redness, and mild swelling. The skin may be very 
tender to touch.  
Second Degree Burn Second degree burns are deeper and in addition to the pain, 
redness and inflammation, there is also blistering of the skin.  
Third Degree Burn  Third degree burns are deeper still, involving all layers of the 
skin.  Because the nerves and blood vessel s are damaged, 
third degree burns appear white, leathery and tend to be 
relatively painless.  
Cold-induced P anniculitis  Severe inflammation which requires medical or surgical 
intervention.  
Skin Pigment Changes  The appearance of hyperpigmentation or hypopi gmentation in 
the treatment area.  
Infection Infection at the treatment site, diagnosed by a Physician and 
requiring medical intervention.  
Discomfort During 
Procedure  Discomfort reported during the procedure that is intolerable to 
the subject and results in an interruption or discontinuation of 
the procedure  
Discomfort Post Procedure  Significant discomfort, pain, cramping, tenderness, soreness, 
muscle spasm following the procedure which results in 
medical intervention (physician visit and/or prescription pain 
reliever) 
Prolonged Sensory 
Alteration Post Procedure  Sensory changes (numbness, tingling, burning sensation) that 
are prolonged (i.e., lasting longer than 12 weeks). 
Sensory Alteration 
Requiring Medical 
Intervention  Sensory changes (pain, burning, stinging, hypersensitivity) 
with a severity warranting medical intervention.

Vasovagal Symptoms  The occurrence of symptoms of anxiety, lightheadedness, 
dizziness, nausea, sweating, near syncope, or syncope 
(fainting).  
Motor Nerve Injury  Injury to the low er face motor nerves such as marginal 
mandibular nerve (lower lip weakness) or hypoglossal nerve 
(tongue deviation).   
Xerostomia  Injury to the submandibular gland as evidenced by the 
subjective decrease in saliva production.  
Contour Irregularity  Significant i ndentation or contour irregularity in the treatment 
area that would require surgical intervention . 
Allergic/Irritant Contact 
Dermatitis  Itchy rashes and skin peeling that may result from prolonged 
exposure to gel or applicator  pressure 
Subcutaneous Induration  Hardness within the treatment area, either as general firmness 
or discrete nodules .  May present with pain and/or discomfort.  
Paradoxical Hyperplasia  Visibly enlarged tissue volume within the treatment area 
which may develop 2 -5 months after treatment. Surgical 
intervention may be required.  
Other Any other untoward medical event determined by the 
investigator to be an adverse event, regardless of the 
relationship to the device or treatment.  
 
 
KYBELLA®  
 
• KYBELLA® is contraindicated in the presence of infection at the injection sites.  
 
• Marginal mandibular nerve injury  
Cases of marginal mandibular nerve injury, manifested as an asymmetric smile or facial 
muscle weakness (paresis), were reported during clinical trials. To avoid the potenti al for 
nerve injury,  KYBELLA® should not be injected into or in close proximity to the marginal

of ZELTIQ. mandibular branch  of the facial nerve. All marginal mandibular nerve injuries reported from 
the trials resolved  spontaneously (range 1 -298 days, median 44 days) . 
 
• Dysphagia  
Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) occurred in clinical trials in the setting of administration 
site reactions, e.g., pain, swelling, and induration of the submental area. Cases of dysphagia  
spontaneously resolved (range 1 -81 days, median 3 day s). Subjects with current or prior 
history of dysphagia were excluded from clinical trials. Avoid use  of KYBELLA® in these 
patients as current or prior history of dysphagia may exacerbate the  condition.  
 
• Injection site hematoma/bruising  
In clinical trials, 72% of subjects treated with KYBELLA® experienced injection site  
hematoma/bruising.  
 
KYBELLA® should be used with caution in patients with bleeding abnormalities or who are  
currently being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant ther apy as excessive bleeding or  
bruising in the treatment area may occur.  
 
• Risk of injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structures . To avoid potential tissue 
damage, KYBELLA® should not be injected into or in close proximity  (1-1.5 cm) to salivary 
glands, lymph nodes and mus cles. 
 
• Injection site alopecia:  withhold subsequent treatments until resolution.  
 
• Injection site ulceration and necrosis:  do not administer to the affected area until complete 
resolution.  
 
Adverse Reactions  
 
In clinical trials, t he most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in KYBELLA®-treated 
subjects were:  
 
• Injection site reactions including edema/swelling, hematoma/bruising, pain, numbness, 
erythema, induration, paresthesia, nodule, pruritus, skin tightness, site warmth an d nerve 
injury; headache, oropharyngeal pain, hypertension, nausea and dysphagia.  
 
• Other adverse reactions associated with the use of KYBELLA® include: injection site  
hemorrhage, injection site discoloration, pre -syncope/syncope, lymphadenopathy, injection 
site urticaria and neck pain.

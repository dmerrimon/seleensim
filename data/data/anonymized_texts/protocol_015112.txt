3.INTRODUCTION
This SAP has been developed after review of the Clinical Study Protocol (final version dated 24 
September 2017 ).
This SAP describes the planned analys is of the safety , tolerabili ty and pharmacokinet ic(PK)data 
from this study . A detailed descript ion of the planned TFLs to be presented in the clinical study  
report (CSR) is provided in the acco mpanying TFL shell document.
The intent of th is docum ent is to provi de gui dance for the stati stical and PK analyses of data. In 
general, the analyses are based on informat ion from the protocol, unless they  have been m odified 
by agreement between Eli Lilly and Co mpany and Covance Early  Clinical (EC) Biometrics .A 
limited amount of informat ion concerning this study (e.g., objectives, study  design) is given to 
help the reader’s interpretation. This SAP m ust be si gned off prior to first subject administration
for this study .When the SAP and TFL shells are agreed upon and finalized, they will serve as 
the tem plate for thi s study’s CSR.
This SAP supersedes the stati stical considerat ions ident ified in the protocol; where 
considerations are substant ially different, they  will be so identified. If addit ional analyses are 
requi red to suppl ement the pl anned analyses described in this SAP, they  may be performed and 
will be ident ified in the CSR. Any substantial deviations fro m this SAP will be agreed upon 
between Eli Lilly and Compa ny and Covance ECBiometricsand i dentified in the CSR. Any 
minor deviat ions from the TFLs may not be documented in the CSR.
This SAP is written with consideration of the recommendat ions outlined in the Inte rnational 
Council on Harm onisation (ICH) E9 Gui deline enti tled Gui dance for Industry : Stati stical 
Principles for Clinical Trials1and the ICH E3 Guideline ent itled Guidance for Industry : Structure 
and Content of Clinical Study  Reports2.
4.STUDY OB JECTIVE S
4.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the relative bioavai labilit y of a single dose of dulaglut ide administered 
subcutaneously (SC) to healthy subjects as a single injection by single dose pen (SDP; 
test) com pared to 3 inject ions by prefilled sy ringe (PFS; reference).
4.2 Secondary Objective
To assess the tolerabili ty of a single dose of dulaglutide administered SC to healthy 
subjects as a single inject ion by SDP compared to 3 injections by PFS.
5.STUDY DESIGN
This study is a Phase 1, single -center, open -label, rando mized, 2 -period, crossover study  in
healt hy subjects to eval uate the rel ative bioavailabilit y of 4.5 m g of a new form ulationof 
Final, 24 Nov 2017              Page 6of 14Statistical Analysis Plan CONFIDENTIAL
Covance Clinical Study  No. 8368080 Sponsor Reference H9X -MC-GBGM
dulaglut ide administered SC as a single injection by SDP (test) compared to 3 injections by PFS 
(reference).
Each subject will provide informed consent for study  parti cipat ion and will undergo a screening
examinat ion within 27 days pri or to enrollment.
In each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day  -1.
On Day  1 of each peri od, subj ects will receive a single dose of 4.5 mg dulaglut ide administered
SC as a single SDP inject ion or as 3 inject ions by PFS according to the randomizat ion schedule . 
Blood sam ples will be collected predose and up to 336 hours postdose to measure dulaglut ide 
concentrations. At a minimum, subjects will remain at the CRU unt il collection ofthe 168 -hour 
(Day  8) PK sample in each period.
There will be a washout period of at least 28 day s between doses in Periods 1 and 2. Each subject 
will be required to return to the CRU for a fo llow-up visit 28 ±3 day s after the lastdulaglut ide 
dose. The total duration for each subject (from screening through the fo llow-up visit) is 
approximately  84 days. The treatment sequences are detailed below:
Treatment Sequence Period 1 Period 2
1 Prefilled Sy ringe Single Dose Pen
2 Single Dose Pen Prefilled Sy ringe
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be assessed throughout the study  by means of vital sign measurement,
physical examinat ion, clinical laboratory  tests, el ectrocardi ograms (ECGs), and AE recording.

probabilit y that the half -width of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the geometric
means for AUC and C maxis no larger than 14%.
Subjects who are randomized may  be replaced to ensure that at least 18 subjects may complete
the study .
8. DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATIONS
The “Safet y” populat ion will consist of all enrolled subjects, whether or not they  completed all  
protocol  requi rements .
The “Pharmacokinet ic” popul ation will consist of a ll subjects who received at least one dose of 
dulaglut ide and have evaluable PK data.  
All protocol deviat ions that occur during the study will be considered for their severit y/impact 
and will be taken into considerat ion when subjects are assigned to analysis popul ations.
9.STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
9.1 General
Data list ings will be provided for all data that is databased. Summary statist ics and statist ical 
analysis will only  be presented for data where detailed in this SAP. For continuous data, 
summary statist ics will include the arithmet ic mean, arithmetic standard deviat ion (SD), m edian, 
min, max and N; for log -normal data (e.g. the PK parameters: AUCs and C max) the geom etric 
mean and geo metric coefficient of variat ion (CV%) will also be presented . For categorical data, 
frequency  count and percentages will be presented. Data list ings will be provided for all subjects 
up to the point of withdrawal, with any subjects excluded from the relevant population 
highlighted. Summary statist ics and statist ical analyses will generally only be performed for 
subjects included in the relevant analysis populat ion.For the calculat ion of summary statist ics 
and statist ical analysis, unrounde d data will be used. 
Mean change fro m baseline is the mean of all individual subjects’ change fro m baseline values. 
Each individual change fro m baseline will be calculated by  subtracting the individual subject’s 
baseline value from the value at the timep oint. The individual subject’s change from baseline 
values will be used to calculate the mean change from baseline using a SAS procedure such as 
Proc Univariate.
Data analysis will be performed using SAS®Version 9.4or greater.
9.2 Demographics and Subject Disposition
Subject disposi tion will be listed . The demographic variab les age, sex , race, ethnicit y, body  
weight, hei ght and body  mass index will be summar ized and listed. Tobacco/nicotine habit s will 
be listed.

9.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessment
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetic A nalysis
Pharmacokinet ic parameter est imates will be determined using non -compartmental procedures in 
validated software program (Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.4 or l ater).
Plasma concentrati ons ofdulaglut idewill be used to determine the following PK parame ters, 
when possible:  
Parameter Units Definition
AUC(0 -) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
infinity
AUC(0 -168h) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
168 hours post dose
AUC(0 -336h) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
336 hours post dose
AUC(0 -tlast) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
time t, where t is the last time point with a measurable 
concent ration
%AUC(t last-) % percentage of AUC(0 -∞) extrapolated
Cmax ng/mL maximum observed drug concentration
tmax h time of maximum observed drug concentration
t½ h half-life associated with the terminal rate constant (λ z) in 
non-compartmental analysis
CL/F L/h apparent total body clearance of drug calculated after 
extra -vascular administration
Vz/F L apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after 
extra -vascular administration
Vss/F L apparent volume of distribution at steady state after extra -vascular 
administration
Addit ional PK parameters may be calculated, as appropriate.  The software and versio n used for 
the final analyses will be specified in the clinical  study report. Any except ions or special 
handling of data will be clear ly documented within the final study  report.
Formatting of tables, figures and abbreviat ions will follow the Eli Lilly Global PK/PD/TS Tool : 
NON- COMPARTMENTAL PHARMACOKINETIC STYLE GUIDE. The versi on of the tool
effect ive at the time of PK analysis will be followed.
General PK Parameter Rules
Actual  sampling times will be used in the final analyses of individual PK parameters, 
except for non -bolus pre -dose sampling times which will be set to zero . 
Final, 24 Nov 2017              Page 9of 14Statistical Analysis Plan CONFIDENTIAL
Covance Clinical Study  No. 8368080 Sponsor Reference H9X -MC-GBGM
Cmaxand t maxwill be reported from observed values.  If C maxoccurs at m ore than one time 
point, t maxwill be assigned to the first occurrence of C max. 
AUC parameters will be calculated using a combination of the linear and logarithmic 
trapezoi dal methods (linear -log trapezoi dal rule).  The linear trapezoidal m ethod will be 
applied up to t maxand then the logarithmic trapezoidal method will be used after t max. The 
minimum requirement for the calculat ion of AUC will be the inclusio n of at least three 
consecut ive plasma concentrations above the lower limit of quant ificat ion (LLOQ), with 
at least one of these concentrations fo llowing C max. AUC(0 -) values where the 
percentage of the total area extrapolated is more than 20% will be flagged. Any AUC(0 -
) value excluded from  summary stati stics will be noted in the footnote of the summary  
table.
Half-life (t ½) will be calculated, when appropriate, based on the apparent terminal log -
linear portion of the concentration-time curve. The start of the terminal eliminat ion phase 
for each subject will be defined by visual in spect ion and generally will be the first point 
at whi ch there i s no system atic deviat ion from the log -linear decline in plasma 
concentrations.  Half -life will only  be calculated when a reliable est imate for this 
param eter can be obtained comprising o f at least 3 data points.  If t ½is est imated over a 
time window of less than 2 half-lives, the values will be flagged in the data list ings. Any 
t½value excluded from summary statist ics will be documented in the footnote of the 
summary table. 
A uniform weight ing scheme will be used in the regressio n analysis of the terminal log -
linear portion of the concentration- time curve.
The parameters based on observed C lastwill be reported .
Individual PK Parameter Rules
Only quantifiable concentrations will be used to c alculate PK parameters with the 
exception of special handling of certain concentratio ns reported below the lower limit of 
quant itation (BQL).  Pl asma concentrations reported as BQL will be set to a value of zero 
when all o f the following condit ions are met : 
The compound is non -endogenous.
The samples are from the init ial dose peri od for a subject or from a 
subsequent dose period fo llowing a suitable wash- out period.
The time points occur before the first quant ifiable concentration.
All other BQL concentrat ions that do not meet the above criteria will be set to missing. 
Also, where two or more consecut ive concentrations are BQL towards the end of a 
profile, the profile will be deemed to have terminated and therefore any further 
quant ifiable concentrations w ill be set to missing for the calculat ion of the PK parameters 
unless it i s considered to be a true characteristic of the profile of the drug.
Individual Concentration vs. Time Profiles
oIndividual concentrations will be plotted utilizing actual sampling times.
oThe terminal po int selections will be indicated on a semi -logarithmic pl ot.

Covance Clinical Study  No. 8368080 Sponsor Reference H9X -MC-GBGM
Average Concentration vs. Time Profiles
oThe average concentration profiles will be graphed using scheduled (no minal) 
sampling t imes. 
oThe average concentration profiles will be graphed using ari thmet ic average 
concentrations.
oThe pre -dose average concentration for single -dose data from  non-endogenous 
compounds will  be set to zero.  Otherwise, only quant ifiable concentrations will 
be used to calculate average concentration s.
oConcentrations at a sampling time exceeding the sampling time window specified 
in the protocol, or ±10%, will be excluded from the average concentration 
profiles.
oConcentrations excluded from the mean calculation will be documented in the 
final study  report.
oA concentration average will be plotted for a given sampling time only  if 2/3 of  
the individual data at the time point have quant ifiable measurements that are 
within the sampling time window specified in the protocol or ± 10%. An average 
concentrati on est imated with less than 2/3 but more than 3 data poi nts may be 
displayed on the mean concentration plot if determined to be appropriate and will 
be docum
ented wi thin the final study  report.
Treatment of Outliers during Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Applicat ion of this procedure to all pharmacokineti c analyses is not a requirement. Rather, this 
procedure provides justificat ion for exclusio n of data when scientifically appropriate. This 
procedure describes the methodol ogy for ident ifying an individual value as an outlier for 
potenti al exclusi on, but does not requi re that the val ue be excluded from  analysis.  The foll owing 
methodol ogy will not be used to exclude complete profiles from analysis.
Data wi thin an Individual Profile
A value within an individu al profile may be excluded from analysis if any of the following 
criteria are met:
For pharm acokinet ic profiles during single dosing of non -endogenous compounds, the 
concentration in a pre -dose sam ple is quant ifiable.
For any  quest ionable datum  that does n ot sati sfy the above cri teria, the profile will be 
evaluated and results reported with and wit hout the suspected datum. 
Data between Individual Profiles
1.If n<6, then the dataset is too small to conduct a reliable range test.  Data will be 
analyzed with a nd without the atypical value, and both sets of results will be reported.  
2.If n6, then an object ive outlier test will be used to compare the aty pical  value to other 
values included in that calculat ion:
a.Transform all values in the calculation to the loga rithmic domain.
b.Find the most extrem e value from  the ari thmetic mean o f the log transformed 
values and exclude that value from the dataset.

Covance Clinical Study  No. 8368080 Sponsor Reference H9X -MC-GBGM
c.Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the range defined by the arithmet ic 
mean ±3*SD of the remaining log -transfor med values.
d.If the extreme value is within the range of arit hmetic mean ±3*SD, then it is 
not an outlier and will be retained in the dataset.
e.If the extreme value is outside the range of arithmetic mean ±3*SD, then it is 
an outlier and will be excluded fro m analysis.
If the remaining dataset contains another atypical datum  suspected to be an outlier and n ≥ 6 
following the exclusi on, then repeat step 2 above. This evaluat ion may be repeated as many 
times as necessary, excluding only one suspected outlier ineach iteration, until all data 
remaining in the dataset fall within the range of arithmetic mean ±3*SD of the log-transformed 
values.
Reporting of Excluded Values
Individual values excluded as outliers will be docum ented in the final report.  Approval of the 
final report will connote approval of the exclusio n.
9.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Statistical Methodology
The PK parameters will be summarized using desc riptive statist ics by treatment and also 
presented graphically. Mean (with and wi thout SD bars) and individual profiles over time will be 
presented for PK concentrations.
The PK parameter estimates will be evaluated to determine the relat ive bioavailabilit y of
dulaglut ide administered SC by SDP (test) compared to dulaglut ide administered by PFS
(reference).
Log-transformed C maxand AUC(0- ∞) (primary  param eters) and AUC(0- 168h) and
AUC(0 -336h) (secondary  parameters) will be evaluated in a linear mixed -effects analysis o f
variance model wit h fixed effects for treatment (SDP or PFS), period, and sequence and a
rando m effect for subject within sequence. The ratios of least squares geometric means of SDP
compared to PFS, as well as the corresponding 90% CIs, will be est imated and reported.
Example SAS code is given below:
procmixeddata=pk;
classsubject treatment period sequence ;
modellog(pk) = treatment period sequence / ddfm=kr;
lsmeans treatment / pdiff alpha=0.1 ;
randomintercept / subject=subject(sequence);
run;
The t maxwill be analyzed nonparametrical ly using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Estimates of
themedian difference and the corresponding 90% CIs will be calculated.

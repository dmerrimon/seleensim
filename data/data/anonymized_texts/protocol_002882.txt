Page 5PROTOCOL SUMMARY
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy, safet y, tolerabilit y, and 
pharmacokinetics of two doses of varenicline in adolescent smokers (12-19 years) in 
conjunction with age appropriate cessation counseling.  The treatment period will be twelve 
weeks and subjects’ smoking status will then be followed for approximately  nine months.
Background
Varenicline is a selective nicotinic acet ylcholine rece ptor (nAChR) partial agonist designed 
to have specific and potent binding at the 42receptor subtype which mediates the behavior 
reinforcing effects of nicotine.  Because of its mixed agonist-antagonist properties, 
varenicline offers the therapeutic bene fit of relieving s ymptoms of nicotine withdrawal and 
cigarette craving during abstinence while blocking the reinforcing effects of chronic nicotine .
Varenicline (Chantix/Champix) was approved as an “aid to smoking cessation treatment” 
in adults by  the FD A in May  2006, and by  the EMEA in September 2006, and is now 
approved in 9
8countries worldwide. The approved dose regimen is 1 mg twice dail y (1mg 
bid) for 12 weeks starting with a 1- week titration.  Post -marketing stud y commitments 
required under secti on 2 of the Pediatric Research Equity  Act (PREA) include a study  to 
determine whether varenicline, as part of an overall smoking cessation program, is effective 
in achieving and maintaining smoking cessation in tobacco- addicted adolescents.  The 
current st udy isconsidered to be a post -authorization safet y study (PASS) in the adolescent 
population, an age group not included in the current labeling for varenicline.
Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy  and tolerability  of vare nicline 
1mg BID in more than 30 00 adult cigarette smokers, increasing the odds of quitting 
approximately  4-fold compared with placebo at end of treatment, and nearly  2-fold compared 
with bupropion at end of treatment.  The most frequently  reported treatment- emerg ent 
adverse events associated with varenicline were nausea, sleep disturbance, constipation, 
flatulence and vomiting.1  Nausea was reported b y approximately 30% of patients treated 
with varenicline 1 mg BID afte r an initial week of dose titration compared with 10% in 
patients taking placebo.  In patients taking 0.5 mg BID following initial titration, the 
incidence was 16% compared with 11% for placebo.  Nausea was generall y described as 
mild or moderate and often transient
.1
Post Marketing Experience
There have been post- marketing reports of neuropsy chiatric s ymptoms, some serious, 
including changes in mood, agitation, ps ychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, 
homicidal ideation, hostility , changes in behavior, anxiety , panic, suicidal ideation, suicid e 
attempt and completed suicide in patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline. 
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not 
alway s possible to reliably  estimate their frequency  or establish causal relationship to drug 
exposure. Smoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with nicotine 
withdrawal s ymptoms and the exacerbation of underly ing ps ychiatric illness. Not all patients 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 6had known pre -existing psy chiatric illness and not all had discontinued smoking. The role of 
varenicline in these reports is not known.
Additionally  there have been reports of h ypersensitivity  reactions and serious skin rea ctions.
TheSingle Reference Safety  Document for varenicline ,where complete information is 
available, is the most recent Investigator Brochure (IB).
Rationale for this study
Most adult smokers initiated smoking as adolescents.  According to the CDC’s 2005 Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey ,223.0% of students in the United States were current cigarette users 
(ie,had smoked cigarettes on more than one of the 30 day s preceding the survey ) and 
9.4% of students were curre nt frequent cigarette users (ie, had smoked cigarettes on 20 of 
the 30 day s preceding the survey ).  Among the students who reported current cigarette use,
10.7% had smoked at least 10 cigarettes/day  on the day s they  smoked during the 30 days 
preceding the survey  and 54.6% had tried to quit smoking cigarettes during the 12 months 
preceding the survey .  Continued smoking increases lifetime risk for various cancers, 
especiall y lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases .3 
 Objective 27- 2 of 
the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy  People 2010 initiative is to 
reduce the prevalence of current cigarette use among high school students to 16%.4
The transition from earl
y smoking to nicotine dependence (ND) in adolescents is not fully  
understood, but similar to adults, intensity  and frequency  of cigarette use is associated with 
ND.5  Past studies of smoking cessation in adolescents defined their target patient population 
by intensity , frequency  and in some cases, duration of cigarette smoking, in an attempt to 
identify  adolescents who were nicotine dependent
.The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire 
(FTQ) was modified and validated for use in adolescents age 12 -16.6The validation of the 
FTQ with salivary  cotinine in adolescents showed good performance for all questions except 
for “Do you inhale”. As this q uestion did not perform well in either 
adults or adolescents ,
the authors recommended abbreviating the scale to six questions.  The sesix questions are the 
same as the six items included in the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) 
(Appendix 2) which will be used in this study  as an instrument to identify  adolescents likely  
to be nicotine
-dependent. 
This study  will examine whether varenicline, in conjunction with age-appropriate smoking 
cessation counse ling at each clinic visit and telephone contact will be safe and effective in 
helping adolescents who smoke on average 
5 cigarettes per day , to stop smoking.  
Primary Objective :
To evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of varenicline compared w ith placebo 
in adolescent tobacco smokers (aged 12-19 years) .

Page 7Endpoints
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:
The 4 -week continuous quit rate (CQR) from Week 9 through Week 12 of treatment 
for varenicline compared with placebo.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints: 
7-day point -prevalence of smoking abstinence at Weeks 12 , 24, and 52;
R
eduction in number of cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12, 24, and 52;
C
ontinuous abstinence rate from Week 9 through Week 24;
Continuous abstinence rate from Week 9 through Week 52
.
Safety  Assessments: 
Adverse events spontaneously  volunteered or observed, adverse events elicited by  the 
Neurops ychiatric Adverse Event Interview (NAEI) (Appendix 4), Columbia Suicide 
Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS), Hospital A nxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) , 
and adverse events associated with safet y laboratory  tests, or vital signs.
PK Assessments: 
Varenicline exposure at steady -state in adolescent smokers.
Statistical Method s
The primary  anal ysis population will be all sub jects who took at least one dose of 
randomized study  medication.  All significance tests will be two- sided and will use a 
0.05 significance level.  No adjustments will be made to the nominal p- values for anal ysis of 
the multiple efficacy  endpoints.  Subjec ts who discontinue the study  will be considered 
smokers for the remainder of the stud y regardless of their last smoking status evaluation.
For the binary  endpoints with planned inferential treatment comparisons, a logistic regression 
model will be fitted w hich will include the main effects of strata, treatment group and center 
as independent variables.  Treatment b y center interaction will be investigated by an 
expanded model; however the reported p -
values will be based on the main effects model.  
Analy sis of the change from baseline in mean number of cigarettes smoked per day  will use 
analysis of covariance with baseline value, strata, treatment group and center included in the 
model.  The assumptions of the linear model will be examined and if not satisfie d, 
nonparametric methods will be used.  There will be no formal inferential analyses of safet y 
assessments.  The standard and additional safety  data will be summarized by  treatment group 
using descriptive statistics.

1.2. Background and Rationale
Most adult smokers ini tiated smoking as adolescents.  According to the CDC’s 2005 Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey ,223.0% of students in the United States were current cigarette users 
(ie, had smoked cigarettes on more than one of the 30 days preceding the survey ) and 
9.4% of students were current frequent cigarette users (ie ,had smoked cigarettes on 20of 
the 30 day s preceding the survey ).  Among the students who reported current cigarette use,
10.7% had smoked at least 10 cigarettes/da y on the day s they  smoked during the 30 days 
preceding the survey  and 54.6% had tried to quit smoking cigarettes during the 12 months 
preceding the survey .  Continued smoking increases lifetime risk for various cancers, 
especiall y lung cancer, cardiovascul ar diseases, and respiratory  diseases .3 
 Objective 27- 2 of 
the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy  People 2010 initiative is to 
reduce the prevalence of current cigarette use among high school stu dents to 16%.4
The transition from earl y smoking to nicotine dependence (ND)
in adolescents is not fully  
understood, but similar to adults, intensity  and frequency  of cigarette use is associated with
ND.5Past studies of smoking cessation in adolescents defined their target patient population 
by intensity , frequency  and in some cases duration of cigarette smoking in an attempt to 
identify  adolescents who w ere nicotin e dependent.  The Fa gerström Tolerance Questionnaire 
(FTQ) was modified and validated for use in adolescents .6  The validation of the FTQ with 
salivary  cotinine in adolescents showed good performance for all que stions except for "Do 
you inhale".  As this question did not perform well in either 
adults or adolescents the authors 
recommended abbreviating the scale to six questions. These six questions are the same as the 
six items included in the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) ( Appendix 2) 
which will be used in this study  as an instrument to identify  adolescents likely  to be

(post -authorization safety  study ), and is a regulatory  commitment .
Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Varenicline in Adults
The approved dosing regimen in adults is 1 mg twice dail y (BID) for 12 weeks starting with 
a 1-week titration.  Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy  and 
tolerability  of varenicline 1 mg BID in more than 3000 adult cigarette smokers, increasing 
the odds of quitting approximate ly 4-fold compared with placebo at end of treatment, and 
nearl y 2-fold compared with bupropion at end of treatment.  The most frequently  reported 
treatment -
emergent adverse events associated with varenicline were nausea, sleep 
disturbance, constipation, flatulence and vomiting.  Nausea was reported by  approximately  
30% of patients treated with varenicline 1 mg BID after an initial week of dose titration 
compared with 10% in patients taking placebo.  In patients taking 0.5 mg BID following 
initial titration, the incidence was 16% compared with 11% for placebo.  Nausea was 
generall y described as mild or moderate and often transient.1
Post Marketing Experience
There have been post- marketing reports of neuropsy chiatri c symptoms, some serious, 
including changes in mood, agitation, ps ychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, 
homicidal ideation, hostility , changes in behavior, anxiety , panic, suicidal ideation, suicide 
attempt and completed suicide in patients attempt ing to quit smoking with varenicline. 
Because these events are reported voluntaril y from a population of uncertain size, it is not 
alway s possible to reliably  estimate their frequency  or establish causal relationship to drug 
exposure. Smoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with nicotine 
withdrawal s ymptoms and the exacerbation of underly ing ps ychiatric illness. Not all patients 
had known pre -existing psy chiatric illness and not all had discontinued smoking. The role of 
varenicline in these reports is not known.
Additionally  there have been reports of h ypersensitivity  reactions and serious skin reactions.
Complete information for this compound may  be found in The Single Reference Safet y 
Document for varenicline , which for this stud y,is the most recent Investigator Brochure (IB).
Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Varenicline in Adolescents
A 2-week multiple -dose study  (A3051070) examined pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability  
in adolescent smokers, 12- 16 years old (see referen ces to report and publication) .19, 20  A total 
of 70 subjects were 
enrolled in two groups (N=35 each group) according to body  weight.  In 
the High Bod y Weight group ( >55kg) subjects were randomized to varenicline 1 mg BID, 
0.5mg BID or placebo. In the Low Bod y Weight group ( 55 kg) subjects were randomized 
to varenicline 0.5 mg BID, 0.5 mg once dail y (QD) or placebo.  No subjects discontinued 
treatment or had a dose reduction due to adverse events.  Adverse event incidence was higher

Body Weight group than the High Bod y Weight group.  The most frequently  reported 
treatment -emerge nt adverse events associated with varenicline were nausea, headache, 
vomiting, and dizziness, with incidences tabulated below.  Psychiatric adverse events that 
were considered possibly treatment- related were reported by  3 subjects.  In the High Bod y 
Weight group receiving 1 mg BID, one male subject had abnormal dreams rated mild, from 
Days 2-12, and one male subject had anger, rated mild, on Day  10.  In the Low Bod y Weight 
group receiving 0.5 mg BID, one male subject had abnormal dreams rated mild, on 
Days 4and 5.  In addition, one female subject in the L ow Body  Weight group receiving 
0.5mg QD had mood swings rated moderate on Day s 10-14 that were considered not 
treatment -related.

Results from the population pharmacokinetic analy sis showed that an open one -compartment 
model with first- order absorption and elimination best described the multiple -dose 
pharmacokinetics of varenicline in adolescent smokers. The final population PK parameter 
estimates (inter -individual variability  expressed as %CV) for a t ypical individual weighing 
70 kg were 10.4 L/hr (30%) for oral clearance (CL/F) and 215 L (18%) for volume of 
distribution (V/F). Body weight was an important predict or of the inter -individual variability  
in V/F.  In adolescents weighing >55, predicted median stead y state exposures 
[AUC(0- 24)ss] kg were 95.7 ng.h/mL and 197 ng.h/mL  for 0.5 mg BID and 1 mg BID, 
respectivel y. These exposures were consistent with exposur e estimates previously  reported 
at equivalent dail y doses in adult smokers (NDA 21 -928, 09 November 2005, Sequence 
# 0000, Module 2.7.221, 22(see references to pop P K in adults ). Adolescents from the Low 
Body Weight group ( 55 kg) tended to have greater varenicline exposures compared to the 
High Bod y Weight group. However adjusting the dose to half of that administered to the 
High Bod y Weight group, adolescents of smaller body  size exhibited exposures within the 
range of exposures observed in heavier adolescents and in adults. Consistent with the 
single -dose PK data (Study  A305102923), this analy sis provided further evide nce of 
dose-proportionalit y in varenicline s ystemic exposure in adolescents across the dose range of 
0.5 mg to 2 mg daily .
Dose Selection Rationale
Varenicline doses for this study  were selected based on the safety , tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics, and effi cacy information from the clinical trials in adult smokers and the 
pharmacokineti c and tolerability  data from the single -dose (A305102923) and the 
multiple -dose (A305107019, 20) studies conducted in adolescent smokers 12 to 16years old. 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 18In clinical trials in adult smokers, both varenicline 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID regimens 
demonstrated efficacy  as an aid to smoking cessation, and exposure-response information 
further indicated that higher s ystemic exposure to varenicline was associated with greater 
probability  of 4-week smoking cessation. This study  proposes to investigate both 1 mg BID 
and 0.5 mg BID doses compared with p lacebo in the adolescent population.  
Since Study  A3051070 demonstrated that varenicline exposure was adequately  adjusted b y 
halving the total dail y dose of varenicline in subjects at or below the pre -specified weight 
threshold of 55 kg, adolescent subjec ts 55kg will have their randomized dose reduced b y 
half in this study . Those randomized to 1 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg BID and those 
randomized to 0.5 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg QD.  This dosing scheme should provide an 
adequate range of individual exp osures to investigate the exposure -response relationships for 
selected measures of efficacy  and tolerability .  All dosing regimens other than 0.5 mg QD 
will begin with a two week titration period followed by  10 weeks at the target dose. 
Smoking Cessation Counseling Program
Smoking cessation attempts are more likel y to be successful with counseling and support.  
All subjects will receive brief age-
appropriate smoking cessation counseling in accordance 
with the Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines24at each clinic visit and telephone contact, 
starting with the baseline visit.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This will be a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study  to compare 
two doses of varenicline 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID with placebo for smoking cessation in 
adolescent smokers aged 12-19 years who are motivated to quit. Since varenicline exposure 
is related to bod y weight, subjects w ith a body  weight 55
kg will have their varenicline dose 
reduced b y half (those randomized to 1 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg BID and those 
randomized to 0.5 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg QD).  
All subjects and their parents/legal guardians will provide inform ed consent/assent before 
any study  activities occur.  
Subjects over the age of 18 may  sign their own informed consent. 
(Parents, guardians, or caregivers need to be actively  involved in the assessment and 
monitoring of these patients). Subject eligibilit y will be reviewed during a t hree week 
screening period.
Those subjects deemed eligible will be randomized and enter the 12 -week placebo- controlled 
treatment period with weekly  clinic visits for efficacy  and safet
y assessments and smoking 
cessation counsel ing. Varenicline or placebo dosing will begin with two weeks of titration.
(Figure 1). All subjects will set a target quit date (TQD) to coincide with the Week 1 visit. 
The Week 1 visit occurs at the end of the first week of the treatment phase.  A visit window 
of 3 day s can be allowed to accommodate unforeseen scheduling issues.  Brief 
a
ge-appropriate smoking cessation counselin g, in accordance with Public Health Service 
(PHS) guidelines, up to 10 minutes dur ation, will be provided by a trained counselor at each 
clinic visit and tele phone contact beginning at baseline. The primary  efficacy  endpoint will 
be complete abstinence from smoking, biochemically verified, during the last 4 weeks of the 
12week dosing period.  
Follow -up (non -treatment) period: 
The primary  purpose of the non- treatment follow -up study  phase is to assess the long -term 
smoking abstinence. In addition, during this phase, subjects will be monitored for an y 
neurops ychiatric or suicide -related adverse events. 
Subjects will be followed to obtain smoking status for 9 months after the end of the 12-week 
treatment 
period.  Clinic visits will occur at Weeks 13-16 ( inclusive ), 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52. 
Telephone contacts are planned for weeks 24, 3 2, 40, and 48.  To accommodate unforeseen

Page 20circumstances, a visit window of 3 day s can be allowed for week 13 through 20 visits, and a 
visit window of 5 day s can be allowed for week 20 to week 52 visits.  
Smoking -
cessation counseling up to 10 minutes dur ation will be provided at each clinic visit 
and telephone contac t for the duration of the study. Whenever possible, counseling should be 
conducted b y the same counselor throughout, so that the relationship builds and brings 
additional value to the sessions. 
Subjects that stop taking study  drug during the treatment phase (wks 1-12) are still eligible to 
remain in the study , provided they  continue to comply  with remaining visit procedures. All 
efforts should be made to keep the subjects in the study .If an earl y termination of the study  
occurs, the appropriate ET visit should be completed in accordance with the schedule of 
activities 
(Table 1).

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
This is a 52 week, double -blind, parallel group study .  Subjects will be randomized to receive 
12 weeks of varenicline 1 mg BID, varenicline 0.5 mg BID or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio using a 
block randomization within each site. Within each randomized treatment group, subjects 
who weigh 55kg at baseline will receive half the assigned dose strength. 
Randomization will be stratified b y age group (12 -16 vs 17- 19). In order to ensure a 
sufficient number of subjects in the 12 -16 y ear old stratum, the 17 -19 year old stratum will 
be capped at a maximum of 90 subjects.

system will also coordinate drug dispensation to subjects at each clinic visit.
5.2.Breaking the Blind 
The study  will be subject, investigator, and sponsor blinded. 
At the initiation of the study , the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind.  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  Blinding codes should only  
be broken in emergency  situations for reasons of subject safet y.  The investigator should 
contact Pfizer b efore breaking the blind.  When the blinding code is broken, the reason must 
be fully  documented. 
5.3.Drug Supplies
Varenicline doses will consist of one or two 0.5 mg tablets of the clinical image formulation.  
Matching placebo tablets will be provided to ma intain the blind.  Study  drug will be supplied 
in blister packs. 
5.4.Formulation and Packaging
Varenicline will be supplied as 0.5 mg tablets of the I mmediate Release formulation.  Tablets 
(blinded varenicline or placebo) will be supplied in blister packs con taining sufficient tablets 
for 10 day s.  A new blister pack will be dispensed after each weekl y clinic visit to provide 
sufficient study  drug until the next scheduled clinic visit. 
5.5.Preparation and Dispensing
Study  drug is to be dispensed to subjects by  qualified site study  staff at (or after) each 
scheduled clinic visit from the Baseline visit to the Week 11 visit (according to the stud y 
flowchart).  Site personnel should provide instructions for study  drug dosing to each subject, 
and request that the subject read for understanding. Once reading is complete, the subject 
will be asked to initial and date the instructions indicating they  comprehend the meaning of 
the sun (am) and moon (pm) and other aspects of the dosing card instructions. If the child is 
aminor, the parent should date and sign to indicate their understanding as well. The 
discussion should be documented in source as well .Subjects will receive their first blister 
pack at (or after) the Baseline visit and will receive a new blister pack at (or after) each 
weekl y clinic visit through the Week 11 visit.  Upon receipt of each new drug package the 
used package will be returned.   Subjects will be instructed to store the study  drug at room 
temperature and out of the reach of small children.
5.6.Admin istration
To maintain the blind the administration of study  medication will use a double -dummy  
strategy  so that all subjects will take two morning tablets and two evening tablets throughout 
the 12- week dosing period.  Tablets will be active drug or placebo as outlined below.

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 27Study drug administration will begin with a two -week titration period.  
Treatment will begin from the Week 1 blister card as soon as possible, the earliest being the
morni ng after the Baseline visit day .  The blister cards are set up in 2 columns; sun, (am), and 
moon, (pm) to accommodate BID dosing schedule. Each subject will be instructed to take 
two pills from each column each day starting with the top of the blister card (in the direction 
of the arrow printed on the card). It is i mportant that this order is followed. The blister cards 
have been created such that dosing instructions (2 tablets in the morning, 2 tablets in the 
evening) remain the same throughout the study . After the subjects are instructed on proper 
dosing, the sub jects should repeat these directions, and initial and date to document 
comprehension of these instructions. If subject is a minor, the parent should initial and date 
as well. 
Dosing should occur with a full glass (240 ml) of water and it is recommended t hat subjects 
eat prior to dosing.  At least 8 hours is recommended between the morning and evening 
dosing.
Medication errors may  result, in this study  from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong drug, b y the wrong subject ,or at a strength of 4 mg/day or higher.  Such medication 
errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the adverse event (AE) page of 
the CRF and on the SAE form when appropriate.   In the event of medication dosing error 
(4mg/day  or higher) the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whet her or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error and, if applicable, an y associated adverse event (s) is 
captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page (refer to Adverse Event Reporting section fo r 
further details.

5.7.Dosing Compliance
Subjects will return blister packs at (or after) each visit.  A dosing record and drug 
accountability  form will be completed.  Reasons for missed doses should be ascertained and
patterns of missed doses should be discussed in detail.  Subjects may beconsidered non -
compliant if weekl y compliance is less than 80%. 
5.8. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all study  
drug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions and in accordance 
with applicable regulatory  requirements.  Varenicline and matching placebo should be stored 
at 15-30C or 59-86F as indicated on the label.
To ensure adequate records, all study  drug will be accounted for in the case report form and 
drug accountability  inventory  forms as instructed by  Pfizer.  Unless otherwise authorized by  
Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the subjects 
must be returned to Pfizer or its designated agent.
5.9. Concomitant Medication(s)
Any use of ps ychotropic or psychoactive drugs b y a potential subject in the past 6 months 
prior to screening should be discussed with the sponsor.  Use of Addera ll or Ritalin may  be 
allowed for treatment of those subjects with ADHD who are otherwise deemed appropriate 
for this study .  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs within 7 day s or 5 half -lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  medication should be discussed with the 
sponsor, and documented in the CRF .Acetaminophen and ibuprofen may  be used 
intermittently  throughout the trial, but should not exceed 2 g/day  on two consecutive day s, 
unless greater quantities are deemed necessary  by the investigator.  Antihistamines, asthma 
medications, bronchodilators, migraine medications and topical medications may  be 
permitted during the course of the stud y.If there is any  question about whether a 
concomitant medication is appropriate for use in subjects while they  are participating in this 
trial, please contact the sponsor.

Page 29All concomitant medication taken during the trial mu st be recorded with indication and start 
and stop dates of administration.  All subjects will be questioned about concom itant 
medication at each clinic visit through Week 52 .
Medications taken within 3 months before the first dose of trial medication will be 
documented as a prior medication.  Medications taken after the first dose of trial medication 
will be documented as c oncomitant medications.

6.2.2. Treatment Phase Clinic Visits (Weeks 1 through 12 and ET 12)
Following the Baseline visit, clinic visits will be conducted weekly  for 12 weeks.  All 
subjects should have set a target quit 
date (TQD) to coincide with the Week 1 visit.  The 
Week 1 visit occurs at the end of the first week of the treatment phase.  Smoking cessation 
counseling up to 10 minutes duration will be provided at each clinic visit beginning at 
Baseline. Whenever possi ble, counseling should be conducted b y the same counselor 
throughout, so that the relationship builds and brings additional value to the sessions. Every  
effort should be made to have the subject return on the same day  of the week for the clinic 
visits, th ereby keeping visits on time.  To accommodate unforeseen circumstances a visit 
window of  3 day s can be allowed as long as proper dosing is maintained.  If an earl y 
termination occurs before the end of Week 12, an earl y termination visit (ET 12) will be 
conducted.  At each of these visits, the following procedures will be conducted :

6.3.Non-Treatment Follow -up Period (Weeks 13 - 52)
Following completion of the week 12 visit, subjects will continue in the non -treatment 
follow -up phase of the protocol. Clinic visits occur weeks 13 -16, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52/ET. 
Subjects will be contacted by phone at weeks 24, 32, 40, and 48. During the non- treatment 
phase, smoking cessation counseling up to 10 minutes duration will be provided at each visit 
and telephone contact. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances, a visit wi ndow of 
3days can be allowed for week s 13 through 20 visits, and a visit window of +5 day s can be 
allowed for week 20 to week 52 visits.

Discharge from stud y at Week 52 or early  termination only .  If a subject has any  clinically  
significant and trial- related abnormalities at the conclusion of a scheduled visit of the trial, 
the Pfizer medical monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and the 
follow -up evaluations will be performed until the abnormalities return to the normal/baseline 
condition.  The investigator should make every  effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at
appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities.
6.4.Early Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Subjects who wish to withdraw from the study  will be allowed to do so at any  time without 
prejudice, or they  may  be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or 
sponsor for safety or behavioral, or the inability of the subject to compl y with the protocol 
required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study  site. Subjects should be 
discontinued if they  cannot be co ntacted for drug monitoring or do not return for s ubsequent 
scheduled visit s.The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the 
subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject return for a final 
visit, if applicable and follow- up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events 
(AEs). Diligent attempts will be made by  telephone and certified letter to determine the 
circumstances for subjects who are lost to follow -up as this may  be related to the study  drug.
Early permanent withdrawal of study drug use may occur at an y phase of the study.  Possible 
reasons for early  permanent withdrawal of study  drug use include:

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 34Adverse event: The subject develops an adverse event, which in the opinion of the
subject or lead investigator, institutional principal investigator or sub -investigator 
warrants termination of study  drug use.
Personal reason: A subject may  withdraw from study  drug use at an y time.
Pregnancy .
In the event of stud y treatment discontinuation, subjects should be encouraged to continue to 
attend clinic and telephone visits, and complete study  procedures.
The investigator must determine the primary  reason for withdrawal of study drug and record 
it on the case report form.  Withdrawal of study drug due to an adverse event should be 
distinguished from withdrawal of study  drug 
due to insufficient response.  A treatment or 
study  discontinuation due to a serious adverse event must be reported to Pfizer immediately .  
Return to smoking is not a basi
s for withdrawing a subject from the study .  Subjects who 
return to smoking should be encouraged to make further quit attempts and to continue their 
participation with the counseling and protocol -specified visits and procedures.
Female subjects who have a positive pregnancy  test during the treatment period will 
discontinue study  medication but should continue study participation.  Pregnant subjects 
must be followed to the outcome of the pregnancy  and an Exposure in Utero Form (EIU) 
must be submitted.  
Any subjects who discontinue treatment for any  reason may  continue participation in the 
study  and should be encouraged to do so.  They  will be required to maintain the visit 
schedule and can continue participation through the non
-treatment follow -up phase of t he 
study .
Subjects should be encouraged to complete the study even if they  stop study  medication .If 
the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
I
n post marketing safet y surveillance t here have been some reports of depressed mood, 
agitation, changes in behavior ,psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal 
ideation, hostility , anxiety , panic, and suicidal ideation (suicidal thoughts) and suicide in 
patients attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline.  Because these events are 
reported voluntaril y from a population of uncertain size, it is not alway s possible to reliably  
estimate their frequency  or establish causal relationship to drug exposure.  The role of 
varenicline in these reports is not known. A subject who experiences such events s hould stop 
dosing and imme diatel y report an y such s ymptoms to the study  staff . 
Each clinical research site will have an Emergency Response Plan in place to properly 
care for subjects who report events of a serious nature that require immediate or very 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 35prompt att ention.  This plan will include having a pediatric/adolescent psychiatrist 
available at all times .  
At all clinic visits, the investigator will be proactively  monitoring for anxiety , panic, 
hostility , aggression, abnormal thinking, hallucinations, suicida lity and depressed mood 
through the use of the C -SSRS, HADS (Appendix 3), and the NAE I(Appendix 4). These 
evaluations should be conducted by  an adolescent or pediatric ps ychiatrist. A subject must be 
discontinued from study  medication and referred for appropriate medical or psy chiatric 
evaluation and follow -up if there is:  
Apositive response 
to any question onthe C -SSRS ;
Ascore 15 for anxiety  or >15 for depression on the HADS (Appendix 3);
Moderate or severe adverse event 
as elicited through the use of the Neuropsy chiatric 
Adverse Event Interview .
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request , or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioural, 
or administrative reasons.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort 
should be made to contact the subject. In an y circumstance, every  effort should be made to 
document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the 
subject return for a final v isit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject regarding an y 
unresolved adverse events. 
7.ASSESSMENTS
7.1.Efficacy
7.1.1. Smoking Status
Smoking status will be assessed using a standard series of questions referred to as the 
Nicotine Use Inventory  (NUI) (Appendix 1).  The subject responds Yes or No to questions 
about cigarette or other nicotine/tobacco use since the last visit or during the past 7 days
.
The NUI is completed at each clinic vi sit and/or phone contact dur ing the treatment period 
and the follow -up period by  research staff based on subjects’ responses. 
All subjects will be provided with Smoking Diary  Worksheets to use as a tool to record how 
many  cigarettes they  have smoked each day .The Smoking Diary  itself will not be 
data-based.
7.1.2. Urine Cotinine Testing
In order to confirm the self-reported abstinence from smoking urine cotinine testing will be 
done at the site at Weeks 9- 12 during the treatment phase and all clinic visits during the 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 36follow -up phase.  The test indicates a positive result when the cotinine in the urine exceeds 
200ng/mL.
7.1.3. Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence
The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence provides a short, self -reported measure of 
dependency  on nicotine. This test will be com pleted at screening onl y.The test’s questions 
and scale are shown in (Appendix 2). This should be scored and reviewed by  the PI prior to 
randomization. 
7.2.Safety
7.2.1. Laboratory
The following safet y laboratory  tests will be performed at protocol- specified time points 
(details 
in Table 1Schedule of Activities). Where practical, subjects should be fasted, 
however, if not appropriate designation should be made on the laboratory  requisition.

Female subjects with a positive pregnancy  test during the treatment period must 
discontinue study  medications but should be encouraged to remain in the study . 
Pregnancy  tests may  be repeated for confirmation, as per request of IRB/IECs, or if 
required b y local regulations.
Safety  laboratory  tests from Screening must have no clinically  significant findings, as 
judged b y the investigator, in order for a subject to be dosed at baseline.
Additional safet y measurements m ay be obtained if deemed necessary  by appropriate study  
personnel.
7.2.1.1. Blood Volume
Total blood sampling volume for the individual adolescent subject is approximately  69mL.

7.2.1.2. Shipment of Laboratory Samples
The shipment address and contact information will be provided to the investigator sites prior 
to initiation of the trial.
7.2.2. Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after subjects have rested in a sitting position 
for approximately  5 minutes.  Sitting blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured with the 
subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  The 
same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used throughout the trial.   In addition to 
these first measurements, blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after subjects have 
been supine for approximately  5minutes, and then orthostatic blood press ure will 
immediately  be recorded when t he subject is asked to stand.  The pulse should also be 
recorded at the times that the BP is recorded.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properl y sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pre ssure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, although, when done manuall y, pulse rate will be 
measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds.  The blood pressure and pulse 
rate s hould be obtained prior to the blood collection.
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at screening, baseline, and weekl y visits 
during the 12 -week treatment period.  
7.2.3. Physical Examinations
A phy sical examination including height and weight will b e performed at screening visit b y 
trained medical personnel. Height and weight will be collected again at Baseline and at the 
Week 12 end -of-treatment visit or early  termination if prior to Week 12. Height and weight 
must be measured at least three times.  Weight should be obtained with a calibrated scale and 
height should be measured with a stadiometer.  
CDC growth charts will be provided to investigators to record height and weight.

The Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire- Revised, a brief self -repor t measure of past suicidal 
behavior,15will be completed b y subjects at the Screening visit.
7.2.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)
The Columbia suicide Severity  Rating Scale (CSSRS)16is a set of suggested questions 
designed to elicit information about passive and active suicidal ideation, active suicidal 
intent, and self injurious behavior.
The C -SSRS will be completed by  a mental health professional (adolesc ent psy chiatrist or 
PhD psy chologist )
, at screening and at each subsequent clinic visit up to and including 
Week 52. 
7.2.6.
Actively Solicited Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events (Appendix 4)
The NAEI will be conducted at every  clinic visit from baseline through Week 52.  The 
Neurops ychiatric Adverse Event Interview (NAEI) must be conducted b y a qualified mental 
health professional, who will actively  inquire about the following t ype of adverse events: 
depression, anxiety , delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, ps ychosis, mania, panic, agitation, 
dissociative states, feeling abnormal, hostility , aggression and homicidal ideation. If a 
subject has a positive response to an y item on the 
NAEI , a determination will be made by  the
investigator as to whether this meets criteria for an adverse event. If it does meet criteria as 
an adverse event it will be recorded on the adverse event pages of the Case Report Form.  
Dosing must be stopped if an adverse event moderate or severe in na ture is elicited through 
thisinterview. 
Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS) (Appendix 3).
The Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale (HADS) measures anxiety  and depression in 
hospital and community  set
tings and has also been validated in the adolescent outpatient 
population.17  It is a patient completed questionnair e that establishes the presence and 
severit y of both anxiety  (7 questions) and depression (7 qu estions) ( Appendix 3).  
The HADS is a self -report scale and contains 14 items rated on 4 -point Likert -type scales. 
Two subscales assess depression and anxiety .The HADS will be completed by  the subject at 
every clinic visit through Week 52.  Dosing must be stopped if the HADS score for either 
depression or anxiey  is 15.
Subjects’ self -
report via the HADS is aimed to more full y characterize potential depression 
and anxiety  related events. These additional mea surements will be collected and evaluated in 
a different manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  No attempt will be made 
to resolve an y apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and 
the additional data collected from subjects using the HADS self -report.  These additional data 
will be presented in separate tables, separate figures, and separate data listings, and will be 
reviewed in the final study report.

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 39Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from the self -reported HADS data but 
rather from the spontaneously  reported information, the NAEI and the CSSRS data described 
above, recorded on the adverse event pages from the Case Report Form (CRF).
7.3.Pharmacokinetics (PK)
7.3.1. Plasma for Analysis of Varenicline:
Blood samples (3 mL) sufficient to provide a minimum of 1 mL  of plasma for 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be collected at protocol specified time -points ( see Table 1
Schedule of Activities) into appropriatel y labeled tubes contain ing sodium heparin. These 
PK samples should not all be collected at the same time after dosing.  A distribution of 
sampling should be encouraged, possibl y through randomly scheduling sampling throughout 
the visit day .  The times of study  drug dosing for t he prior 2 doses as well as the time of the 
blood drawing will be recorded at each of these visits on the source document and data 
collection tool (eg, CRF) . 
The samples should be cooled on ice or in a refrigerator at -2- 8°C (this procedure is meant to 
mi
nimize hemoly sis and mazimize plasma y ield from the whole blood), then centrifuged for 
about 10 minutes at 1400-1700 x g. Plasma is to be transferred to appropriately  labeled 
screw -capped pol yprop ylene tubes provided b y the Central Laboratory .The tubes with 
plasma samples should then be stored at -20°C within one hour of blood collection. Samples 
will be anal yzed using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard 
operating procedures.
7.3.2. Shipment of PK Samples
The shipment address and c ontact information will be provided to the investigator site prior 
to initiation of the trial.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to t ime there may be 
circumstances, outside the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety  and 
well-being of the subject.  When a protocol req uired test cannot be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventative actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. 
The study  team will be informed of the se incidents in a timely  fashion.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
The adolescent subjects will be instructed to tell the study  doctor immediately  if they  
experience an y side effects, injury , symptoms or complaints.  They  will be provided a 
24 -hour telephone contact number to reach the research site staff. 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 40All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections.
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notifica tion to Pfizer or its 
designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained 
by the investigator to determine the causality  of the adverse event.  The investigator is 
required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or 
its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs 
with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y review conducted b y the Sponsor, any non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
trial.
8.2.Reporting Period
For serious adverse events,
(SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the subje ct’s participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing an y 
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through the last subject 
visit. Should an investigator be made aware of a ny serious adverse event occurring any  time 
after the active reporting period, it must be promptly  reported if a causal relationship to 
investigational product is suspected. 
Adverse events (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the 
time the subject /legal guardian provides informed conse nt/assent through last subject

8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationsh ip with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 41Progression/worsening of underl yingdisease ;
Drug abuse ;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose ;
Drug withdrawal ;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (in Utero );
Exposure via breast feeding ;
Medication error .
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additi onal diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be a n adverse event by  the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting a s an adverse event.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any  untoward medical occurrence 
at an y dose that:

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 42Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect ;
Lack of efficacy  should be reported a s an adverse event when it is associated with a 
serious adverse event.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  
life-threatening an d/or result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the 
event may  jeopardize the subject and/or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other 
adverse event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.Potential Cases of Drug- Induc ed Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bili rubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered pot ential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory
 values:
a.Subjects with AST or ALT baseline values within the normal range who subsequently  
present with AST or ALT 3 times the upper limit of normal concurrent with a total 
bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal with no evidence of hemol ysis and an 
alkaline phosphatase 2 times the upper limit of norma l or not available.
For subjects with preexisti ng ALT ORAST ORtotal bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 43For subjects with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline valu es above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  3 XULN, or 
8 XULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with: 
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased by  one time the upper limit of normal or  3times the 
upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evalu ation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment. In addition to repeating 
AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bili rubin, direct 
and indirect bilirubin, GGT, prothrombin time/ internat ional normalized ratio (INR) and 
alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , 
occupational exposure, sexual history , trave l history , history  of contact with a jaundiced 
subject, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, 
should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract ) may  be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the 
laboratory criteria defined above with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the 
time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all t he 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such 
potential Hy ’s Law cases should be reported as serious adverse events.
8.7.Hospitalization
Adverse events reported from studies associated with hospitalization or prol ongations of 
hospitalization are considered serious.  An y initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility  meets these criteria.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospital 
to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the ps ychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor 
to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 44Routine emergency  room admissions;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition 
(eg, for work -up of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associ ated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (eg, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE ;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event.  
For purposes of consiste ncy, these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinc tion between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event (SAE) .  For example, a headache may  be severe 
(interferes significantl y with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as seri ous 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non- serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 45requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event ; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section on 
Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality  assessmen t is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study  
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure D uring Pregnancy ( Also Referred to as Exposure In Utero )
For investi gational products and for marketed products, an exposure in -utero (EIU) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly  exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the 
fema le becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly  
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure);
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the 
investigational product prior to or arou nd the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy  (paternal exposure).
If any stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the in vestigator must submit this 
information to Pfizer on an Exposure in Utero Form.  I n addition, the investigator must 
submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant 
woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product 
by inhalation or spillage) using the Exposure in Utero Form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy .  
The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to induced termination of pregnancy ).If at an y time a study  subject 
becomes or is found to be pregnant and a pregnancy  registry  is ongoing, the subject will be 
enrolled in the p regnancy registry . 
Follow -upis conducted to obtain pregnancy  outcome information on all Exposure in Utero 
reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination ( ie, induced abortion) and then notify  Pfizer of the 
outcome.  The investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Exposure 
in Utero Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is 
not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy  is not usuall y 
viable.  Rather, a serious adverse event case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy .

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 46If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious 
adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  
[including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.
In the case of a live bir th, the “normality ” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
(ie, no minimum follow -up period of a presumably  normal infant is required before an 
Exposure in Utero Form can be completed).  The “normality ” of an aborted fetus can be 
assessed b y gross visual inspection, unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a 
congenital anomal y.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are classified as serious adverse 
events follows: 
“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causalit y, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after 
1month that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the exposure in utero to 
the investigational medication should be reported.
Additional information regarding the exposure in utero may  be requested by  the investigator.  
Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up 
on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator must obtain permission from the subject’s partner in order to conduct any  
follow -up or collect an y information.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient 
response, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page.  
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse e vent, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  report ed by  the study  subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be 
questioned about adverse events.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 478.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator
awareness of the event by the investigator.  In particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal 
or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent 
of available adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new 
information (follow -up) on previously  forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to 
the initial and follow -up reporting of Exposure in Utero and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the o ccurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may  be requested by  Pfizer to obtain spe cific additional follow -up information in 
an expedited fashion.  This information may  be more detailed than that captured on the 
adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a description of the adverse 
event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and 
independent determination of possible causalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the 
event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a 
subject death, a summa ry of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to Pfizer or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be us ed on both forms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information.
8.13.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) and the Statistical Rulebook, 
which will be dated and maintained by the sponsor, before the time of database release.  The 
reasons for an y departure from the planned method of anal ysis will be fully documented.

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 489.1.Sample Size Determination
Although analy sis for the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be model based, the sample size 
calculation is based on a two -sided Chi -Square test with a 0.05 significance level and a 
1:1:1 randomization ratio of vareniclin e 1 mg BID to varenicline 0.5 mg BID to placebo.  
The study  is powered at 80% or greater to detect varenicline (1 mg BID or 0.5 mg BID dose) 
vs. placebo differences in the CQR from Weeks 9 through 12 . The sample size is based on 
CQR of 9% and 24 % for plac ebo and varenicline respectivel y, or an odds ratio of 3.2.  
A sample size of 300 subjects randomized to varenicline or placebo in a 1:1:1 (100 to 
varenicline 1 mg BID, 100 to varenicline 0.5 mg BID, 
100 to placebo) will provide 
approximately 80% power to detect a difference in the primary  endpoint between varenicline 
and placebo groups, assuming a true Week 9 -12 CQR of 9% and 24% for placebo and 
varenicline respectively .  
Enrollment will be stratified by  age group (12
-16 vs. 17 -19) and sufficient subjects will be 
enrolled in the 12 -16 year old age group to detect a difference in the primary  endpoint 
between varenicline and placebo groups, assuming a true Week 9 -12 CQR of 9% and 
29%for placebo and varenicline respectivel y. 
In order to ensure sufficient subjects are enrolled in the 12- 16 year old stratum, the 
17-19 year old stratum will be capped at a maximum of 90 subjects, leaving at least 
210subjects (approximately  70 subjects per treatment group) in the 12 -16 year old stratum
.
Efficacy Analysis
The pri mary  efficacy  inference for the study  is a comparison of varenicline to placebo for the 
CQR for Weeks 9 through 12.  This measure will be obtained through reports of cigarette or 
other nicotine use since the last study  visit confirmed by  urine cotinine . An exploratory  
subgroup anal ysis for each dosing group b y weight stratum for the primary endpoint will be 
provided.
All efficacy  analy ses will be performed overall as well as on the subgroup of patients who 
are 12 -16 years of age.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoin ts are listed in Section 2.2.
These efficacy  endpoints will be based on subject self -report, with abstinence confirmed by  
cotinine.
To assess the comparability  of subjects across treatment groups, demographic, smoking 
history , and baseline nicotine dependence and other baseline characteristics will be 
summarized by  treatment group.  In addition, subgroup summaries and analyses may be 
completed, when the number of subjects in the subgroups permits, to evaluate the 
consistency  of the efficacy  in the primary  and key
 secondary  endpoints over demographic 
and other baseline characteristics.  

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 49Data collected at baseline and other time points will be summarized by  treatment group using 
descriptive statistics.  Descriptive statistics, suc h as the mean, median, standard deviation, 
and range will be used to summarize continuous variables, and counts and percentages for 
categorical variables.  In addition to tabulated descriptive statistics, graphical data display s 
may be used to summarize th e data.  
9.1.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Logistic regression models will be used in the analy ses of primary  endpoint. The model will 
include strata, treatment ,and center as independent variables.  Treatment by  center 
interaction will be investigated.  If the treatment by  center interaction is significant in the 
model containing treatment, center, and treatment by  center interaction, then exploratory  
analyses will be undertaken to explain the nature and source of the interaction.  However, the 
reported p- values will be based on the main effects model.  
Additional analy ses may  be performed adjusting for baseline covariates as additive terms to 
the primary  model, if necessary .  Results from an y additional anal yses will not be used as a 
substitute for the plan ned anal yses, but may  be used as supplemental information for the 
study  report. 
Statistical hy potheses for the primary  endpoint will be tested in an ordered fashion to 
preserve overall Type I Error.  The 1 mg BID group will be tested against placebo, and if a 
statistically  significant difference is observed, the 0.5 mg BID group will be tested against 
placebo. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically  significant in both tests. Both 
tests will be presented regardless of the p -value obtained.
Theprimary  efficacy  analy sis population will be all subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
randomized study  medication ( Full A nalysis set ).  Subjects who discontinue the study  are 
assumed to be smokers for the time point of discontinuation through the end of t he study .  In 
computing responder rates, subjects who discontinue the study  will be included in the 
denominator but not in the numerator, regardless of their last smoking status evaluation. 
9.1.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
9.1.2.1. Efficacy Endpoints
There are seve ral secondary  smoking abstinence endpoints for this study , as indicated in 
Section 2.2.  Each of these binary  secondary  endpoints will be analy zed using procedures 
similar to that described above for the primary  efficacy  endpoi nt.  All statistical tests will be 
two-sided and at a 0.05 level of significance.  P -values will be reported with no adjustments 
for the analy sis of multiple secondary  endpoints.  
The number of cigarettes smoked over the past seven day s will be collected by completion of 
the NUI at each visit.  The reduction in the number of the cigarettes smoked will be 
calculated at each visit by  subtracting the reported number of cigarettes smoked in the past 
7days at each visit from the number of cigarettes smoked in 
the past 7 days reported at the 
baseline visit.  L ongitudinal repeated measures models including strata, treatment, center, 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 50and baseline number of cigarettes smoked will be used to assess the effect of treatment on the 
reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The plasma concentration- time data collected in this study  will be anal yzed via nonlinear 
mixed effects (NONMEM software) to describe the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
varenicline including an assessment of covaria te effects in adolescent smokers. 
Varenicline exposure data derived from the individual Bay esian estimates of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be subsequentl y utilized to characterize the population 
exposure -response relationships for selected measures of efficacy  and safety /tolerability  of 
varenicline in this pediatric population. Model development may  require the use of data 
from previous clinical studies. An anal ysis plan describing the details of the model building, 
covariate assessment and model validation will be provided separatel y before the unblinding 
of the data.
9.2.Safety Analysis
All safet y anal yses will be performed overall as well as on the subgroup of patients who are 
12-16 years of age.   Laboratory and other safety  data will be subjected t o clinical review and 
summarized, using Pfizer Data Standards, b y frequencies of events and mean changes from 
Baseline.  
The following summaries will be used to assess the safet y of subjects in this study :
Incidence and t ype of AEs ;
Incidence and t ype o f SAEs ;  
Change from ba seline in laboratory  parameters;  
Incidence of clinicall y significant laboratory  parameters ;  
Change from baseline in vital signs ;  
Incidence of clinicall y significant vital sign parameters ;  
Frequency  and percent of subjects en dorsing suicidal ideation or behavior.
All safet y anal yses will use the population of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study  drug.  
In addition to the standard safet y summaries for the vital signs data collected at each visit, the 
change from Baseline in BMI at Week 12 will be summarized by  treatment group. Change 
from Baseline in BMI and any  other safet y endpoints of interest may be summarized for 
subgroups of interest if the number of subjects in the subgroup permits.

Not pl anned .
9.4.Data Monitoring Committee 
Anexternal Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to review 
data during the course of the study  for safety  monitoring and assessing risk benefit.  Based on 
their review the IDMC will make a recom mendation to continue, modify  or stop the study .  
The IDMC members will be selected from a pool of experts including one statistician, a 
psychiatrist and an expert in pediatric studies.  The IDMC will meet before study  start to 
discuss and finalize the charter.
The frequency  of meetings will be dependent upon subject enrollment.  It is suggested that 
the first data review will take place after 30 subjects complete 12 weeks of treatment.  
Subsequently  data reviews will take place in increments of 50 subjects completing the 
12
week treatment period, and as subjects complete the 9 month follow -up period; or at a 
minimum of two times a year. Serious adverse event (SAE) reports will be provided to the 
IDMC on a real -time basis. The frequency  of meetings will be adjusted b y the IDMC chair 
as she/he considers appropriate to fulfill the
IDMC's responsibilities.
Details will be outlined in the IDMC charter.
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects in 
the study  accor ding to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the DMC to alter the 
conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  In this instance, 
such disease -related efficacy  endpoints are not reported individually  as SAEs. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Pfizer, or 
companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate 
regulatory  authorities.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available duri ng the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

Page 5211.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole proper ty of Pfizer and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the accuracy , authenticit y, and timely 
collection and reporting of all clinical, safety , laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and an y 
other data collection forms. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or by  an 
authorized staff member to attest that the d ata contained on the CRFs is true. Any 
corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and 
explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry .” 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or t he phy sician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer, the invest igator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copies of all CRFs, serious adverse event forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to I CH, local regulation s, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study  Agreement, whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  T he 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent part y arranged b y Pfizer.  Investigator 
records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or disc ontinuation of the 
study  or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain 
Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements 
have been met.

12.1. Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicabl e, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducte d in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2008). 
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws . Subject names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be 
replaced b y a numerical code consisting of a numberi ng system provided by  Pfizer in order 
to de -identify  the trial subject. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality  and protection of subject personal data.
The informed consent form must be in compliance with I CH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent form used in this study , and any  changes made during the course of the 
study , must be prospectively  approved b y both the IRB/IEC and Pfizer before use.
The investigator must ensur e that each study  subject, or his/her legally  acceptable 
representative, is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by  the 
investigator, will ob tain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legally  
acceptable representative before an y stud y-specific activity  is performed.  Direct assent of 
the adolescent subject must also be obtained.  Parental consent is not required for subjec ts 
over the age of 18.  These subjects must sign their own informed consent document.  The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent / assent form.

Clinical Practice ( GCP )
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately
.  
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.

(other than the Stud y results themselves) before disclosure.
If the Study  is part of a multi -centre study , Investigator agrees that the first publication is to 
be a joint publication covering all centers. However, if a joint manuscript has not been 
submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the Stu dy at all 
participating sites, Investigator is free to publish separately , subject to the other requirements 
of this Section.
For all publications relating to the Study , Institution will comply  with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical 
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for

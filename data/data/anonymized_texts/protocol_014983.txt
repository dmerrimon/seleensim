Pro
vide a summary of the background and purpose of the study in language that can be understood b
y a person without a
medical degree.
Infected broken bones that don't heal are a dif
ficult clinical problem that significantly af
fect patient quality of life. Current methodology for detecting bacteria (growth in
laboratory cultures) is inadequate to detect infections caused by bacteria existing in a biofilm, which is the layer of "slime" found in the presence of foreign bodies (eg,
implanted metal devices to fix broken bones). Advances in molecular biology have allowed development of highly sensitive tests to detect bacteria in the biofilm state.
However
, the limited prior research has not included control groups or compared the performance of dif
ferent highly sensitive tests. T
o address these limitations and
further define the role of highly sensitive bacterial tests in clinical practice, we hypothesize that there will be increasing bacterial burden when comparing clean broken
bone surgery (1st surgery) to implanted metal device 
removal (2nd surgery
, bone healed) to index nonunion surgery (subsequent surgery
, bone not healed) as measured
by percentage of cases being positive for bacteria using highly sensitive bacterial tests. Further
, the highly sensitive bacterial tests (Illumina MiSeq system and Ibis
T5000 biosensor) will have similar ability to quantify the number of bacteria and dif
ferentiate bacterial species. Eligible patients will consist of three groups. Group 1 is
clean broken bone surgery undergoing plate and screw fixation, intramedullary nailing fixation where the fracture site is accessible, or staged treatment of a broken
bones initially treated by joint spanning external fixation device. Group 2 will include patients having a plate and screws removed without clinical evidence of infection.
Group 3 will be patients undergoing an initial procedure for fracture nonunion. T
issue obtained at the time of surgery will be sent to the research laboratory for culture and
performance of the two highly sensitive tests. The tissue samples taken will be tissue normally removed and discarded in the course of these particular procedures. The
rates of positivity for culture and the highly sensitive tests will be compared amongst the three groups. W
e will also compare bacterial count and the distribution of
bacterial species found using the two highly sensitive tests. These data will then undergo statistical analysis against clinical data gathered from review of the patients’
charts. The overall project goal is to establish the clinical relevance of highly sensitive bacterial tests in diagnosing infected nonunions. The ability to more accurately
identify patients with infection may lead to a change in clinical decision making with respect to surgical procedure or antibiotic treatment. This project will develop an
improved understanding of the potential role of highly sensitive bacterial tests in diagnosing infected nonunions compared to the current standard of care, which is
growing bacteria in the laboratory under artificial conditions.

hypotheses will be tested:
1. There will be increasing bacterial burden when comparing clean index fracture surgery (1st surgery) to hardware removal (2nd surgery
, bone healed) to index
nonunion surgery (subsequent surgery
, bone not healed) as measured by percentage of cases yielding a positive result using highly sensitive bacterial assays. 
Further
,
the highly sensitive bacterial assays will have a higher percentage of positive results compared to standard hospital culture based methods. 
2. The highly sensitive bacterial assays Illumina MiSeq system and Ibis T5000 biosensor will have similar ability to semiquantify bacterial load and dif
ferentiate bacterial
species for clean index fracture surgery (1st surgery), hardware removal (2nd surgery
, bone healed), and index nonunion surgery (subsequent surgery
, bone not healed).
The specific aims associated with each hypothesis is as follows:
Specific Aim #1: T
o establish baseline bacterial burden for common orthopaedic trauma procedures as measured by highly sensitive bacterial assays under modern
perioperative antibiotic protocols and compare them to standard hospital culture based methods. 
Specific Aim #2: T
o compare the ability of two highly sensitive bacterial assays (Illumina MiSeq system and Ibis T5000 biosensor) to semiquantify bacterial load and
dif
ferentiate bacterial species in common orthopaedic trauma procedures.

, use of control subjects, etc.:
The study subjects will be patients who agree to participate in this prospective trial. Three groups of patients will be identified: 1) clean index fracture surgery (1st
surgery), 2) hardware removal (2nd surgery
, bone healed), and 3) index nonunion surgery (subsequent surgery
, bone not healed). Specifically
, group 1 will consist of
closed fractures undergoing open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), intramedullary nailing (IMN) where the fracture site is accessible, or staged treatment of a pilon or
plateau that was initially treated by joint spanning external fixation. Group 2 will include patients having a plate removed without clinical evidence of infection and
excluding history of open fracture. Group 3 will be patients that are undergoing an index procedure for fracture nonunion. The definition of nonunion and indication for
surgery will be at the discretion of the attending surgeon. T
ime from initial surgical treatment of the fracture to index nonunion surgery will be at least six months. There is
not randomization as the study is a prospective observational design. Group 1, clean index fracture surgery
, is the control group for this study
. In order to make sure that
patients do not have latent infections, patients who do not complete a 6-month standard follow-up with their surgeon in clinic will be contacted by phone. W
e will only
seek to know if the patient has had any infections or complications since their surgery
.

Describe the relev
ant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. Describe an
y relev
ant preliminary data:
Nonunions are a dif
ficult clinical problem for both the patient and surgeon. Studies have shown that nonunion significantly decreases patients health related quality of life
measures. There are several factors that may be responsible for fracture nonunion, one if which is infection. The presence of infection complicates the problem, with one
third of
f of patients requiring additional procedures. From a clinical perspective, knowing the likelihood of infection preoperatively may lead to a change in plan (eg,
choosing a type of procedure that does not place metal at the nonunion site). Additionally
, an accurate diagnosis of the pathogenic bacteria will guide postoperative
antibiotic decision making. Attempts have been made to improve the preoperative diagnosis of infection in patients undergoing nonunion surgery
, but the gold standard
remains purulence encountered at the time of surgery or identification of a bacterial species from culture of intraoperative specimens. Recent work calls into question the
utility of culture based methods compared to highly sensitive assays for the detection of bacteria. This proposal seeks to further elucidate the relevance of highly
sensitive assays for the detection of bacteria at fracture nonunion sites.

* 
Pro
vide the scientific or scholarly background, r
ationale, and significance of the research and how it will add to existing
knowledge:
Bacteria exist in planktonic and biofilm forms. It is increasingly recognized that the biofilm form occurring in the presence of foreign material (eg, metallic implants) is the
culprit biology in many orthopaedic infections. The current gold standard method for establishing the identity of the infecting organism is microbiologic laboratory culture.
Unfortunately
, culture is insuf
ficient in ability to identify bacteria that exist in the biofilm state, partially due to the selection pressure posed by restrictive, artificial growth
conditions. In fact, some bacterial species are not culturable. These issues reflect the bias of culture methodology
. Additionally
, several prior studies looking at
orthopaedic procedures and hardware removals in patients without signs of infection have yielded positive culture results in up to 58% of cases, whereas culture results
from patients undergoing nonunion surgery have ranged from ~12-37%. Clearly
, the overlap in percent positive cultures from clinically seeming dissimilar groups makes
interpretation of the data dif
ficult, as some bacteria may be contaminant or commensal. Advances in molecular biology techniques have allowed the development of
highly sensitive assays for detecting the presence of bacteria. T
wo recent studies compared culture positivity to positive results from highly sensitive assays for patients
with open fractures and patients undergoing nonunion surgery
. The highly sensitive techniques (Illumina MiSeq system and Ibis T5000 biosensor) were positive at a rate
>3.6 times that of culture. This has led some to question whether the results of intraoperative cultures obtained during nonunion surgery should be trusted, particularly
ones that are negative, as the culture methodology may not be picking up ‘occult/subclinical’ infections. This finding is akin to recent trends in the total joint arthroplasty
literature. Again, many patients with suspected infected total joint replacements undergoing revision surgery are culture negative, but they are positive for bacteria when
highly sensitive assays are employed. However
, before adoption of highly sensitive assays in clinical practice, it is imperative to understand the unique facets and
establish the clinical relevance of the results. As an example, in one study 5/7 (71%) of patients undergoing index total knee arthroplasty were positive using the Ibis
T5000 biosensor
, but only one of these patients went on to a revision surgery for infection, and the bacteria that was identified at revision surgery was dif
ferent than that
at index surgery
. T
o further elucidate the role of highly sensitive bacterial assays in identifying infected nonunions, we propose a prospective evaluation of bacterial
burden in routine orthopaedic trauma procedures. This will improve upon prior literature by including relevant control groups and comparing two highly sensitive assays
ability to semiquantify bacterial load and dif
ferentiate bacterial species. Infected fracture nonunions are challenging clinical problems for both patient and surgeon. The
ability to more accurately identify patients with infection may lead to a change in clinical decision making with respect to surgical procedure or antibiotic treatment. This
project will develop an improved understanding of the potential role of highly sensitive bacterial assays in diagnosing infected nonunions compared to the current
standard of care, microbiologic culture.

If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below. (If this study is a collaborative UM/VA
study please list each procedure that is being conducted and the locations where it is being conducted.)

* 
Describe all procedures being performed for research purposes only (these procedures would not be done if individuals were
not in the study) and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safet
y or to
minimiz
e risks: 
There will be several patients requiring a single blood draw to obtain ESR, CRP
, and WBC. It is standard of care for patients undergoing nonunion surgery to have these
labs drawn prior to surgery
. However
, not every surgeon in our department draws these labs before hardware removal procedures. So, the one procedure being
performed for research purposes only would be a one time blood draw to obtain ESR, CRP
, and WBC from patients undergoing hardware removal that did not have one
prior to surgery or the rare nonunion case that does not have these lab tests within one month prior to surgery
. These blood draws would be performed on the day of
surgery pre-operatively
. The patient will not occur any additional needle sticks associated with these blood draws as they will already be receiving IV placement for
anesthesia, and the blood tests would be drawn at the time of IV placement. The study will pay for any ESR, CRP
, WBC obtained that the surgeon did not want as part of
standard of care. At 6 months after surgery
, many patients will have a standard of care follow-up with their surgeon. If this follow-up does not take place, we will contact
these patients by phone to determine if they have experienced any infections or complications since their surgery
.
 
2
* 
Describe all procedures already being performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes (if not applicable to the study
, enter
"N/A"):
The procedures being performed for treatment purposes are, 1. closed fractures undergoing open reduction internal fixation, intramedullary nailing where the fracture site
is accessible, or staged treatment of a pilon or plateau fracture that was initially treated by joint spanning external fixation; 2. plate and screw removal; and 3. index
procedure for fracture nonunion. In each of these surgical procedures tissue samples will be obtained for research culture and testing with highly sensitive bacterial
assays. All of the tissue samples will come from tissue that would be debrided or discarded as part of the normal routine for that operation. Patients are normally advised
to follow-up with their surgeon up to 6 months to 1 year after their surgery
.

section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.

vide the r
ationale and sample siz
e calculations for the proposed target population:
The primary outcome from specific aim #1 is percentage of cases yielding a positive result. With three groups, there will be three comparisons: 1) clean index fracture
surgery to hardware removal, 2) clean index fracture surgery to index nonunion surgery
, and 3) hardware removal to index nonunion surgery
. Using a Bonferroni
correction starting at p = 0.05, α will be set at 0.016667. W
e will set the power at 0.8, or β = 0.2.
A prior work with the Ibis T5000 biosensor highly sensitive assay showed 88% of the nonunion cases were positive for bacteria. W
e will conservatively estimate 80% in

our series. W
e assume a 50% reduction in percentage of cases positive in the hardware removal group, yielding an estimate of 40% positive cases. For clean index
fracture surgery
, one would anticipate a low rate of percentage positive cases. However
, given the highly sensitive nature of these assays, we will conservatively estimate
10% of the cases to be positive.
Using a standard estimation of sample size for comparing two binomial proportions (http://www
.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html), 43 patients per group are required
for comparison 1, 14 for comparison 2, and 30 for comparison 3. W
e will thus attempt to enroll 43 patients in the clean index fracture surgery and hardware removal
groups and 30 patients in the index nonunion surgery group to be adequately powered to test the main hypothesis of specific aim #1 given the above stated
assumptions.
In specific aim #2 the primary outcome is semiquantification of bacterial load, a continuous variable. The rate of clinical infection in clean index fracture surgery and
hardware removal is low; in contrast, nonunions have a rate of at least 12.7% in larger patient cohorts. 
Based on there being 500 fold dif
ference in number of
Staphylococci needed to cause skin infection when a foreign body is present, a parametric power analysis comparing means amongst groups with a standard deviation
equal to 20% of the mean (again using a Bonferroni correction starting at p = 0.05, α = 0.016667, power at 0.8, β = 0.2) revealed that less than 30 patients were needed
in all groups. Thus, our proposed sample size for specific aim #1 satisfies the number of patients needed to make the planned comparisons of specific aim #2.
Additionally
, the two recent studies comparing culture positivity to positive results from highly sensitive assays for patients with open fractures and patients undergoing
nonunion surgery had 30 and 34 patients, respectively
. 
Based on CPT codes, review of clinical activity at our trauma center in the year prior to this proposal (July 2014-July 2015) showed 409 hardware removals and 56
nonunion surgeries on the tibia/fibula alone. Assuming a 20% refusal to participate rate, we would meet the proposed 30 patients in the nonunion group within one year
.
Of note, there were 51 additional nonunion procedures when including the clavicle, humerus, forearm, and femur from which we will be enrolling patients.

Pro
vide the plan for data analysis. Include in the description the t
ypes of comparisons that are planned (e.g.
, comparison of
means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of v
ariance, etc.),  which is the primary comparison/analysis, and
how the analyses proposed will relate to the primary purposes of the study:
There will be three comparisons: 1) clean index fracture surgery to hardware removal, 2) clean index fracture surgery to index nonunion surgery
, and 3) hardware
removal to index nonunion surgery
. The number of cases positive for bacteria in each of these groups will be compared against the others via comparing two binomial
proportions. This is the primary outcome of specific aim #1. In specific aim #2, the outcome variable is bacterial count, and comparison of each group to the others will be
a comparison of means. Additionally
, though not part of the primary outcome power analysis, post-hoc testing beginning with univariate analysis will be used to look for
any relationship between the clinically gathered data (eg, ESR, CRP
, and WBC; patient demographics and comorbidities; injury characteristics; post-operative outcomes)
and positivity for bacteria based on culture or the highly sensitive assays. Significant univariate variables will then be assessed via a multivariate analysis.

obtained, but instead participants who are enrolled using a LAR will be re-consented when they are able to consent for themselves.
The choice of LAR will follow standard procedures. The following with be approached in this order of priority:
• Legal guardian 
• Proxy (health care agent) named in an advance directive or durable power of attorney for health care;
• Family member or other surrogate identified by the state law on health care decisions. 
Guidance will be provided to assist the LAR in making the consent decision. They will advised to base the decision on the participant’
s expressed wishes, or
, if these are
not known, what they believe the participant would have desired under the circumstances of the injury
, their beliefs and values. If the LAR does not know what the
participant would have wanted, the LAR will advised to base the decision with the participant’
s best interest in mind. They will be asked to carefully consider how much
leeway the participant would likely give the LAR in making the choice about participation in the study
.
Recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, the study team will encourage the participants to ask additional questions that may arise during the course of their
participation in the study
.

If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer box below.
1
* 
Individually list each research-related risk, using a separ
ate line for each.  Next to each risk, delineate the
lik
elihood/seriousness of the risk, and the pro
visions for minimizing the risk:
Blood draw - risk of further bleeding and site infection. Minimal risk. Unlikely that the patient will experience complications as it will be drawn on the day of surgery as the
IV is placed for anesthesia.
Safety issues related to this are only concerns related to patient privacy
.
There is a slight risk of a breach of confidentiality since there will be PHI accessed and recorded for the study however we will try to minimize this by maintaining
password-protected databases.

Potential Benefits and Alternatives
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1
* 
Describe the potential direct benefit(s) to participants:
While there are no direct benefits to patients participating in the study
, participation may help determine if highly sensitive bacterial assays are useful in determining if
fracture nonunions are infected.
2
* 
Describe the importance of the knowledge expected to result from the study:
The ability to more accurately identify patients with infection may lead to a change in clinical decision making with respect to surgical procedure or antibiotic treatment.

This project will develop an improved understanding of the potential role of highly sensitive bacterial assays in diagnosing infected nonunions compared to the current
standard of care, microbiologic culture.
3
* 
Describe how the potential risks to participants are reasonable in relationship to the potential benefits:
The breach of confidentiality is minimal. The benefits of properly identifying infected nonunions and treating them to improve patient quality of life and minimize the need
for further reconstructive procedures will have a much more profound and positive ef
fect.

 Page 6 of 13 Template Revis ed On : 7/26/2018  1.0 Study Intervention(s)/Investigational Agent(s)  
1.1 Description:  
The primary goal of this study is to investigate the qualitative and 
quantitative effects of SRP with and without minocycline HCL 
microspheres, 1 mg on periodontal pathogens and overall bacterial load.  
A randomized controlled clinical trial of a control (scaling and root planing)  
(SRP)) group and an experimental (SRP with minocycline HCl microspheres, 
1 mg) group is planned.  
 
The int ervention of minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg will be 
administered in the experimental group at baseline and the three month 
periodontal maintenance visit. Saliva samples, gingival crevicular fluid 
(GCF), and blood serum will be collected at four time po ints (baseline, 1, 3, 
and 6 month follow up). Saliva will be analyzed for overall pathogen 
burden. GCF will be analyzed for IL -1, IL-6, TNF -α, MMP -8. Serum will be 
analyzed for C -reactive protein (hsCRP), haptoglobin (Hp), hemoglobin 
(Hgb) Alc,  IL-1, IL-6, TNF -α, and MMP -8.  
 
Primary: Investigate the pathogenic burden and overall bacterial load 
utilizing the MyPerioPath® salivary test as a measure of the effect of SRP 
with and without minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg.  
 
Secondary: Evaluate the effects of SRP with and without minocycline HCl 
microspheres, 1 mg on serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation, 
including IL -1, IL-6, TNF -α, MMP -8, hsCRP, Hp, and Hgb A1c  and GCF levels 
of IL -, IL-6, TNF -α, MMP -8. 
1.2 Drug/Device Handling:  
Minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg are approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to SRP procedures for reduction of 
pocket depth in patients with adult periodontitis . Minocycline HCL, 1 mg is 
a subgingival unit dose of 4 mg of drug containing 1 mg o f minocycline and 
3 mg of poly (glycolide -co-dl-lactide) (PGLA). The drug is in a powder form 
and prepackaged in a disposal plastic cartridge tip. The tip is loaded into a 
stainless steel spring - loaded cartridge handle to deliver subgingivally. The 
packag ing is clearly labeled for the administration of the drug.  
 
Minocycline HCL, 1 mg will be stored in a locked cabinet in the U of M SoD 
Oral Health Clinical Research Clinic (OHCRC) at room temperature (68o to 
77o F). The product will not be exposed to heat or pressure.

The drug is prepackaged and no preparation is required. The prepackaged 
drug is located inside a disposal plastic cartridge tip to ensure exact dosage 
delivered. The tip is loaded into a stainless steel spring -loaded cartridge 
handle to  deliver subgingivally.

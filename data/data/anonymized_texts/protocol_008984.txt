Summary of changes for protocol versions prior to version  4.0 
No samples for exploratory biomarkers were analyzed.  
The following changes to the global protocol V1.0 (dated 19 September 2017 ) were included by 
amendments due to requests from the authorities : 
The Protocol V1.1 for the EU (dated 12 December 2017) introduced the following changes:  
• Inconsistencies between the body of the protocol, synopsis, and schedule of assessments
were harmonized to ensure an optimal study conduct.
• The timing of chest X -ray assessment was moved to the Pre -conditioning visit to better
reflect standard clinical pra ctice.
• References to the new IB and updated information on ADA were added.
The pr otocol  V2.0 for Germany ( dated 24 May 2018 ) introduced the following changes:  
• The study contact list was updated.
• It was added that the primary objective is to gather addition al efficacy data on
emapalumab in pHLH patients , and efficacy was removed from the first the secondary
objective.
• The timeframe for the medical supervision  of the infusions was extended from 1 hour to
2 hours, and it was added that active infections, as per patient’s clinical presentation,
have to be carefully followed over time .
• Viral load positivity, in particular for EBV, CMV and adenovirus, and evolution , was
removed from the exceptions for AE recording requirements.  Quantitative monito ring
(e.g., viral loads, antigenemia, and antigenuria) as relevant according to the patient’s
clinical presentation, requiring EBV and CMV quantitative PCR at a minimum  at
screening , was added .
• It was added  that any emergent safety concern will be  timely a ssessed and appropriate
measure will be taken for the patients, if relevant , by an iDMC .
• Another timepoint for vital signs measurement at 2 hours after the infusion was added.
• The estimate of the blood volume to be collected throughout the study was update d.
The Protocol V1.2 for the United Kingdom (dated 04 September 2018) introduced the following 
changes:  
• In response to comments from the British authority, the protocol section on contraception
was expanded.
• As an administrative change, contact details for 2 Sponsor  team members were updated.
Protocol V2.0 for North America  (dated 18 July 2018) introduced the following changes:  
• The study contact list was updated.
• Vital signs assessment s were made more frequent ly during each infusion when a dose
increase was applied and during the subsequent infusions in any patient who had
Page 2 of 98
experienced an IRR. The duration of monitoring after infusion was extended to up to 
2 hours for all patients. Clinically appropriate windows  were applied to these 
measurements.  
• The required duration of TB search testing was added as a footnote to the schedule of 
assessments . 
• In the rationale for dosing schema, simulations were updated to present the “worst -case” 
scenario in the dose escalation  schema, based on the updated, larger dataset accumulated 
in emapalumab development program that was previously submitted to FDA.  
• The considerations that could prompt the Investigator  to increase the emapalumab dose 
were further clarified. A dedicated dose  notification form was implemented to capture the 
specificities and reasoning around the Investigator  decision.  
• A higher flexibility around the possibility to add other HLH treatments in the first week 
of treatment, i.e., the use of etoposide (or other drugs) , could be considered on SD6 in a 
patient in whom an HLH worsening or no initial response was observed after the first 
emapalumab dose increase on SD3. With regard to the addition of other HLH treatments 
later during the study, definition of “u nsatisfactory HLH control” had replaced 
“unsatisfactory HLH improvement”, in order to better reflect the clinical conditions in 
which the Investigator  could decide so. For completeness in the guidance to the 
Investigator , a reference to section on decision  to discontinue treatment was  added.  
• A window of 1 day was introduced in the circumstances of weekly emapalumab 
infusions, to decrease study burden for these patients who were expected to be clinically 
stable and likely outpatients.  
• An iDMC  was appointed in place of the safety management team to regularly assess the 
benefit/risk profile of emapalumab treatment . 
• The requirement to particularly monitor signs of fluid retention and purpura was lifted, as 
these pathological elements were not jud ged to be specifically indicative of HLH. These 
signs and symptoms were collected in accordance with general principles of AE 
recording.  
• To ensure correct questionnaire completion, the patient name field was removed from the 
questionnaire and replaced by patient ID. 
The country -specific Protocols V3.0  for the USA/Canada  and Germany  and Protocols V2.0 for  
the United Kingdom  and the EU (version for Italy, Spain , and Switzerland ) (all versions dated  
31 October 2019 ) introduced the following changes : 
• The Sponsor name was changed from NovImmune to S wedish Orphan Biovitrum AG . 
An Administrative Letter (dated 29 January 2019) provided the following clarification for the 
USA sites: 
Following the approval of emapalumab in the USA and its commercialization as Gamifant® for 
the “treatment of adult and pediatric (newborn and older) patients with primary HLH with 
refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH  therapy”, the 
enrollment in USA was limit ed to those patients who were naïve to conventional HLH therapy.  
Page 3 of 98
The global Protocol V4.0 (dated 31 March 2020) introduced the following changes:  
• The study contact list was updated.
• Some clinical and laboratory parameters were defined broader in accordance  with the
observed median age at presentation and standard laboratory practices for routine tests.
• Suggestions from  FDA for special circumstances in vital signs monitoring were
implemented, blood pressure monitoring was homogenized across the countries usi ng a
conservative approach, and clinically appropriate windows were applied to the vital sign
monitoring timepoints.
• Further changes were introduced to minimize the study burden on these severely ill and
young patients and to simplify study conduct from lo gistical standpoint while still
collecting sufficient data.
• Based on accumulated data, infection search was adapted to be more flexible and
considerate of an individual patient while still being rigorous.
• To make the Schedule of Assessments a more complete  tool for sites’ convenience, a
reminder about AE collection timelines was inserted, and an IRR was defined in the
footnote. Definition of IRRs that required increased monitoring during subsequent
infusions was expanded to include relatedness to ensure mea ningful and risk -based
monitoring.
• Additional measurements of height/length were introduced to accommodate calculation
of creatinine clearance throughout the study duration.
• The approval of emapalumab in the US A was reflected, and updated information on ot her
HLH treatment modalities and latest data accumulated in emapalumab development
program were added.
• A provision for retreatment of patients who experience HLH reactivation in the follow -up
period was made.
• The 2 -year and 3 -year survival data collection timepoints were removed  from the body of
the protocol , with the intention to collect those data in a separate study to provide a
comprehensive long -term follow -up across  the emapalumab development program.  As
per the note to file (dated 23 February 2023) t o protocol version 4.0, an inconsistency
within the protocol was addressed , as removal of colle ction of survival data at  the 2 -year
and 3 -year timepoints had been omitted in the synopsis . It was clarified that survival data
collection w ould only be performed at 1 year after either HSCT or the last emapalumab
infusion (as applicable).
• A separate section was added to list study committees to improve readability and easier
search for this in formation.
• Clarifications on testing methods used for diagnosis of pHLH and assessment of
eligibility criteria were made to reflect current global practices: NK -cell degranulation
test was emerged as a more readily available alternative to NK -cell activity  testing, and
reference to sites’ laboratories units for sCD25 was made.
Page 4 of 98
• The wording on sexual abstinence was expanded based on suggestions from the British 
authority.  
• Simulations were updated to present the “worst -case” scenario in the dose escalation 
schema, based on the updated, larger dataset accumulated in the emapalumab 
development program.  
• The considerations that could prompt the Investigator  to increase the emapa lumab dose 
were further clarified. Also, additional instructions were included for lowering the dose 
of emapalumab to provide complete guidance to the Investigator . 
• Language on the drug accountability was amended to include the reference to IRT. 
• It was clarified that biologic drugs were not allowed for indications other than additional 
HLH treatments.  
• Janus kinase inhibitors were added to the list of not allowed concomitant therapies due to 
their mechanism of action, possibly interfering with emapalumab efficacy and safety 
assessment.  
• More explicit guidance was provided to the Investigator  on introduction of additional 
HLH treatments in the beginning of the study. Also, “unsatisfactory HLH improvement” 
was replaced with “unsatisfactory HLH control”, a def inition that better reflects the 
clinical conditions in which the Investigator  could require additional HLH treatments.  
• A window of 1 day was added to allow for more flexible scheduling of emapalumab 
infusions in the circumstances of weekly administration.  
• The screening process was further detailed in the protocol. It was clarified that standard 
of care procedures performed before consent were accepted for screening. 
Two documents were made available and appended to the protocol in order to facilitate 
exped itious assessment of the patients (eligibility review form and pre -screening 
checklist).  
• Blood sampling assessment was expanded in accordance with a German authority 
request.  
• It was explicitly stated that race, ethnicity, and country of origin were only to  be collected 
if allowed per local regulations.  
• The safety monitoring section language was amended for clarity and to avoid any 
ambiguity.  
• Specific references to signs of fluid retention and purpura were  removed ( since  these  data 
were  already collected in physical examination ). 
• The r isks and benefits considerations were updated with the latest available information, 
and the current IB version was  referenced. References to the development risk 
management plan are removed.  
• A minor rewording was performed in t he stopping rules section to clarify the role of 
Sponsor in the process.  
• A maximum number of dropouts  was specified considering the ongoing pandemic.  
Page 5 of 98
• Regarding the disclosure of protocol and study results and publication policy, references 
to the C oordinat ing Investigator  were removed. No Coordinating Investigator  was 
appointed on the study -wide level.  
• A serious GCP breach definition was provided for clarity, and the terminology was 
updated from violation to deviation.  
• The PedsQL  questionnaires were added to Appendix A.  
An Addendum, V4.0 – V1.0 for Sweden, dated 26 August 2020, was generated to introduce 
measures to ensure patient  safety and counteract potential study  conduct disruption  during a 
COVID -19 outbreak .

Title:  An Open -label,  Single Arm, Multicenter Study t o Broaden Access to 
Emapalumab, an  Anti-Interferon Gamma (Anti -IFNγ) Monoclonal 
Antibody, and to Assess its Efficacy , Safety, Impact on Quality of Life, 
and Long -term Outcome in Pediatric Patients with Primary 
Hemop hagocytic  Lymphohistiocytosis   
Sponsor:  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AG , Switzerland  
Study Type  and Design:  Study NI-0501 -09 is an open -label, single arm, multicenter, 
interventional study performed both in North America  and in Europe.  
The study is open to enrolment to pediatric patients with confirmed or 
suspected primary HLH (pHLH) who are either treatment -naïve , or 
failed conventional HLH therapy or show ed intolerance to it.  
The study is divided into three parts: screening, treatment  period , and 
follow -up.  
Patients will be in the treating unit the day before the first 
administration of emapalumab  (Study Day minus one, SD -1). 
Study Objectives:  ‐ To gather additional safety and efficacy data on emapalumab 
in pHLH patients   
‐ To assess a starting dose of emapalumab  of 3 mg/kg  
‐ To assess the impact of emap alumab on Quality of Life (QOL)  
‐ To gather additional evidence on the long -term outcome of 
pHLH patients treated with emapalumab  
‐ To f urther evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) pro file of 
emapalumab in pHLH patients   
‐ To further evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (levels of 
circulating t otal Interferon Gamma ( IFNγ) and biomarkers of its 
neutralization, namely CXCL9 and CXCL10)  
‐ To assess the profile of other relevant HLH biomarkers, e.g., 
sCD25 and other  exploratory biomarkers  
‐ To monitor for potential occurrence of anti -drug antibodies 
(ADAs).  
Study Population:  Male and female pHLH patients, from birth up to and including 18  years 
at diagnosis of HLH.  
Patients can be naïve to HLH treatment or may have received 
conventional HLH therapy without having obtained a satisfactory 
response according to the treating physician ,  or having shown signs of 
intolerance to previous HLH therapy.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 1. Of note, t he enrolment of patients will continue until emapalumab 
is commercially available for a given indication , or until sample size 
is reached , whichever comes first ; thus, US enrolment will be 
limited to treatment -naïve patients. Male and female pHLH

 patients, from birth up to and including 18  years at diagnosis of 
HLH.   
2. A molecular diagnosis or familial history consistent with pHLH or 
fulfilment of HLH -2004 diagnostic criteria, i .e., five of the eight 
criteria below:  
- Fever  
- Splenomegaly  
- Cytopenias affecting 2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood 
(hemoglobin <90 g/L; platelets <100 x 109/L; neutrophils 
<1 x 109/L) 
- Hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥3 mmol/L or 
≥265 mg/dL) and/o r hypofibrinogene mia (≤1.5 g/L)  
- Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes,  
with no evidence of malignancy  
- Low or absent nat ural killer (NK) -cell activity  
- Ferritin ≥500 µg/L  
- Soluble CD25 (sCD25, i .e., soluble IL -2 receptor) 
≥2400  U/mL  
3. Presence of active HLH disease as assessed by the treating 
physician.  
4. Patients having already received c onventional HLH therapy must 
fulfil  one of the following criteria as assessed by the treating 
physician:  
- Having not responded  
- Having not a chieved a satisfactory response  or 
worsened   
- Having reactivated  
- Showing intolerance to previous conventional 
treatment of HLH.  
At the time of enrol ment, eligible patients might still be receiving 
treatment (induction or maintenance) or might have already 
discontinued it.  
5. Informed consent signed by the patient (as required by local law), 
or by the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) with the 
assent of patients who are legally capable of providing it, as 
applicable.  
6. Having received guidance on contraception for  both male and 
female patients sexually active and having reached puberty.  
Females of child -bearing potential require use of highly effective 
contraceptive measures (failure rate of less than 1% per year) from 
Screening until 6 months after receiving last dos e of the study drug.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures include:  
o Sexual abstinence  
o Hormonal contraceptives: combination or progesterone 
only  
o Intrauterine methods: intrauterine devices or  systems

o Vasectomised partner.  
Males with partner(s) of child -bearing potential must agree to take 
appropriate precautions (such as sexual abstinence, barrier 
contraception, vasectomy) to avoid fathering a child from 
Screening until 6 months after receiving last dose of study drug.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 1. Diagnosis of secondary HLH consequent to a proven rheumatic, 
metabolic or neoplastic disease.  
2. Active mycobacteria , Histoplasma capsulatum, Shigella, 
Salmonella, Campylobacter or Leishmania infections.  
3. Evidence of latent tuberculosis.  
4. Presence of malignancy.  
5. Patients who have another concomitant disease or malformation 
severely affecting cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous 
system (CNS), liver, or renal function that in the opinion of the 
Investigator may significantly affect the likelihood to respond to 
treatment and/or the assessment of emapalumab safety  and/or 
efficacy.  
6. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of the 
study regimen  (e.g., polysorbate) . 
7. Receipt of a bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) vaccine within  12 
weeks prior to Screening.  
8. Receipt of a live or attenuated live (other than BCG) vaccine within 
6 weeks prior to Screening.  
9. Pregnant or lactating female patients.  
Study Drug:  
 Emapalumab (previously referred to as NI -0501) is a fully human high 
affinity anti-IFNγ monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes 
human IFNγ.  
Dosing Regimen & Frequency 
of Administration:  
 Emapalumab will be administered by IV infusion over a peri od of 1 to 2 
hours depending on the volume to infuse , at a dose of 3 mg/kg.  
Infusions will be performed twice weekly  (not mor e than 4  days apart ), 
except for the second infusion which must be administered on Study 
Day 3 (SD3).  
The 3 mg/kg dose will be maintained unless the Investigator, guided by 
the clinical and laboratory response in each patient, deems that a dose 
increase is appropriate: at any time during the study, it will be possible 
to increase the emapalumab dose to 6 m g/kg (see parameters to be 
satisfied for dose increase in Section 5.3).  
The dose of emapalumab may be further increased to 10 mg/kg per 
Investigator’s decision based on the patient’s clinical and laboratory 
response (as per Section 5.3). 
Upon achievement of Complete Response (i .e., normalization of all 
clinical and laboratory HLH parameters), the dose of emapalumab 
should  be lowered to achieve 1 mg/kg twice a week and maintained 
Page 12 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09  NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 7 of 92 
 
Protocol NI -0501 -09                           Version 4.0 Global  – 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  until conditioning for transplant, as long  as the patient’s clinical 
conditions are satisfactory.  Decrease of emapalumab dose will occur in 
a stepwise fashion (e.g. if patient was on 6 mg/kg, emapalumab will be 
administered in 3 mg/kg for at least one infusion before achieving 1 
mg/kg).  
Given the unpredictable course of the disease, in case of reactivation 
(e.g. triggered by intercurrent infections ), subsequent dose increases 
to 3 mg/kg (and up to 6 or 10 mg/kg, as appropriate) may need to be 
considered and will be guided by the same clinical and laborat ory 
parameters described in Section 5.3. 
Upon regaining  a Complete Response, the dose of emapalumab will be 
lowered again to  achieve  1 mg/kg twice a week.  
Should hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) be scheduled 
beyond 12  weeks from emapalumab initiation for reasons unrelated to 
the administration of emapalumab (e .g., lack of donor  availability ) and 
provided Complete Response is maintained, the treatment  with 
emapalumab  may continue  at the dose of 1 mg/kg once a week.  
Treatment Duration:  The duration of treatment is foreseen until the start of conditioning for 
HSCT, but must not exceed 6 month s.  
The minimum treatment duration is 4 weeks, if the patient’s condition 
and donor availability allow the performance of HSCT.  
No wash -out period is required between the last administration of 
emapalumab and the start of conditioning.  
After treatment com pletion or treatment discontinuation (for any 
reason), patients will continue in the study for long -term follow -up until 
1 year after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (in case HSCT is 
not performed). This will represent the last visit in the study.  
A patient who experiences HLH reactivation during the follow -up 
period, ma y be re -treated with emapalumab  upon discussion with 
Sponsor. Re -treated patients will follow the same schedule of 
assessments as applicable during initial treatment (i.e., starting from 
Visit 1), and will enter the follow -up period after completion of re -
treatment.  
Attempts to gather additional information on survival only will be made 
at 2 and 3 years after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (as 
applicable) to extend the assess ment of long -term survival.  
Background Therapy & 
Concomitant Medication:  Emapalumab will be administered initially on a background of 
dexamethasone. Patients are required to receive dexamethasone from 
not later than SD-1. 
In treatment -naïve patients, an initial background therapy of 10  mg/m2 
dexamethasone will be required.  
In patients who failed previous HLH therapy, dexamethasone is to be 
administered at a dose of at least 5 mg/m2 or at the dose administered 
Page 13 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 8 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09   Version 4.0 Global  – 31 March 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  prior to Screening if higher. Low er dexamethasone doses at study entry 
are allowed in case of documented intolerance to glucocorticoids.  
During the study, dexamethasone can be tapered depending on the 
patient’s condition, according to the judgment of the treating 
physician.  
Prophylaxis f or Herpes Zoster  virus infection has to be in place from the 
day before initiation of emapalumab treatment until  serum levels of 
emapalumab are no longer detectable.  
Patients will receive any required prophylactic antimicrobial 
treatment s accor ding to local recommendations for the management 
of pHLH.  
Cyclosporin A (CsA) can be continued if already being admini stered to 
the patient prior to S creening. CsA can be withdrawn at any time, upon 
judgment of the Investigator. CsA is not to be introduced (or re -
introduced) during the course of the study once emapalumab 
administration has started.  
If the patient is receiving intrathecal (IT) therapy (e .g., methotrexate 
and glucocorticoids) at the time of emapalumab treatment initiation, 
this therapy  will be contin ued until clinically indicated. The introduction 
of IT therapy  during emapalumab treatment  is allowed should CNS 
signs and symptoms occur . 
IV immunoglobulins are only allowed as replacement treatment. 
Analgesic treatment, transfusion of blood products, electrolyte and 
glucose infusions, IV parenteral nutrition, inotropic support, antibiotics, 
anti-fungal and anti -viral treatment , hemofiltration or hemodialysis, as 
well as  general supportive care are allowed.  Vaccination with a live or 
attenuated (including BCG) vaccine must be avoided until serum levels 
of emapalumab are no longer detectable.  
The administration of additional HLH treatments will be allowed  in  a 
patient in whom an HLH worsening or no initial response has been 
observed after an increase of emapalumab dose to 6 mg/kg on SD3, as 
well as later during the course of emapalumab treatment in case of 
unsatisfactory HLH control , provided that emapalumab has been 
admi nistered at a dose of 6  mg/kg  (or 10 mg/kg, if the Investigator 
decided to do so) for at least 2 infusions.  
Unsatisfactory HLH control is defined as follows:  
‐ patients who have not achieved or maintained a disease control 
and general conditions that would a llow to proceed to transplant  
‐ patients who present a clinically relevant HLH worsening . 
If an additional HLH treatment is needed, etoposide is the drug of 
choice, unless there is evidence indicating that an alternative agent 
should be selected.  
 Sample Size:  The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint 
of `Overall Response` . Assuming an Overall Response Rate of 65%, a

above 40% with 85% power using an exact binomial t est at a one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  A drop -out rate of 20% may be expected, 
hence a total maximum of 41 patients may be enrolled.  
 
Number of Sites:  It is estimated that approximately 13 sites in North America  and 
approximately 15 sites in Europe will participate in this study.  
Study Duration and Study 
End Definition:  After treatment completion or  treatment discontinuation (for any 
reason), patients will continue in the study for a long -term follow -up. 
End of the study is defined as last patient last visit at 1  year after either 
HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (as applicable). Survival data 
obtain ed at 2 year and 3 year follow -up will be analyzed separately.  
Study Surveillance, Safety 
Reporting and Stopping 
Rules:  Infusions should be performe d under medical supervision and 
monitored as per local standard of care based on patient’s conditions , 
with a minimum requirement of monitoring  blood pressure, body 
temperature,  heart rate and oxygen saturation during the 
administration of emapalumab , and up to 2 hours after  the end of the 
infusion . 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from the date of the informed 
consent form ( ICF) signature  until  serum levels of emap alumab are no 
longer detectable , except for the following :  
- Common  HLH signs and symptoms  (e.g. anemia, neutropenia,  
thrombocytopenia,  hepatosplenomegaly) will not be reported as 
separate events unless clearly attributed to a cause different from 
HLH; however, reactivation  or  worsening of HLH from start of 
treatment with emapalumab will be reported as AE;  
- fever will on ly be reported when not linked to an identified cause 
(fever of unknown origin). If fever is considered as a sign of a 
confirmed infection or of HLH worsening or reactivation,  it will not 
be reported as `fever` , but the cause will be reported as an AE;  
- viral load positivity, in particular for Epstein -Barr virus ( EBV), 
cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and adenovirus, and evolution will be 
collected on a dedicated electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) 
module.  
- Active infections will be reported as AEs, indicating whether 
constituting a primary infection or a reactivation (whenever 
possible). Pathogen positivity and evolution will be collected in a 
dedicated eCRF module.  
- expected effect s of conditioning (i.e. , pancytopenia during 
conditioning and until engraftment) will not be reported  as AEs  
Any serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs during the course of the 
study , and regardless of causality to the study drug, must be notified  by

transmission, within 24 hours of awareness, with the exception of:  
- elective hospitalizations for surgical procedures that are a result of  
patient’s pre -existing condition(s) which have not worsened during 
the study ; 
- hospitalization s required  for emapalumab infusion  and study visits  
(including a possible hospital stay overnight, if due to logistic 
convenience ); 
- hospitalizations  post -HSCT lasting less than 72 hours and not leading 
to a new diagnosis, but triggered by a sign which will  be reported as 
an AE. If a new diagnosis is found, it will be reported as an SAE.  
After elimination of emapalumab only SAEs will be reported . 
There are no predefined rules for permanent study drug 
discontinuation  based on the current safety profile of th e drug. An 
independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC) will be formed to 
ensure that any emergent safety concern will be timely assessed  and 
appropriate measure taken for the patients, if relevant. Moreover, 
iDMC will be specifically tasked with regular assessment of extent of 
benefit and fatal events prior to transplant in treatment -naïve 
subgroup of patients.  
A patient, his/her representative or the Investigator can decide at any 
time to prematurely discontinue treatment or to withdraw a patient 
from the study. This decision will have no impact on the patient’s care.  
A patient who pre maturely discontinues treatment will receive 
alternative HLH therapy, according to the standard of care at the site.  
Efficacy Endpoints:  Primary efficacy endpoint:  
• Overall Response, i .e., achievement of either Complete or Partial 
Response or HLH Improvement , at End of Treatment (EOT) or Week 
8 (whichever occurs earlier).   
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
• Overall Survival, including survival to HSCT and survival after either 
HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (if HSCT is not performed)  
• Event -free Survival  
• Overall Response, i.e., achievement of either Complete or Partial 
Response or HLH Improvement, at start of conditioning (or at last 
emapalumab infusion if HSCT is not performed)  
• Duration of Response, i .e., maintenance of response achieved any 
time during the study (with censoring time at start of conditioning 
for patients with no events)  
• Time to Response at any time during the study  
• Number of patients able t o reduce glucocorticoids by 50% or more 
of baseline  dose  during emapalumab treatment

Protocol NI -0501 -09                           Version 4.0 Global  – 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  • Number of patients able to proceed  to HSCT, when deemed 
indicated  
• QOL indices.  
Safety Endpoints:   
 
 • Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and non -
serious).  
• Evolutions of relevant laboratory parameters, e.g., complete  blood 
cell (CBC) count, liver and renal function tests, and coagulation 
parameters.  
• Number of patients who discontinu ed emapalumab treatment  for 
safety reasons.  
PK/PD Endpoints:  • Serum concentrations of emapalumab to further evaluate 
emapalumab PK profile.  
• Determination of PD parameters (levels of circulating total IFN γ and 
markers of its neutralization, namely CXCL9 and CXCL10).  
• Determination of other relevant disease biomarkers, e .g., sCD25 
and other exploratory biomarkers.  
• Measurement of emapalumab concentrations and PD parameters in 
other matrices, e .g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL), if clinically appropriate (exploratory).  
• Level (if any) of circulating antibodies against emapalumab (ADAs).  
Statistical Analysis:  The primary endpoint Overall Response Rate will be evaluated using 
the exact binomial test at the one -sided 0.025 level.   
Time to Response, Duration of Response, and Survival time will be 
presented using Kaplan -Meier curves with medians calculated where 
available. Associated two -sided  95% confidence interv als will be 
calculated for the median for each of these endpoints.  
Additional endpoints based on binary outcomes including number of 
patients who reduce glucocorticoids by 50% or more and number of 
patients able to proceed to HSCT  will be converted to pro portions and 
associated 95% confidence intervals calculated.  
Statistical significance in terms of p -values will only be obtained for the 
primary endpoint. All other endpoints will be viewed as supportive for 
the primary endpoint and as a consequence no fo rmal hierarchy of 
endpoints will be declared.

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPH OHISTIOCYTOSIS  
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)  is a syndrome characterized by a severe impairment or 
absence of cytotoxic function by natural killer ( NK) and CD8+ T cells leading to striking activation of the 
immune system.  
HLH comprises primary (genetic/familial) and secondar y forms , both clinically characterized by a 
dysregulation of the immune system leading to a profound hypercytokinemia with deleterious 
consequences on various tissues and organs  (Henter 1991 ). 
Primary HLH  (pHLH)  is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. Primary HLH is mostly seen in 
infancy and early childhood with an estimated prevalence in Europe of 1/50,000 live births  (Henter 1991 ). 
The disease is invariably fatal with a median survival of less than 2 months after onset of symptoms, if 
untreated  (Janka 1983 , Arico 1996 ).  
The imp aired cytotoxic function present in HLH leads to hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytosis. These, 
in turn, cause all of the typical signs and symptoms of HLH  (Dhote 2003 , Risdall 1979 , Risdall 1984 ): 
•Prolonged fever
•Splenomegaly
•Cytopenia
•Hyperferritinemia
•Hypertriglyceridemia
•Hypofibrinogenemia
•Lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, bone marrow hypoplasia, meningeal infiltrate.
Secondary forms of HLH  (sHLH)  are reported to  occur during the course of an infection, of an autoimmune 
or auto -inflammatory disease,  or of a malignancy . While pHLH is a predominantly childhood disease, sHLH 
is a condition that can also be diagnosed in adu lts, and increased awareness indicates this may occur more 
often than recognized in the past.  
Secondary HLH presents with the same signs and symptoms of primary forms and can be equally severe. 
Of note, the presence of certain infections, in particular vi ral infections such as those due to 
cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) or Epstein -Barr virus ( EBV), is very often the trigger for the manifestation of 
primary forms of HLH.  
During the last years, evidence has been accumulating in support of the pivotal role of interferon gamma 
(IFNγ ) in the development of both primary  (Jordan 2004 ; Pachlopnik 2009 ) and secondary  (Behrens 2011 , 
Bracaglia 2017 , Buatois  2017 ) forms  of HLH.  
Perforin knock -out mice represent a relevant model for pHLH since, once infected with Lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ), they develop a n HLH-like disease dependent on activation and 
proliferation of CD8+ T cells and  increased  IFNγ production, with many of the clinical and laboratory 
characteristic features of the human disease. When the high circulating levels of IFNγ are neutralized with 
the administration of an anti -IFNγ antibody, not only are the clinical and laboratory abno rmalities 
reverted, but also survival rate is dramatically improved. On the contrary, the ablation of many other 
cytokines had no impact on survival  (Jordan 2004 ).  
Page 30 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 25 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  Two animal models of  sHLH have been investigated to elucidate the pathogenetic role of IFNγ,  a murine 
model that mimics an infection -driven HLH  through  repeated administrations of CpG 
oligodeoxynucleotides  and activation of toll-like receptor -9 (TLR9 ) (Strippoli 2012 ), and a model of 
interleukin -6 (IL-6) transgenic mice expressing high levels of IL -6 that mimics the condition of patients 
with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sJIA), the rheumatic disease most frequently associated with 
secondary forms of HLH  (Prencipe 2017 ). In both models, when IFNγ was neutraliz ed by the 
administration of an anti -IFNγ antibody, clinical and laboratory features of the disease were reverted  
(Strippoli 2012 ), and survival  markedly improved  (Prencipe 2017 ). 
Further strengthening the importance of IFNγ in HLH are the high concentrations of circulating IFNγ levels 
found in  pHLH  patients  (Browne 2012 , Remus 2001 ), with IFNγ levels above the upper limit of normal 
(17.3 pg/mL) in all patients, and above 1000 pg/mL  in 53.5% of cases .  
With regard to sHLH, evidence has been recently gathered in two observational studies conducted in 
patients with secondary forms of HLH : one study in sHLH  consequent to infections or of unknown orig in 
(Buatois 2017 ), and  another one  in macrophage activating syndrome ( MAS ) occurring in the context of 
sJIA (Bracaglia 2017 ). Levels of IFNγ and IFNγ -induced chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) were markedly 
higher in the active phase compared to disease remission and significantly correlated significantly with 
para meters of disease severity, such as neutrophil and platelet counts, ferritin and alanine transaminase 
(ALT) (Bracaglia 2017 , Buatois 2017 ). 
At present, no drug, other tha n emapalumab  (in the USA) , is approved  for the treatment of pHLH. Most 
commonly used c onventional therapy for the initial treatment of pHLH and severe forms of sHLH  is 
immunochemotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) is required to cure pHLH and is 
indicated in forms (independently of the trigger, if known) of HLH which appear recurrent or progressive 
despite intensive therapy, or which present central nervous system ( CNS) involvement (Jordan 2004 ). It 
has been shown that a reduction or abrogation of signs of HLH activity prior to HSCT is an important step 
in order to imp rove HSCT outcome and survival.  
The most commonly used immunochemotherapy is the so called HLH -94 regimen which includes  the use 
of high doses of dexamethasone and eto poside.  The results of prospective  study  of this regimen , initially 
published by  (Henter 2002 ) and subsequently by  (Trottestam 2011 ) showed a 5-year cumulative 
probability of survival of 54%.  
In an attempt to improve survival, two alternative treatment regimens have been proposed and assessed: 
the HLH -2004 one based on addition of cyclosporine A to the HLH -94 treatment protocol  (Henter  2007 ), 
and the treatment investigated in the  ‘HIT-HLH’ study (Hybrid Immunotherapy for HLH)  combining 
treatment with anti -thymocyte globulin  (ATG), etoposide and dexamethasone .  
Despite the se more aggressive immun ochemotherapies, no significant improvement in mortality was 
obtained with either of the two regimens, as reported at the latest Histi ocyte Society meeting in October 
2016 ( Henter  for the HLH -2004 study  oral presentation , Jordan  2016  for the HIT -HLH study).  
A significant number of patients with HLH either fail to respond to current therapies or relapse prior  to 
HSCT. Furthermore, withdrawal of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of HLH may be required 
due to their toxicities (e.g. , severe infections, myelosuppression, malignant hypertension), thus leaving 
HLH patients without alternative treatment optio ns and significantly increasing the risk of death. No 
conventional salvage therapy is available at present, although the use of rescue alemtuzumab has been 
reported  in a retrospective series of 22 patients ( Marsh 2013 ).

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  With m ortality  and morbi dity remain ing high, the scientific community concurs that new therapeutic 
approaches are needed.  
The possibility to treat HLH by means of the targeted neutralization of the most relevant recognized 
pathogenic player, namely IFNγ, offers an innovative approach towards the management of this disease,  
aimed at ensuring efficacy with minor toxicity . The US A approval of emapalumab in pHLH in patients with 
refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy  confirms the 
strength of this rationale.  
1.2 EMAPALUMAB  
1.2.1 Description and Mode of Action  
Emapalumab  (previously referred to as NI -0501) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) anti-
interferon gamma (IFNγ) monoclonal antibody which binds and neutralizes IFNγ . Emapalumab  binds to 
both free and receptor (IFNγR1) -bound forms of IFNγ.  
Since emapalumab  is a human IgG1, it retains the characteristics of this immunoglobulin isotype, including 
the capacity to engage Fc γ receptors and to bind compleme nt.  
IFNγ is produced predominantly by NK and NK T cells, as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 
Th1 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocy te effector T cells, once antigen -specific immunity develops . IFNγ is one 
of the most potent and pleiotropic c ytokines of the immune system. After binding to its receptor, IFNγ 
acts to produce a variety of physiological and cellular responses. Numerous studies over the last 20 years 
have associated IFN  with the pathogenesis and the maintenance of inflammatory diseases  (Billiau 1996 , 
Schoenborn 2007 , Zhang 2008 ). 
. 
1.2.2 Preclinical Data  
1.2.2.1  Non -clinical Pharmacology  
Emapalumab  has shown similar binding affinit y and blocking activity for IFNγ from non -human species , 
including Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys , but not from dog s, cat s, pig s, rabbit s, rats, or mice .  
Due to emapalumab  capacity to bind free and IFNγR1 -bound IFNγ, studies were performed to investigate 
the potential of emapalumab  to mediate antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and 
complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC) activities , in the presence of target . A lack of ADCC activity was 
demonstrated and no induction of CDC activity was obser ved.  
As to safety pharmacology, no abnormalities in electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), histopathology of organs and 
behavior of the animals were observed throughout the pre -clinical emapalumab  program.  
1.2.2.2  Toxicology  
Binding and functional data demonstrated Rhesus  or Cynomolgus  monkey s to be relevant species to 
evaluate the safety of emapalumab . No off -target toxicity was attributed to the drug when administered 
to Cynomolgus  monkeys in 13 weekly doses of up to 200 mg/kg. Shigella  and Campylobacter  infections 
were observed at all dose levels (10 to 200 mg/kg/week) in animals originally harboring  gastrointestinal 
pathogens ( Shigella , Salmonella, Campylobacter ) prior to emapalum ab administration . These findings 
were assessed to be in line with emapalumab  pharmacological effect (i.e. , neutralization of IFN γ), given 
the role played by IFN γ in controlling these pathogens. Subsequently,  in a study where cynomolgus

Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 27 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  monkeys were free from  gastrointestinal pathogens  at Screening , weekly administrations of emapalumab  
for 8 consecutive weeks at doses up to 30 mg/kg were well tolerated  with no toxicity or gastrointestinal 
disturbances observed , and no  need for  antibio tic prophylaxis.  
Results from a human tissue cross -reactivity study , involving a panel of 35 different human tissues, 
demonstrated that emapalumab  did not cross -react with any of the human samples tested.  
Embryo -fetal development, fertility and early embryonic development as well as peri - and post -natal 
developmen t studies were performed in mice . No effects on embryo -fetal development , mating or 
fertility were observed.  No effects on sexual maturation, organ weights, learning and memory, 
reproductive or immunological functions evaluated in the F1 generation mice were observed.  
More details are available in the current Investigator Brochure (version 10. 0, dated 24 January 2020).  
1.2.3 Clinical Data  
A Phase 1 randomized double -blinded placebo -controlled single ascending dose study , Study  NI-0501 -03, 
in 20 healthy adult  volunteers investigating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profil es of 
single intravenous (IV) administrations of emapalumab  took place between September 2011 and January 
2013 . During this study , 6 subjects  received placebo , while 3, 3, 4, and 4 subjects (in total 14 subjects) 
received emapalumab  doses of  0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg , respectively . 
The PK analysis of emapalumab  revealed the expected profile for an IgG1 with a long half -life (around 
22 days), a slow clearance ( approximately 0.007  L/h) and a low volume of distribution (< 6 L on average).  
All emapalumab  infusions were uneventful.  
A similar incidence of commonly reported infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infections) was 
observed after administration of emapalumab  and in sub jects who had received placebo.  
A Herpes Zoster (HZ)  infection was reported in one subject ( male , aged 26), 14 days after infusion of 
3 mg/kg of emapalumab . This event  was assessed as related to the emapalumab  infusion and considered 
as serious (medically significant) in the context of a Phase I study in healthy volunteers . Its intensity was 
moderate and its course normal under antiviral therapy . The subject recovered with no sequelae.  
An increased susceptibil ity to HZ infections in patients having developed auto -antibodies against IFNγ  
(Browne 2012 ) or having receiv ed ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody  which decreases IFNγ  production  
by inhibiting the p40 subunit of IL -12) has been described in the literature  (Failla 2011 ).  
In conclusion, the infusion of emapalumab  was well tolerated and the effects observed during the 8 -week 
monitoring after drug infusion did not reveal any serious or unexpected off -target safety or 
immunogenicity concerns.  
An open -label, single arm, intern ational, multicenter Phase 2/3 study is ongoing to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of emapalumab  treatment in patients with pHLH (protocol NI -0501 -04). The protocol allows 
for inclusion of patients either treatment -naïve or reactivating after initial resp onse to conventional 
therapy or not achieving a satisfactory response or showing intolerance to conventional therapy.  
Upon completion of study NI -0501 -04, patients were invited to enter a long -term safety follow -up (study 
NI-0501 -05) of 1 year after HSCT o r after last emapalumab infusion.  NI-0501 -05 study protocol made 
provision for continuation of emapalumab treatment if required by the treating physician as a bridge to 
transplantation.

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  An interim  analysis of the data gathered in both NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501-05 studies (cut -off date of 20  July 
2017) ha s been conducted and these data have been the basis of the biologics license application (BLA) 
and the market authorization application (MAA) submissions.    
At  the  BLA/MAA  cut -off  date,  34  patients  have   been  treated  in  Study  NI -0501 -04.  The  primary 
efficacy endpoint of the study, overall response rate (ORR) at End of Treatment (EOT) was met. ORR was 
64.7% (95% CI: 44%, 78%) in all patients, and 63% (95% CI: 42%, 81%) in second -line patients.  
In both groups, the lower limit of the 95% CI was higher than the pre -defined null hypothesis of 40% 
(p=0.0031 and p=0.0134, respectively). Response occurred early during treatment and was generally 
sustained.  
During  pre -conditioning,  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  those  related  to 
HLH reactivation, flare or worsening. The most frequently reported AEs in post -conditioning were pyrexia 
and hypertension.    
At the BLA/MAA cut -off date, a total of 34 patients were treated and 10 patients died in studies NI -0501 -
04/05. None of the deaths were assessed to be related to emapalumab by Investigator, Sponsor and 
independent data monitoring committee (iDMC).  
In line with the risks due to the immune deficiency status in pHL H patients, 19 out of 34 patients (56 %) 
reported at least 1 infection from start of emapalumab treatment until start of HSCT conditioning. In  
11  patients,  infections  were  reported  as  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE).  Only  2  SAEs  (both infectio ns) 
were  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  emapalumab,  one  disseminated  histoplasmosis (leading to 
treatment  discontinuation) and  one necrotizing  fasciitis  (assessed  by  the  Investigator  as possibly 
related based on the temporal relationship ). Both events resolved with appropriate antibiotic therapy.   
In second -line patients who were intolerant to previous  conventional HLH therapies due to their 
toxicities, the administration  of emapalumab did not aggravate these toxicities, while showing,  in 
general, a favorable impact on disease activity.  
Likewise, no safety concern related to the concomitant administration of emapalumab with other 
treatments (e.g., antimicrobial agents, anti -hypertensive drugs) has been reported so far. Of interest, 
tapering of glucocorticoids had no impact on the safety and tolerability of emapalumab infusions and has 
shown benefit for patients with steroid -related hypertension and generalized immunosuppression.  
Study NI -0501 -04 has currently completed enrolment, with a  total of 45 patients recruited.  
Study NI -0501 -06 is a phase 2 study in sJIA patients with MAS/sHLH who have shown an inadequate 
response to high -dose glucocorticoid treatment. As of 24 August 2019 ,  a  total  of  8  patients  have  been  
treated.  In  all   6  patients,  complete response was achieved. Systemic glucocorticoids were weaned in 
all patients. Emapalumab infusions were  well  tolerated  and  none  of  the  patients  discontinued  
emapalumab  prematurely.  A CMV reactivation was reported by Inves tigator as a serious event possibly 
related to emapalumab, but resolved completely with treatment ( De Benedetti F , 2019 ).  
Overall,  6  out  of  the  8  patients  experienced  at  least  1  treatment -emergent  AE  (TEAE) .  No  AEs  with  
fatal outcome or leading to study treatment discontinuation were reported.   
For more details on the clinical experience , refer to the latest Investigator’s Brochure ( currently  version 
10.0, dated 24 January 2020 ).

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
Study NI-0501 -09 is an open -label, single arm, multicenter, interventional study performed both in North 
America (NA)  and in Europe.  
The study enrol ls pediatric patients with  confirmed or suspected  pHLH who are treatment -naïve, or have 
failed conventional HLH therapy , or showed intolerance to it.  
The study is divided into three parts: screening, treatment, and follow -up. 
Patients will be in the treating unit the day before the first administration of emapalumab (Study Day 
minus one ; SD-1). 
Patients are required to receive dexamethasone from SD -1. 
In treatment -naïve patients, a background therapy of 10 mg/m2 dexamethasone will be required.  
In patients who failed previous HLH therapy, dexamethasone is to be administered at a dose of at least 5 
mg/m2 or at the dose administered prior to Screening if higher.  
Lower dexamethasone doses are allowed in case of docu mented intolerance to glucocorticoids.  
During the study, dexamethasone can be tapered depending on the patient’s condition, according to the 
judgment of the treating physician.

Additional HLH treatments allowed in case of documented unsatisfactory HLH control . 
*The 3 mg/kg d ose is continued unless the Investigator, guided by the clinical and laboratory response in each patient, deems that
a dose increase  is appropriate : at any time during the study, it will be possible to increase the emapalumab dose to 6 mg/kg. If
needed, a further dose increase to 10 mg/kg may also be considered. Upon achievement of Complete Response (i .e., normalization
of all clinical and laboratory HLH parameters), the dose of emapalumab will be lowered to achieve 1 mg/kg twice a week and
maintained until  conditioning for transplant, as long as the p atient’s clinical condition is satisfactory.  See Section 5.3 for full dosing
schema .
3.2 SCREENING PERIOD  
Screening will be carried out within 2 week s prior to first administration of emapalumab  (SD0) to enable 
confirmation of patient eligibility , and following the signature of the Informed Consent Form  (ICF) . 
Samples for infection s creening need to be collected for analysis  prior to first administration of 
emapalumab  according  to the protocol requirements. H owever , if a patient’s medical condition warrants 
rapid treatment initiation, availability of the results is not required  prior to initiation of emapalumab  
provided that there are no clinical findings suggestive of any of the infections which represent exclusion 
criteria.   
3.3 TREATMENT PERIOD  
The duration  of treatment  is foreseen until the start of conditioning for HSCT, but must not exceed 
6 months .   
The minimum treatment duration is 4 weeks, if the patient’s conditions and donor availability allow for 
HSCT.  
No wash -out period is required between the last administration of emapalumab and the start of 
conditioning.  
3.4 FOLLOW -UP PERIOD  
After treatment compl etion or treatment discontinuation (for any reason), patients will continue in the 
study for long -term follow -up until 1 year after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion  (if HSCT is not 
performed) .

 If patient experiences HLH reactivation during the follo w-up period, patient may be re -treated with 
emapalumab, upon discussion with Sponsor. Re -treated patient will follow the same schedule of 
assessments as applicable during initial treatment  (i.e., starting from Visit 1) , and will enter follow -up 
period afte r completion of re -treatment.  
If the patient is unable to return to the site for all follow -up visits, every effort should be made to schedule 
visits until emapalumab is no longer detectable in the blood . 
3.5 STUDY END  
The e nd of the study is defined as last patient last visit  (LPLV)  at 1 year after either HSCT or last 
emapalumab infusion (as applicable).  
In case of an ongoing SAE, the patient  will continue to be monitored until resolution  or until the outcome 
of the event is known and stable, beyond the  defined study end as necessary.   
3.6 STUDY COMMITTEES  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC) has overall responsibility for safeguarding the 
interests of subjects by monitoring relevant data obtained in the study and making appropriate 
recommendations based on the reported data, thus ensuring that the study is being conducted with the 
highest scientific and ethical standards. Moreover,  the iDMC will be specifically tasked with regular 
assessment of extent of benefit and fatal events prio r to transplant in the treatment -naïve subgroup of 
patients.  
iDMC operations will be described in the iDMC charter.  
4 TARGET POPULATION  
The criteria for study eligibility are provided below.  Patients  in this study can be  naïve to HLH treatment 
or may  have already received conventional HLH therapy  without having obtained a satisfactory response 
according to the treating physician or having shown signs of intolerance to HLH therapy . Of note, 
enrolment of patients who have failed previous conventional HLH therapy  will continue until emapalumab 
is commercially available for a given indication , or until sample size is reached , whichever comes first ; 
thus,  US enrolment will be limited to treatment -naïve patients.  
Conventional  HLH therapy is defined as per site standard -of-care, e .g., any of the following, alone or in 
combination (etoposide, ATG, alemtuzumab and cyclosporine A) or glucocorticoids, namely 
dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2 for at least 7 days or methylprednisolone pulses  for 3 consecutive days.

5 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT  
5.1 DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT  
Emapalumab  (prev iously referred to as  NI-0501) is a fully human high affinity anti-IFNγ monoclonal 
antibody that binds  to and neutrali zes human IFNγ.  
Emapalumab  is manufactured by a third -party manufacturing facility duly qualified by Swedish Orphan 
Biovitrum  AG and is supplied to study sites in 2 mL and/or 10 mL filled single -use glass vials at a 
concentration of 5  mg/mL , for dilution prior to administration.  
Page 39 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 34 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  The nominal composition of the  emapalumab  sterile concentrate for infusion (per mL) is as follows:  
Ingredient  Quantity (per mL)  
Emapalumab  5 mg  
L-Histidine 1.55 mg  
L-Histidine monohydrochloride, monohydrate 3.14 mg  
Sodium chloride (NaCl)  7.31 mg  
Polysorbate 80 0.05 mg  
pH 6.0 ± 0.2 
The solution contains no antimicrobial preservative, and therefore each vial must be used only once.  
5.2 RATIONALE FOR DOSING SCHEMA  
The dosing regimen for emapalumab is determined based on patient outcomes and PK/PD data collected 
in the ongoing NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501 -05 studies. Preliminary analyses indicate that the administered 
dose need s to be adapted to the IFNγ production , which varies significantly between subjects but can also 
significantly change over time within a subject, e.g. in case of infection  (Figure  2).

Figure 2: Total IFN γ Concentrations up to the Last Dose or HSCT in HLH Patients Treated with 
Emapalumab in Studies NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501 -05 (HLH) and in Compassionate Use (CU) Patients   
 
 
Results of preliminary PK/ PD analys es demonstrate that : 1) the higher the total IFN γ production, the 
higher the clearance of emapalumab  due to target mediated drug disposition  and 2) the higher the IFN γ 
concentration, the higher the required emapalumab  concentration to reach neutralization.  
In the 3 4 pHLH patients enrolled in the NI -0501 -04 study as of 15 May  2017, emapalumab has been 
administered at a dose ranging from 1  to 10 mg/kg. Out of these 3 4 patients, 14 remained at the dose of 
1 mg/kg and 20 required a dose increase at any time during the course of treatment, with 12 patients 
requiring a dose increase by Day 9. These dose adaptations were based on PK observations and on 
clinical/laboratory parameters (in the initial pilot phase of the study) a nd on clinical criteria only 
thereafter . Specifically, in this later phase, in which 8 patients were enrolled, dose increase occurred in 7 
patients and only 1 remained at 1 mg/kg. These dose increases did not lead to any safety concerns.  
Based on these lea rnings from the NI -0501 -04 study, a starting dose of 3 mg/kg is applied in this study, 
with a simplified schema for dose escalation  up to 10 mg/kg (refer to Section 5.3). 
The impact on the PK and PD of the proposed dosing schema is shown by the simulations reported in  
Figure 3 , Figure 4  and Figure 5 . 
The concentration of emapalumab (graphs on the left) and CXCL9 (graphs on the right) are represented 
at three different production rates of IFN γ (represented by total IFN γ levels)  that exemplif y the variability 
of IFN γ: namely a “relatively low” production of 10,000 pg/mL (orange line), a “medium” production of 
50,000 pg/mL (blue line), and a “high” production of 250,000 pg/mL (green line). As reference:  "' 0 + .,

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  The grey area on the left graph indicates the mean of the individual  three  highest peak and trough 
concentrations observed in Studies NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501 -05, and in compassionate use patients  (cut-
off date 20 July 2017 ). 
The black line (mean) and  grey shadowed area on the right graph indicates CXCL9 levels  at week 2 and  
end of treatment  that appear to be associate d with the probability of clinical response  at end of 
treatment  as indicated by preliminary Rec eiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses  (data on file ). The 
right y -axis gives the probability of overall response at the end of treatment as estimated by logistic 
regression analysis.  
The simulation with the dose increase  up to 10 mg/kg ( Figure 5 ) shows  that patients with a low prod uction 
of IFNγ (TIFN γ=10,000 pg/mL ) reach  emapalumab concentrations close to the highest ones already 
observed in studies NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501 -05 and in compassionate use patients.  However, this 
condition is unlikely to occur as these patients are expect ed to respond primarily at the dose of 3  mg/kg . 
As shown in Figure 2, none of the NI -0501 -04 study patients with maximal total  IFNγ  levels remaining 
below 10,000 pg/mL  required a dose increase up to 10 mg/kg.

Emapalumab  will be administered by IV infusion over a period of 1 to 2 hours depending on the volume 
to infuse , at a dose of 3 mg/kg.   Infusions will be performed twice weekly  (not more than 4 days apart ), 
except for the second infusion which must be administered on SD3 . 
The 3 mg/kg dose will be maintained unless the Investigator, guided by the clinical and laboratory 
response in each patient, deems that a dose increase is appropriate: at any  time during th e study, it will 
be possible to increase emapalumab dose to 6 mg/kg  (Table 3).  A further dose increase to 10  mg/kg can 
be considered  per Investigator’s decision based on the patient’s condition and appreciation of some  
benefit from the administration of emapalumab .  
Upon achievement of Complete Response (i .e., normalization of all clinical and laboratory HLH 
parameters), the dose of em apalumab should  be lowered to achieve 1 mg/kg twice a week and 
maintained until conditioning for transplant, as long as the patient’s clinical conditions is satisfactory.  
Decrease of emapalumab dose will occur in a stepwise fashion (e .g. if patient was on 6 mg/kg, 
emapalumab will be administered in 3 mg/kg for at least one infusion before achieving 1 mg/kg).  
Given the unpredictable course of the disease, in case of reactivation (e.g. triggered by intercurrent 
infections), subsequent dose increases to 3 mg/k g (and up to 6 or 10 mg/kg, as appropriate) may need to 
be considered and will be guided by the same clinical and laboratory parame ters described above ( Table 
3). 
The Investigators ’ assessments  for emapalumab dose increase will be documented in the Dose 
Notification form ( Appendix E ) to be  completed for each infusion and provided to Sponsor  in a timely 
manner . 
Upon regaining a Complete Response, the dose of emapalumab should  be lowered again to  achieve  
1 mg/kg twice a week.  Should HSCT be scheduled beyond 12 weeks from emapalumab initiation , for 
reasons unrelated to the administration of emapalumab (e .g., lack of donor  availability ), and provided 
Complete Response is maintained,  the treatment  with emapalumab may continue at the dose of 1  mg/kg 
once a week.  
The duration of treatment is foreseen until the start of conditioning for HSCT, but must not exceed 
6 months. The minimum treatment duration is 4 weeks, if the patient’s condi tions and donor availability 
allow the performance of HSCT.   
No wash -out period is required between the last administration of emapaluma b and the start of 
conditioning.   
If patient experiences HLH reactivation during the follow -up period, patient may be re -treated with 
emapalumab, upon discussion with Sponsor. Re -treated patient s will follow the same schedule of 
assessments as applicable during initial treatment  (i.e., starting from Visit 1) , and will enter  the follow -up 
period after completion of re -treatment.

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.2 Investigational Medicinal Product  Supply  
Emapalumab  will be supplied to the study site s as open -label supplies.  
5.4.3 Investigational Medicinal Product  Receipt and Storage  
Emapalumab  vials will be transported with temperature deviation a larms (TempTale 4 or equivalent 
device) , to confirm  consistent temperatures during transit. When the study drug is received at the site, 
the Investigator  or Pharmacist will check for accurate delivery and absence of temperature deviation 
alarm s. 
Emapalumab  should be stored between 2 - 8°C (36 - 46°F). All vials must be stored in a secure locked 
location in a temperature -controlled refrigerator or cold room.  Any deviations from the recommended 
storage conditions should be immediately reported to th e Sponsor  and responsible study monitor or 
contract research organization  (CRO). Affected vials should not be used  and should be quarantined  until 
the Sponsor has authorized  their use , return or destruction . 
Documentation of the storage conditions of the s tudy drug must be maintained for the duration of the 
time the study drug is stored at the site, until  the time it is used, disposed of, or returned to Swedish 
Orphan Biovitrum  AG or designee.  
Regular inspections of the emapalumab  vials are required , as detailed in the Investigational medicinal 
product ( IMP) manual ’s directions for the Preparation and Administration of Individual Doses of Study 
Drug Emapalumab . 
5.4.4 Investigational Medicinal Product  Preparation , Administration , Accountability , and 
Destruction  
5.4.4.1  Preparation 
The s tudy drug must be prepared only by a Pharmacist or other appropriately qualified staff member , 
specifically authorized by  the Investigator /Pharmacist  and appropriately licensed to perform the task . 
The specific dose to be administered for  an individual infusion is determined as detailed in Section 5.3. As 
emapalumab  is dosed in mg/kg, the weight of the patient must be taken within 24 hours before 
preparation of the study drug for administration.  
Full i nstructions for the preparation , incl uding dilution steps,  and method for administration of 
emapalumab  are available in the IMP manual ’s directions for the Preparation and Administration of 
Individual Doses of Study Drug Emapalumab . 
5.4.4.2  Administration  
The patient should receive the designated volume of the infusion material  through an infusion pump over 
1 to 2 hour s depending on the volume to infuse . A 0.2  μm filter must  be added to all infusion lines.  
It is recommended that an IV central  line remain in place to ensure venous access  during the treatment 
period. This will improve patient’s comfort and ensure a reliable drug administration, in particular in 
infants and toddlers, or in case of foreseen difficulties with peripheral venous access. However, peripheral 
infusions have been s uccessfu lly performed in some patients.  
Since no data are available on the compatibility of emapalumab  with other IV substances or additives, 
other medications/substances should not be added to the infusion material  or infused simultaneously 
Page 46 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH   Page 41 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  
 through the same IV line. If the same IV line is used for subsequent infusion s of other drugs, the line 
should be flushed appropria tely with saline before and after infusion of emapalumab . 
The infusion of emapalumab  will be performed under the direct supervision of the Investigator  (or 
delegate) , preferably in the morning at the same time  for each infusion . Details of the infusion mus t be 
recorded in the patient’s Medical Notes or other source documents  and have  to include : 
• Dose prescribed (in mg/kg)  
• Date of administration  
• If flushing was performed  
• Start time & End time  
• Rate of administration  
• Total volume infused (ml)  
• Total dose infused (mg)  
• In case infusion was interrupted  
▪ Reason for interruption  
▪ What was the stop time of the infusion  
▪ What was the new start time of the infusion  
▪ What was the new rate of administration  
• Any untoward  signs and/or symptoms, event  or illness experienc ed by the patien t during the 
infusion  
• Any other event(s) judged relevant by the site personnel . 
5.4.4.3  Accountability  
When the study drug is received at the site, the Investigator  or Pharmacist (or appropriate designee) 
should acknowledge its receipt by signing (or  initia ling) and dating the documentation , and updating  the 
Interactive response technology  (IRT) system . Documentation should be returned to Swedish Orphan 
Biovitrum  AG (or its designee) and a copy retained in the Investigator ’s file.  
The dispe nsing of the study drug shall be carefully recorded on Drug Accountability Forms and an accurate 
accounting must be available for verification by the Monitor at monitoring visit s. 
The used (or unused) infusion material  should be sent back to the Pharmacist  at the end of the infusion, 
if possible, for later inventory.  
Drug accountability records shall include:  
• Confirmation of the study drug’s delivery to the study site . 
• The inventory at the study site . 
• The use of study drug by each patient .  
• The return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of unused products . 
The records should include dates, quantities, expiration dates , batch number , and if applicable  patient  
number .  
Unused study drug vials must not be used  for any purpose other than the present study  without Sponsor’s

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  Unused study drug vials must not be discarded prior to verification by the Monitor.  
5.4.4.4  Destruction, Return , and Disposal 
Periodically during the study and at the conclusion of participation of the study by the site, t he clinical 
research associate (CRA) will monitor and perform  drug accountability  via the IRT system,  before making 
arrangements for study drug return or  authorizing  destruction by the study site.  
6 PATIENT BACKGROUND T REATMENT AND CARE  
6.1 BACKGROUND THERAPY  WITH DEXAMETHASONE  
Initially, emapalumab will be administered o n a background of dexamethasone. 
Patients are required to receive dexamethasone from not later than SD -1. 
In treatment -naïve patients, a background therapy of 10 mg/m2 of dexamethasone  will be required . In 
patients receiving emapalumab  after having failed  previous HLH therapy , dexamethasone is to be 
administered a t a dose  of at least 5 mg/m2, or at the dose administered prior to Screening if higher . Lower 
dexamethasone doses at study entry are allowed in case of documented intolerance to glucocortico ids. 
During the study, d examethasone can be tapered depending on patient `s condition . The tapering scheme 
can be selected by the treating physician , and should take into account the potential risk of disease (HLH) 
reactivation.  
In the event of disease reactivation/ worsening after tapering of dexamethasone , the dose of 
dexamethasone  can be increased  and maintained  until a satisfactory response  is achieved  according to 
the treating physician .  
6.2 PRO PHYLACTIC T REATMENT 
Prophylaxis for HZ virus (HZV) infection will be performed to mitigate the potential risk associated to 
emapalumab administration ( see Section 9.4) and has to be in place from the day before initiation of 
emapalumab treatment until serum levels of emapalumab are no longer detectable .  
Patients will receive any additional required prophylactic antimicrobial treatment according to local 
recommendations in pHLH.  
Consider  the following:  
•For HZV prevention, according to Institution Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. , Acyclovir
200 mg four times daily for children over two years, for  children under two years 100 mg four
times daily ).
•For tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis ( if required as indicated  above ) according to Institution
Guidelines/  Recommendations (e.g. , Isoniazid).
These treatment s will be given orally, whenever possible , otherwise intravenously . 
6.3 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
6.3.1 Cyclosporin A  
Cyclosporin A (C sA) can be continued, if already administered prior to Screening . CsA can be withdrawn 
at any time, upon the judgment  of the Investigator . CsA is not to be introduced (or re -introduced) during 
the course of the study once emapalumab  administration has started.  
Page 48 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 43 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  6.3.2 Intrathecal Therapy  
For patients receiving intrathecal  (IT) therapy (e .g., methotrexate and glucocorticoids ) at the time of 
emapalumab  treatment initiation, this therapy  will be continued until clinically indicated . The 
introduction of IT therapy  during emapalumab treatment  is allowed should CNS signs and symptoms 
occur during the study, as clinically indicated.  
6.3.3 Other Concomitant Therapies  
Intravenous  immunoglobulin (IVIG) are only allowed as replacement treatment  (i.e., not at doses 
expected to produce an immunomodulatory effect) according to the clinical judgement of the 
Investigator . Any IVIG infusion within the previous  4 weeks  prior to  Screening , as well as any infusion 
during emapalumab  treatment , should be documented in the Case Report Form ( CRF; dose, date of 
administration).  
Analgesic treatment, transfusion of blood products, electrolyte and glucose infusion s, IV parenteral 
nutrition, inotropic support, antibiotics, anti -fungal and anti -viral treatment , hemo filtration or 
hemodialysis, as well as  general supportive care (e.g. , gastro -protective agents , anti -hypertensive etc. ) 
are permitted within the study .  
The us e of any prescript ion or over -the-counter medication , including herbal and homeopathic 
preparations with the exception of multi -vitamins, needs to be notified to the Investigator . 
Contracep tion guidance: see Section 6.4. 
6.3.4 Not Allowed  Concomitant Therapies  
As long as emapalumab  is being administered , the concomitant use of other  biologic drug s (for indications 
other than additional HLH treatments)  is generally not allowed , except for the following : 
-Granulocyte -colony -stimulating factor ( G-CSF), in case of prolonged neutropenia
-Rituximab, in case of documented EBV infection .
Administration of  Janus kinase  (JAK) inhibitors concomitantly with emapalumab is not allowed.  
Vaccination with a live or attenuated -live (including BCG) vaccine must  be avoided until serum levels of 
emapalumab are no lon ger detectable, unless the investigator has a specific reason for overcoming this 
recommendation, and upon discussion with the Sponsor.   
6.3.5 Additional HLH treatments  
The administration of additional HLH treatments (e .g., etoposide, T -cell depleting agents) will be allowed  
concomitantly with emapalumab .  
In a patient in whom  an HLH worsening or no initial response has been observed after an increase of 
emapalumab dose to 6 mg/kg on SD3,  at SD6  the Investigator may consider the therapeutic option of 
adding an alternative HLH treatment  while continuing emapalumab .  
Benefit/risk  of administering an additional HLH treatment ( with or without emapalumab dose increase) 
must be assessed, taking into consideration e .g. possible drug toxicities, trends of relevant clinical/ 
laboratory parameters in that individual patient, extent of pas t response to conventional HLH therapy (if 
a second -line patient).  
Page 49 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 44 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  The administration of an additional HLH treatment is also allowed later during the course of emapalumab 
treatment  in case of unsatisfactory  HLH control , provided that emapalumab has been administered at a 
dose of 6  (or 10 mg/kg  if the Investigator decided to do so ) for at least 2 infusions .  
Unsatisfactory HLH control is defined as follows : 
-patients who have not achieved or maintained a disease control and general conditions that
woul d allow to proceed to transplant
-patients who  present a clinically relevant worsen ing.
If an additional HLH treatment is needed, etoposide is the drug of choice, unless there is evidence 
indicating that an alternative agent should be selected. The rationale for administration of additional HLH 
treatments (including the choice of an agent alt ernative to etoposide, if applicable) has to be documented 
in the patient’s medical file and in the Dose Notification Form ( Appendix E ). 
At any time,  the Investigator can decide to discontinue emapalumab treatment and opt for a different 
HLH regimen in the patient’s best interest, as described in the Section 10.1.3 . 
6.4 CONTRACEPTION  
Females of child -bearing potential require the use of highly effective contraceptive measures (failure rate 
of less than 1% per year) from Screening until 6 months after receiving last dose of the study drug.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures include:  
•Sexual abstinence : refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period
defined above.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to
its duration and compatibility w ith the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) is not an
acceptable method of contraception)
•Hormonal contraceptives: combination or progesterone only
•Intrauterine methods: intrau terine devices or systems
•Bilateral tuba l occlusion
•Vasectomised partner.
Males with partner(s) of child -bearing potential must agree to take appropriate precautions (such as 
sexual abstinence, barrier contraception, vasectomy) to avoid fathering a child f rom Screening until 
6 months after receiving last dose of study drug.  
6.5 EMERGENCY TREATMENT  
Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylactic shock require prompt IV treatment with adrenaline and 
antihistamines. Oxygen shall be supplied through a face mask. Pat ients must have an appropriately sized 
IV line that allows rapid infusion of colloid volume substitution. In case of an anaphylactic reaction 
patients shall be transferred as soon as possible to the intensive care unit of the hospital.  
Following the first administration of emapalumab  and before leaving their reference cent er, each patient 
(and/or patient’s legal representative) will be given a card to carry at all times in case of any emergency. 
The card gives details of the name of the drug, name of the responsible physician, and the address and 
telephone number of the study site.

Criteria for the definitions of response are reported in Table 4. 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
•Overall Response, i.e., achievement of either Complete or Partial Response or HLH Improvement , at
EOT or Week 8 (whichever occurs earlier) .
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
•Overall Survival, including survival to HSCT and survival after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion
(if HSCT is not performed)
•Event -free survival
•Overall Response, i.e., achievement of either Complete or Partial Response or HLH Improvement, at
start of conditi oning (or at last emapalumab infusion if HSCT is not performed)

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis   
7.2 SAFETY  ENDPOINTS  
Safety and tolerability of emapalumab will be assessed as follows:  
•Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes  of AEs (serious and non -serious)
•Evolution of relevant laboratory parameters, e.g., complete blood cell (CBC) count, liver and renal
function tests, and coagulation par ameters
•Number of patients  who discontinued emapalumab treatment  for safety reasons
7.3 PHARMACOKINETIC ENDPOINT S 
The serum concentration of emapalumab  will be measured as a function of time to determine the 
emapalumab PK profile .  
Pharmacokinetic  data will be visually examined using appropriate graphical analysis.  
Individual emapalumab concentration -time profiles will be subject to population PK analysis using non -
linear mixed effects modelling. The anticipated covariate effects of body weight and  time -varying total 
IFNγ  will be included in the model. Additional covariate effects might be investigated. Individual and mean 
PK parameters will be tabulated.  
Measurement of emapalumab concentrations may be performed in an exploratory manner, if clinical ly 
indicated, in other matrices, e .g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  
7.4 PHARMACODYNAMIC ENDP OINTS  
Determination of PD parameters as a function of time will include the following s: 
•Levels of circulating total IFNγ (free + bound) at a ny time -point
•Markers  of IFNγ neutrali zation, namely CXCL9 and CXCL10
•Other relevant HLH biomarkers, e.g., sCD25 a nd other exploratory biomarkers
•Level (if any) of circulating antibodies against emapalumab  (ADAs )
Population PK/ PD analysis using non -linear mixed effects modelling will be undertaken.  The main PD 
biomarker investigated will be CXCL9.  
Additional PD biomarkers will also be evaluated (e.g. , sCD25  and other exploratory biomarkers) . The 
anticipated covariate effect of  time -varying total IFNγ  will be included in the CXCL9 model. Additional 
covariate effects might be investigated. Individual and mean PD parameters will be tabulated.

8 OUTLINE OF STUDY PRO CEDURES  
Patients will be recruited from specialized  study sites , equipped with an intensive care unit and access to 
a bone marrow t ransplant unit.  
Patients will be in the treating unit the day before the first administration of emapalumab (Study Day 
minus one, SD -1). 
For a detailed description of the schedule of visits and assessments , refer  to the Schedule of Assessment  
Table 1 (Screening and Treatment Period ) and Table 2 (Follow -up Period ). 
Informed consent form must be signed by the patient o r his/her legal ly authorized  representative prior 
to any study -related procedures , with the assent of patients who are  deemed suitable to provide it .  
During the emapalumab treatment period, visits for infusion and efficacy/safety assessments will occur 
on SD0, SD3 and twice -a-week thereafter (not more than 4 days apart).  In the circumstances when HSCT 
is scheduled beyond  12 weeks from emapalumab initiation and Complete Response is maintained (see 
Section 5.3), the treatment with emapalumab may continue once a week; acceptable time -window for 
visits in this case will be 1 day.  An EOT visit has to be performed 3 1 days after last emapalumab infusi on. 
Furthermore, d uring the follow -up period, the following time -windows are allowed around visits:  
- Pre-conditioning :  can be combined with EOT visit provided the two visits are 
not more than 2 days apart  
-Week ( Wk) 1-2-3, D+30 post -HSCT:  2 days
-D+60, D+100  post -HSCT : 1 week  
-6-mo, 1 -yr post -HSCT : 4 weeks  
If HSCT is not performed, the described schedule applies to the follow -up visits required to occur after 
the last emapalumab infusion.  
Following windows can be  applied to the vital signs measurement:  
-When measured every 15 minutes:    5 minutes  
-When measured every 30 minutes: 10 minutes  
-When measured at 1 hour and 2 hours after infusion:  15 minutes
Some procedures are not to be done systematically but only if clinically relevant. For example:  
•ECG is mandatory at Screening  and at EOT visits, however it should  be done at any other time -
point  during the study , if deemed appropriate .
•Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is mandatory at Screening  only  in case of CNS disease ,
but should be done  at any other time -point s during the study to monitor evolution or to confirm
onset of CNS involvement , as clinically indicated .
•Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis is to be performed at Screening providing that coagulation
function allows, but should be done at any other time -point s during the study to monitor
evolution  (if the initial analysis was abnormal ), or to confirm new onset o f CNS involvement .

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  •Search for pathogens  (other than TB)  at Screening and  during the study should be done if there is
any suspicion of infection , and should  be performed at relevant time intervals to follow the
evolution of infections, either pre -existing or emerging during the study .
•Chest X -ray should be performed at Screening and during the study  in case of clinical suspicion of
a pulmonary infection  or to  follow -up a pre -existing infection at Screening/baseline .
If planned as standard of care, alternative imaging methods will be accepted as a replacement  for per 
protocol imaging  (with exception of abdominal ultrasound ): namely, brain computeriz ed tomograph y (CT) 
or cranial ultrasound will be accepted as a replacement of brain MRI, and chest CT will be accepted as a 
replacement of chest X-Ray. 
If CBC, coagulation, biochemistry and imaging assessments  cannot be  performed on the day of the 
scheduled visit,  assessments within  1 day window from scheduled visit  date  will be accepted  as a 
replacement.  
Analysis done on blood samples will favor as much as possible the use of micro -sampling techniques . 
When blood drawing need s to be limited , laboratory sa fety parameters (which  would have been done as 
normal disease monitoring)  will be prioritized.   
Volumes of blood are calculated assuming a maximum 2 -week screening, 6 -month treatment period with 
infusions twice a week, 1 -year follow -up with emapalumab dete ctable at all timepoints, pregnancy test 
performed (total study duration of 18.5 months), and amount to 98 mL for study -specific assessments 
(PK, PD, ADA); 253 mL for CBC, biochemistry, coagulation and pregnancy test; 31.5 mL for search for 
infections. Amo unt of blood drawn per 8 weeks of study (41.4 mL) is therefore within acceptableiv 5-10% 
total blood volume draw for patients of the first year of life, and under 5% of total blood volume for older 
children . 
8.1 SCREENING  
Patients will be screened for eligibility prior to enro lment in to the study.  An Eligibility Review Form 
(Appendix C ) will be completed and shared with the Sponsor after the patient is consented, t o guide the 
joint review of patient’s eligibility.  
A pre-screening checklist ( Appendix D ) is an additional tool  to assist the  Investigator to make  decisions 
such as patient transfer ,. This checklist  enables rapid preliminary assessment of patient’s eligibility based 
strictly on th e information available from routine patient care. The p re-screening checklist  does not need 
to be shared with the Sponsor  
A screening  log will be maintained by the Investigator  with specification of  reasons for non -eligibility.  
Screening evaluations should be completed within the  2 week s prior to the first administration of study 
drug ( Visit 1 ). Evaluations performed before ICF signature, but within this window and as per routine  care, 
will be accepted for screening purposes. Patient’s medical record  should clearly denote these evaluations 
as standard of care.  
The following information must be collected and the following procedures must be performed:

for Tuberculosis  via PCR  in any relevant specimen  should be
performed to have a baseline, as this test will be used during the
course of the study to perform regular TB monitoring.
▪Infection search  at Scre ening should be performed according to the
patient’s clinical presentation. At a minimum EBV and CMV viral loads
should be assessed.
▪Atypical mycobacteria , Histoplasma capsulatum , Shigella ,
Salmonella , Campylobacter  and Leishmaniavi, as appropriate. The
presence of Leishmania  can also be ascertained by direct bone

•Vital signs : body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure , oxygen saturation
•If present at baseline or emerging during treatment, the following parameters will be collected
until resolution:
-evolution of viral load and positivity for an identified pathogen (frequency of collection
driven by site local practices).
9.2 RECORDING AND REPORTING  SAFETY PARAMETERS  
9.2.1 Adverse E vents  
Adve rse events  (AEs) are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a patient  during the study, 
whether or not considered related to the IMP. All  AEs occurring during the study , i.e. ,  from  the date of 
ICF signature  up to and including the end -of-study visit must  be recorded on the AE page of the  electronic 
CRF (eCRF). Once emapalumab serum levels are no longer detectable, only serious AEs (SAEs) will be 
recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  
Medical conditions present at Screening or diagnosed at the Screening visit will be recorded in the medical 
history section of the eCRF.  
An AE which occurs between the Screening visit and the start of first IMP administration will be considered 
as a pre -treatment AE.  
Any AE that occurs after the start of first IMP administration will be considered as a Treatment Emergent 
Adverse Event (TEAE) , including  the specific situations described below . AEs are collected after signing of 
ICF up to Study Completion or  until serum levels of emapalumab are no longer detectable (whichever 
occurs first) . After elimination of emapalumab only SAEs will be reported . 
Shou ld a pre -existing medical condition worsen (clinically significant change in intensity or frequency), it 
must be recorded as an AE in the eCRF and, depending on the time of its occu rrence, will be considered 
as a pre-treatment AE or a TEAE. Should a medica l condition record ed as a pre -treatment AE worsen  after 
start of IMP administration , it will be recorded in the eCRF as a separate TEAE, specifying `Worsening of 
xxx`.   
For all AEs, the following will be assessed and recorded: onset and end dates (and -whe n relevant - time), 
intensity, seriousness, relationship to IMP, action taken regarding IMP, any treatment received , and 
outcome .  
Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three -points scale  (mild, moderate, severe) using the modified World 
Health Organization (WHO) toxicity scale (Grade 3 and 4 are considered to be the severe grade). If AE 
severity is not mentioned in the scale, assessment will be made using the following definitions:  
•Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal activity
•Moderate: Disco mfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity
•Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity
For a given AE, the assessment of its intensity should reflect th e highest grade (on the three -point  scale 
mentioned above) reported durin g its course (except when the intensity of a pre -treatment AE increases 
after treatment initiation, as indicated above).  
The relationship of AEs to the IMP  will be assessed by the Investigator  using a “Yes/No” classification. A 
“Yes” relationship infers t hat there is a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the IMP. The

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey that there are facts, evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. In this study , emapalumab  is the only IMP.   
Specific situations:  
-Common HLH signs and symptoms  (e.g., anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia,
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) will not be reported as separate AEs unless clearly attributed to a cause
different from HLH, and the verbatim term should indicate the cause.
-If changes in the above  mentioned HLH signs and symptoms indicate HLH worsening or reactivation,
worsening or reactivation will be reported as an AE.
-Fever will only be reported when not linked to an identified cause with the highest temperature
considered during the period. If it is a recurrent fever it can be entered as intermittent fever with no
need to specify the temperature (the intensity should be a reflection of the highest temperature
observed). If fever is considered as a sign of a confirmed infection or of HLH worsenin g or reactivation,
only the diagnosis should be reported as an AE, and not `fever`.
-Viral load positivity, in particular for EBV, CMV and adenovirus, and evolution will be c ollected o n a
dedicated eCRF module.
- Active infections will be reported as AEs, indicating whether constituting a primary infection or a
reactivation (whenever possible). Pathogen positivity and evolution will be collected in a dedicated
eCRF module.
-Expected effect s of conditioning (i.e. , pancytopenia during conditioning and until engraftment) will
not be reported.
9.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 Any AE is considered “serious” if  it: 
•results in death (note: death is an outcome, not an event);
•is life -threatening; (note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient was
at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could
hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe);
•requires in -patient hospitalization o r prolongs an existing hospitalization;
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
•is an important medical event , i.e. , refers to an event  that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require  hospitalization but  may be considered as serious when, based upon
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient , and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  above .
The following re asons for hospitalization are exempted from being reported : 
•elective hospitalizati ons for surgical procedures that are a result of a patient’s pre -existing
condition(s) which have not worsened during the study ;
•hospitalization requested  for emapalumab infusion and study visits  (including a possible hospital
stay overnight, if due to logistic convenience) ;
•post -HSCT hospitalization as a measure of caution in this fragile population , to investigate a
clinical sign or symptom (e.g. fever), provi ded that the hospital stay has a duration of less than 72
hours and does not result in any confirmed new diagnosis (e.g., negative search of infection in

Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 60 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  presence of fever which resolves with symptomatic measures); in this case the sign will be 
recorded as  an AE.  
For the initial SAE report, the Investigator  should report all available case details concerning the patient 
and the event , using the Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG SAE reporting form  within 24 hours of awareness . 
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG contact information for SAE reporting:  
E-mail: NI-0501drugsafety@sobi.com
Relevant follow -up information on SAEs should be forwarded to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG as soon 
as it becomes available. In addition, the Investigator  must be available to answer without delay any 
request for follow -up information or question s that Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG may have regarding 
the SAE.  
All SAEs will be recorded on the appro priate page of the eCRF. They will be reviewed, evaluated and 
followed up until  the event resolves or is considered stable  by a study physician . 
If either the Sponsor or Investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting . 
9.2.3 SUSAR reporting  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs  that are both:  
•related, i.e. , there must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and
undesirable reaction to the IMP under investigation, regardless of the administered dose
•unexpected, i.e. , the event is not listed as an expected serious adverse reaction in the  Reference
Safety Information (RSI) of the Investigator’s Brochure
All SUSARs will reported by the sponsor to relevant Health Authorities, Ethics Committees 
(ECs)/Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs )/Research Ethics Boards (REB)  and investigators as per 
appl icable regulations.  
Under the USA 21 Code of Federal Regulation ( CFR) 312.32(c), the Sponsor (directly or through a 
delegated third party) is required to notify the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and all participating 
Investigators in an Investigationa l New Drug ( IND) safety report (i.e. , 7- or 15 -day expedited report) of 
potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor receives the safety information and determi nes that the information 
qualifies for reporting.  
Investigators in the US A are required  to promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risk to human subjects or others, including AEs that should be consid ered unanticipated problems (21  CFR 
312.66) , such as IND safety reports . 
In countries other than the US A, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all SAEs and against cumulative 
product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to 
investigators, IRBs, ECs, REBs and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislati on. 
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG will also report  all SUSARs to the EMA's EudraVigilance database within 15 
days , as well as to the relevant National Competent Authorities when required . Fatal and life -threatening 
SUSARs will be reported within 7 calendar d ays, with another 8 days for completion of the report.

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.4 Managing Abnormal Laboratory Test Values 
All  laboratory tests (hematology, coagulation, blood chemistry) will be  captured in the database from the 
local laboratory .  
Laboratory test abnormalities must be consider ed as AEs and recorded on specific AE pages of the CRF  
only  if they :  
•require specific intervention for correction, or
•lead  to a change in study medication (e.g., dose modification, interruption or permanent
discontinuation), or
•qualify  as grade 4 severity as per modified WHO toxicity scale
If a laboratory test abnormality leads to a new clinical diagnosis, the new clinical diagnosis should be 
reported as an  AE rather than the laboratory abnormality.  
Laboratory test abnormality that qualifies as an AE as per the definition above,  will follow the AE/SAE 
reporting process described in this section .  
Laboratory abnormalities which are considered to be  part of HLH signs  and symptoms  (see Section 9.2.1 ) 
will not be reported as AEs. If laboratory abnormalities are  indicative of an HLH reactivation or worsening, 
the reactivation or worsening of HLH will be reported as the AE, and not the laboratory abnormalities 
themselves.   
9.3 FOLLOW -UP OF SAFETY PARAMETERS  
9.3.1 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Adverse events should be followed up to resolution or stabilization or until they return to baseline status 
(in the event of an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition).  
For AEs still ongoing at study completion or withdrawal , where return to baseline st atus or stabilization 
cannot be established , an explanation should be recorded.  
9.3.2 Follow -up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values  
Abnormal laboratory findi ngs that qualify as AEs should be followed -up as per Section 9.3.1 . 
9.3.3 Pregnancy  
Occurrence of pregnancy in a study participant will require discontinuation of the IMP and entry into the 
study follow -up period.  
Pregnancies, incl uding pregnancies of female partners of male study participants  must be reported to 
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG within 24  hours of awareness  on the Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG 
Pregnancy form.   
A pregnanc y must be followed until its conclusion.  Any AE associated with the pre gnancy occurring during 
the follow -up period after study treatment discontinuation must be reported in the eCRF. Any SAE 
occurring during the pregnancy must be reported on an SAE form as described in Section 9.2.2 .

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  9.4 BENEFIT/RISK MANAGEM ENT 
9.4.1 Safety Surveillance  Management  
HLH is a rare disease, and experience gathered  from previous exposure of patients to emapalumab  is still 
limited . It is therefore  required  that patients are monitored  during  and for 2 hours after  each  infusion  of 
emapalumab, and that infusion s are administered  under medical supervision within a unit having 
emergency equipment .   
The iDMC will ensure that any emergent safety concern will be assessed in a timely manner  and 
appropriate measure taken for the patients, if relevant. Moreover, iDMC will be specifically tasked with 
regular assessment of the extent of benefit and fatal eve nts prior to transplant in the treatment -naïve 
subgroup of patients.  
9.4.2 General Benefit/Risk Considerations  
9.4.2.1  Potential benefits  
Based on evidence available from  comprehensive analysis of  the NI -0501 -04 and NI -0501 -05 studies  that 
formed  the basis of the BLA and MAA submissions , emapalumab  administration has shown the potential 
to improve or resolve relevant clinical and laboratory abnormalities of HLH . Emapalumab demonstrated 
a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in H LH disease activity, assessed through 
objective clinical and laboratory parameters, in 64.7% of patients.  Response occurred early during 
treatment and was generally sustained. The reduction in HLH disease activity was sustained and was 
associated with an o verall survival benefit that persisted following HSCT.  The observed treatment effect 
was consistent across all efficacy endpoints. Emapalumab was well tolerated in doses up to 10  mg/kg and 
no off -target toxicity has been identified.  Emapalumab treatment co uld be continued safely and 
effectively beyond 8 weeks in patients for whom the search for a donor was longer than expected.  
The response to emapalumab  seems  independent of:  
•the presence and typ e of causative mutations
•the presence and type of an infectio us trigger
On 20 November 2018, emapalumab was approved by the FDA "for the treatment of adult and  pediatric  
(newborn and  older)  patients  with  primary  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with refractory, 
recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance wit h conventional HLH therapy".   
For more  details , refer  to the latest Investigator ’s Brochure ( currently  version 10.0 , dated 24 January 
2020 ).  
9.4.2.2  Risks 
•Infusion -related reactions
Infusion -related reactions  (IRRs)  are commonly associated with  monoclonal antibody  infusions  and are 
defined as signs or symptoms with a temporal relationship to the administration of an infusion  and 
assessed as related , typically occurring  soon  after the start  of the infusion , although symptoms may be 
delayed for up to 24h. They might be limited (skin reaction) or systemic.  
After  more than 1000 infusions administered to HLH patients up to the dose of 10 mg/kg , no 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid or other significant reactions were observed with emapalumab. IRRs were  
mainly transient skin reactions observed during and shortly after emapalumab infusions (corresponding 
Page 68 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 63 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  to less than 2% of the infusions performed). They resolved spontaneously and did not lead to 
ema palumab permanent discontinuation.  
From the clinical experience  to date , the risk of IRR s associated with emapalumab treatment  seems to be 
very low. However , the infusion should be performed under medical supervision with monitoring of vital 
signs during and for 2 hour s after emapalumab infusion  as outline in Section 8.  
•Immunogenicity
Occurrence of ADAs inactivating therapeutic effects of the treatment and, in rare cases, inducing adverse 
reactions, is a potential risk associated with the administration of  monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ). As of 
24 August 2019 , treatment -emergent ADAs were detected in : 
•1 out of 14 healthy subjects participating in study NI -0501 -03; a low titer of ADAs was
measured at the last follow -up visit (at week 44 post -emapalumab administration
•3 out of 45  patients treated in the context of NI -0501 -04/05 studies
•1 patient treated in compassionate use developed transient ADAs
No AEs, including decreased e fficacy, attributable to antibodies have occurred  in these patients. In 
addition, in ongoing studies in patients with sJIA/MAS (NI -0501 -06, N=8 ) and in patients with pHLH 
(NI-0501 -09, N=9 ), no ADA were detected.  
•Drug -drug interactions
High IFN γ production and subsequent hyper production of other cytokines during active pHLH might 
downregulate cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYPs ), resulting in suppression of CYP isoenzymes activity 
during active disease. Anti -cytokine mAbs have the potential to restore  CYP activity back to normal, 
through neutralization of the pro -inflammatory cytokine which is targeted by the antibody and the 
ensuing reduction in inflammation ( Morgan, 2009 ). The restoration of CYP activity may therefore alter 
the elimination of concomi tant medications metabolized by these CYPs.  During the clinical trials with 
emapalumab, no events of Therapeutic Protein -Drug Interactions (TP -DI) were reported in pHLH patients.  
•Infections
The impact on the immune defen se caused by the neutralization of IFN γ is known from patients with 
inborn errors of the IL -12/23 -IFN-γ circuit, particularly patients with complete or partial IFN γ receptor (R) 
deficiency, and patient s developing neutralizing auto anti -IFNγ antibodies.  Patients with IFNγ R deficiency 
are prone to develop mycobacterial infections and, although to a lesser extent, Salmonella  infections  
(Dorman 2000 , Jouanguy 1997 ). The m ean age of the first environmental mycobacterial infection is 3.1 
and 13.4 years in p atient s with complete and partial deficiency, respectively  (Remus 2001 ).  
No systematic prophylaxis is recommended in these patients . If an infection occurs, appropriate antibio tic 
therapy based on sensitivity of isolated species is prescribed.  
Individuals with anti-IFNγ auto -antibodies are also susceptible to develop mycobacterial infections (for 
the vast majority atypical mycobacterial infections), but also opportunistic infections (e.g. , caused by 
Histoplasma capsulatum, Salmonella , HZV) (Browne 2012 ). 
Toxicological studies carried out with emapalumab  have shown an increased susceptibility  to enteral 
pathogen infections in  monkeys having received emapalumab , when the enteral pathogen was  present  
in the intestinal tract  prior to emapalumab  administration . Therefore, p resence of  infections due to  
Shigella , Salmonella and Campylobacter  pathogens is part of the exclusion criteria.

Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 64 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  As to the development of infections caused by pathogens known to be favor ed by the absence of IFN γ 
biological activity, a reactivation of HZV (which resolved after a normal course with no sequelae) was 
observed in one healthy volunteer, at a dose of 3 mg/kg; and one HLH patient enrolled in the NI -0501 -04 
study developed a disseminated histoplasmosis which resulted in treatment discontin uation. This 
infection resolved with adequate antifungal therapy, even though emapalumab  was still at detectable  
concentrations in  blood.  
Other infections reported during or after administration of emapalumab  are the same ones  commonly 
observed in immunocompromised patients or are the same ones  described in pediatric population s 
(seasonal viral infections). Patients with active infe ctions (except for the exclusionary ones) were enrolled 
and treated in the study. The presence of active infections did not lead to  the discontinuation or dose 
decrease of emapalumab treatment , and infections resolved  on study drug  when treated appropriate ly 
and not associated with a refractory dise ase status.  Severe or serious i nfections were generally reported 
in patients with previous recent significant exposure to immunosuppressive treatments as they added an 
additional risk factor for infection develo pment. Importantly, emapalumab treatment has not been 
associated with myelosuppression.  
Active infections, as per patient’s clinical presentation, must  be carefully followed over time, including 
quantitative monitoring (e.g. viral loads, antigenemia, antigenuria), when relevant.  
For more details refer to the latest Investigator’s Brochure ( currently  version 10.0, dated 24 January 
2020 ).  
9.4.2.3  Risk minimizatio n measures  
In view of the above reported considerations, the benefit/risk profile of emapalumab in children 
diagnosed with pHLH is considered to be favorable .  
Specific measures  are implemented  to minimize the potential risks described above  as follows : 
•As per eligibility criteria , patients with evidence of active Mycobacteria , Histoplasma,
Shigella, Salmonella , Camp ylobacter  or Leishmania  infections,  or latent tuberculosis will not
be included in the study (for details see Section 4.1.2 ). Patients who received live or
attenuated live vaccine within 6 weeks prior to screening are excluded from the studies with
emapalumab .
•Monitoring of IRRs : infusions will be  performed  under medical supervision  to immediately
identify the occurrence of  any IRRs. Each of the specialized centers will have  person nel
adequ ately trained in IRR managemen t.
•Prophylaxis for HZV for all patients , and t uberculosis for a defined subpopulation (see Section
6.2), is required per  protocol .
•Occurrence of e merging infections  and evolution of pre -existing infections  are monitored
through regular physical examination  and laboratory testing, including  detection of
tuberculosis . Ad hoc search for infections will be performed based on signs and symptoms
indicating a suspicion of infection . Empirical antibiotherapy  will be introduced  when  deemed
appropriate,  and proper monitoring of active pre -existing infections or emerging infections
will be conducted.

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  10 STOPPING RULES  
10.1 AT PATIENT LEVEL  
10.1.1  Decision to Slow Down or Stop Emapalumab  Infusion due to Systemic Reaction  
During the infusion of emapalumab , any significant change compared to pre -infusion values in vital signs , 
such as those listed below , should trigger appropriate immediate care:  
•Sudden and sustained increase or paradoxical decrease of heart rate (duration of more than
5 minute s) compared to pre -infusion value  and not linked to child’s anxiety or fear ;
•Sustained (an episode of more than 5 minutes duration or more than 3 episodes of shorter
duration , i.e., 3 minute) oxygen desaturation (below 90%) ;
•Any clinical sign or complaint indicative of patient  distress
The decision to interrupt  the infusion might be  taken by the physician in the event of any of the above 
mentioned occurrences.  
The decision to restart the infusion will be based on the evolution of the patient `s status (i.e. , resolution 
of symptoms after a ppropriate symptomatic measures, e.g., oxygenation or administration of anti -
histamine treatment), and upon physician’s own medical judgment. The infusion will generally be 
restarted at a lower rate.  
All changes in infusion rate will be recorded in the pat ient’s medical chart and the eCRF each time there 
is a rate modification, as well as at the end time of premature or delayed termination of the infusion.  
10.1.2  Local Issues During Emapalumab  Infusion 
Unless related to a hypersensitivity re action, a local infusion issue such as catheter displacement, 
obstr uction or product extravasation,  will trigger the infusion of the remaining quantity through a new 
venous access as soon as possible. All information related to the incident will be recorde d accurately  in 
the patien t’s medical chart prior to be ing entered in the eCRF . This includes reasons, volume of IMP 
potentially lost (to calculate the quantity of drug infused ), time at which the infusion stop ped, time  at 
which the  infusion was resume d and time of end of the infusion .  
To avoid this type of incident , it is preferable that  a central venous access is used : this will improve 
patient’s comfort and ensure a reliable drug administration in particular in infants and toddlers or in case 
of foreseen difficulties with peripheral venous access.   
10.1.3  Decision to Discontinue Treatment  or to Withdraw from the Study  
The Investigator  can decide at any time during the study to discontinue the treatment for an individual 
patient based on his/her own medical judgment , taking into  account the individual benefit/ risk ratio for 
his/her patient. After treatment discontinuation (for any reaso n), the patient will continue in the study 
for a long -term follow -up. 
In addition, the patient (or their legal representative) can decide at any time to withdraw from the study . 
The reason for premature treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal should be documented in the 
patient’s chart and shared with the Sponsor.  
Page 71 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 66 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  The I nvestigator may request  expert  advice or a discussion with the Sponsor to receive additional 
information , if relevant prior  to taking  a decision;  however , the ultimate decision remains the 
Investigator`s  responsibility .  
In any case , the decision to withdraw or be withdrawn  from the study and/or treatment  will have no 
impact on the patient ’s care and on further treatments administered to him/her after withdrawal.  The 
man agement of th ese patient s is described in Section 10.3 . 
10.2 AT STUDY LEVEL  
Recruitment may be temporarily  suspended in the following situations:  
•occurrence of unexpected fatal or life -threatening  adverse reactions ;
•emergence of severe drug reaction s linked to a common cause/ risk factor at different sites
Patients already enrolled in the study should continue receiving emapalumab  per protocol unless decided 
otherwise by the Investigator.  
The suspension will allow  for the analysis of  the available data by the Sponsor and  the iDMC . 
After re -evaluation of benefit/risk, the sponsor and iDMC may recommend any of the following: 
•to resume recruitment without any change ;
•to implement  risk minimization  measures that may require protocol amendmen t;
•to implement conditions for study termination , e.g., next occurrence of a particular serious drug
reaction
The management of patients already enrolled in the study will  also be part of the iDMC  recommendations.  
10.3 MANAGEMENT OF TREATM ENT DISCONTINUATION  
All patients who discontinue emapalumab  treatment  will be treated according to the standard care at the 
site.  However, it is recommended they continue in the study for long -term follow -up monitoring . 
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND A NALYTICAL PLAN  
Full deta ils of all statistical issues and planned statistical analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized  prior to the locking of the study database. This section contains 
an overview of the planned methods of analysis.  
11.1 SAMPLE SIZE  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint of “Overall Response”.  
Assuming an Overall Response Rate of 65%, a minimum of 34 treated patients is required to show a 
significant improvement above 40% with 85% power using an exact binomial test  at a one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.   A drop -out rate of 20% may be expected, hence a total maximum of 41 patients 
may be enrolled.  
Due to the rarity of pHLH, recruitment is competitive across all European and NA  sites in order to gather 
data in a reasonable timeframe .

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  11.2 ANALYSIS SETS  
All analysis sets will be defined prior to final database closure. In addition to the analysis sets listed below, 
further ex ploratory analyses may be performed using other subgroups of patients.  
11.2.1  All Treated  Analysis Set  
The All Treated  Analysis Set will include all patients who receive any part of an infusion of study drug , and 
will be as the Primary Efficacy and Safety Analysi s Set.  
11.2.2  Evaluable  Analysis Set  
The Evaluable  Analysis Set will consist of patients in the All Treated Analysis S et who are evaluable for 
efficacy, i.e. : 
•Have received a minimum of 3 consecutive infusions of emapalumab
•Have not had a  diagnos is of s econdary HLH subsequent to the  initiation of emapalumab
treatment
11.2.3  Enrolled Population Analysis Set  
The Enrolled Population Analysis Set will include all subjects w ho sign the inform consent. This population 
will be used for disposition and major protocol deviations summaries only.  
11.3 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL METHODS  
For measurements of continuous endpoints, summary statistics will include n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum values. For binary data (proportions of patients showing a defined 
response  for example ) numbers and percentages will be tabulated. For time to event data, Kaplan -Meier 
plots will be provided together with the median should this be available. Finally , 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated for suitable summary statistics associated with endpoints of interest.  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on both the All Treated  and Evaluable Analysis Sets . Safety ana lyses 
will be conducted on the safety se t. 
11.3.1  Efficacy Data  
The analysis of the primary endpoint, Overall Response Rate, will utilize an exact binomial test to evaluate 
the null hypothesis that the response rate is at most 40%. This test will be undertaken at  the one -sided 
0.025 level.  
Time to Response, Duration  of Response, and Survival time will be presented using Kaplan -Meier curves 
with medians calculated if available. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
median for each of these endpoints.   
For maintenance of response achieved any time during the study , event of interest will be the loss of 
response, with patients in response being censored on the day starting conditioning.  
Additional endpoints based on binary outcomes including number of patients who reduce glucocorticoids 
by 50% or more, and number of  patients able to proceed to HSCT  will be converted to proportions and 
associated 95% confidence intervals calculated.

Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 68 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical significance in terms of p -values will only be obtained for the primary endpoint in both the All 
Treated and the Evaluable analysis sets. All other endpoints will be viewed as supportive for the primary 
endpoint and as a consequence no formal hierarchy of endpoints will be declared.  
11.3.2  Safety Data  
All data relating to safety will be listed and summari zed using descriptive statistic s. 
AEs will be coded and tabulated by body system, and by individual events within each body system. AEs 
will also be tabulated by severity and relationship to the study medication. Su mmaries will also be 
produced for  SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal of treatment.  
For each clinical laboratory test, individual patient values will be listed and summari zed and change from 
pre-treatment baseline values calculated and summari zed. Any values outside the standard reference 
range will be flagged. Summaries of ma rked abnormalities and shift tables  or boxplots will be tabulated 
for each laboratory test.  
In addition, other exploratory analyses of safety data, including summaries for different subsets of 
patients, may be conducted.  
11.3.3  Pharmacodynamic Data  
All PD data wi ll be summari zed using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations.  
Exploratory statistical models will be fitted, and correlation analyses undertaken, to investigate the 
relationships between PD data and other biomarkers and the clinical measures of response. ROC curves 
may be used to summari ze any relationships that are found.  
In addition, other exploratory analyses of PD endpoints, including summaries for different subsets of 
patients, may be conducted.  
11.3.4  Immunogenicity Data  
The numbers of  patients with anti -drug antibodies present at each assessment point will be summari zed. 
11.3.5  Missing Data  
Imputation rules will be pre -defined in the SAP prior to final database close, in order to keep to a minimum 
the number of patients not being evaluated fo r the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
11.4 REPLACEMENT POLICY  
11.4.1  For Patients  
Additional patients will be recruited into the study if patients are withdrawn from the study for reasons 
other than safety or lack of efficacy to ensure a sample size of a minimum of 34 patients . 
11.4.2  For Centers  
A cent er may be replaced for the following administrative reason s: excessively slow recruitment , poor 
protocol adherence.

The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation 
of this study are designed to ensure that Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG, its authorized  representative, 
and Investigator s abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/IEC/REB  prior to commencement and 
where applicable by law also from National Competent Authorities. The Investigator will conduct all 
aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent 
regulatory authoritie s. 
12.2 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are appropriately qualified and 
adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study -related duties 
and functions. T he Investigator should maintain a list of sub -investigators and other appropriately 
qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study -related duties.  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patients  (or their legally a uthori zed 
representative) who  sign an informed consent document and are screened for entry into the study. 
Patients  who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in their  source documents and the study -
screening log.  The I nvestigator should maintain source documents and trial records that include all 
pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. Source data should be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete.  
The Investigator, or a designated membe r of the Investigators’ staff, must be available during monitoring 
visits, audits and inspections to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject s’ records 
(e.g. , medical/hospital records, office charts, hospital charts, and study relate d charts) for source data 
and other type s of verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs 
and queries.  
12.3 CONSENT  
Before being admitted to the clinical study, the patient  must consent to participate after the nature, 
scop e, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to 
him or her. An informed consent document that includes both information about the study and the 
consent form will be prepared and given to the patient . This document will contain all ICH -GCP, and locally 
required regulatory elements (whichever is more stringent). The document must be in a language 
understandable to the patient  and must specify who informed the patient , and when the informed 
consent was obtaine d.  
Information to patients will be split into a Patient Information Sheet that provides detailed information 
about the trial and its benefits and risks, and the Informed Consent Form that summarizes  the content of 
the Patient Information Sheet and is used  to obtain the dated signature from the patient as evidence of 
the patient’s agreement to partake in the study.  
If applicable, s ince minors are involved in the trial, assent must be obtained from the minor and informed 
consent from at least one of the pare nts or as mandated by local rules (individual or judicial or other body 
authorized  under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient  to the patien t’s 
participation in the procedures involved in the research). The language used in the Assen t Form is adapted 
Page 75 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 70 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  to the maturity level of the minor involved in the trial. Since minors of different age groups are likely to 
be entered into the trial different versions of the Assent Form will be p rovid ed. The modalities for 
obtaining informed consent f rom the parents and Assent from the minor will be defined at the site 
initiation visit and documented in the clinical trial center  Trial Master File ( TMF ). 
After reading and understanding the informed consent document, the patient  (or their legally authori zed 
representative) must give consent in writing. The written informed consent will be obtained prior to 
conducting any study -related procedures or tests. The patient ’s consent (or the consent of the patient’s 
legally authorized  representative) must be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated 
signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. A copy of the signed consent 
document must be given to  the patient  or their  legally authorized  representative. The Investigator will 
retain the original signed consent document. The Investigator  will not undertake any measures 
specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obta ined.  
If an amended protocol impacts the content of the informed consent document, the consent document  
must be revised. Patients  already participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented 
must be re -consented with the revised version of t he informed consent document. A copy of the revised 
informed consent document must be given to the patient  or their  legally authorized  representative. The 
Investigator will retain the original signed updated consent document in the study files.  
12.4 CONFIDENTIA LITY AND DATA PRIVAC Y 
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG affirms the patien t's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to 
be in compliance with ICH -GCP and other local regulations (whichever is more stringent). Swedish Orphan 
Biovitrum  AG requires the  Investigator to permit Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG represen tatives and  when 
necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities , to review and/or copy any medical records 
relevant to the study in accordance with local laws (any copies of patients’ reco rds must be dul y 
anonymi zed to protect patient s’ confidentiality).  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization  separate from the patien t’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
12.5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Substantial a mendments will be submitted to the IRB/ IEC/REB  for written approval  and where applicable 
to National Competent Authorities . Written approval must be obtaine d before implementation of the 
amended version occurs. The written signed approval from the IRB/EC /REB  should specifically reference 
the Principal Investigator ’s name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is/are  
applicable.  
12.6 APPROVAL OF  THE CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AND AMENDME NTS 
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, informed consent document, and any other appropriate 
documents will be submitted to the IRB/ IEC/REB  with a cover letter or a form listing the documents 
submitted , their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which 
approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance 
with local legal requirements.  
Swedish Orphan Biovitr um AG can only supply study drug to an Investigator after Swedish Orphan 
Biovitrum  AG or their authorized  representative  has received documentation on all ethical and legal 
requirements for starting the study. This documentation must also include a list of the members of the

Page 79 of 98
Study NI -0501 -09 NI-0501 in Primary HLH  Page 74 of 92 
Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  The Investigator should promptly notify Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG of any inspections scheduled by 
any regulatory authorities and promptly forward to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG copies of any audit 
reports received.  
13.3 SERIOUS GCP BREACHES  
Swedish Orphan Bio vitrum  AG is required to report a serious GCP Breach within 7 days of awareness of 
the breach to applicable health authorities.  
A serious GCP breach is a breach likely to affect to a significant degree the safety (both physical and 
mental) and rights of a  subject or the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical trial.  
Therefore, should an Investigator become aware of a possible serious GCP breach, e. g., an important  
protocol deviation , or non -reporting of critical safety information that ha s the potential of jeopardizing  
patients’ safety, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG must be notified within 24 hours.  
14 DOCUMENTATION AND US E OF STUDY FINDINGS  
14.1 DOCUMENTATION OF STU DY RESULTS  
An eCRF is used i n this study  and a specific eCRF will correspond to  each subject. 
All requ ired information must be entered on the eCRFs. If an item is not available or is not applicable,  this 
fact should be indicated and no blank  spaces must be left . The data collected on the eCRF w ill be entered 
into the study database. If the Investigator authori zes other personnel to enter data into the CRF, the 
names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be supplied to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  
AG or their authori zed represent ative before these individuals start completing CRF information.  
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG will ensure that the I nvestigator has control of and continuous access to 
the eCRF data reported to the S ponsor. Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG will not have exclusi ve control of 
those data.  
The eCRF pages must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator named in the study p rotocol or by a 
designated sub -Investigator. Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AG will ensure that the CRF copies left with the 
Investigator (print -outs and /or CD -ROM) are an exact copy of the data maintain ed in the database.  
14.2 USE OF COMPUTERI ZED SYSTEMS AT THE CL INICAL TRIAL CENTRE  
When clinical information of patients are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized 
medical record system (electronic Health Records System; i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the 
electronic record can serve as the source docum ent if the system has been validated in accordance with 
health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An 
acceptable electronic Health Records System allows preservation and integrity of the original entry of 
data by ongoing review, change control processes and audit trails. If original data are modified, the system 
should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, 
the name of the person making the change, the date  and the hour  of the change. The investigator should 
be able to demonstrate medical oversight of the trial when electronic Health Records Systems are used, 
e.g. verifying entries of study nurses on ongoing basis.
The system must allow the sponsor, clinical research associate s, auditors or inspectors to verify source 
data without infringing privacy rights of other patients, e.g., access must be restricted to records 
pertaining to the study patients and access to other patients must not be possible. T his should include

Protocol NI -0501 -09 Version 4.0 Global  – Final 31 March 2020   CONFIDENTIAL  access to the audit trail. If the electronic Health System does not comply with these requirements, the 
sponsor reserves the right to be provided with paper print outs from the System containing the same 
information as the electronic ori ginal records.

Name of Investigational Product : Risperidone Implant  
Name of Active Ingredient : Risperidone  
Methodology : The study will be a 6 month, open-label, multiple center stud y in approximately 60 
stable subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective  disorder to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokine tics of risperidone and 9-OH-risp eridone following implantation of two 
or three, 300 mg  Risperidone Implants.  It will be followed by a 6 month safety extension for subjects 
who agree to receive a second im plant. Subjects who are diagnosed with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-V and are stable on a  daily 4 mg oral dose of risperidone 
for at least 8 weeks will be recruited into the study. Subjects  will be implanted with two or three 300 
mg Risperidone Implants.  Approxima tely the first 10 subjects w ill receive two 300 mg implants; 
approximately 50 additional subjects will receive three 300 mg implants. All implants will be placed in 
the inner aspect of the upper arm. Samples for determination of  plasma concentrations of risperidone, 
9-OH-risperidone and the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-OH-r isperidone) will be obtained prior to 
and after insertion of the Risperidone Implants.  
The additional 50 subjects who receive the three 300 mg implant s will stay in the treatment center for 
7 days prior to and 7 days post implantation of the initial Ris peridone Implants. Subjects can check in 
up to 16 days prior to allow flexibility for subject check in. Safety monitoring and pharmacokinetic 
sampling will be conducted during the in-house period of the st udy. Scheduled outpatient visits, that 
will include safety monitoring and pharmacokinetic sampling, wi ll be conducted for the remainder of 
the implantation period. After 6 months, the first implants wil l be explanted and subjects may be 
implanted (at their same dose le vel) with two or three addition al implants for an additional six 
months in the same site in a safety extension.  Again, schedule d outpatient visits that will include 
safety monitoring will be conducted for the remainder of the im plant period.  A subset of study 
participants (approximately 15 subjects) will also have pharmac okinetic sampling during the 7 days 
following reimplantation, as well as throughout the remainder o f the study. A subset of 
approximately 10 subjects who are re-implanted during the safet y extension will be followed with 
serial monthly ultrasounds for 6 months to characterize ability  of high resolution ultrasound to 
localize implanted rods. Following explantation of the second s et of Risperidone Implants, each 
subject will be converted back to his/her pre-implant oral risperidone dosing regimen.  
Number of Subjects (Planned):  Approximately 10 subjects will receive the two 300 Risperido ne 
Implants (600 mg risperidone) a nd approximately 50 subjects wil l receive three Risperidone 
Implants (900 mg risperidone). A  subset of approximately 15 sub jects in the 900 mg risperidone 
group will have additi onal pharmacokinetic s ampling during the 7 days following re-implantation, 
as well as throughout the remainde r of the safety extension.

Investigational Product, Dosage , and Mode of Administration:  
2x or 3x Risperidone Implant 300 mg  
risperidone, 4 mg, oral tablet  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration : None  
Duration of Treatment :  Approximately 56 weeks, up to 50 weeks of Risperidone Implan t. 
Criteria for Evaluation : 
Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples f or pharmacokine tic assessment of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone 
plasma concentrations will be obt ained for the oral risperidone  dose and for the Risperidone Implants.  
 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined for  risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone, and 
active moiety (risperidone + 9-O H-risperidone) after the 4 mg o ral dose of risperidone on Day -1: 
AUC0-24h, Cavg, Cmax, Ctrough, and Tmax.  
 
The following parameters will be  determined for risperidone, 9- OH-risperidone and active moiety 
following the Risperidone Implants: AUC3-180 days , AUC3-t (where t represents the duration of 
pharmacokinetic sampli ng in subjects not completing the 180 day  sampling schedule), AUC monthly 
for each month of the 6 month periods, C avg monthly for the each month of the 6 month period, C avg 3-180 
days and  Cavg 3-t. The C avg values for risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and active moiety over  time will be 
calculated as their respective AUC value divided by the number of days over which the data was 
collected. In the event a subject  discontinues during the impla ntation period AUC 3-t and C avg will be 
assessed, if determined evaluable by the pharmacokineticist.  
 
 
Efficacy Assessment:  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PAN SS) will be summarized using 
appropriate descriptive statis tics for pharmacokinetic populati on. 
 
Safety: Safety parameters will be monitored throughout the stud y by collection of vital signs, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, ECGs, physical examinations, implant si te assessments, extrapyramidal 
symptom assessments, (EPS), Columbia Suicide Severity Scale ass essments (C-SSRS), Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson Rating Scale (SAS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale 
(BARS) and adverse event (AE) monitoring.

Name of Investigational Product : Risperidone Implant  
Name of Active Ingredient : Risperidone  
Statistical Methods : 
Approximately 40 will provide ove r 90% power to establish that implant is non-inferior to the oral 4 mg 
dose of risperidone.   In the samp le size calculation it was as sumed that the true ratio was 1.1 and the 
coefficient of variance (CV) was  less than 0.45.  These assumptions were based on internal data.  
Therefore, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled to ensure  approximately 40 subjects completing 
the study assuming that the drop rate is less than 20%.   
 
Analysis Populations: Safety population will consist of all subjects who have received any study 
medication.  
 
The pharmacokinetic ( PK) population will consist of subjects who receive 4 mg oral risperidone daily 
and the Risperidone Implant.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: All pharmacokinetic results (concentration and pharmacoki netic variables) 
will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics whe re applicable. The total active moiety 
will be considered the primary interest.  The ratios of Risperi done Implant C avg  over oral C max, over 
the oral C avg  and over the oral C trough will analyzed based on log-transformed scales using an 
ANOVA model with treatment effects.  The two sided 95% confidence intervals will be presented.   
Safety/Tolerability Analyses: The frequency of AEs will be tabu lated using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms and treatment 
for each cohort. The maximum intensity and frequency of AEs wil l also be summarized by treatment 
and cohort.  
Vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations, asses sment of implant site, EPS assessment 
and ECGs will be summarized by treatment and study day (visit) using descriptive statistics or 
frequency distribution, as appropriate.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Schizophrenia is a chronic debili tating mental illness, which is estimated to affect 0.4% to 0.71% 
of the population ( Goldner et al., 2002). Men and women are equally affected by the disease 
although men usually present with t he illness in their late tee ns or early 20s; whereas, women 
usually present 10 years later in  their late 20s or early 30s ( Castle et al, 1991 ). The course of 
schizophrenia is typically cha racterized by episodes of psychotic behaviors occurring at varying 
intervals between periods of rel ative symptomatic stability. Th e symptoms may involve multiple 
psychological realms, such as perception (halluci nations), ideation, reality testing (delusions), 
thought processes (loose associatio ns), feeling (flatness, inap propriate affect), behavior (catatonia, 
disorganization), atte ntion, concentration, m otivation (avoliti on, impaired intention and planning), 
and judgment. These psychological and behavioral characteristic s are associated with a variety of 
impairments in occupational or s ocial functioning. Although the re can be marked deterioration 
with impairments in multiple domains of functioning (e.g., lear ning, self-care, working, 
interpersonal relationships, and living skills), the disorder is noted for great hete rogeneity across 
persons and variability within persons over time.  
Patients with schizophrenia usua lly do not return to baseline f unctioning, and there is often further 
deterioration after each relapse . Prevention of future exacerba tions is a critical goal of therapy, 
and patients who stay on continual treatment are more likely to  achieve better outcomes. Patients 
with schizophrenia generally have impaired insight and do not r ecognize that they have the 
illness. This lack of insight leads to poor or partial complian ce with their prescribed medication 
which in turn results in reduced t reatment efficacy, earlier re lapses, higher psychiatric admissions, 
reduced quality of life, increase d suicide rates, and a shortened life expectancy. An estimated 50% 
of patients do not adhere to prescr ibed medication regimens for  a variety of reasons.  The lack of 
compliance leads to increased morbidity, decreased quality of l ife, and consequently, an 
associated increase in healthcare costs. One of the patient-driven reasons for noncompliance is the 
patient’s inability to adhere to daily dosing on a long-term ba sis. Current depot formulations of 
antipsychotic only provide medi cation coverage up to one month.  A formulation such as 
Risperidone Implant, provides th erapeutic dose levels of Risper idone over 6 months and should 
further enhance patient complia nce and therefore improve patien t outcomes   
Risperidone, the active pharmaco logical ingredient (API) in the  Risperidone Implant, was first 
marketed by Janssen Research Found ation under the brand name Ri sperdal® (NDA 20-272) and 
was approved in the United Sta tes in 1993 and in Europe in 2008  to treat schizophrenia (Van Peer 
et al., 1996). The mechanism of action of r isperidone is believed to be through blockade of both 
the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 2 (5-HT2) and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2) (Page et al., 2010 ).  Risperidone is also marketed by the Janssen Research Founda tion as a depot 
intramuscular injection under th e brand name Risperdal CONSTA® (NDA21-346).  Three dosage 
strengths are marketed (25  mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg) given every 2  weeks; following this regimen, 
plasma concentrations during the  dosing interval are maintained  within the range achieved by oral 
therapeutic doses of risperidone. The steady state average expo sure of the 25 mg and 50 mg 
intramuscular depot injections ( Risperdal CONSTA) and the corre sponding daily administration 
of 2 mg and 4 mg oral tablets, re spectively, were comparable.

 Risperidone Implant utilizes a  novel drug delivery implant tech nology (polyurethane polymer 
technology), that had been developed by Endo Pharmaceuticals So lutions Inc. in order to deliver a 
wide range of drugs and small mo lecules for an extended period of time. The Risperidone Implant 
is a subcutaneous implant composed of 300 mg USP grade risperid one, National Formulation 
(NF) grade croscarmellose sodium , NF grade stearic acid, and biomedical grade polyurethane 
(Tecoflex® EG-80A). Tecoflex E G-80A is an, aliphatic, polyether -based polyurethane membrane 
that controls the rate of risperidone release. The dimensions o f the implant are approximately 
50 mm long with an outside diameter of approximately 4 mm. Risperidone is delivered 
systemically via passive diffusi on at an anticipated release rate of 1.2 to 1.5 mg/day (based on 6-
month dog data) for a period of up to 6 months ( RISI-TR-10-007, Endo Pharmaceuticals,  2010 ). 
This release rate is expected to result in achieving similar st eady-state trough levels from a 4 
mg/day oral dose of risperidone. 
The Risperidone Implant is a re servoir-type drug delivery syste m in which risperidone pellets are 
enclosed within a sealed, cylindrical polymer membrane, made of  Tecoflex EG-80A. The polymer 
membrane controls the rate of  diffusion of the drug substance t o provide the re lease appears 
superficially to be a pseudo-zero- order however a more detailed  analysis of models development 
is presented in a separate report.  The polymer membrane is not intended to exert therapeutic 
effects although it acts to imp rove product delivery via contro lled release of t he drug substance. 
The proposed initial indication for the Risperidone Implant is “maintenance treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults”. The Ris peridone Implant may offer sig nificant advantages over 
risperidone oral tablets and long-acting depot formulations of antipsychotics (i.e., Risperdal® 
Consta®) including: 1) reduce d pain, anxiety, and risk of infec tion associated with frequent IM 
injections; 2) ability to remove the implant if treatment needs  to be discontinued urgently, which 
is not possible with the depot i njectable formulation; 3) impro ved patient compliance, which is 
expected to lead to improved functional outcomes and reduced re lapse rates and EPS; 4) 
improved convenience for patients  and healthcare providers due to less frequent clinic visits; and 
5) reduced healthcare costs because of improved functional outc omes, reduced relapse rates, 
reduced clinic visits for drug dosing, and reduced hospitalizat ions. 
For adults with schizophrenia,  the effective dose range of oral  risperidone tablets is 4 to 
16 mg/day with a target dose of 4 to 6 mg/day.  
Additional information about the R isperidone Implant can be fou nd in the Investigator’s 
Brochure/Prescribing Information. 
1.1.1 Summary of Nonclinical Findings and Safety  
The endocrine, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiovascular  effects of risperidone have 
been characterized as part of the original Risperdal® New Drug Application (NDA 20-272) 
(Risperdal NDA 20-272, 1993 ). The safety and efficacy of risperidone have also been 
demonstrated in acute, sub chronic and chronic toxicity, reprod uctive and developmental 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies in support of the original Risperdal NDA 20-
272 ( Risperdal NDA 20-272, 1993 ). Findings in these studies  were consistent with the 
proposed mechanism of action, i.e., antagonism of 5-HT2 and dopamine receptor type 2 (D2) of 
risperidone. 
Comprehensive biocompatibility t esting of Tecoflex EG-80A impla nt was performed in

 accordance with ISO 10993 requirements for a permanent, tissue contact implantable 
biomaterial. Testing included acute toxicity, genotoxicity, loc al tolerance, cytotoxicity, 
implantation, and pyrogenicity. Extracts of blank Tecoflex EG-8 0A were not systemically toxic, 
mutagenic, cytotoxic, or pyrogenic, and did not elicit a dermal  sensitization response. Extracts of 
blank Tecoflex EG-80A were not irritating when injected intrade rmally in rabbits and 
subcutaneous (SC) implantation of empty Tecoflex EG-80A implants for up to 6 months in dogs, 
4 weeks and 6 months in rats , or  36 weeks in rabbits were very  well tolerated systemically, and 
did not elicit an adverse local reaction. 
The safety of risperidone and empty (blank) Tecoflex EG-80A imp lant was demonstrated in the 
3- and 6-month toxicity studies in Beagle dogs. There was no sy stemic toxicity observed with 
empty (blank) Tecoflex EG-80A implants in both studies.  In bot h studies, findings related to the 
perturbations of the pituitary-reproductive axis, consistent with the previously reported effects 
of risperidone, have been observed with Risperidone Implants. I n the 3-month dog toxicity 
study, chronic inflammation (mild to severe) was noted microsco pically at the implantation site 
in 1 of 8 blank Tecoflex EG-80A animals and two (2) of 8 Risper idone Implant animals. The 
inflammatory changes were consis tent with infection, and not in dicative of a local reaction to 
Tecoflex. 
In the 6-month dog toxi city study, blank Tecoflex implant-relat ed findings included local dark 
red area noted at primary necropsy in one animal, mild to sever e fibrosis, minimal to mild 
chronic-active inflammation, and minimal to moderate hemorrhage  at the implant sites. At the 
end of recovery, only mild fibrosis and minimal brown pigment w ere observed microscopically 
in 1 out of 4 blank implant animal s, indicating local implant s ite recovery. At the primary 
necropsy, dark red and yellow areas at the implant site were ob served in 1 male in the 
risperidone group. These observa tions were cons idered potential ly related to the implant. 
Microscopic findings of mild to severe fibrosis, minimal hemorrhage, minimal to mild chronic-
active inflammation, and minimal to mild brown pigmentation at the implant sites were noted 
in the risperidone gr oup. At the end of recovery, only minimal fibrosis and mild brown pigment 
were observed in 1 out of 4 rispe ridone group animals, indicati ng local implant site recovery. 
These findings indicate implant biocompatibility with no toxic leachables and no 
biodegradation of either blank Tecoflex or risperidone-containing Tecoflex implants. No particles or foreign body reaction to p articulate were identifi ed in any of the implant sites 
indicating that biodegradation, by any mechanism, with loss of integrity of the devices was not 
present. Histological evaluati on of the recovery necropsy impla ntation sites and recovery 
necropsy-incision sites showed no inflammation, granulation tis sue, foreign body reaction, or 
fibrous capsule formation. These findings indicate reversibilit y of the inflammatory and wound 
healing responses following remo val of the implant, and no pers istence or delayed occurrence 
of test article-related effects. 
The effects of age, moderate and severe renal impairment, and l iver disease on the 
pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone have been evaluated (Snoeck et al., 
1995). The elimination rate and clearance of 9-OH-risperidone was r educed in the elderly and 
patients with renal di 
sease because of a diminished creatinine clearance, while the PK of 
risperidone in the elderly and cirrhotic patients were comparable to those in young patients. The 
total clearance of oral risperidone was reduced in patients wit h renal disease. Based on the 
pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, a dose reduction and a c autious dose titration in the

 elderly and in patients with  renal disease is recommended (Snoeck et al., 1995) . In patients with 
cirrhosis of the liver, the single-dose pharmacokinetics were c omparable to those in healthy 
young subject s, thus no dose adjustment is required. 
1.1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism in Humans  
The PK and metabolism of the active ingredient risperidone, has  been extensively studied in 
human subjects, patients with schizophrenia, and patients with bipolar disorders. In addition, 
the PK of risperidone has been evaluated in subjects with impai red hepatic and renal function 
(Snoeck et al., 1995 ).  
Risperidone metabolism in humans, as well as in rats and dogs, results in the formation of an 
active metabolite, 9-OH-risperidone. In humans, this metabolite  has a different PK profile 
(longer half-life: 20 hours versus 3 hours compared with risper idone), but has in vitro 
pharmacological and potency profiles comparable to that of risp eridone (Mannens et al., 1993 ). 
For this reason, the sum concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH -risperidone are generally 
considered the “active drug moiety.” 
The hydroxylation of risperidone to the 9-OH metabolite is cata lyzed mainly by cytochrome P-
450 system (CYP) 2D6, a polymorphically expressed CYP in humans . The ratios of risperidone 
to 9-OH-risperidone in plasma and urine differ in humans phenot yped as extensive metabolizers 
(EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) o f debrisoquine or dextrometho rphan ( Mannens et al., 1993; 
Huang et al., 1993 ). 
Following an oral dose of 14C-risperidone to healthy subjects,  Mannens et al., 1993 found that in 
the urine of EM subjects, only 3.5%  of the dose was the parent compound, while 30% of the 
dose was recovered in the  urine of PM subjects ( Mannens et al., 1993). Although the primary 
elimination pathway of risperidone is through metabolism, the a ctive metabolite 9-OH-
risperidone is primarily eliminated by renal excretion. In urin e, 9-OH-risperidone represented 
32% of the dose in the  EM, but only 8% in the  PM. Other metabolites, of far less importance, 
were detected in urine. Only 3% to 5% of the dose could be iden tified as glucuronide conjugates 
in urine, indicating that glucuronidation is a minor metabolic pathway ( Mannens et al., 1993 ).  
After intravenous dosing, risperidone plasma concentrations fel l in a biphasic manner with a 
distribution half-life of 6 minutes followed by a terminal half -life of 3 hours in EM and 17 to 
22 hours in PM. The apparent volum e of distribution of risperid one (1.1 L/kg) was independent 
of the metabolic phenotype. Ren al clearance of risperidone repr esented 3% of the total 
clearance in the EMs (394 mL/min ), and about 20% of the total c learance in the PMs (54 
mL/min) ( Huang et al., 1993 ). Although the clearance of r isperidone differed by 7-fold 
between EMs and PMs, the plasma A UC and also the clearance of t he active moiety differed 
only by 20% between PMs and EMs because the EMs extensively for m the active metabolite 
(Van Peer et al., 1996). The terminal half-life of the active moiety averaged 20 hours ( Huang 
et al., 1993 ). 
The effects of age, moderate and severe renal impairment, and l iver disease on the 
pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone have been evaluated (Snoeck et al., 
1995). The elimination rate and clearance of 9-OH-risperidone was r educed in the elderly and 
patients with renal disease because of a diminished creatinine clearance, while the PK of 
risperidone in the elderly and cirrhotic patients were comparable to those in young patients. The

 total oral clearance of risperidone was reduced in patients wit h renal disease. Based on the 
pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, a dose reduction and a c autious dose titration in the 
elderly and in patients with  renal disease is recommended (Snoeck et al., 1995). In cirrhotic 
patients, the single-dose pharmacokinetics was comparable to th ose in healthy young subjects, 
thus not requiring dose adjustment. 
1.2 Previous Human Experience  
Endo has completed two clinical s tudies, first a 3-month first in human Phase 1 study (EN3342-
101) in 6 subjects diagnosed with s chizophrenia whose disease w as maintained with a daily 4 mg 
oral dose of risperidone.  In thi s study there were no serious adverse events (SAEs), or 
discontinuations due to an AE occurred. Adverse events were rep orted in five (5) of the 6 enrolled 
subjects. There was 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) o f erectile dysfunction. The AE 
reported included incisional si te pain, paresthesia, and hypoes thesia in the arm of the 
implantation, constipation, arthr algia, join swelling, worsenin g of extrapyramidal disorder, 
worsening of schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation.  The PK data  indicated that th e active moiety 
Cave from the risperidone Implant  over a 3-month period averaged approximately 77% of the 
subjects’ oral risperidone C trough level.  The implants used in R isperidone Implant-101 contained 
375 mg risperidone. 
The second study was another Ph ase 1 study with a 6-month in du ration in 35 subjects (EN3342-
102) study, including 5 subjects w ho only received oral risperidone and discontinued prior to 
receiving EN3342 implants, and there were 10 subjects each in t he 480 mg, 720 mg, and 960 mg 
Risperidone Implant doses/tre atment groups. The most common TEA E overall was injection site 
pain (40.0%), which occurred in 1 subject (10.0%) in the EN3342  480 mg group, 7 subjects 
(70.0%) in the 720 mg group and 4 subjects (40.0%) in the 960 m g group. Injection site 
hemorrhage, incision site edema, anxiety and psychotic disorder  were also relatively common 
(occurring in 13.3%) of subjects  overall. Implant site pain, difficult device use and weight 
increased were reported in 10.0%  of subjects overall, while oth er TEAEs were each reported in 
only 1 or 2 subjects, overall. There  was no discernible difference in patterns of TEAEs between 
the 3 treatment groups, other tha n possibly a higher incidence of implantation-type events in the 
720 mg group, and a higher inciden ce of psychotic disorder in the 960 mg group (30.0% of 
subjects vs. 10% in the 720 mg group and 0% in the 480 mg group). Comparison of oral 
risperidone and the Risperidone Imp lants demonstrate that while  Cmax and C avg were higher in oral 
risperidone, C trough for oral risperidone was more comparable to C ss for EN3342 implants at 
respective dose levels.

1.3 PK Model Summary  
 
All PK data (risperi done, 9-OH-risperidone , and total active dr ug) from study EN3342-102 could 
be modeled.  Total active drug conc entration (risperidone + 9OH -risperidone) is the best 
representation of compound activ ity. EN3342 PK data show an imm ediate release of risperidone 
once implanted consistent with a s ingle day’s dose, then consta nt (the release appears superficially 
to be a pseudo-zero-order however a more detailed analysis of m odels development is presented in a 
separate report ) delivery of risperidone over a 180-day period. PK modeling co mparisons of 
EN3342 three 300 mg Risperidone Impla nts  (900 mg risperidone)  to daily oral risperidone 4 mg 
dosing suggests EN3342 mainta ins concentrations above C trough and below C max, and comparable 
to C avg over 180 days and which is being tested in this clinical study .

 3 INVESTIGAT IONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
The study will be a 26 week, open-la bel, multiple sites, Phase 2 study in stabilized subjects with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to evaluate the PK of  risperidone its active metabolite, 
9-OH-risperidone and the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-OH r isperidone) following 
implantation of the Risperidone  Implants. A 24 week safety extension will follow.  Subjects 
diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who ar e stable on a daily dose of 4 mg 
oral risperidone will be recruited into the study.  
Subjects will be implanted with  two or three 300 mg Risperidone Implants.  All implants will be 
placed in the inner aspect of the upper arm.  Plasma concentrat ions of risperidone and the active 
moiety will be measured prior to placement of the Risperidone Implants, throughout the first 6-
month implantation period 
The subjects will check into the clinic 16 to 7 days prior to i mplantation for the two or three 300 
mg Risperidone Implants and check-out 7 days’ post implantation  of the Risperidone Implants. 
Safety monitoring and PK sampling will be conducted during the in-house period of the study.  
Scheduled outpatient visits, tha t will include safety monitorin g and PK sampling, will be 
conducted for the remainder of the implantation period. After 6  months, the first implants will be 
explanted and subjects may be imp lanted (at their same dose level) in the same location in the 
arm with two or three 300 mg Ris peridone Implants for an additi onal 6 months in the safety 
extension.  Again, scheduled outpati ent visits that will includ e safety monitoring, will be 
conducted for the remainder of the implant period. A subset of subjects in the PK group 
(approximately 15 subjects) will  have pharmacokinetic sampling during the 7 days following 
reimplantation, as well as throughout  the remainder of the stud y in the extension.  Following 
explantation of the second Rispe ridone Implants each subject will be converted back to his/her 
pre-implant oral risperidone dosing regimen. The four non-PK ru n in subjects who received the 
three 300 mg implant checked in up to 4 days and a minimum of two days prior to implantation.  
The treatment design for thos e subjects receiving 600 mg or 900 mg is illustrated in Table 1  and 
the schedule of study evaluations is provided in Table 3 . The treatment design for the non-PK run 
in subjects who received 900 mg is illustrated in Table 2  and the schedule of study evaluations is 
provided in Table 3 .

16. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applie s to both Braeburn staff or 
staff at the investigational site) 
17. History of difficulty with phlebotomy procedures 
4.3 PK Subset Inclusion 
Approximately 15 subjects who compl ete through Week 26 will be included in the PK subset of 
subjects in the safety extension.  These PK subset subjects will remain in the clinic for 7 days 
after the explants and implant  procedure on Week 26.  After Week 27, the PK subset subjects 
will have the same procedures performed as the remaining subjects from Weeks 27 through 48.  These subjects will be selected based on order of completion of  the Week 26 visit, Investigator 
judgment, and subject informed consent. 
4.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
4.4.1 Criteria and Procedures for Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued fro m the study for the following r easons, if deemed appropriate by 
the Sponsor or Investigator: 
• Entered the study in viola tion of this protocol 
• Safety and/or Efficacy reasons as judged by the Investigator an d/or Sponsor (see 
section 10.3 and/or section 9) 
• Non-compliance to the protocol as  judged by the Investigator an d/or Sponsor 
• Required the use of a prohibited concomitant medication (see se ction 5.2) 
• Withdrawal of informed consent; any subject who withdraws conse nt as a result of an 
AE, regardless of severity or I nvestigator’s opi nion, must be r eported as a discontinuation 
due to an AE 
• In the Investigator’s opinion, it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue 
• Sponsor decision 
The date a subject discontinues, the treatment, and the reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded in the case report form (CRF). If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study 
procedures should be conducted. If, however, a subject withdraw s consent, no end-of-study 
procedures are required except the collection of AE information  and removal of the implant. This 
information should be recorded i n the CRF. The decision whether  to enroll replacement subjects 
will be made by joint agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor . 
When a subject is “lost to follo w-up” (i.e., fails to return fo r study visits), a reasonable effort will 
be made to contact him/her to determine a reason for the failur e to return and encourage the 
subject to return for removal of the implant. The detailed plan  that the research center will follow 
in attempts to contact a subject t hat fails to return for a vis it is listed below. 
12-Feb-2017 BB-P K-103 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals
Confidential Page 34 
 In the event a subject misses a scheduled outpatient visit duri ng the study, the following 
procedures will be conducted to locate the patient:   
• The study coordinator will attempt to contact the subject (e.g. , phone, email, or text) 4 
consecutive weeks in an effort to locate the subject and coordi nate his/her return to the 
research site. 
• If unsuccessful in contacting the subject the coordinator will contact the subject’s 
caregiver/emergency contact. 
• The study coordinator will contact the treating psychiatrist, therapist, case manager, and all 
other listed contacts and alert them of the urgency to call the  research site 24/7 if they have 
contact with the subject or can provide a location where the su bject can be found. 
• Once contact is established, the Investigator will assess the s ubject’s ability to continue in 
the study. 
• If the patient does not contact his/her caregiver, treating psychiatrist, therapist, case manager, or site, the Sponsor will request for a third party to  locate the patient to have the 
implant removed. 
All attempts to contact the subj ect must be documented in the s ource data. 
The subject will be considered l ost to follow up if the subject  is not successfully located using 
the plan outlined above and shoul d be identified as “lost to fo llow-up” in the CRF. However, the 
research site will request that all listed contacts continue to  monitor for the subject and request 
that they call the emergency num bers if contact i s made with th e subject. The research site will 
also continue to monitor their psychiatric network in efforts t o locate the subject.

5.2 Concomitant Medications  
Subjects will be permitted to continue on their current prescri bed medication regimens, including 
prescribed PRN medications, to treat stable coexisting medical and psychiatric conditions that are 
not associated with schizophrenia  or schizoaffective disorder w hile enrolled in the study. At 
entry to the study, if a subject’s current medication regimen i ncludes the use of a CYP450 2D6 
inducer or inhibitor the Investigator will inform the Sponsor. The Investigator must use caution 
when prescribing new medications to ensure that they are not inducers or inhibitors of CYP2D6. 
The following medications, defined as strong CYP inducers, are excluded from Screening 
through week 50:  carbamazepine , phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s wort. 
Any medication taken by a subject  during the course of the study (from Day -7 through week 
50) and the reason for use of the  medication will be recorded o nto the appropriate CRF page. 
Upon entering the study, each subject will be instructed to rep ort the use of all and any new 
medication to the Inve stigator. Subjects w ill also be instructe d about the importance of not 
taking any new medication (including OTC [over-the-counter] med ication) without 
consulting the Investigator. 
5.3 Treatment Compliance  
All oral Risperidone will be di spensed by the Investigator or d esignee and will be administered 
under supervision. All doses will be recorded in the subject’s CRF (dose, route of administration, 
frequency, date and time of each a dministration). During the pa tients in the clinical research 
facility stay, all efforts will be made to dispense the 4 mg oral risperidone to the patient for 
administration as close to the  same time each day.  A mouth and  hand check will be performed 
after each oral risperidone dose administration to ensure treat ment compliance.  
A Sponsor-trained, licensed physic ian will insert the Risperido ne Implants subc utaneously into 
the upper, inner aspect of the subject’s non-dominant arm betwe en the bicep and triceps. At the 
completion of the implantation period, the Risperidone Implants  will be removed by a Sponsor 
trained, licensed physician. The date and time of implantation and explantation and the arm that 
the implant was inserted in w ill be recorded in the subject’s C RF. If the subject  is reimplanted, 
the same site and dose will be used, and the dose, date and tim e will be recorded.  Detailed

provided to the Investigator separately. 
 
5.4 Restrictions on Study Subjects  
Subjects will be served standard ized meals during the confineme nt periods in the clinical 
research facility; no other foods will be permitted. A record o f the menu served will be 
maintained. Water is permitted ad libitum throughout the study.  
No alcohol containing foods or beverages may be consumed within 24 hours prior to check-in 
and extending until the subjects are discharged from the study site. 
All sexually active females of c hildbearing potential and all m ale subjects who are sexually active 
with a partner of childbearing potential must agree to use a me dically acceptable method of 
contraception throughout the entire study. Medically acceptable  methods of contraception for the 
subject and/or partner include abstinence, birth control pills or patches, diaphragm with 
spermicide, IUD, surgical sterilization, condom with spermicide , or progestin injection. 
Additionally, all males treated with Risperidone Implants must avoid donating sperm during 
treatment and for 3 months follo wing the final explants procedu re.

 6 STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Study Drug 
The risperidone Implant drug p roduct is supplied as a sterile i mplant. The 300 mg Risperidone 
Implant is composed of 5 pelle ts of 60 mg risperidone and a mem brane composed of aliphatic, 
polyether-based polyurethane that controls the rate of risperid one release.  The implants are 
manufactured by a Contract Management Organization, Xcelience, Tampa FL.    
Commercially available 4 mg risperidone oral tablets will be pr ovided at no cost to subjects and 
sites from check-in to Day -1.   
6.2 Study Drug Description, Packaging, and Labeling  
Risperidone Implant is packaged in a sealed clear polyester/foi l pouch containing one sterilized 
implant per package. Each pouch is labeled with a single-panel label containing product 
description, dose of risperidone contained in implant, lot numb er and Sponsor name. Each pouch 
is packaged into a carton with a  single-panel label containing protocol number, product 
description, lot number, storage conditions, caution statement and name and address of Sponsor. 
Kits containing all supplies need ed for implantation and explan tation will be provided. 
6.3 Study Drug Storage  
Risperidone Implant should be store d at controlled room tempera ture, i.e., 25°C (77°F); 
excursions allowed 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
Risperidone tablets should be sto red at controlled room tempera ture 15°C to 25°C (59° to 77°F) 
and protected from light and moisture.

opened, the implants shoul d be used within 1 hour. 
6.5 Administration  
A Sponsor trained, licensed physic ian will insert the Risperido ne Implants subcutaneously into 
the upper, inner aspect of the subject’s non-dominant arm (betw een the bicep and triceps). 
Reinsertions will be made in the same incision location following explantation. Detailed 
instructions for implantation and explantation procedures will be provided to the Investigator 
separately. The implantation/explantation kit will contain all the ancillary supplies necessary for 
implantation and/or explantation of the Risperidone Implants. T he implantation and explantation 
procedure must be performed using aseptic technique and the use  of a local anesthetic. 
 
Subjects will be administered thei r oral risperidone at approxi mately the same time each morning 
under direct supervision of the s tudy site personnel. If a subj ect is on an evening dosing regimen 
of 4 mg risperidone prior to study entry, the subject will be c onverted to a morning dosing 
regimen one week prior to admission to the clinical research ce nter. The dosing regimen a subject 
will follow once admitte d to the research center will be the sa me regimen they will be converted

6.6 Study Drug Accountability  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all  study medication received at the 
site is inventoried and accounted  for and that dispensed study medication is recorded both in the 
CRF and in the Study Medication Log. Drug accountability will b e verified by the monitor 
during site visits. 
Upon completion of the study and verification of the final stud y medication inventory by the 
monitor, a list of all the rema ining study medication will be p rovided to the Sponsor.  
The Principal Investigator will  not supply the study drug to an y person except those named as 
sub-investigators on Form FDA 1572, designated staff reflected on the Delegation of Authority 
Log, and consented subjects i n this study. Study drug may not b e relabeled or reassigned for use 
by other subjects. 
 
6.7 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All study medication and kits must be kept in a locked area wit h access restricted to designated 
study personnel. After completion of the study, all unused stud y drug will be returned to the 
Sponsor. The monitor will provide instructions to the site for the return drug shipment.

 7 ASSESSMENT OF PH ARMACOKINETICS  
7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
7.1.1 Blood Sample Collections 
Pharmacokinetic assessments for risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone a nd active moiety (risperidone 
plus 9-OH-risperidone) will be pe rformed for all subjects in th e study. Samples of venous blood 
will be obtained according to the clinical research facility st andard procedure and collected at the 
times indicated in the Sche dule of Study Evaluations (Table 3 -7). PK samples should be drawn 
from the arm contralateral to the implant. Samples collected wi thin 10% of the specified times 
will not be considered protocol de viations; however, every attempt will be made by the clinical 
research facility to collect samples at the specified times. The exact sample collection times will 
be recorded in the CRF t o the nearest minute. 
All plasma samples will be placed into a freezer at -20°C or be low within 1 hour after collection 
and further plasma sample handling instructions will be provide d and detailed by the central 
laboratory.   
 
7.1.2 Sample Storage and Shipment  
All plasma samples will be store d frozen (at -20°C or below) un til they are shipped to the 
analytical facility. Prior to shipping, the samples will be packed into thermal insulated containers 
and packed in sufficient dry ice to assure they remain frozen, and are protected from breakage 
during shipment to the analytical facility. Samples will be shi pped by ground courier with 
appropriate documentation to iden tify the samples. The samples will be divided into 2 shipments, 
each containing 1 aliquot of plasma for each time point. The second aliquot will remain at the site until Sponsor notifica tion of the receipt of the 1
st sample is received. 
The shipment schedule, shipping address, and contact informatio n will be provided to the site in 
a separate document. The analytical facility will be notified b y telephone, fax, and/or email prior 
to shipment of any samples 
 
7.1.3 Analytical Methodology  
A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS) method will be used for the determination of concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone from the 
plasma samples. Details of the method validation and sample ana lysis will be included in the 
final report.

 8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
8.1 Psychiatric Rating Scales 
All assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -
7) by clinicians train ed in the use of the rating scales. The n umber of clinicians who make these 
assessments should be k ept to a minimum. It is most desirable t o have only one person making 
all the assessments for a given day. 
 
8.1.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  
The PANSS is a rating scale used to assess the positive symptom s, negative symptoms, and 
general psychopathology specifi cally associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 
30 items. Each item is rated on a  scale from 1 (symptom not pre sent) to 7 (symptom extremely 
severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210. 
The PANSS positive sub-scale and the PANSS negative sub-scale contain seven items of the 
30 items, and the scores range from 7 to 49. The PANSS general psychopathology sub-scale 
includes 16 of the 30 PANSS items , and the score ranges from 16  to 112. To optimize the scales 
objectivity and standardization a tightly structured interview is important.

 9 CLINICAL CRITERION FOR LACK OF EFFICACY  
Any subject presenting with signs  and symptoms of lack-of-effic acy (LOE) will be evaluated by 
the Investigator, or designee. L OE will be evaluated using PANSS.  The subject will be 
withdrawn from the study and will be scheduled for implant remo val as soon as possible if LOE 
is determined. Once the implant has been removed, the subject w ill be restarted on his/her pre-
implant oral Risperidone dosing regimen. The Investigator will notify the Medical Monitor and 
Sponsor of each case of LOE.

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
10.1 Timing of Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will be obtained throughout the study. The t iming of these measurements is 
detailed in the Schedul e of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7). PK samples will be drawn before the 4 
mg oral risperidone dose during days -7 to -1 then at 0.5, 1, 2 , 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24 hours on 
Day -1 prior to implantation of R isperidone Implant for the pat ients that will be implanted with 
600 mg (2, 300 mg) and 900 mg (3, 300 mg).  The initial four “N on-PK run in” subjects in the 
three 300 mg implant group will not have PK draws done until th e pre-implant draw on Day 1 
(this group is no longer enrolling). 
On implant day, PK samples will be drawn pre-implantation, 2 an d 6 hours post implant, then 
daily from day 2 to day 7.  The follo wing “priority order” will  be in effect when more than 1 
assessment is required at a particular time point: 
• PK blood sampling will take prior ity over all study procedures unless there is a LOE. 
The exact time of collection to  nearest minute will be document ed in the CRF. 
• Safety parameters will be mon itored throughout the study by collection of vital signs, 
clinical laboratory evaluations , ECGs, physical examinations, i mplant site assessments, 
extrapyramidal symptom assessments, (EPS), Columbia Suicide Sev erity Scale 
assessments (C-SSRS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS ), Simpson 
Rating Scale (SAS), and Barnes Ak athisia Scale (BARS) and adver se event (AE) 
monitoring will be performed at a similar time per day.  The ex act time of assessments 
to nearest minute will be  documented in the CRF. 
10.2 Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Medical/Medication History and Demographic Information  
A detailed relevant medical hi story and medication history will be recorded for each subject at 
screening and reviewed/updated upo n admission to the clinical r esearch facility to confirm 
eligibility for the study. Signi ficant medical conditions or co nditions that are ongoing (e.g., 
headache, indigestion, diabetes, hypertension) will be recorded in the CRF. The medication 
history must identify any known drug allergies, present or hist ory of drug abuse and use of acute 
or chronic medications. 
Demographic information (i.e ., age, sex, and race) will be collected for all subjects and recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. 
10.2.2 Physical Examinations 
The complete physical examination assessment will be completed at the time points indicated in 
the Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7) and will include an assessment of the following: 
general appearance, skin, head and neck (including eyes, ears, nose, and throat), lymph nodes, 
thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities (including spine), cardiov ascular, lungs, abdomen and 
neurological systems. The screening physical examination will also include a measurement of 
body height and weight (without shoes) for determination of the subject’s BMI. 
12-Feb-2017 BB-P K-103 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals

 Except for the screening examination, if there has been a change from the previous examination, 
only that information need be recorded. 
10.2.3 Laboratory Evaluations  
Subjects should be fasting for at  least 8 hours pr ior to all la boratory evaluations. A complete 
series of laboratory evaluations (i.e., clinical chemistry, hem atology, and urinalysis), substances 
of abuse screen, virology screen, and serum pregnancy test (fem ale subjects only) will be 
performed at the screening visit . A complete series of laborato ry evaluations (i.e., clinical 
chemistry, hematology, lipid profile, and urinalysis), substanc es of abuse screen, and urine and 
serum pregnancy tests (female subjects only) will be performed in accordance with the 
Schedule of Study Evaluations on ( Table 3 -7). 
Lipid profile evaluations will be conducted at week 12 and 26, and also 40 and 48 in the safety 
extension. The required laborator y evaluations are detailed in Table 8 . 
Test results for the substances  of abuse screen, virology scree n, and serum pregnancy (females 
only) will be confirmed negative prior to implant of the Risperidone Implants as indicated in (Table 3 -7) documentation will be maintai ned with the source worksheets ; the test res ults will not 
be entered into the database.

 Antibodies, and HIV will be perf ormed for all subjects, unless a site’s IRB prohibits such 
testing. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to understand and comply with all laws and regulations that 
apply to the testing of blood for HIV and hepatitis B and C. These laws and regulations may 
include state laws related to written consent, separate from th e ICF for this study, and pre- and 
post-test counseling.  
Any clinically significant abnormalities should be fully investigated and reported as AEs. 
Whenever possible, the etiology of the abnormal findings will b e documented in the CRF. 
Laboratory results with clinically significantly abnormal value s should be repeated for 
confirmation. Additional tests and other evaluations required t o establish the clinical 
significance or etiology of an abnormal laboratory result or to monitor the course of an AE 
should be obtained when clinically indicated. In particular, if a clinically significant abnormal 
result is observed that is not resolved by the final study visit, repeat tests should be performed to document resolution or stability of the abnormality. 
The diagnosis associated with any clinically significant laboratory abnormality will be recorded 
as an AE on the CRF. Recorded A Es should indicate the underlyin g abnormality or diagnosis 
(e.g., renal insufficiency) as opposed to the observed deviatio n in laboratory results (e.g., 
elevated creatinine). 
Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either seriou s or unexpected should be 
promptly reported to the Medical Monitor. Any additional releva nt laboratory results obtained 
by the Investigator during the c ourse of this study will be sup plied to the Sponsor. 
 
10.2.4 Vital Signs  
Routine vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, resp iration rate, and oral body 
temperature will be obtained at t he times indicated in the Sche dule of Study Evaluations 
(Table 3 -7).  Blood pressure assessments  should be conducte d in the arm  contralateral to the 
implant. 
Blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate will be obtaine d after the subject is in the supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Additional vital signs will be  obtained when clinically indicated. 
Any additional relevant data obtained by the Investigator durin g the course of this study will be 
supplied to the Sponsor. 
 
10.2.5 12-Lead Electrocardiograms 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the times indicated in the Schedule of Study 
Evaluations ( Table 3 -7). The ECG will be obtained af ter the subject has been restin g in the 
supine position for at least 5 minutes. The ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT, and QTc), heart 
rate, and ECG findings will be recorded in the CRF. Additional ECGs may be obtained if 
clinically indicated. A follow-up ECG will be obtained at the Investigator’s discretion if any 
symptom-oriented abnormalities are detected after dose administ ration. Any additional 
relevant data obtained by the Inve stigator during the course of  this study will be supplied to 
the Sponsor. Clinically signifi cant ECG findings will be report ed to the Medical Monitor.

 10.2.6 Implant Site Assessments 
 
Implant site assessments will include monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection, (e.g., 
pain, tenderness, swelling, erythema, exudate) and tolerability . The presence of the implant will 
be assessed by palpation in add ition to the visual examination at the times indicated in the 
Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7). Clinically significant findings, as judged by the 
Investigator, resulting from t he implant site assessment will b e recorded as AEs. If an infection 
develops at the implant site, th e subject will be withdrawn fro m the study and the implant will 
be removed. The infection will be  treated in accordance with st andard medical practice. Once 
the implant has been removed the subject will be restarted on h is/her pre-implant oral 
risperidone dosing regimen.  Additionally, ultrasounds may be p erformed at the discretion of the 
Investigator to confirm implant location.  
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor of a ny clinically significant findings 
related to implant assessments. 
 
10.2.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Assessments  
Safety testing to monitor for si gns of EPS will assessed at the  times indicated in the Schedule of 
Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7).  The assessments will be conducted with the use of the fol lowing 
objective rating scales: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson Rating Scale 
(SAS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS). 
Assessments will be completed by clinicians trained in the use of the rating scales. The number 
of clinicians who make these asse ssments should be kept to a mi nimum. It is most desirable to 
have only one person mak ing all the assessme nts for a given day . 
 
10.2.8 Columbia Suicide Severity Scale 
Suicidality will be assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -
7). 
 
10.3 Early Explantation and Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
10.3.1 Suspicion of Implant Breakage 
If it is suspected that an imp lant has been broken or damaged during the insertion procedure the 
implant will be removed and the subject will be withdrawn from the study. If there is no 
immediate suspicion of implant b reakage or damage during the in sertion procedure, subjects will 
be followed closely during the inpatient stay with assessments of symptoms, vital signs, ECGs, 
and plasma drug concentrations. Previous experience with implan t technology has shown that 
plasma levels rise more quickly than predicted and to higher le vels than expected when an 
implant is damaged during inser tion. The occurrence of EPS and tachycardia have been observed 
in cases of excessive ingestion of oral risperidone ( Page et al., 2010 ) and these signs and 
symptoms should be monitored afte r implantation of the Risperid one Implants. 
 
After discharge from the inpatient phase the following criteria  should be followed to identify if an 
12-Feb-2017 BB-P K-103 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals
Confidential Page 46 
 implant may have been damaged: 
• During the outpatient phase of the study all subjects will be i nstructed to call the site if 
they have a sudden change in feeli ngs of wellness that may be r elated to possible 
exaggerated pharmacologic effects. If a severe or serious adver se event (SAE) is 
reported within 24 hours following implantation of the Risperid one Implant and is 
considered at least possibly related to the Risperidone Implant  the subject will be 
withdrawn from the study and have the implant removed. 
At the time of explantation, it is expected that the implant will be removed as a single piece. If 
any breakage occurs, attempts w ill be made to remove the remain ing piece(s). If the remaining 
piece(s) is not found, the patient will be observed closely for  clinical symptoms and plasma drug 
levels will be monitored for highe r than expected levels, and t reatment will be provided per 
standard medical practice. 
10.3.2 Subject Manipulation or Attempted Removal of RISPERIDONE IMPLAN T 
If a subject attempts to remove the Risperidone Implants once i mplanted, or in any way 
attempts to manipulate the Risperidone Implants while implanted, the subject will be 
withdrawn from the study and the implant will be removed. 
10.3.3 Documentation of Implant Events  
In the event implant breakage is observed, excessive increase o r decrease in plasma 
concentrations is reported, or a  subject manipulates or attempt s to remove the implant, the 
Investigator will evaluate the  finding, inform the Sponsor, and  report any clinically significant 
abnormality as an AE. 
10.4 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the appropriate  page of the CRF whether or 
not considered treatment-related. This includes any new signs, symptoms, injur y or illness, 
including increased severity of pr eviously existing signs, symp toms, injury, or illness. 
Conditions existing prior to dos ing will be recorded as part of  the subject’s medical history. The 
Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of A Es to the study medication; 
relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related 
(see section 10.4.1.2 for definitions). 
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time inf ormed consent is signed through 
the follow up visit. This includes any AEs that are ongoing at the completion/termination of the study, and any AEs that start aft er the last dose of study medi cation. A follow-up safety visit will 
be conducted approxima tely 14 days after discharge from the res earch center.  
All SAEs will be collected from the time the informed consent i s signed at screening through the 
follow up visit. Any SAEs consider ed related to study medicatio n should be reported to the 
Sponsor without regards to these timelines. 
Any SAE, including death resulti ng from any cause, which occurs  to any subject participating in 
this study or within 14 days follo wing cessation of the study t reatment or premature 
discontinuation from the study wh ether or not related to the in vestigational product, must be 
reported via email, facsimile o r telephone within 24 hours of f irst being advised of the SAE. 
12-Feb-2017 BB-P K-103 
Braeburn Pharmaceuticals
Confidential Page 47 
 Follow-up information collected f or any initial report of an SA E must be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee within 24 hours of recei pt by the Investigator. In the event discussion is necessary 
call the Medical Monitor. 
The Sponsor or designee will determ ine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days 
to the FDA. If so, the  Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s representative ) will report the event to the 
FDA. The Investigator will transm it a written report of the cir cumstances and outcome to the 
Sponsor as soon as he or she is m ade aware of the circumstances . The Investigator will report 
SAEs to the Institutional Review  Board (IRB) per IRB policy. 
10.4.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure  (signs), body function 
(symptoms), laboratory result (e.g., chemistry, ECG, etc.), or worsening of a pre-existing 
condition associated temporally w ith the use of the study medic ation whether or not considered 
related to the s tudy medication. 
A treatment-emergent AE is any condition that was not present p rior to treatment with study 
medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation but worsened 
during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but re solved and then reappeared while 
the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of  the AE when the treatment was 
initiated). 
 
All AEs, including either obser ved or volunteered problems, com plaints, signs, or symptoms 
must be recorded on the AE page o f the CRF, regardless of wheth er associated with the use of 
study medication. This would incl ude AEs resulting from concurr ent illness, reactions to 
concurrent medication use, or p rogression of disease states (ex cluding the disease under study).  
AEs should be recorded in standard medical terminology. 
The Investigator will evaluate each AE for duration, intensity,  and relationship to study 
medication, record the action ta ken, and any treatment given. R ecurrent symptoms of a chronic 
pre-existing condition are not considered AEs unless they occur  in a worse or unexpected pattern 
during study drug administration. 
 
10.4.1.1 Intensity of AEs 
The intensity (or severity) of A Es is characterized as mild, mo derate, or severe: 
Mild AEs are usually transient, requi ring no special treatment, and do not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities. 
Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the su bject and may 
interfere with daily activities,  but are usually ameliorated by  simple therapeutic measures. 
Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically re quire systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. When the intensity category of t he AE changes more frequently t han once daily, the maximum 
intensity for the event is record ed. If the intensity category changes after a number of days, then 
these sub-events or changes are recorded separately (i.e., havi ng distinct onset a nd stop dates).

 10.4.1.2 Relationship to Study Medication 
The degree of “relatedness” of th e AE to the study drug may be described using the following 
scale: 
Not related indicates that the AE is definitely not related  to the study drug. 
Unlikely related indicates that there are other , more likely causes and study dr ug is not 
suspected as a cause. Possibly related indicates that a direct cause a nd effect relationship between s tudy drug and the 
AE has not been demonstrated but  there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by 
the study drug. Probably related indicates that there probably is  a direct cause and effect rela tionship between 
the AE and the study drug. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to c onsider “Probable” and “Possible” causality assessments as positive 
causality. It is the Sponsor’s po licy to consider “Not” and “Un likely” causality assessments as 
negative causality. Assessments are to be recorded  on the CRF and must indicate cle arly the relationship being 
assessed. 
 
10.4.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as an AE that: 
• Results in death 
• Is immediately life-threatening (t here is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include a n AE that had it occurred in a  more serious form 
may have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a ho spitalization for elective or 
pre-planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not consti tute an SAE unless there 
is complication resulting in hospitalization prolongation). An AE that results in a visit to 
an Emergency Room that does not require an inpatient stay is no t always classified as an 
SAE. 
• Results in permanent or substantia l disability (permanent or su bstantial disruption 
of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a patient  using the study 
medication regardless of time to diagnosis) 
• Is considered an important medical event 
Life-threatening events are defi ned as events that place the subject, in the  view of the 
Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as i t occurred, i.e., it does not include 
a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might h ave caused death. 
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to conduct normal life 
functions.

 Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon  appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes. Examples of important medical events include allergic  bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitali zation, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
10.5 Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
All pregnancies of a subject or their partner will be reported to the Sponsor using the same 
reporting timelines as indi cated for SAEs in section 10.4.1.3. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as 
an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational prod uct under study may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication . However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (i.e., spontaneous miscarriage, elective abortion, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the sub ject was discontinued from 
the study. 
All reports of congenital abnorma lities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions withou t complications should not be 
handled as AEs unless the deci sion to abort was based on a diag nostic test that indicated there 
was a problem. All outcomes of p regnancy must be reported to th e Sponsor on the pregnancy 
outcomes report form. 
10.6 Precautions 
It is expected that the Risperidone Implants will have a safety  and efficacy profiles similar to 
risperidone oral tablets and the long-acting IM depot injectabl e formulation of risperidone. 
Risperidone is considered to be generally safe and well tolerat ed. The most common adverse 
reactions (≥10%) in clinical st udies with risperidone oral tabl ets include somnolence, increased 
appetite, fatigue, rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection,  vomiting, coughing, urinary 
incontinence, saliva increased, constipation, fever, Parkinsoni sm, dystonia, abdominal pain, 
anxiety, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, tremor, rash, akathisia,  and dyspepsia. Subjects will be 
monitored closely th roughout the study for potential adverse ev ents. 
There are no additional risks e xpected with implantation of the  Risperidone Implants beyond 
those normally encountered during similar minor surgical proced ures. A Sponsor-trained, 
licensed physician, must insert and remove the Risperidone Impl ants Aseptic t echnique should 
be followed at all times during the implant procedure to minimi ze the chance of infection. 
Sterile gloves are required at all times throughout the implantation and explantation procedure. 
The implantation/explantation procedure may result in bruising,  pain/soreness/tenderness, skin 
redness, and swelling at the site of implantation. Subjects wil l be monitored closely throughout 
the study for signs and symptoms of  implantation site reactions .   
The Investigator should treat a ll adverse experiences in accord ance with standard medical 
practice. Due to the investigational nature of the method of de livery of Risperidone, the AE 
profile cannot be defined with certainty; all subjects will be carefully evaluated. 
Additional information regarding AEs is provided in the Investi gator Brochure and the MOP.

 10.7 Observation  
All subjects will remain in the c linical research facility from  approximately Day -7 until 
discharged by the Investigator  at the end of the in-house confi nement period. The subjects will 
be kept under observation during their time in the clinical res earch facility in a manner 
consistent with the s tandard operating procedures of the clinic al research facility and as 
medically indicated. 
AEs should be treated in accordan ce with the standard medical p ractice. During th e course of the 
study, the overall safety and tolerability of the study medicat ions will be reviewed by the 
Investigator and Sponsor.

 11 STATISTICS  
This section describes the st atistical methods to be used. Thes e methods may be revised and 
updated due to reasons such as regu latory requirements or need for further clarific ations. The final 
analysis plan will be documented in a formal statistical analys is plan (SAP) that must be finalized 
before database lock. The SAP will include details on how varia bles will be derived, how missing 
data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to 
be used for safety and efficacy analyses. The final clinical st udy report will discuss deviations 
from the SAP, if any.  For bridging the efficacy of the  Risperidone Implant to oral ri speridone, the mean concentrations 
after the insertion of the Impla nts is expected to approximate the mean C
avg of oral 4 mg 
risperidone and not to exceed oral C max. In addition, the average concentr ations after the implant 
is expected to be higher than the oral C trough.  The target concentration is to provide consistent 
levels between the relevant oral C trough and C max, where efficacy and safet y could be preserved.  
 
 
11.1 Sample Size Consideration  
Approximately 40 will provide over 90% power to establish that implant is non-inferior to the 
oral dose of risperidone. .   In the sample size calculation it was assumed that the true ratio was at least 1.1 and the coefficient of variance (CV) was less than 0.45.  These assumptions were based on internal data.  Therefore, approximately 50 subjects w ill be enrolled to ensure 
approximately 40 subjects completing the study assuming that th e drop rate is less than 20%. 
11.2 Analysis Population  
The safety population will consis t of all subjects who have rec eived at least one dose of 
study treatment. 
The PK population will consist of  subjects who receive 4-mg ora l risperidone daily and the 
Risperidone Implants.  
The primary PK analyses will be based on the subjects who provi de Month 6 PK results.   
11.3 Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summa rized. The overall summary wil l be comprised of the number 
and percentage of subjects fo r each analysis population, as wel l as the number and percentage of 
subjects who completed and disc ontinued early with reasons for discontinuation. 
11.4 Demographics and Base line Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline charact eristics will be summarized usi ng appropriate descriptive 
statistics. 
11.5 Concomitant Medications  
Medications administered prior to and concomitantly with study treatment will be tabulated and 
listed.

11.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
11.6.1 Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Pharmacokinetic variables of AUC 0-24 (oral dose only) , AUC 3-180 days, (Risperidone Implant 
only), AUC 3-t, (Risperidone Implant only), C max, Ctrough and T max (oral dose only), for 
risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone will be derived. The active moiet y will be calculated as the sum 
of the risperidone a nd 9-OH-risperidone con centrations at each sampling time point.  In 
order to minimize the contribution that the Day 1 oral dose of risperidone will have on the 
AUC during implantation, the AUC calculation for the implantation period will initiate 3 days 
after implantation (Day 3).  The  concentrations of risperidone,  9-OH risperidone and active 
moiety on Days 1 to 3 will be summa rized to characterize the ph armacokinetics of risperidone 
and 9-OH-risperidone when changing the oral tablet to implant.  The C avg values for 
risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and active moiety from the Risper idone Implants will be 
calculated as the plasma AUC 3-t divided by t-3 (in days). The C avg for the oral tablet will be 
calculated as the plasma AUC 0-24 on Day -1 divided by 24 hours.  Actual sample times (relative 
to the corresponding implantati on time) rounded to two decimal digits and negative pre-dose 
times set to zero, will be used i n the computation of the pharm acokinetic variables, rather than 
scheduled times. Refer to section 11.7 for the handling of missing values. 
The definition and method of determination for each pharmacokin etic variable are summarized 
in Table 9 .

dose; calculated using the linear trapezoid rule.  
AUC 3-180day  Area under the concentration versus time curve from time Day 3 to 180 days after 
Risperidone Implant for the subs equent subjects; calculated usi ng the linear trapezoid 
rule 
AUC 3-t Area under the concentration versus time curve from time Day 3 to t days after 
t h e  Risperidone Implant for subj ects who do not complete the im plantation 
period; calculated using th e linear trapezoid rule.  
Cavg Average steady-state concentration  
Oral tablet: measured as AUC 0-24 hr on Day -1 divided by 24  
Risperidone Implant: measured as AUC 3-t divided by t-3; t=da ys Risperidone Implant
remained in situ.  
Cmax Observed maximum plasma concentration; the highest concentratio n observed after 
the oral dose and after implan tation with Risperidone Implant.  
Ctrough The concentration at 24 hours following an oral dose of risperi done.  
Tmax The time that C max was observed.  
 
11.6.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data 
All PK data (concentration and pharmacokinetic variables) will be summarized usi ng appropriate 
descriptive statistics. The ratios of Risperidone Implant C avg  over oral C max, over oral C avg  and over oral 
Ctrough will be analyzed based on log-tr ansformed scales using an ANOV A model with treatment effects.  
The two sided 95% confidence inte rvals will be presented.  Infe riority is defined as the lower bound of 
95% confidence interval o f the ratio is <0.8. 
 
The active moiety will be considered the primary interest.  To control for Type I error rate, active moiety will be analyzed first, followed by the analysis for risperidon e. 
The concentrations of risperi done, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety on Days 1 to 3 will be 
summarized to characterize the pharmacokinetics of risperidone when changing the oral tablet 
to implant. 
The study is designed to evaluat e the PK profiles of the 900 mg implant arm.  PK profile for 600 
mg arm is exploratory. 
11.7 Handling of Missing Values  
Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) w ill be set to half of BLQ value 
in the computation of mean concentration values; however, BLQ c oncentrations between 2 
non-BLQ concentrations will be set to missing. For the computat ion of PK variables, the BLQ

Confidential Page 54 
 concentrations prior to the fir st measurable concentration will  be set to half of the BLQ value; 
other BLQ concentrations will be set to missing. 
No imputation will be performed for demographic and safety data . 
11.8 Safety Analysis 
The safety analysis will be based on all subjects who received any study medication. The 
frequency of AEs will be tabulat ed using the Me dical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) by system organ class (S OC) and preferred term (PT), a nd treatment for each cohort. 
The maximum intensity  and frequency of AEs will be summarized b y treatment and cohort. 
Vital sign, clinical laboratory, EPS assessments and ECG measur ements will be s ummarized by 
treatment and study day (visit) using descriptive statistics or frequency distribution, as 
appropriate. 
11.9 Protocol Deviations  
A list of subjects with protocol deviations will be compiled. P rior to database lock, an evaluation 
of subjects with significant protocol deviations will be perfor med to assess the appropriateness of 
their inclusion into the PK analysis.

 12 DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
12.1 Study Monitoring 
The monitoring of the study will  be performed in accordance wit h the principles of Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) as descr ibed in the International Confe rence on Harmonization (ICH) E6 
titled “Good Clinical Practice.” Monitoring including source da ta verification s hould be routinely 
performed prior to the transfe r of data to Data Management. 
It is a prerequisite of this st udy that the study monitor has d irect access to source data for data 
verification. This will be done by comparing data from the CRFs  with those in the subject’s 
medical notes (permission fro m the subject will be sought as part of the consent process). Such 
verification is an essential el ement of quality control, as it allows the rectification of transcription 
errors and omissions. 
The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the study c oordinator and Investigator will be 
available, the source documentation will be a vailable, and a su itable environment will be 
provided for review of study related documents. 
12.2 Audits and Inspections 
Authorized representatives from the Sponsor, a regulatory autho rity or an IRB/independent 
ethics committee (IEC) may reque st access to all study records, including direct access to source 
data/documents, for inspecti on, audit and/or copying, in keeping with applicable regulations. The 
Investigator will permit study related monitoring, audits, IRB/ IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections, providing direct acce ss to source data/ documents.  The Investigator should 
immediately notify the Sponsor o f an upcoming regulatory authority inspection.

 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
15.1 Source Data Capture 
Source worksheets will be used to r ecord data at the clinical r esearch facility. Data on the source 
worksheets will be transferred t o the eCRF. All information req uested on the source worksheet 
should be completed legibly. If t he data are not available, the  source worksheet and CRF should 
be documented as such. 
15.2 Case Report Forms  
Data collected will be entered at the clinical research facilit y into electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs). The eCRFs will be availa ble through the electronic data capturing (EDC) system 
provided by the Sponsor. As the data are entered, they will be subjected to range checks and 
other edits to ensure accuracy. Electronic CRFs are to be compl eted on an ongoing basis during 
the study. The medical chart and the source documents are the s ource of verification of data. 
Electronic CRFs should be completed according to the instructio ns provided by the Sponsor. The 
Principal Investigator is res ponsible for maintaining accurate,  complete and up-to-date records 
for each subject and for authenticating the data recorded in th e eCRF. 
15.3 Data Recording and Handling 
Data collection and handling w ill involve the use of the Sponso r’s EDC system to which only 
authorized personnel will have access. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the 
system by the Sponsor monitor, p rogrammatic edit checks will be used to review the data for 
completeness, logic, and adheren ce to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these 
edit checks, queries may be issu ed electronically to the clinic al study site and closed 
electronically by the monitor, Sponsor’s data management staff or authorized study site staff. 
The identifying information (assigned username, date, and time)  for both the originator of the 
data change (if applicable), as well as the Investigator’s appr oval of all changes performed on the 
subjects’ data, will be recorded in various features of the EDC  system. 
All data collected in the contex t of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Al so, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way as to guarantee subject confidentiality  in accordance with the legal 
stipulations applying to confidentiality of subject data. Study  records (i.e., copies of eCRF, 
regulatory documents) will be ret ained at the study site, along with adequate source 
documentation in accordance with  GCP and ICH guidelines. All st udy records will be available 
for inspection by the Sponsor, th eir authorized representatives , or regulatory agencies. At the 
completion of the study, the Sponsor or its representatives wil l supply the site with a copy of all 
data captured in the EDC system. 
 
15.4 Inspection of Records  
Periodically the Sponsor or Sponsor  representative will review study documents to verify 
compliance with the protocol a nd accuracy of the data. All corr ections or change s made to study 
data (e.g., source worksheet, CRF) must be appropriately docume nted (e.g., initialed and dated, 
audit trail) as per GCP/ICH guidelines.

 16 PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS  
Neither the Investigator nor the Sponsor will modify this proto col without obtaining the 
concurrence of the other. All protocol amendments must be signe d and dated by the Investigator, 
and submitted and approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementati on of the amendment, unless it 
is administrative in nature or t o protect the immediate well-being of study subjects. The Sponsor 
will submit protocol modificati ons to the appropr iate regulator y authority as called for under 
applicable regulations. 
If a protocol amendment requires a change to the informed conse nt form, then the Sponsor and 
the IRB/IEC must be notified. Appr oval of the revised informed consent form by the Sponsor 
and IRB/IEC is required before the revised form may be used. Al l ongoing subjects should be 
advised of any changes and they should be documen ted appropriat ely. 
In situations requiring a departure from the protocol, the Investigator or other physician in 
attendance will contact the medi cal monitor by fax or telephone . If possible, this contact will be 
made before implementing any de parture from protocol. In all ca ses, contact with the medical 
monitor must be made as soon as  possible in order to discuss the situation and agree on an 
appropriate course of action. The CRF and source document will reflect any departure from the 
protocol procedures and the circumstances requiring it. All dep artures will be a deviation; no 
waivers will be granted.

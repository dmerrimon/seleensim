Statistical MethodsThe primary efficacy parameter will be the change from 
baseline in MADRS total score at end of study . The primary 
analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for
repeated measures (MMRM) with terms for treatment ,pooled
study center ,visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as the 
fixed effects , and baseline MADRS total score, and baseline 
MADRS total score -by-visit as covariates . The key secondary 
efficacy parameter, change from baseline in MADRS total score 
1 day after randomized treatment will be analyzed using the 
same MMRM model as was used for the primary efficacy 
parameter . An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to 
model the covariance of within -patient scores.  Baseline will be 
defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of 
double-blindtreatment. To control the overall type I error rate 
for both the primary and key secondary endpoint, a sequential 
testing procedure will be implemented.
All safety parameters will be analyzed using descriptive 
statistics. Safety analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population, defined as all randomized patients who receiveat 
least 1 dose of randomized treatment . Efficacy analyses will be 
based on the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population, 
defined as all patients who arerandomized and receive at least 
1 dose of treatment and haveat least 1 postrandomization 
assessment of the MADRS total score.

RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20187.0 INTRODUCTION
Disease Burden of M ajor Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder ( MDD)is a highly disabling, serious condition which is 
associated with significant morbidity  and mortality . MDDmanifests as amajor 
depressive episode (which may  be singular or recurrent) in which the affected individual 
experiences 1) depressed mood ,or 2) loss of interest or pleasure (as well as other 
symptoms) for most of the day , nearly every day,for at least 2 weeks. MDD affects 
approximately  14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 % of the US population 
18years of age and older, in a given year (Kessler et al, 2005 ).Worldwide, about 15% of 
the adult population is at lifetime risk of developing MDD ( Kessler et al, 1994 ).
Depression may  cause serious, long -lasting symptoms and often disrupts a person’s 
ability to perform routine tasks. I n 2000, unipolar depressive disorders were by  far the 
leading cause (11.9%) of worldwide years of life lived with disability  (World Health 
Organization, 2001 ), and the total economic burden of treating depression in the 
UnitedStates was $83.1 billion, with workplace costs, including missed day s and lack of 
productivity  due to illness, accounting for most of the total economic burden (62%). 
Other economic burdens in 2000 included $26.1 billion (31%) for treatment costs and 
$5.4 billion (7%) for suicide -related costs ( Greenberg et al, 2003 ). 
MDD is a leading cause of disability  in the United States ( Murray et al, 2013 ). Moreover, 
MDD is known to be a significant risk factor for suicide and ischemic heart disease, as it 
accounted for 16 million of the disability  adjusted life y ears (DALYs) associated with 
suicide and 4 mi llion of the DALYs associated with ischemic heart disease. Research has 
shown that untreated depression has both a functional (social and work role) as well as a 
neuroanatomical (hippocampal shrinkage) effect on the patient (Videbech and Ravnkilde , 
2004). Given the disease burden and link to suicidality  as well as increased mortality  with 
other comorbid conditions, MDD is a serious and life -threatening condition which is a 
leading cause of disability in the world.
Selective S erotonin Reuptake I nhibitors and Selective Serotonin and N orepinephrine 
Reuptake Inhibitors in Major Depressive Disorder
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s) and selective serotonin and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI s)currently represent the first line of treatment 
of depression in the United States. Unfortunatel y, a large number of patients do not 
experience therapeutic benefit from these first- line agents ( Rosenzweig -Lipson et al, 
2007). Lack of sufficient response to adequate treatment remains a critical problem in the 
management of patients with MDD. Up to two thirds of patients treated with first -line 
antidepressant monotherapy  do not reach full remission, and as many  as a third beco me 
treatment resistant ( Fava and Davidson, 1996; Trivedi et al, 2006 ). Not achieving 
remission has been shown to be predictive of poorer ps ychosocial functioning, higher 
rates of relapse ,and higher rates of rehospitalization ( McIntyre and O’Donovan, 2004 ). 
16
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018The results of the STAR*D study  suggest that with successive failures of treatment, 
patients are less and less likely  to respond to subsequent treatment, and those who do 
respond are more likely to relapse ( Rush et al, 2006 ). Present strategies available to treat 
patients who do not respond to first- line antidepressant monotherap y include switching of 
antidepressant (either within or between classes); combi nation therap y in which multiple 
antidepressants are used simultaneously ; augmentation of ongoing antidepressant 
monotherap y with adjunctive use of drugs such as mood stabilizers or atypical 
antipsychotics (Boland and Kelle r, 2006);and nonpharmacologic treatments including 
psychotherap y and phototherap y, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic 
stimulation, and electroconvulsive therap y(ECT).Clearly, there remains a critically  
important unmet medical need for this patient population.
Existing antidepressants have a number of limitations, leading to considerable unmet 
medical need in the effective treatment of MDD ,with up to 50% of patients with MDD
having an inadequate response or failing current antidepressant the rapy (ADT). Currentl y 
available first -line antidepressants (SSRI s, SNRIs) ty pically take 3 to 4 weeks or more of 
continuous daily  dosing to relieve s ymptoms of MDD and are associated with side effects 
related to their pharmacological mechanisms of action ( sexual dy sfunction, weight gain, 
jitteriness, sleep disturbances), which are further associated with poor patient compliance 
(Masand 2003, Ashton et al, 2005 ).  Patients often experience undesirable side effects 
before they experience an improvement in depressive sy mptoms, which could lead to 
premature discontinuation of therap y. Taken together, these factors define significant 
areas for improvement of ADT . 
Patients vary  greatly in their response to antidepressants and it i s not possible to reliably  
predict whether an individual patient will respond to a given antidepressant. This leads to 
clinicians often using a trial- and-error approach to identify  an effective antidepressant. 
Due to the gradual development ofthe full the rapeutic effect of currently  available 
antidepressants, each antidepressant needs to be administered for 4 weeks or longer in 
order to determine the individual therapeutic benefit , making the process of finding an 
effective antidepressant a length y process for patients who are often severely  depressed 
and at a high risk for suicide. Clearl y a drug that could induce a rapid antidepressant 
effect would represent a major advancement for these patients.
Atypical Antipsychotics as A djunctive Therapy in Major Depressive Disorder
The available treatments for adjunctive therap y in MDD also have substantial safet y and 
efficacy limitations. The drugs currently  approved for use as adjunctive therapy  to 
antidepressants for the treatment of MDD —namely, the atypical antipsychotics Abilify®
(aripiprazole), Seroquel XR®(quetiapine fumarate), and Rexulti®(brexpiprazole)—are 
associated with significant adverse reactions, as well as a number of serious warnings and 
precautions. Originall y developed for the treatment of psychotic disorders, these drugs 
share a number of clinically  relevant adverse effects based on their mechanisms of action. 
17
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018As all current antipsy chotic agents modulate central dopaminergic s ystems, they  all carry 
a risk of extrap yramidal symptoms such as mu scular rigidity , acute dy stonia, as well as 
akathisia, which is a particularly relevant adverse event (AE) that complicates clinical 
management in a significant number of treated individuals, as high as 45% 
(Sachdev, 1995).In addition, these compounds are associated with a risk of neuroleptic 
malignant s yndrome andtardive dyskinesia. Depending on their individual 
pharmacological profile, antipsy chotics also carry  a risk for metabolic changes including 
hyperglycemia/diabete s mellitus, dy slipidemia and body  weight gain; blood dy skrasias 
such as leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocy tosis; orthostatic hy potension; cognitive 
and motor impairment; cataracts; and insomnia ( Abilify, 2014; Seroquel , 2013; 
Rexulti,2015). The range of clinicall y relevant side effects with antips ychotics has to be 
balanced carefull y against the potential for therapeutic benefits in patients with major 
depression. In this context it is important to highlight that for t he approved aty pical 
antipsychotics the full therapeutic benefit required several weeks of daily  adjunctive 
dosingto become apparent , and in many subjects adverse effects occurred substantially  
earlier than the mood -alleviating effects of these drugs . 
Furthermore, the drugs currentl y approved for adjunctive treatment of MDD also have 
limited efficacy . The pivotal studies for Abilify , the atypical antips ychotic most 
commonly  used for adjunctive treatment of MDD, showed a delay ed onset of effect 
(1-2 weeks), a modest magnitude of effect (effect sizes were 0.35- 0.39 after 6 weeks of 
repeat dosing) and modest rates of response and remission after 6 weeks of repeat dosing 
(response rates were 32 -34% and remission rates were 25 -26%) (Berman et al, 2007; 
Marcus et al, 2008 ). 
Clearly, there is a substantial need for the development of novel treatments with a better 
safety/tolerability  profile and a faster onse t of full therapeutic benefit. Rapastinel has 
initially shown substantially  improved safet y/tolerability  as well as promising efficacy, in 
both speed of onset and overall magnitude, for adjunctive therap y in MDD. 
Rapastinel as a Novel Approach to M ajor Depressive Disorder T reatment
The mechanism of action of rapastinel is entirel y different from that of at ypical 
antipsychotics.Rapastinel is a n N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator
with a novel and complex pharmacological mechanism of action, acting as a nonselective 
agent at NR2 subunits a nd display ing properties as a functional partial agonist in a 
number of pharmacological assays. 
Rapastinel has demonstrated antidepressant properties in relevant animal models, 
displays cognitive enhanc ing properties in treated animals, and facilitates hippocampal 
long-term potentiation of sy naptic transmission in preclinical models. In contrast to 
ketamine, no signal of abuse liability  was detected in informative animal models. 
18
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Rapastinel is available as an intravenous (IV)formulation only. In 2Phase 2 clinical 
studiesin patients with MDD, single IV doses of rapastinel 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg have 
been shown to produce marked antidepressant effects within 1 day  that lasted for
approximately 1 week or longer in responding patients. These antidepressant effects are 
very similar to ketamine’s effects when administered at a low dose as an infusion. In a 
systematic review and meta -analysis of ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists in the 
treatment of major depression, a single infusion of ketamine produced a rapid, y et 
transient antidepressant effect, accompanied b y brief ps ychotomimetic and dissociative 
effects(Newport et al , 2015). 
The available Phase 1 and 2 data demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability  profile 
of rapastinel . In contrast to ketamine, rapastinel has not shown a high likelihood to induce 
psychotomimetic or dissociative effects in humans so far. 
The purpose of this stud y is toprospectively  confirm that rapastinel, when administered 
as an adjunctive treatment at doses of 225and 450 mg as a short IV infusion in patients 
with MDD ,is significantly  superior to placebo in rapidlyreducing depressive sy mptoms. 
Furthermore, the safety and tolerability of rapastinel will be investigat ed. The study  is 
intended to support an application for regulatory  approval of rapastinel as adjunctive 
treatment for MDD.

9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION
This study  isa multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
3-weekstudy in patients with MDD who have a partial response to ADT . The study  will 
include a total of 12 visits and will be approximately  4to 6weeks in duration
(Figure9.1-1): 
Up to 2-week screening period 
3-week double -blind treatment period 
1-week safety follow-upperiod (for patients who do not enter the RAP -MD-04 
maintenance stud y)
9.1.1 Screening Period
After providing written consent, patients will enter a screening period of up to 14 day s.
The screening /washout period will be up to 2 weeksprior to Visit 2. Screening 
procedures may  be conducted on up to 2 separate dates where necessary  to accommodate 
patient and study  center schedule; however, every  effort should be made to conduct all 
procedures as earl y as possible in the screening period and the rater -administered 
MADRS and computer -administered MADRS must be collected on the same date.   
Patients will not receive any  investigational product (IP)during the screening period but 
must continue their background ADT at the same dose . Patients meeting the eligibility  
criteria at the end of Visit 2 (Base line) will be assigned a t reatment by  the interactive web 
response s ystem (IWRS)and enter the double -blind treatment period. 
9.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period
Approximately  630patients are planned for enrollment in the double-blindtreatment 
period(350 placebo patients,350 rapastinel 225mg patients,and 350 rapastinel 450 mg 
patients). Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 
rapastinel 225 mg IV weekly , rapastinel 450 mg IV weekl y, or placebo IV administration 
(all adjunctive to ongoing ADT).
22
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018During the double -blind treatment period, patients have 3 stud y visits per week .The 
visits will occur in the following pattern: treatment day, 1 day  following the treatment 
day, 4days following the treatment day, and 7 days fol lowing the treatment day  (which is 
the next treatment day ). If necessary , study visits may  be conducted up to 2 day s before 
or after the scheduled visits with the exception of visits which are 24 hours apart
(eg,Visits2 and 3 must be conducted 1 day  apart; similarly,Visits 5 and 6 as well as 
Visits 8 and 9 must be conducted 1 day  apart). All patients who receive IP must complete 
Visit 11. Upon completion of the double -blind treatment p eriod,patients are eligible to 
enterthe RAP-MD-04 maintenance study .  Patients who do not enter RAP -MD-04 will 
enter a 1-week safety  follow-up period.
9.1.3 Safety Follow -upPeriod
Patients who do not enter the RAP -MD-04 maintenance study  upon completing the 
double-blind treatment period and patients who prematurel y discontinue from the study  
before completing 3 weeks of double- blind treatment shouldenter the 1- week safety 
follow-upperiod. 
Additional follow -up visits may  be scheduled within 30 days, if necessary  for safety 
reasons.
A schematic of the study  design is presented in Figure 9.1-1. The Schedule of 
Evaluations is pr esented in Section 2.0. Detailed descriptions of each stud y visit can be 
found in Section 9.5.6.

Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE 
OF CONTROL GROUPS
This multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group stud y with a 3-week 
double-blind treatment period, was designed based on prior studies that established 
rapastinel efficacy and safety  in adult patients with MDD .In this study , investigators will
enrollpatients 18 through 65years of age who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). The MDD diagnosis will beconfirmed using 
the Modified Structured Clinical Interview fo r Diagnostic Statistic Manual of Mental 
Health Disorders, Fifth Edition (SCID) .The symptoms and severity  of MDD will be 
assessed using the MADRS (Section 9.5.1.2.1). 

24
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Study centers will have experience with the study  population and will be encouraged to 
apply available guidelines to minimize patient risk or distress. 
Dose selection information is presented in Section 9.4.6. The planned dosing regimen is 
based on experience from previous rapastinel studies. 
A placebo treatment groupis included in the study to comply  with worldwide regulatory  
preferences ( Laughren, 2001; Gispen -de Wied et al , 2012
), since placebo -controlled 
superiority  trials have been shown to be conducive to higher quality  studies and to 
provide more reliable outcomes ( Feifel, 2008; Laugh ren, 2001; Gispen- de Wied et al , 
2012
). Additionally , from a scientific point of view, randomized double- blind 
comparisons versus placebo are needed to permit adequate evaluation of efficacy . 
Comparison to a placebo treatment is also of value for distinguishing d isease 
manifestations from adverse reactions tothe IP(EMA guidance , 2013
). The use of 
placeboin place of the standard therapy  should not cause irreversible health problems or 
extreme suffering (depression is recognized by the FDA as a condition in which there is 
substantial improvement and variability  in placebo groups) (FDAGuidance for Industry : 
E10,May 2001). 
In StudyRAP-MD-02, 
safety and efficacy  assessments are included during every  visit to 
determine adequacy  of response, safet y, and tolerability . In the event of insufficient 
therapeutic response or worsening of the patient’s initial condition, the IP should be 
discontinued and an alternative tre
atment will then be allowed (Section 9.4.13). An 
independent Data and Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate safety  data during 
the study (Section 9.8).

9.3.3 Removal of Patient s from Therapy or Assessment
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the I CF ceases 
participation in the study , regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study 
visits and procedures . Patients can be prematurel y discontinued from the study  after 
careful consideration for one of the 
following reasons:
Screen failure (f ailure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria or pregnancy )
Pregnancy
Withdrawal of consent 
AE
oAny patient may  be withdrawn due to AE at the discretion of the 
Investigator
oAny patient who meets any  of the following crite ria at any point during 
the study must be withdrawn from participation, due to AEs related to 
suicide:
a)A suicide attempt
In the event that a patient is withdrawn for a suicide
-related AE, the patient should be 
referred for additional treatment or hospitalization, as clinically indicated, in addition 
to withdrawing the patient from the study .
Lack of efficacy
Protocol violation
Noncompliance with IP
Noncompliance with ADT

30
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Lost to follow -up
Studyterminated by  Sponsor
Study center terminated by  Sponsor
Other 
All randomized patients who prematurely  discontinue from the study , regardless of cause, 
should be seen for a final assessment at an Earl y Termination (ET) Visit. A final 
assessment will be defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled for all patients at 
Visit11. All patient sdiscontinuing the study prematurel y should enter the 1-week safety 
follow
-upperiod.
Patients who discontinue from the study  and donot return to the study centerfor final 
assessments must be requested in writing to return to the study center for a final 
assessment. A cop y of the letter, together with the source docume ntation, will be kept in 
the Investigator’s files. The reason for premature discontinuation from the study  will be 
recorded on the Study  Termination Page of the eCRF .Study center staff will be contacted 
by the Sponsor after each premature discontinuation to ensure proper characterization of 
the reason for discontinuation is capture d.
9.3.4 PatientReplacement Procedures
Patients in this study  
who prematurel y discontinue treatment will not be replaced.
9.4 TREATMENTS
Patients meeting the eligibility  criteria at the end of Visit 2 (Baseline) will be randomized 
in double-blind fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, rapastinel 225mg, or 
rapastinel 450 mg . 
9.4.1 Background Antidepressant Therapy
Patients must enter the study  while having no more than partial response (<50% 
improvement) to ongoing treatment with a protocol-allowed ADT   
 
 
 
 
 
 
. 

31
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Upon entry  into the study at Screening ( Visit 1),the dosag e of the ADT must be held 
constant at a dose allowed in the respective label through Visit 11/ET. I f a patient 
experiences an AE, intercurrent illness, or s ymptoms of intolerance, he or she will be 
permitted to stop taking the ADT for a maximum of 3 consec utivedays at the discretion 
of the Investigator. No other alterations in the ADT dose regimen are allowed. If an ADT 
dose change is required during the stud y, the patient should be discontinued from the 
study.
Background ADT medication compliance will also be closel y monitored. Patients should 
be questioned to determine if there were any missed doses or changes in dose at Visits 2, 
5, 8, and 11. Every effort should be made to have patients bring their background ADT to
Visits 5, 8, and 11 for verification of patient- reported compliance by  pill count (to the 
extentpossible).
9.4.2 Treatments Administered
The IPwill only be administered to eligible patient s by a medically  qualified person as 
per the local state regulations. The range of person s who can administer an IV can be a 
physician, a phy sician assistant, nurse, or nurse practitioner, etc, depending on the local 
and/or state law.  
IP should be administered after all efficacy  and safety  assessments with the exception of 
the post-dose assessments described below. IP will be administered in a “slow bolus” 
injection to each stud y patient in an upper extremity vein within approximately 1 to 2 
minutes. 
During IP administration and until completion of postadministration assessments a 
licensed ph ysician must be immediately  available and in close proximity  to the patient(s) 
to attend to medical emergencies.  The study center must have the capabilities, in 
accordance with the applicable country, local, and/or state regulations and standard of 
care, to resuscitate a patient in the event of a medical emergency.   
The patient should not be discharged from the study center until the following are 
completed:
Postadministration vital sign measures (approximately  15 minutes after 
administration)
Patient is clinically  assessed and determined to not be at increased risk of 
suicidality in the opinion of the Investigator (or medically  qualified 
subinvestigator)
32
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Patient is assessed for mental status and is determined to be free of perceptual 
disturbances or other conditions that would deem them not read y for discharge 
from the study  center, in the opinion of the Investigator (or medically  qualified 
subinvestigator )
A physician licensed in the state (Investigator or subinvestigator) determines that 
they are medicall y able to leave the stud y center and provides written sign -off not 
less than 15 minutes following administration (see IV Administration and 
Discharge Not es document in Program Reference Manual)

kit mentioned above. The prefilled s yringe will not have a tear off and will remain on the 
prefilled s yringe.

33
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.4.4 Handling of Investigational Product s
The IPmust be stored in a secure area and administered onl y to patients entered into the 
clinical study , at no cost to the patient , in accordance with the conditions specified in this 
protocol.
 
 
 Study centersmust report any  temperature excursions as 
described in the Stud y Reference Manual or contact the Sponsor or its designee for 
further instructions.
At the end of the stud y, all IPmust be accounted for. In addition, a t the end of the study , 
all unused IPshould be returned to the Sponsor or the local distributor at the address 
provided in the Study  Reference Manual.
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
After a patient sign sthe ICF at Screening (Visit 1), study personnel will register the 
patient in the I WRS, and the sy stem will assign the patient a sequential PID.  
 
 
 
 
 
The IPwill be labeled with me dication kit numbers. The IWRS will provide the study 
centerwith the specific medication kit number(s) f or each randomized patientat the time 
of randomization.  Study  centerswill dispense IP according to the IWRS instructions. 
Study centerswill also log onto the IWRS at subsequent visits to obtain a study  
medication kit number for dispensing IP. Study centers will receive the IWRS 
confirmation notifications for each transaction.  All notifications are to be maintained 
with the study  source documents.
9.4.6 Selection of Dos agesin the Study
Doses of rapastinel were selected based on 2 Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with 
MDD,in whichsingle IV doses of rapastinel 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg wereshown to 
produce marked antidepressant effects within 1 day  that lasted approx imately1 week or 
longer in responding patients.

34
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018A 450-mg unit dose is expected to be app ropriate for most patients as this represents a 
dose of 4.5 mg/kg in a 100 kg patient and a 9 mg/kg dose in a 50 kg patient. The 225-mg 
unit dose has been included in this study  for purposes of characterizing the minimum 
effective dose.
9.4.7 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
The IPwill be administered IV using the assigned single- use prefilled sy ringes at Visits 
2, 5,and 8.
9.4.7.1 Screening Period
At Screening (Visit 1) a fter written consent is obtained , patients enter a screening period 
of up to 14 days. No IP is administered during the screening period, however, patients 
must continue their background ADT at a stable dose.
9.4.7.2 Double-blind Treatment Period
Patients who meet all eligibility  criteria at Screening (Vi sit 1) and who continue to meet 
all the eligibility criteria for participation in the study  at the Baseline Visit (Visit2)will 
be assigned a nIP kit number via IWRS at Baseline (Visit 2). Patients will receive the 
first dose of IPthatday. IP kit number s will also be assigned b y IWRS at subsequent 
treatment visits (ie, Visits 5 and 8).
Patients will receive either rapastinel 450 mg, rapastinel 225 mg, or placebo from a 
prefilled single -dose syringe at Visits 2, 5, and 8.
9.4.7.3 Safety Follow -up Period
Patients who complete 3 weeks of randomized treatment are eligible to enter the 
RAP-MD-04 maintenance study .  If they do not enter RAP -MD-04, theyshould enter the 
safety follow-up period. P atients who discontinue the study  prematurel y should enter the 
safety follow-upperiod. No IP is administered during the safet y follow-up period and 
patients’ background ADT may  be modified as deemed appropriate by  the Investigator.
9.4.8 Blinding
A list of patient randomization codes will be generated b y Statistical Programming a nd 
implemented by  the IWRS vendor (an electronic version will be stored on a secure 
server). This list will identify  each patient b y randomization number and include the 
patient’s corresponding treatment assignment.
35
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018All study treatments will be provided in identical sy ringes and cartons to maintain 
masking of the stud y.
9.4.9 Unblinding
Any unblinding at the study  centerlevel should be done only  in an emergency  that 
requires for the IPto be identified for the medical management of the patient . The 
Investigator mustnotify the Study Physician immediately  (refer toAppendix II) and a 
full written explanation 
must be provided if the blind is broken. Before IPis unblinded, 
every attempt should be made to discuss the case with the Study  Physician. Breaking the 
code at the stud y center will immediately  disqualify  the 
patientfrom further participation 
in the study .
Treatment codes may  be broken b y Global Drug Sa fety for regulatory reporting purposes. 
In such cases, the stud y staff will be kept blinded and the patientwill not need to be 
disqualified from the study .
For IWRSUnblinding
In an emergency , the Investigator can obtain the treatment assignment of any patientat 
his or her study  centerthrough the IWRS. The Investigator will access the IWRSto break 
the blind and record the unblinding in the eCRF.
9.4.10 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
A list of example medications that are allowed and not allowed 
as concomitant 
medications for either episodic or chronic use is provided in Appendix III . Medication 
history (psychotropic medication history  during the previous 5 y ears and all other 
medications during the past 12 months) will be record ed at Screening (Visit 1) in the 
eCRF. Thereafter, an y changes in concomitant medications or any  new medications 
added will be recorded in the eCRF.

9.4.11 Other Restrictions
9.4.11.1 Alcohol 
It is recommended that patients abstain from alcohol consumption during the study .
9.4.11.2 Contraception
For purposes of this study, females will be considered of childbearing potential unless 
they are naturall y postmenopausal or permanentl y sterilized (ie, hy sterectom y). Natural 
menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, determined 
retrospectivel y after a woman has experienced 12 months of amenorrhea without any  
other obvious pathological or phy siological cause.  
For women of childbearing po tentialand male partners of childbearing potential who 
may participate in the study , the following methods of contraception, if properly  used, are 
generally considered reliable: hormonal contraceptives (ie, oral, patch, injection, 
implant), male condom wi th intravaginal spermicide, diaphragm or cervical cap with 
spermicide, vaginal contraceptive ring, intrauterine device, surgical sterilization (bilateral 
tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectom y), vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence.
The Investigator and each patient will determine the appropriate method of contraception 
for the patient during the participation in the study .
See Section 9.5.2.3for pregnancy  reporting procedures.

38
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.4.12 Monitoring Treatment Compliance
IP compliance during any period will be closel y monitored by  capturing the date and time 
of each injection of IP. If a scheduled injection does not occur, the Sponsor must be 
notified and the reason captured in the eCRF.
Background ADT compliance will also be closel y monitored. Patients should be 
questioned to determine if there were an y missed doses or changes in dose at Visits 2, 5, 
8, and 11. Every effort should be made to have patients bring their background ADT to
Visits 5, 8, and 11 for verification of patient- reported compliance by  pill count (to the 
extentpossible). Missed doses or other changes in the dose of ADT and the reason should 
be captured in the eCRF.
9.4.13 Treatment After Disco ntinuation
Patients whose MDD s ymptoms worsen or are determined by the Investigator not to be 
adequatel y controlled prior to completing the double -blind treatment period will be 
allowed to discontinue the studyand start appropriate treatment at the Invest igator’s 
discretion. This new treatment will not be provided by  the Sponsor . Patients who initiate 
a new treatment must be discontinued from the study .
9.5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES
9.5.1 Diagnostic and Efficacy Assessment s
9.5.1.1 Diagnostic Assessments
The SCIDwill be administered during the screening interviews b y a psychiatrist, doctoral 
level clinical ps ychologist ,or other clinician who has extensive professional training and 
experience in the diagnosis of mental illness and who meets the training requirements an d 
qualifications standards set by  the Sponsor and rater training vendor .
Patients will complete a computer -administered Diagnostic Validation (DxV) assessment 
at the Screening visit prior to the rater -administered SCI D, on a tablet computer provided 
to the study center. The DxV will collect data about the patients’ history relative to 
lifelong history  of MDD. The patient’s diagnostic information, based on the responses to 
the computerized interview, will be reviewed b y the independent clinical reviewers te am 
appointed by  the Sponsor, and any  uncertaint y raised by the patient’s responses on the 
diagnostic interview will be discussed with the Investigator/ study centerclinician in order 
to establish confidence in the diagnosis. Patients for whom diagnostic ag reement between 
the Investigator/ study centerclinician and the rater vendor clinician cannot be reached, 
may not be appropriate for study  participation.

Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018 
 
 
 
 
  
9.5.1.2 Efficacy Assessments
The efficacy assessments ( MADRS )will be administered by  a psychiatrist,
doctoral level clinical psychologist , or other clinician who has extensive professional 
training and experience in the diagnosis of mental illness and who meets the trainin g 
requirements and qualifications standards set b y the Sponsor and rater training vendor.
9.5.1.2.1 The Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale
The MADRS ( Montgomery  and Åsberg, 1979 ) is a clinician -rated scale. The MADRS 
will be used to assess depressive s ymptomatology . Patients are rated on 10 items to 
assess feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality , reduced sleep 
or appetite, difficult y concentrating and lack of interest. Each item will be scored on a 7-
point scale. A score of 0 indicates the absence of symptoms, and a score of 6 indicates 
symptoms of maximum severit y. 
9.5.1.2.1.1 MedAvante Central Ratings for MADRS
In order to control for possible bias in face -to-face ratings and to obtain a “blinded” 
rating of patient symptom severity  and change, blinded expert raters will administer, 
through remote teleconference, the MADRS. The remote (or centralized) raters will be 
blind to the study  design, entry  criteria, and visit number (except for Screening [Visit 1] 
and Baseline [Visit 2]).
The MedAvante rater may  be observed during the interview by  another mental health 
evaluator for quality  control purposes. At the study center, the evaluations must be 
conducted in a private room, with the door closed ,and a study center representative (eg, 
study coordinator) maybe present during the rating session at the discretion of the 
Investigator .Every effort should be made to admin ister the MADRS prior to other 
assessments.

Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018 
 
 
 
9.5.2 Safety Assessments
Patients must be evaluated by a physician or an appropriatel y trained health care 
professional at every  visitand the evaluation must be documented. The procedures 
discussed below will be completed at the designated visits.
9.5.2.1 Adverse Events
An AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patientor clinical investigation patient
administer ed a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a 
causal relationship with thistreatment .An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH-E2A).
For the purpose of the study center’sdata collection responsibilities
, any untoward event 
that was reported from the time the patient signed the ICFuntil 30days after the final 
protocol-defined stud y visit or the last known dose of IP(if the final visit does not occur)
isto be considered an AE.
Examples of AE sare as follows :
Changes in the general condition of the patient
Subjective symptoms offered by  or elicited from the patient
Objective signs observed by  the Investigator or other study  centerpersonnel
All diseases that occur after signing inform edconsent, including an y change in 
severity or frequency of pre -existing disease
All clinically  relevant abnormalities in 
laboratory  values or clinically relevant 
physical findings that occur during the study schedule

41
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Please note thatmedical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during 
the study should not be capture das AEs, but should be listed in the medical history  if 
related to a pre -existing condition .
9.5.2.1.1 Causality Assessment
For each AE, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the IP. 
The causality  assessment must be recorded o n the appropriate AE reporting page of the 
patient’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by answering the following 
question:
Is there a reasonable possibility  the IPcaused the event?
Yes:There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IPand AE, ie:
○ There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the IPand the event, and /or
○The event is unlikel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent disease or other 
factors, and/or
○Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist
No:There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IPand AE, 
ie:
○ There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the IPand the event, or
○The patientdid not take the IP, or
○The event is likel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent disease or other 
factors, or
○The event is commonl y occurring in the (stud y) population independent of IP
exposure
9.5.2.1.2 Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severit y of each AEby recording a 
severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient ’s eCRF. Severity,
which is a description of the intensity  of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from 
seriousness, which implies a patientoutcome or AE -required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality (Section 9.5.2.1.3). Severity will be 
assessed according to the following scale:
42
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Mild: A type of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  
interfere with usual activities of daily  living.
Moderate: A type of AEthat is usually  alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, 
causing discomfort , but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the research participant.
Severe: A type of AEthat interrupt s usual activities of daily living, or significantl y 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
9.5.2.1.3 Serious Adverse Events
AnSAEis any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life threatening
Requires i npatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity, or
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be lifethreatening, o r require 
hospitalization may  be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patientand may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such med ical events 
includeallergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in patienthospitalization, orthe 
development of IPdependency  or drug abuse.
Emergency  room visits that do not result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of 
the other serious outcomes to determine whether they  qualify as SAEs.
Preplanned hospitalizations ( eg, elective procedures for pre -existing conditions that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery  and hysterectomy ) are excluded from SAE 
reporting.

RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.5.2.1.4 Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any  AEsor SAEsthat have occurred 
since the previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading 
question such as, “How do y ou feelsince your last visit ?” Study centerpersonnel will 
record all pertinent information in the patient’s eCRF. 
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF
whether or not they  are considered causally  related to the IP.
For every  AE, the Investigator must:
Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event ( ie, is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severit y and casual relationship
Document all actions taken with regard to the IP
Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE
Document the outcome of the AE
In addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the I CF and in accordance with 
Section 9.5.2.1, to notify  study centerpersonnel of any  AEs occurring durin g the 30-day 
poststudy  period.Any AEs reported b y the patient (or patient representative) during this 
period are to be reco rded in original source documents. AEsare also to be recorded in the 
eCRF if at least oneof the following conditions is met: 1) the event meets the criteria for 
an SAE (see Sections 9.5.2.1.3 and 9.5.2.1.4), and/or 2) the event is judged by  the 
Investigator to be potentially  causally related to IP.
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol -defined stud y visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to prestudy  status, has resolved or stabilized, or can 
be explained as being unrelated to the IP. If a follow -up visit is deemed necessary  for 
appropriate safet y surveillance, it will take place within 30 day s of the final 
protocol-defined stud y visit.
9.5.2.1.4.1 MedAvante Reporting of Safety/Adverse Events
MedAvante Raters will complete a safety reporting form (ie, Potential Clinical Events 
Notification Form), including an additional risk assessment form if certain triggers are 
met during t heir interviews with the patientsat the study centers(ie, risk assessment 
forms for suicide, homicide, suspected child abuse, and suspected elder/dependent adult 
abuse). MedAvante Raters feel morally  and ethically  obligated to report this information 
to the study center, and the principal Investigator is responsible for follow -up, including 
management of the patientand further reporting as necessary . 
44
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018Patientsmay spontaneously  report possible clinical events to the centralized rater during 
an assessment . Possible clinical events as determined by the centralized rater will be 
recorded on a central rater source document and will be forwarded to the study centerfor 
further evaluation at the conclusion of the assessment. I t is the study center’s
responsibil ity to determine, with further patientquestioning, whether this event qualifies 
as an AE or SAE and to adhere to the methods described in Section 9.5.2.1.3 for 
reporting such events to the Sponsor. 
If, while conducting the assessment, the centralized rater feels that there is an emergent 
risk to the safet y of the patient, or to a third part y, the study centerwill be contacted 
immediately  by the centralized rater to intervene in the patientassessment room. The 
central rater shall stay  on the teleconference call with the patientuntil appropriate 
personnel from the study centerarrive. Information regarding the assessment shall be 
documented b y the central r ater and forwarded to the study centerwhere the patientis 
physically present. The principal I nvestigator at the study centershall be responsible for 
compliance with an y state law reporting requirements such as, for example, those 
governing the reporting of child abuse, or any  duty to warn third parties of potential 
harmful conduct b y the patient.
9.5.2.2 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Events of 
Special Interest
The Sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAE s that mee t 
specific criteria. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately  regarding an y SAE 
that occurs after informed consent is obtained.
Within 24 hours of learning of an y AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE, the 
study centerpersonnel must report the event to Global Drug Safety on the SAE Form for 
Clinical Trials .TheStudy Physicianmay also be notified by  telephone.
If, during follow -up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventuall y meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE.
Thestudy centermusttransmit the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to the SAE fax number 
shown below . Even if aninitial report ismade bytelephone, the SAEForm for Clinical 
Trials completed with all available details must still be faxed within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event at the study center.
Supplemental information should be submitted as soon as available and may include 
laboratory  results, radiology  reports, progress notes, hospital admission and emergency  
room notes, holding and observationnotes, discharge summaries, autops y reports, and 
death certificates.
45
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018The Investigator is expected to take all therapeutic measures necessary  for resolution of 
the SAE. Any medications or procedures necessary  for treatment of the SAE must be 
recorded on the appropriate pages of the patient’s eCRF. All SAEs are to be followed by  
the study staff until resolution or until the SAE is deemed stable. The Sponsor may  
contact the study centerto solicit additional information or follow up on the event.
9.5.2.3 Reporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study
Study centerpersonnel must report every  pregnancy  from the time the patient signs the 
ICF until 30 day s after the last dose of IP. Within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy , 
the study centerpersonnel must report the event to Global Drug Safet y on the Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy  Form and fax it to the SAE/ Pregnancy fax number 
provided in 
Section 9.5.2.2
, even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male 
patients occurring during the ti meframe described above must also be reported. 
Any pregnancy  of a patient treated with IP(or in female partners of male patients 
occurring during the time frame described above) must be followed to term and the 
outcome reported b y completing a follow-
upClinical Tr ial Pregnancy Form. Ifthe 
pregnancy  is associated with an SAE ( eg, if the moth er is hospitalized for hemorrhage), a 
separate SAE Form for Clinical Trials must be filed as described in Section 9.5.2.2with 
the appropriate seri ous criterion ( eg, hospitalization) indicated in addition to the 
pregnancy  form.

The schedule of study  procedures and assessments is tabulated by  visit in the Schedule of 
Evaluations in Section 2.0. The descriptions of the procedures to be performed at each 
visit are provided in the following sections.
Upon providing 
written informed consent, patients enter a screening period of up to 
14days.  Following the screening peri od, patients enter the 3- week, double-blind 
treatment period.  During the double -blind treatment p
eriod,patients have 3 study  visits 
per week. The visits occur in the following pattern: treatment day , 1 day following the 
treatment day , 4 days followin g the treatment day , and 7 day s following the treatment day  
(which is the next treatment day ).If necessary , study visits may  be conducted up to 
2days before or after the scheduled visits with the exception of visits which are 24 hours 
apart(ie, Visits 2 and 3 must be conducted 1 day  apart;
similarly,Visits 5 and 6 as well 
as Visits 8 and 9 must be conducted 1 day  apart).  Upon completion of the double-blind 
treatment 
period,
patients are eligible to enter the RAP-MD-04 maint enance study  or 
enter a 1-week safety follow-u p period.

RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.5.6.13 Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled visits can be performed if safet y concerns arise and at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Additional examinations may  be performed as necessary  toensure the safet y 
and well-being of the patients during the study .
9.6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
9.6.1 Data Monitoring
Before an y patiententers the study , a representative of the Sponsor will meet with the 
Investigator and the study  center staff to review the procedures to be followed during the 
study. Electronic data capture (E DC)functionality  training is provided via 
computer -based training to train investigator s and authorized designees on recording the 
data in the eCRFs using the EDC sy stem. After the first patientis enrolled, the Sponsor
representative, a Regional Site Manager or designee , will periodicall y monitor the 
progress of the stud y by conducting on -site visits. This Regional Site Manager or 
designee will review query  statuses remotely, possibly  warranting more frequent 
communication and/or study center visits with the Investigator and the study  centerstaff. 
The Investigator will make available to the Regional Site Manager or designee source 
documents (written notes and electro nic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, 
and all other stud y-related documents. The Investigator and the stud y centerstaff will be 
responsible for data entry of patientdata into the eCRFs via the EDC sy stem, resolving 
data queries generated via the EDC s ystem and providing missing or corrected data. The 
Investigator or designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the 
data, and endorsing the patientdata within the EDC sy stem. This approval method will 
include appl ying an electronic signature linked to a uniquely  assigned username and 
password that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature used in the past.
9.6.2 Data Recording and Docum entation
Data collection will involve the use of the EDC system, to which only  authorized 
personnel will have access. Patient’sdata are to be entered into the EDC sy stem by the 
Investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data ent ry into the 
EDC system by the Investigator or designee, a combination of manual and programmatic 
edit checks will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to 
study protocol. As a result of these edit checks, data monitoring ,andreviews,queries 
may be electronicall y issued to the study  centerand should be answered electronicall y via 
the EDC sy stem.
Each query  will carry  identifying information (assigned username, date, and time) to 
assist 
the Sponsor and the Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and 
the response provided b y theInvestigator . All data changes made to the patient’s data via 
a data query  will be approved by  the Investigator prior to final database lock.
61
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018After all data have been reviewed and al l issues have been resolved, the database will be 
locked.
All data collected in the context of this study  will be stored and evaluated per regulatory  
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way  as to guarantee patientconfidentiality  in accordance with the 
legal stipulations apply ing to confidentiality  of data. Study  records ( eg, copies of eCRFs, 
laboratory reports, regulatory  documents) will be retained at the study center, along with 
adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study  
records must be available for inspection b ythe Sponsor, its authorized representatives ,
the FDA, or other health authorities.
 
 Source documents will be used 
at the study centersand may include a patient’s medical record, hospital charts, clinic 
charts, the I nvestigator’s patient study  files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such 
as laboratory  tests, ECGs, etc. A centralized clinical laboratory  will be used for the 
analysis of all blood samples. Additional information on the collection and handling of 
samples is detailed in the L ab Procedure Manual.
9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE

RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.7.2 Patient Disposition
The number and percentage of patients in theEnrolled, Safety, and mITTpopulations
will be summarized by  treatment group and study  center.
Screen-failurepatients(ie, patients screened but not included in the Enrolled 
Population ) and the associated reaso ns for failure to randomize will be tabulated overall 
for all screened patients . 
The number and percentage of patients in the mITT Population who complete the 
double-blindtreatment p eriodand ofpatients who prematurel y discontinue during the 
same period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment 
groups. The reasons for premature discontinuation duringthe double -blindtreatment 
periodas recorded on the disposition pages of the eCRFswill be summarized by  
treatment group for t he mITTPopulation. 
9.7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic parameters (eg, age, race, ethnicit y, sex, weight, height, body mass index 
[BMI]) and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group for the 
Safety and mITT populations. 
9.7.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
9.7.4.1Extent of Exposure
Patients in the Safety Population will be categorized by the number of IP doses 
received. The number and percent ageof patients in each category will be summarized 
by treatmen t group.
Prior medication is defined as an y medication taken before the date of the first dose of 
randomized IP. Concomitant medication is defined as an y medication taken on or after 
the date of the first dose of randomized IP.
Both prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by  the number and 
proportion of patients in each treatment group receiving each medication within 
eachtherapeutic class for the Safet y Population. Multiple medication use by a patient will 
only be counted once.
63
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018IV administ ration notes including site reaction at placement of IV, reaction to 
adhesive, infusion interruption, failure of administration device, increase in suicidality 
based on clinical evaluation, and perceptual disturbance based on mental s tatus 
assessment are c ollected.For each item, the number and percentage of patients who 
had a ‘yes’ response will be summarized by treatment group and visit for the Safety 
Population. The number and percentage of patients taking each qualifying ADT will be 
summarized by  treatment group for the mITTPopulation. Mean daily  dose foreach 
qualifying ADT will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, 
mean, standard deviation [ SD], median, Q1, Q3,minimum, and maximum) by treatment 
group for the mITTPopulation.
9.7.4.2Measurement of Treatment Compliance
Dosing compliance for the background ADT during a specified period is defined as the 
total daily dose administered to a patient during that period divided by the total daily 
dose prescribed during the same period multi plied by 100, as captured in the eCRF.
Descriptive statistics for ADT compliance will be presented for each ADT and overall by 
treatment group for the mITTPopulation.
9.7.5 Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy  analyses will be based on the mITT Population, unless stated otherwise. The 
baseline for each specific efficacy  endpoint is defined as the last measurement prior to the 
first dose of randomized treatment. All statistical hy pothesis tests will be performed at the 
2-sided 5% significance level for main effects. All confidence intervals (CIs)will be 
2-sided 95% CI s, unless stated otherwise.  
For efficacy  analyses in which study  center is a factor, a small center will be defined as a 
center with < 2 patients in ≥ 1 treatment group in the mITT Population. Small c enters will 
be pooled to form pseudo -centers so that each treatment group includes ≥ 2 mITT 
patients within the center. Details of the pooling algorithm will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).
64
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.7.5.1 Primary Efficacy Parameter
The primary  efficacy parameter will be the change from baseline in MADRS total score 
at end of study . The primary  analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM )with treatment group, pooled study  center,visit and 
randomized treatment -by-visit interaction as the fixed effects , and baseline MADRS 
total score and baseline MADRS total score -by-visit interaction as covariates . An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covari ance of within -patient 
scores. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the denominator 
degrees of freedom ( Kenward et al, 1997; Kenward et al, 2003 ). The treatment 
difference for rapastinel doses versus placebo will be estimated and reported along with 
the corresponding 95% CI and nominalp-value.
In the case that the MMRM model with unstructured covariance fails to converge with 
the default algorithm , then the Fisher scoring algorithm will be used to provide better 
initial values of the covariance parameters; if the model still does not converge, a 
simplified model without term for study center will be used to find the initial values of 
the covariance parameters. In the rare event that the model still does not converge after 
using those initial values, simplified covariance structures will be used to fit the model 
in the following order: (1) ante -dependence, (2) heterogeneous autoregressive, 
(3) Toeplitz, and (4) compound symmetry.
To assess the robustness of the primary MMRM results to the possible violation of the 
missing-at-random assumption, a sensitivity analysis using a pattern -mixture model 
based on non -future dependent missing value restriction s (Kenward et al, 2003 ) will be 
performed. The pattern for the pattern -mixture model will be defined by the patient’s 
last visit with observed value. The observed MADRS total score at a visit is assumed to 
have a linear rel ationship with the patient’s prior measurements. The missing values 
will be imputed under the assumption that the distribution of the missing observations 
differs from the observed only by a shift parameter value Δ. The dataset with missing 
values will be analyzed using the same model as the primary analysis for between -
treatment group comparisons at the end of the treatment. The imputation of missing 
values and the analysis will be performed multiple times and the inference of this 
sensitivity analysis wil l be based on the combined estimates using the standard multiple 
imputation technique. The values ofΔ will be selected as 0 to 8.
9.7.5.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Parameter
The key secondary  efficacy parameter will be the change from baseline to 1 day after the 
first dose of treatment in MADRS total score. Thisparameter will be anal yzed using the 
same MMRMas will beused for the primary efficacy param eter.  The treatment 
difference for rapastinel versus placebo will be estimated and reported along with the 
corresponding 95% CI and nominalp-value.
65
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018A sequential testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error rate at 
5% for the compariso ns of treatment difference in the following order:
Rapastinel 450 mg versus placebo -primary efficacy parameter
Rapastinel 450 mg versus placebo -key secondary efficacy parameter
Rapastinel 225mg versus placebo -primary efficacy parameter
Rapastinel 225mg versus placebo -key secondary efficacy parameter

9.7.6.1 Adverse Events
AEswill be coded b y system organ class and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.

67
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 2018An AE (classified b y preferred term) will be considered a treatment -emergent adverse 
event (TEAE) if it was notpresent beforethe first dose of IPor was present before the 
date of the first dose of IPand increased in severity after the first dose of IP. An AE that 
becomes serious after the date of first dose of IP will also be considered as a TEAE.
If more than 1 AE is reported before the first dose of IPand coded to the same preferred 
term, the AE with the greatest severit y will be used for comparison with the AEs 
occurring during the double-blind treatment period that were also coded to that preferred 
term. An AE that occurs more than 30 daysafter the date of the last dose of IPwill not be 
considered as a TEAE.
The number and percentage of patients reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be 
tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term and further categorized by  severity 
and causal relationship to the IP. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term 
for the same patient, the patient will be counted only  once for that preferred term using 
the greatest severit y and strictest causalit y for the summarization by  severity and causal 
relationship.
Aserious adverse event ( SAE)that occurred between the date of the first dose of IPand 
30 days after the date of the last dose of IP, inclusive, will be considered a treatment -
emergent SAE(TESAE) .The number and percentage of patients who have TESAEs will 
be summarized by  preferred term and treatment group. In addition, the incidence of 
TESAEs that lead to death will be summarized separatel y by preferred term for each 
treatment group.
Overall summaries of AEs will be provided on a per- patient bas is for categories of all 
TEAEs, treatment -related TEAEs, 
TESAEs, and TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation.

9.7.8 Interim Analysis
At the time of preparation for Protocol Amendment 2, a blinded interim analysis 
was performed as part of data quality review as the study was progressing. In this 
review, it was observed th at the SDfor the primary and secondary endpoints were 
substantially lower than the originally assumed values for sample size calculations. 
The observed SDs in the blinded reviews of this study and other ongoing acute 
studies at the same time (RAP -MD-02 and RAP-MD-03) were taken into 
consideration for revising the estimate of the sample size as proposed in the next 
section (Section 9.7.9Determination of Sample Size) .

71
Naurex, Inc
RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.7.9 Determination of Sample Size
The originally proposed primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline in the 
MADRS total score at 1 day after the first dose of treatment.  The study was planned to 
randomize 1050 patients assuming SDof 10 points, which provides 99% power to 
detect a difference of 3.25 points in MADRS total score between at least 1 of the 2 
rapastinel dose groups and placebo at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.   
While the study was ongoing ,the primary efficacy variable was revised to be the 
change from baseline in MADRS score at the last visit, Day 21, as recommended by the 
FDA, EMA, and PDMA , and included in Amendment 2 of the protocol. At the same 
time of Amendment 2, a blinded data review was conducted for St udies RAP -MD-01, 
RAP-MD-02, and RAP -MD-03. The pooled SD for the 3 studies were 7.4, 8.0, and 8.7, 
respectively, all smaller than the originally assumed 10 points. Sample size was re -
calculated using 8.7 as the common SD. The calculation used MMRM model wi th 
simulations; it also assumed correlation of 0.5 between the repeat ed measures and an 
overall drop out rate of 15%. To have 90% power, the total sample size required is 540 
patients. However, the study had already enrolled more than 590 patients with less than 
5% of overall dropout rate, surpassing the re- estimated sample size of 540 patients.  
The study enrollment will be halted as soon as operationally feasible. The final sample 
size expected is approximately 630 patients (210 patients per treatment grou p).
9.7.10 Computer Methods
Statistical analy ses will be performed using version 9.3 (or newer) of SAS.
9.8 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD
The study  will be conducted under the supervision of an independent DSMB to be 
chartered to review safety  data at predetermined points during the study . The DSMB may  
also decide to meet and review safet y data at other timepoints should it be deemed 
necessary. The DSMB is responsible for the ongoing review of safety data in the clinical 
study and for making recommendations concerning the continuation, modification, and 
termination of the study (FDA Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and 
Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, March 2006 ).
All analyses that are required to support the DSMB will be performed b y an independent 
unblinded statistician not otherwise involved in the study.  Details of the DSMB 
membership, meeting schedule, and data review and anal ysis will be documented in the 
DSMB Charter.

RAP-MD-02 Protocol Amendment 2 10Dec 20189.9 CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE STUDY OR PLANNED 
ANALYSES
Any amendment to this protocol will be provided to the Investigator in writing by  the 
Sponsor. No protocol amendment may  be implemented (with the exceptions noted below) 
before it has been approved by  the IRB,and the signature page, signed by  the 
Investigator, has been received by  the Sponsor . If the protocol is amended to eliminate or 
reduce the risk to patients, the amendment may  be implemented before IRB review and 
approval. However, the IRB must be informed in writing of such an amendment, and 
approval must be obtained within reasonable time limits. 
9.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
A protocol devi ationis any change, divergence, or departure from the study  design or 
procedures that is under the Investigator ’sresponsibility  and oversight (as defined by  
regulations) without prior written IRB approval or favorable opinion of an appropriate 
amendment and that does not have a major impact on the patient’s rights, safety , or

Title Multicenter Pilot Study of the Safety, Efficacy, and Immune Cell Profiling in 
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients Treated with the 
Combination of Sorafenib plus Nivolumab as First-Line of Systemic Therapy 
Patient 
populationUnresectable HCC with no prior systemic therapy and Child Pugh A or B liver 
function
Rationale for 
StudyThe multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, whose principal targets include VEGFR2, 
VEGFR3, and RAF kinases, is the only approved first-line therapy with 
established survival benefit in patients with HCC not amenable to curative 
therapies.1,2  Though the survival benefit of sorafenib has been consistent 
across multiple studies, the overall magnitude of benefit is small, and 
generally fewer than 5% of patients demonstrate response by conventional 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) across studies.1-3 
Recently, the anti-programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab, 
demonstrated a preliminary signal of efficacy in the CheckMate 040 Phase 
I/II trial in advanced HCC patients, including a dose escalation cohort of 48 
patients and a dose expansion cohort of 214 additional patients, across 
etiologic subtypes.4  In the dose expansion cohort, tumor responses occurred 
in 20%, median duration of response has not yet been reached but was over 
17 months for the dose escalation cohort. Results of CheckMate 040 have 
led to an ongoing multinational Phase III trial, CheckMate 459 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] comparing the efficacy of sorafenib versus nivolumab as 
first-line therapy for advanced HCC.  
Primary 
ObjectivePart 1: Escalation Cohort: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib in 
combination with standard dose nivolumab in patients with Child Pugh A-B7 
liver function
Part 2: Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort: Safety in patients with Child Pugh B 
liver function 
Secondary 
Objectives1. Safety and tolerability of combination overall
2. Rate of irAE for combination overall and in patients with Child Pugh B 
liver function
3. Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.15 for overall study
4. ORR by RECIST 1.1 in patients with Child Pugh B liver function
5. Duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS) overall and in Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort

Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 5 of 106Study Design This is an open-label, dose-escalation and expansion pilot study to examine 
the safety and efficacy of sorafenib combined with the PD-1 checkpoint 
inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with unresectable HCC not amenable to 
curative therapies, with no prior systemic treatment. The study is divided into 
two parts: Dose Escalation Cohort (Part 1, in patients with Child Pugh A-B7 
liver function) and Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort (Part 2, in patients with 
Child Pugh B liver function). There are 2 planned study sites: UCSF and a 
sub-site which was activated after completion of Part 1: Dose Escalation 
Cohort. Immune profiling of PBMC will be performed in UCSF patients only; 
PBMCs will not be collected for sub-site participants. 
Number of 
patients6-24 patients. Part 1: 6-12 patients; Part 2: 12 patients.
Duration of 
TherapySorafenib will be administered continuously and nivolumab will be 
administered every 14 days until progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, criteria for discontinuation are met, or study end, 
whichever comes first. 
Duration of 
Follow upPatients will be followed for survival every 3 months after last dose of study 
drug for up to 2 years.
Duration of 
studyThe study is expected to complete accrual approximately 48 months from the 
time the study opened to accrual, based upon expected enrollment of 
approximately 1-2 subjects per month and enrollment holds for protocol 
amendment. Accrual will be closed after 12 patients are enrolled to Child 
Pugh B Expansion Cohort or on 30 April 2022, whichever occurs first.
Study Drugs Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which inhibits specific targets that are 
imperative for tumor cell proliferation including the serine/threonine kinases 
c-Raf and B-Raf (IC 50 6 and 25 nM respectively) and the receptor tyrosine 
kinase RET, Flt-3 and c-Kit (IC 50 47, 33 and 68 nM respectively).6  Sorafenib 
has potent activity against receptor tyrosine kinases important in tumor 
angiogenesis including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family 
(VEGFR1, -2, -3; IC 50 26, 90 and 20 nM respectively) and platelet derived 
growth factor-beta (PDGFR-ί;  IC50 57 nM). In cellular mechanistic (on target) 
assays, sorafenib was found to be a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, 
and PDGFR and Flt-3 receptor phosphorylation.6  The anti-tumor activity of 
sorafenib in vivo is driven by its direct effects on tumor growth through its 
inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and on the anti-angiogenic activity of 
the compound.  Sorafenib demonstrates broad anti-tumor activity in human 
tumor xenograft models of liver, kidney, lung, prostate, breast and leukemia. 
In human hepatocellular tumor cell lines, sorafenib potently inhibited cellular 
proliferations, Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and induced apoptosis. Sorafenib has 
potent activity against human tumor xenograft model of hepatocellular 
carcinoma with tumor stabilization seen at moderate doses and partial tumor 
regressions observed at higher doses. For further information about 
preclinical pharmacology, please refer to the current version of the sorafenib 
IB.
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a human 
monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets 
the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell 
surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 6 of 106expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.7 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, 
programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-
regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 
and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell 
responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. Nivolumab is 
expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purification 
technologies.

1.1 Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide 
with an estimated incidence of over 750,000 new cases and almost as many deaths 
annually.8  The incidence and mortality of HCC are rising significantly in the United 
States.9  Advanced stage of disease at diagnosis precludes curative treatments in the 
majority of cases, and there are limited treatment options for patients with unresectable 
HCC after failure of liver-directed therapies.  In 2008, publication of the Sorafenib 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) phase III trial 
demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients with 
advanced HCC treated with the biologic agent, sorafenib.2  The SHARP trial will be 
discussed in detail below. After progression on sorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor 
regorafenib showed significant improvement in 2nd line OS along with modest 
improvement in progression-free survival (PFS).10  Despite improvements in outcome 
with sorafenib and regorafenib, however, the median OS for patients starting first line 
therapy for advanced HCC remains less than a year.  Multiple recent randomized phase 
3 trials of other anti-angiogenic multikinase inhibitors in HCC have failed to show 
benefit, underscoring the challenges of toxicity, comorbidity, and chemoresistance in 
this treatment-refractory disease.11  Recently, a Phase I/II trial has shown preliminary 
activity of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab in HCC as discussed below.4 New 
active drugs and combinations are urgently needed.
1.2 Rationale of the study
The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, whose principal targets include VEGFR2, VEGFR3, 
and RAF kinases, is the only approved first-line therapy with established survival benefit 
in patients with HCC not amenable to curative therapies.1,2  Though the survival benefit 
of sorafenib has been consistent across multiple studies, the overall magnitude of 
benefit is small, and generally fewer than 5% of patients demonstrate response by 
conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) across studies.1-3 
Recently, the anti-programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab, 
demonstrated a preliminary signal of efficacy in the CheckMate 040 Phase I/II trial in 
advanced HCC patients, including a dose escalation cohort of 48 patients and a dose 
expansion cohort of 214 additional patients, across etiologic subtypes.4  In the dose 
expansion cohort, tumor responses occurred in 20%, median duration of response has 
not yet been reached but was over 17 months for the dose escalation cohort.     Results 
of CheckMate 040 have led to an ongoing multinational Phase III trial, CheckMate 459 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] comparing the efficacy of sorafenib versus nivolumab as first-line 
therapy for advanced HCC.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 17 of 1061.3 Sorafenib
1.3.1 Sorafenib preclinical data
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which effects specific targets that are imperative for 
tumor cell proliferation including the serine/threonine kinases c-Raf and B-Raf (IC 50 6 
and 25 nM respectively) and the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, Flt-3 and c-Kit (IC 50 47, 
33 and 68 nM respectively).6  Sorafenib has potent activity against receptor tyrosine 
kinases important in tumor angiogenesis including the vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor family (VEGFR1, -2, -3; IC 50 26, 90 and 20 nM respectively) and platelet 
derived growth factor-beta (PDGFR-ί; IC 50 57 nM). In cellular mechanistic (on target) 
assays, sorafenib was found to be a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and 
PDGFR and Flt-3 receptor phosphorylation.6  The anti-tumor activity of sorafenib in vivo 
is driven by its direct effects on tumor growth through its inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK 
pathway and on the anti-angiogenic activity of the compound.  Sorafenib demonstrates 
broad anti-tumor activity in human tumor xenograft models of liver, kidney, lung, 
prostate, breast and leukemia. In human hepatocellular tumor cell lines, sorafenib 
potently inhibited cellular proliferations, Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and induced apoptosis. 
Sorafenib has potent activity against human tumor xenograft model of hepatocellular 
carcinoma with tumor stabilization seen at moderate doses and partial tumor 
regressions observed at higher doses. For further information about preclinical 
pharmacology, please refer to the current version of the sorafenib IB.
1.3.2 Sorafenib clinical experience in HCC
Sorafenib as a single agent has been evaluated globally in multiple trials in various 
malignancies. Three pivotal international multi-institutional, single agent, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trials led to sorafenib’s approval for the treatment of patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, 2005), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 2007) and 
locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma refractory to radioactive 
iodine (DTC2013). 
Clinical results in Phase I studies of sorafenib as a single agent were suggestive of a 
therapeutic effect in HCC and led to the design of a single arm Phase II study, in which 
137 subjects with advanced, inoperable HCC Child-Pugh classes A and B were 
treated.12  The results of this study (median TTP of 5.5 months by independent 
assessment and median overall survival of 9.2 months), provided the basis for the 
randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study in subjects with advanced HCC Child-
Pugh class A (SHARP, Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol).  This large 
(602 subjects) Phase III study was the first international, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in OS in advanced HCC subjects treated with sorafenib over 
placebo.2 Of the 299 sorafenib subjects valid for ITT analysis, the median OS was 10.7 
months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the 303 subjects randomized to the 
placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 
0.55 to 0.87; p<0.001.  The nominal alpha for this analysis was 0.0077 according to the 
pre-specified O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha spending function.  Therefore, sorafenib had a 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 18 of 106statistically significant effect on prolonging overall survival.  This significant survival 
benefit represented a 31% reduction in risk of death (or 44% improvement in OS) in 
subjects treated with sorafenib versus those treated with placebo.  
Similar improvements in OS and TTP were observed in a Phase III trial of sorafenib 
versus placebo in 271 Asian patients with advanced HCC randomized 2:1 to sorafenib 
versus placebo.1 In the Asian study, the median OS for sorafenib was 6.5 months for 
sorafenib compared to 4.2 months for placebo (HR 0.68), and median TTP was 2.8 
months for sorafenib versus 1.4 months for placebo (HR 0.57). 
In the SHARP study, treatment-related adverse events occurred in 80% of patients in 
the sorafenib group by comparison with 52% in the placebo group.2  Grade 3 toxicities 
included diarrhea (8%), hand-foot skin reaction (8%), hypertension (2%), and abdominal 
pain (2%) in the treatment group.  Grade 3 or 4 hypophosphatemia (4%) and 
thrombocytopenia (4%) were also more common in patients treated with sorafenib. In 
the Asian randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study, the most common Grade 3 
and 4 toxicities were hand-foot skin reaction (10.1%), diarrhea (6%), hyperbilirubinemia 
(3.4%), and fatigue (3.4%) with the use of sorafenib.1  The preceding Phase II study of 
sorafenib in HCC included 28% of patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis; subgroup 
analysis in this cohort with greater degree of hepatic impairment showed higher rates of 
hyperbilirubinemia and encephalopathy developing on study by comparison with 
patients with Child-Pugh class A.12,13
As of 31-December 2015 approximately 70,897 patients have been exposed to 
sorafenib in company-sponsored interventional clinical trials, non-interventional studies 
and investigator-sponsored studies for which Bayer has provided grants. The 
cumulative post-marketing exposure, excluding above mentioned clinical studies, since 
2005 is estimated to be 440,109 patients.
Please refer to the current version of the sorafenib IB for the complete list of observed 
adverse events seen in Phase III studies. 
1.4 Nivolumab
1.4.1 Nivolumab preclinical data
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. 
PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.7 
Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), 
results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction 
between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell 
responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using standard mammalian cell 
cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 19 of 106Nivolumab has been shown to bind specifically to the human PD-1 receptor and not to 
related members of the CD28 family (nivolumab IB).  Nivolumab inhibits the interaction 
of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in enhanced T-cell proliferation and 
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release in vitro (nivolumab IB).14 Nivolumab binds with high 
affinity to activated human T-cells expressing cell surface PD-1 and to cynomolgus 
monkey PD-1. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), nivolumab promoted a 
reproducible concentration-dependent enhancement of IFN-γ release.15 In intravenous 
(IV) repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well 
tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg, administered weekly for 5 weeks, and at doses up to 
50 mg/kg, administered twice weekly for 27 doses. While nivolumab alone was well 
tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys, combination studies have highlighted the potential for 
enhanced toxicity when combined with other immunostimulatory agents (nivolumab IB).  
In addition, an enhanced pre- and postnatal development (ePPND) study in pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys with nivolumab was conducted (nivolumab IB).  Administration of 
nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW was well tolerated by pregnant monkeys; however, 
nivolumab was determined to be a selective developmental toxicant when administered 
from the period of organogenesis to parturition at ≥ 10 mg/kg (area under the 
concentration-time curve [AUC] from time zero to 168 hours [AUC(0-168 h)] 117,000 
µg●h/mL). Specifically, increased developmental mortality (including late gestational 
fetal losses and extreme prematurity with associated neonatal mortality) was noted in 
the absence of overt maternal toxicity. There were no nivolumab-related changes in 
surviving infants tested throughout the 6-month postnatal period. Although the cause of 
these pregnancy failures was undetermined, nivolumab-related effects on pregnancy 
maintenance are consistent with the established role of PD-L1 in maintaining 
fetomaternal tolerance in mice.16
Please refer to the current version of the nivolumab IB for additional data from 
preclinical studies.
1.4.2 Nivolumab clinical experience in HCC
The anti-programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab, has been studied in 
multiple tumor types, including HCC.  Nivolumab has been approved for treatment of 
multiple malignancies, including unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as monotherapy 
or in combination with ipilimumab; metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); and relapsed or progressive classical Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma.  
In HCC, the Phase I/II clinical trial CheckMate 040 reported on 262 patients with 
advanced HCC treated with nivolumab in a dose escalation cohort (n=48) and a dose 
expansion cohort (n=214).4  In the dose escalation phase, a maximum tolerated dose 
was not reached; the dose of 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks was selected for dose 
expansion.  Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (AE) occurred in 25%, 
including rash (23%), AST and/or ALT elevation in 21% and 15% respectively, elevated 
amylase and/or lipase in 21% and 19% respectively, and pruritus in 19%.  Three of 48 
patients experienced serious adverse events (SAE): pemphigoid, adrenal insufficiency, 
and liver disorder in 1 each.  There were no deaths attributed to treatment-related

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 20 of 106toxicity. The objective response rate (ORR) in dose escalation phase was 15% with 3 
complete responses (CR) and 4 partial responses (PR), with prolonged median duration 
of response (DOR) approximately 17 months.4,17  The median OS for the dose 
escalation cohort was 15.0 months. 
In the CheckMate 040 dose expansion cohort, 214 additional patients with advanced 
HCC were treated with nivolumab at dose of 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks.  Safety was 
similar to the dose escalation cohort with Grade 3-4 treatment-related AE occurring in 
19%.  There were no events of reactivation HBV.  The ORR for the dose expansion 
cohort was 20%, similar across subgroups defined by positive for hepatitis C virus 
(HCV), positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV), and uninfected without HBV or HCV; the 
response rates were also similar for patients without prior sorafenib therapy as for those 
enrolled after progression on sorafenib.  The median OS has not been reached for the 
overall dose expansion cohort, but the median OS for the uninfected, sorafenib 
progressor cohort (n=57) was 13.2 months.4  Among patients with evaluable tumor 
samples in the CheckMate 040 expansion cohort (81%), tumor responses were not 
significantly associated with tumor PD-L1 expression which was present in 20%.  
Results of CheckMate 040 have led to an ongoing multinational Phase III trial, 
CheckMate 459 [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] comparing the efficacy of sorafenib versus nivolumab 
as first-line therapy for advanced HCC.  Please refer to the nivolumab IB for the 
complete list of observed adverse events seen in Phase III studies.
1.5 Combination of multikinase inhibition and checkpoint inhibition
1.5.1 Combination multikinase inhibition and checkpoint inhibition 
preclinical rationale
One potential mechanism for primary or secondary resistance to checkpoint inhibition is 
immunosuppression by factors within the tumor microenvironment, such as by FOXP3+ 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).18  
Several preclinical studies suggest that multikinase inhibitors such as sorafenib may 
reduce the number of tumor infiltrating Tregs and myeloid derived suppressor cells 
(MDSC) as well as inhibiting their function, thereby promoting an immune antitumor 
response.19-21 In a syngeneic mouse model, the combination of the multikinase inhibitor, 
lenvatinib, plus anti-mouse PD-1 mAb showed greater growth inhibition in combination 
than with either agent as monotherapy, with complete tumor regressions in a subset of 
mice treated on combination.22  Re-inoculation with tumor cells did not grow any tumors 
in the mice with complete tumor regression, while all naïve animals grew tumors. The 
combination was associated with synergistic upregulation of interferon signaling-related 
genes; lenvatinib was associated with increased memory T cell and TH1 population 
compared with vehicle treatment.
In a small study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from 20 HCC 
patients as well as 11 control patients, ex vivo incubation with sorafenib elicited dose-
dependent Treg inhibition and effector T cell (Teff) activation at low doses, with Teff 
suppression at higher doses.23  In PBMC samples from 19 HCC patients, sorafenib 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 21 of 106treatment was associated with decreased frequency and absolute number of FOXP3+ 
Tregs along with significantly increased ratio of Teff to Treg by FACS analysis after 4 
weeks of sorafenib therapy compared to baseline.24 Conflicting data in human renal cell 
carcinoma blood samples have been reported, and the timing of these effects has not 
been well characterized.25,26 
Sorafenib therapy may also be associated with increased PD-L1 expression on tumor-
infiltrating immune cells.  In a study of 23 HCC patients with pre-treatment baseline 
tumor samples compared to tumor biopsies after progression on sorafenib, immune cell 
PD-L1 expression by IHC was significantly increased post sorafenib therapy.27  These 
findings suggest PD-L1 expression as a possible mechanism of sorafenib resistance 
and support investigation of the combination of sorafenib plus PD-1 inhibition.
1.5.2 Combination multikinase inhibition and checkpoint inhibition 
clinical experience
Other multikinase inhibitors combined with nivolumab indicate preliminary favorable 
response rates but are notable for Grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity rates of approximately 18-
20% (unpublished data, BMS). CA209-016 is an ongoing phase 1 study of nivolumab 
plus sunitinib, pazopanib, or ipilimumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC).  Interim data from 33 patients enrolled on CA209-016 (n=14 with prior systemic 
therapy) treated with combination of nivolumab plus sunitinib shows a promising overall 
response rate of 52%, with median duration of response of 54 weeks. No DLT were 
identified at full doses of both sunitinib and nivolumab in combination. Toxicity profile 
was notable for Grade 3-4 ALT elevation and hypertension, each occurring in 
approximately 18%, with Grade 3-4 AST elevation and diarrhea in approximately 9% 
each.  For the combination of nivolumab and pazopanib on CA209-016, the overall 
response rate in previously treated patients was 45%, though study expansion was not 
pursued due to occurrence of 4 DLT among 20 patients. Grade 3-4 toxicity included 
elevated ALT and AST each in 20% (requiring treatment discontinuation in 3 patients), 
diarrhea in 20%, hypertension in 10%, and fatigue in 15%. 
1.6 Rationale for selected correlative analyses
1.6.1 PD-L1 expression
Tumor PD-L1 expression by IHC predicts an increased likelihood of response to 
immune checkpoint inhibition with PD-1 inhibitors in some cancer types.28  A pooled 
analysis of 20 trials including 1475 patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and genitourinary cancer showed a significant interaction between PD-L1 
expression and response overall, with overall RR 34.1% vs. 19.9% (p<0.0001).28  
Response rates were significantly higher in PD-L1+ melanoma and NSCLC but no 
significant difference in response rate was observed according to PD-L1 status for 
genitourinary cancers, and a significant proportion of patients with PD-L1-negative 
tumors achieved tumor response to PD-1 inhibition across tumor types.
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 22 of 106In HCC patients enrolled on CheckMate-040, 81% of patients in dose expansion had 
evaluable tumor samples for PD-L1 expression.4  Among these, approximately 20% of 
cases exhibited tumor staining positive for PD-L1, defined as membrane expression of 
PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells.   In this study, positive tumor PD-L1 expression 
was not significantly associated with response to nivolumab therapy. 
Tumor and immune cell PD-L1 expression will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) from pre-treatment baseline archival tumor samples in all patients and any post-
treatment samples if obtained as part of standard clinical care.  PD-L1 IHC analyses will 
be performed in the UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Laboratory (CIL) or other laboratory 
approved by Study Chair dependent upon funding and sample availability.
1.6.2 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Immune Cell Subsets 
and TCR Clonotype Frequency and Diversity
Research blood samples will be collected from all patients enrolled at UCSF at time 
points listed in Section 7.1. Research blood samples will not be collected from patients 
enrolled at the sub-site.
Whole blood will be processed into PBMC and cryopreserved at the UCSF Cancer 
Immunotherapy Laboratory (CIL) for future analyses in batch after completion of study.
PBMC samples will be analyzed for immune cell subsets by flow cytometry and may 
also be profiled for T cell receptor (TCR) genotype by next generation sequencing 
technologies.  Dr. Fong’s laboratory has demonstrated that treatment with the 
combination of CTLA-4 blockade plus GM-CSF results in expansion of activated effector 
CD8+ T cells as well as expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells in patients with 
advanced prostate cancer.29,30  Dr. Fong’s laboratory and collaborators also have 
shown that checkpoint blockade by treatment with CTLA-4 inhibition in patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer and melanoma can increase T cell clonotype repertoire and 
diversity.29,31  
Immune cell subsets will be measured using flow cytometry as has been previously 
described.29,30  The frequency of individual clonotypes, and the diversity of overall 
clonotype repertoire, will be measured by next-generation sequencing.31  Baseline and 
changes on treatment in PBMC T cell subsets and TCR clonotype frequency and 
diversity will be explored for relationship to clinical outcomes including ORR, DOR, PFS, 
OS, and AFP response.
1.6.3 Tumor immune cell infiltration and subsets
Preexisting tumor immune infiltration has shown association with increased likelihood of 
tumor response to checkpoint inhibition.32,33  This association between tumor immune 
infiltration and increased response to immunotherapy may be due to preexisting tumor-
specific T cell clones within the tumor which have been primed by tumor antigens but 
attenuated by checkpoint signaling, which are then activated upon checkpoint inhibition.  
To explore the impact of tumor immune infiltration in HCC treated with the combination 
of sorafenib plus nivolumab, archival pre-treatment tumor core biopsy or resection 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 23 of 106samples (primary and/or non-nodal metastatic site depending on availability) will be 
obtained from all patients.  The samples will be examined for immune cell infiltrates and 
T cell subset composition in batch at study completion in the UCSF CIL as has been 
previously described.29,30,34  The presence of tumor immune infiltrates and T cell subset 
composition will be explored for association with clinical outcomes including ORR, DOR, 
PFS, OS, and AFP (Alpha fetoprotein) response.  
On-treatment or post-treatment tumor samples will also be analyzed in comparison to 
the baseline/pre-treatment specimen when available, such as in cases for which an on-
treatment or post-treatment tumor resection or biopsy is required for clinical care (e.g. 
palliative metastatectomy/debulking, biopsy of an equivocal lesion, or if fiducial 
placement is required for palliative radiotherapy). 
The immune cell subsets in tumor tissue will be compared descriptively to paired PBMC 
from the same patient (Section 1.6.2).29
1.6.4 Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) tumor marker
The most commonly measured blood tumor marker of HCC is AFP, a glycoprotein 
highly expressed during hepatocyte development.   AFP is secreted by approximately 
70% of HCC. Elevated baseline AFP levels have been shown to correlate with worse 
prognosis after hepatic resection, transplant, and local therapies. A study of patients 
enrolled in a phase III randomized trial comparing two palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens showed that patients with AFP decline by at least 20% (designated as AFP 
responders) demonstrated markedly improved survival by comparison with AFP non-
responders, with overall survival 13.5 versus 5.6 months, respectively (p < 0.0001).35 
AFP changes are also associated with response to sorafenib and may be an early 
surrogate marker of response.36,37  
1.7 Rationale for expansion of eligibility to include Child Pugh B 
hepatic dysfunction
The CheckMate 040 trial enrolled a cohort of 49 advanced HCC patients with Child 
Pugh B7 or B8 liver dysfunction which showed objective response rate of 10.2%, with 
median duration of response 9.9 months.38 The safety of nivolumab appeared similar to 
Child Pugh A patients, with discontinuation for toxicity in 2 patients (4.1%). Four patients 
(8.2%) experienced treatment-related hepatic adverse events, similar to proportion in 
Child Pugh A patients in CheckMate 040. Similar results were demonstrated in a 
retrospective case series of patients with Child Pugh B7-B9 hepatic function treated with 
nivolumab at UCSF, with treatment related discontinuation required in 4 of 18 patients 
(22%) and objective responses occurring in 17%.39 Sorafenib also has demonstrated 
acceptable safety in Child Pugh B patients and similar adverse event and 
pharmacokinetic profiles to Child Pugh A,13,40 with no dose modifications recommended 
in the FDA prescribing information, though a phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of 
sorafenib in setting of hepatic dysfunction recommended empiric starting dose reduction 
according to baseline bilirubin and albumin levels.41  There are few treatment options 
with prospective data for safety and efficacy in Child Pugh B patients, noting that the 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 24 of 106first-line treatment options of bevacizumab plus atezolizumab as well as lenvatinib have 
only been studied prospectively in Child Pugh A populations to date, without established 
safety in Child Pugh B populations.42,43 Thus, inclusion of carefully-selected Child Pugh 
B patients provides a treatment option for a subgroup of HCC patients without any 
established first line treatment options beyond sorafenib alone.
1.8 Rationale for protocol amendment to change Expansion Cohort 
primary objective to study safety and tolerability in patients with 
Child Pugh B hepatic function
After completion of Part 1: Escalation Cohort, the results of the IMbrave150 trial were 
reported demonstrating the superiority of the combination of atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab over standard sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and Child Pugh A 
liver function, becoming a new global standard of care in this population.42 Atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab has not been studied in patients with Child Pugh B liver dysfunction, 
however, and is contraindicated in patients with esophageal varices at high risk for 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding or patients with recent history of gastrointestinal 
bleeding, complications which are associated with Child Pugh B liver dysfunction. 
Due to the changing treatment landscape with new first-line treatment options for 
patients with advanced HCC and Child Pugh A liver function, and the lack of established 
combination immunotherapy options for patients with Child Pugh B liver function, the 
previous version Expansion Cohort (Part 2) of this protocol has been amended and 
renamed as the Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort (Part 2), in order to study the safety 
and tolerability of the combination of sorafenib plus nivolumab in patients with both 
Child Pugh B liver dysfunction and advanced HCC, a population with urgent unmet 
medical need for safe and efficacious therapies.

5.3.3 Withdrawal
Subjects must be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the following 
reasons: 
Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A 
subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request 
of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the trial and 
without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further.  The subject 
will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.
Subject is lost to follow-up.
Death.
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:
The subject is non-compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; including 
the use of anti-cancer therapy not prescribed by the study protocol.
Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.  (Note: subjects who have 
been withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of pregnancy should 
not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/MRI or bone scans while pregnant.)
If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the trial would be harmful to the 
subject's well-being.
Severe allergic reaction or unacceptable toxicity to both study drugs (see 
Section 6.9).
The development of a second cancer. 
Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment 
of the investigator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial 
endpoints.
Deterioration of ECOG performance status to greater than 2 despite best 
supportive care and attributed as at least possibly related to protocol therapy.
Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opinion of the 
investigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise 
skewing trial result.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 32 of 106Administrative or safety reasons requiring study closure.
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge 
or transfer is medically acceptable. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be 
recorded in the CRF and in the subject's medical records. Details for the premature 
termination of the study as a whole are provided in Section 10 (Premature termination of 
the study).
6. Treatments
6.1 Treatments to be administered
All patients will be treated with the combination of sorafenib plus nivolumab.  Patients 
will be enrolled to one of two sequential cohorts: the Dose Escalation Cohort (Part 1) or 
the Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort (Part 2). Patients enrolled to the Dose Escalation 
Cohort (Part 1) will be enrolled starting at Dose Level -1 according to Table 6.2.1-1 
below, following standard 3+3 dose escalation rules as outlined in Section 6.2.2 below.  
Patients enrolled to the Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort (Part 2) will be enrolled to the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib identified in Part 1 along with standard 
dose nivolumab, as described below in Section 6.2.2.  
6.2 Part 1: Dose Escalation Cohort
Between 3-12 patients will be enrolled in Part 1 starting at Dose Level (DL) -1.  See 
Table 6.2.1-1 for dose levels and Table 6.2.2-1 for dose escalation decision rules. 
Standard dose nivolumab 240 mg IV every 14 days will be used for both dose levels 
based upon absence of established dose-relationship for toxicities attributed to this 
agent in advanced HCC patients.4

Given Dose LevelEscalation Decision Rule
0 out of 3 Dose escalate to next higher dose level. If already at DL 1, enroll 3 
additional patients at DL 1.
≥ 2 out of 3* Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be declared the 
maximally administered dose (highest dose administered).  The next 
lower cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If no DLTs are seen consider 
an intermediate dose level between this dose and the MAD dose. 
1 out of 3 Enter 3 more patients at this dose level.
If 0 of these 3 patients experience a DLT, proceed to the next dose level.  
If already at DL 1, then DL 1 is the MTD.
If 1 or more of these 3 patients suffer a DLT, then dose escalation is 
stopped, and this dose is declared the maximally administered dose. 
≤ 1 out of 6 at highest dose level below 
the maximally administered doseThis is the MTD and recommended Expansion Cohort dose. 
Note: Dose escalation will stop at Dose Level 1 which is the FDA-labeled dose of sorafenib as monotherapy for HCC.  
If >1 DLT occur at DL-2 a decision will be made whether to amend or terminate the study. 
6.2.3 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) window and definitions
The DLT window will be 28 days (1 cycle).  Subjects must receive 2 doses of nivolumab 
and at least 75% of sorafenib doses within 28 days (1 cycle), or experience a qualifying 
DLT event, to be evaluable for DLT. DLT will be defined as clinically-significant toxicities 
which are at least possibly treatment-related and meet criteria listed in the sections 
below.
Toxicity will be graded by NCI CTCAE v.4.03 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/). Toxicity grade 
should be determined after standard, optimal supportive care treatments have been 
provided when appropriate. Optimal supportive care is defined as standard of care 
measures (such as electrolyte supplementation, the use of loperamide for diarrhea or 
antiemetics for nausea, or topical skin care for rash) that the treating physician deems 
appropriate and sustainable over multiple cycles of therapy.  Clinically significant toxicity 
is defined as requiring therapeutic intervention beyond standard supportive care and/or 
placing the patient at risk for other toxicity by the judgment of the treating investigator.   
After experiencing a DLT, a subject may resume treatment with dose reduction and/or 
optimal supportive care according to protocol guidance on dose modification and delay, 
once criteria for retreatment have been met and provided criteria for discontinuation 
have not been met.
6.2.3.1 Hematologic DLT
1. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (limited to neutrophil, hemoglobin, and platelet counts)
1. Lymphopenia is excluded
2. Prolonged Grade 3 thrombocytopenia > 7 days, requiring dose modifications during 
Cycle 1, requiring platelet transfusion, or associated with clinically relevant bleeding 
(as defined by bleeding requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or an invasive procedure 
such as endoscopy)

6.4 Sorafenib
Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor targeting both tumor cells and 
the tumor vasculature. The chemical name for sorafenib tosylate is 4
Chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ureido] -phenoxy}-pyridine-2
carboxylic acid methylamide-4-methylbenzene-sulfonate, and its molecular weight is 
637 daltons.  The structure of sorafenib is depicted in Figure 6.4-1.
Sorafenib (as Nexavar™) is approved for use in multiple countries including the United 
States (US), the European Union (EU), and many other countries for multiple oncology 
indications including renal cell carcinoma, HCC, and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 36 of 1066.4.1 Sorafenib dosage and administration
Subjects will be instructed on the proper administration of sorafenib.  Sorafenib tablets 
should be taken approximately 12 hours apart if assigned to BID dose level or 
approximately 24 hours apart if assigned to QD dose level, at approximately the same 
time(s) each day.  Sorafenib tablets should be taken without food, at least 1 hour before 
or at least 2 hours after a meal, and with up to 240 mL (approximately 1 cup or 8 oz.) of 
water.  Consumption of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while receiving 
study drug.
6.4.1.1 Sorafenib missed doses
Missed doses of sorafenib should be taken as soon as the subject remembers. 
However, if it < 12 hours before next dose due, the missed dose should be skipped and 
the subject should take his/her next dose as scheduled. A double dose should not be 
administered to make up for missed individual doses.
6.4.2 Sorafenib drug supply and handling
For Part 1 of study, sorafenib tablets were obtained locally from commercial supplies 
with prescription from treating investigator, as a standard therapy for HCC.  For Part 2 
of study after amendment to restrict to Child Pugh B7-9 liver dysfunction, sorafenib 
tablets will be supplied by Bayer HealthCare.  The 200-mg tablet formulation contains 
sorafenib tosylate and the excipients croscarmellose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, 
hypromellose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate.  The tablets have a film 
coating comprised of hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, and red ferric 
oxide, which has no effect on the release rate of the active ingredient, sorafenib 
tosylate.  The tablets are un-debossed, salmon colored, weigh approximately 350 mg 
each, and are 10 mm (millimeter) round in shape. Sorafenib tablets do not need to be 
protected from light.  They are sufficiently stable with regard to light, oxidation, thermal 
stress, and hydrolytic degradation.  The formulation is presented as an immediate 
release (IR) dosage form, i.e., the active ingredient is completely dissolved under in

6.5 Nivolumab
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. 
PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. 
Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), 
results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction 
between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell 
responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens.  Nivolumab is a soluble 
protein consisting of 4 polypeptide chains, which include 2 identical heavy chains and 2 
identical light chains. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
and is produced using standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic 
purification technologies. The clinical study product is a sterile solution for parenteral 
administration.
Nivolumab (as OPDIVO™) is approved for use in multiple countries including the United 
States (US, Dec-2014), the European Union (EU, Jun-2015), and Japan (Jul-2014) for 
multiple oncology indications. OPDIVO™ is not approved for use in HCC as of 1 June 
2017.
6.5.1 Nivolumab dosage and administration
Nivolumab 240 mg flat dose will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes 
through a 0.2-micron to 1.2-micron pore size, low-protein binding (polyethersulfone 
membrane) in-line filter. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. 
Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to protein concentrations as low 
as 0.35 mg/mL. During drug product preparation and handling, vigorous mixing or 
shaking is to be avoided. Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) or polyolefin containers and infusion sets, and glass bottles. At the end of the 
infusion, the line should be flushed with a sufficient quantity of dextrose or normal 
saline.
For patients enrolled to Part 2, nivolumab may be switched to monthly infusion of 480 
mg Q28 days on or after C4D1 with Study Chair approval in patients with investigator-
assessed clinical benefit and without any uncontrolled or grade >2 immune-related 
toxicity, based upon established safety and efficacy of the monthly dosing regimen 
across tumor types.44  A note to file will be placed in the subject’s study chart to 
document Study Chair or designee approval.

dose. Subjects may be dosed up to 3 days (for Q14 day dosing) or 6 days (for Q28 day 
dosing) after the scheduled date if necessary. A dose given more than 3 or 6 days after 
the intended dose date will be considered a delay for each respective dosing interval. 
Subsequent dosing should be based on the actual date of administration of the previous 
dose of drug.
6.5.1.2 Nivolumab premedication
Premedication for nivolumab is not required unless a subject has experienced prior 
infusion reaction. See Section 6.8.2.2.  In subjects who have experienced a prior 
infusion reaction (< Grade 3) and who are determined eligible for retreatment, the 
following prophylactic premedications are recommended: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before additional 
nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 
mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
6.5.2 Nivolumab drug supply and handling
Nivolumab was supplied by Bristol-Myers Squibb to each study site for Part 1 and 
beginning of Part 2 patient enrollment.  Starting after protocol amendment (version 4.0) 
requiring Child Pugh B7-9 liver dysfunction for eligibility to Part 2, nivolumab will be 
prescribed as a standard therapy option for patients with Child Pugh B liver dysfunction 
from commercial supplies and administered according to package insert instructions.  
Additional information on prepared drug storage and administration are available in the 
nivolumab Investigator Brochure and package insert.
6.6 Blinding
This is an open-label study.  No blinding will be performed.
6.7 Dose modifications and delays
Toxicity will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v.4.03 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/). 
Dose modifications, interruptions, and treatment discontinuation for one or both study 
drugs will be determined according to the system showing the greatest degree of 
toxicity and according to the treating investigator’s assessment of cause of toxicity.  
Toxicity will be formally assessed at protocol-defined safety assessment time points well 
as by investigator review of weekly laboratory testing and, in the interim, by any 
unscheduled patient contact with the study team.  
General principles of dose modification and delay are listed below:
Optimal supportive care should be provided for all clinically relevant toxicities. 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 39 of 106See Section 6.8 for guidance on supportive care/rescue medications for specific 
toxicities.
For any toxicity (regardless of grade), despite optimal supportive care, that is felt 
by the treating investigator to represent a risk to the patient’s safety, additional 
dose reduction, treatment delay, and/or treatment discontinuation (beyond per 
protocol dose modifications) are permitted at the discretion of the treating 
investigator.
Scheduled safety and tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per 
protocol even if dosing is delayed.
oSafety assessments may be required more often if treatment delay for 
toxicity.
No dose re-escalation is permitted after dose reduction for toxicity.
If a treatment-related toxicity requiring treatment delay has not recovered to ≤ 
Grade 1 after treatment delay ≥ 6 weeks (42 days) for toxicity, treatment will be 
discontinued.
oExceptions allowing longer treatment delay up to approximately 12 weeks 
for recovery of treatment-related toxicity in subjects who have 
demonstrated previous treatment benefit (e.g. radiographic regression 
and/or clinical improvement such as reduced pain or tumor marker) are 
permitted with documented approval from Study Chair or designee.
6.7.1 Sorafenib dose modifications and delays for toxicity
Sorafenib doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and 
non-hematologic toxicities that are determined to be related to sorafenib therapy 
according to the guidelines in the sections below, according to types of toxicity.
Sorafenib dose reduction will follow predefined dose levels in Table 6.2.1-1 in Section 
6.2.1. Subjects requiring dose reduction at current dose should be treated at next lower 
dose level until Dose Level -2.  If additional toxicity attributed to sorafenib occurs 
despite reduction to Dose Level -2, sorafenib will be discontinued.

6.7.2 Nivolumab dose modifications and delays
No dose reductions for nivolumab are permitted under this protocol.  Nivolumab 
administration will be delayed for the following: 
1. Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin drug-related adverse event, with the following exceptions:
a. Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities do not 
require a treatment delay.
2. Any Grade ≥ 3 skin drug-related adverse event.
3. Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions:
a. Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis do not require a dose 
delay.
4. Dose delay for changes in AST or ALT as follows:
a. If a subject has a baseline AST or ALT that is within normal limits, delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade  2 toxicity (2 grade shift).
b. If a subject has baseline AST or ALT within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay 
dosing for drug-related increase to ≥ 8x ULN.
c. If a subject has baseline AST or ALT within the Grade 2-3 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for two-fold drug-related increase in AST or ALT or for AST or 
ALT values 10x ULN (whichever is lower).
5. Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 41 of 106See Section 6.8.2 and Appendix 14.5 for guidance on management of toxicity attributed 
to nivolumab including initiation of immunosuppression for possible immune-related 
toxicity.  Subjects who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evaluated weekly or 
more frequently if clinically indicated. It is recommended to monitor elevations in AST or 
ALT at least weekly until levels peak or begin to decline. Nivolumab dosing can be 
resumed when the following re-treatment criteria are met.   
6.7.2.1 Criteria to resume nivolumab dosing after delay for toxicity
Subjects may resume treatment with a study drug after treatment hold for toxicity if the 
drug-related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline within 6 weeks (42 days), with the 
following exceptions:
1. Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.
2. Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
3. Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin who require dose delays 
for reasons other than a drug-related hepatic event may resume treatment in the 
presence of Grade 2 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin.
4. Subjects who require dose delays for drug-related elevations in AST, ALT, or total 
bilirubin may resume treatment when these values have returned to their baseline 
CTCAE Grade or normal, provided the criteria for unacceptable toxicity requiring 
permanent discontinuation are not met (Section 6.9).
5. Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed.
6. Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement are acceptable for resuming treatment.
7. A longer treatment delay up to approximately 12 weeks for recovery of treatment-
related toxicity in subjects may be permitted in subjects who have demonstrated 
previous treatment benefit (e.g. radiographic regression and/or clinical improvement 
such as reduced pain or tumor marker), with approval from Study Chair or designee.
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the 
next scheduled time point per protocol.
6.7.3 Dose delays for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity
Dosing interruptions in either or both drugs are permitted in the case of unrelated 
medical or surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., 
elective surgery, unrelated medical events, administrative reasons, patient vacation or 
personal reasons, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy 
within approximately 4 weeks (28 days, 1 cycle) of the scheduled interruption if within 
the first 6 months (6 cycles) of protocol therapy, or within approximately 8 weeks (56 
days, 2 cycles) if the delay occurs after the first 6 months (6 cycles) of protocol therapy.  
Scheduled safety and tumor assessments for all subjects should continue per protocol 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 42 of 106even if dosing is delayed.
Longer delays may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if approved in writing by Study 
Chair. 
The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  Before 
resuming treatment, patients must demonstrate adequate clinical and laboratory 
parameters to resume treatment without indication for dose modification or delay 
according to Section 6.8. 
6.8 Supportive care for toxicity
6.8.1 Sorafenib supportive care
Standard supportive care should be provided to all patients according to institutional 
practice for sorafenib therapy. The following tables provide guidance on supportive care 
to prevent and/or mitigate toxicity related to sorafenib, to be employed at discretion of 
treating investigator.  The treating investigator may employ different or additional 
interventions according to institutional practice and clinical judgment.
6.8.1.1 Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR)
Table 6.8.1.1-1 Guidance on prevention and supportive care for HFSR on sorafenib
Toxicity Grade Practical Prevention / Management Strategies for HFSR 
Grade 0 (Preventive 
strategies)Maintain frequent contact with trial physician to ensure early diagnosis of 
HFSR.
Practical prevention strategies
oSubjects should avoid hot water, tight clothing, or activities that can cause 
friction on the skin.
oMoisturizing cream should be applied frequently.
Padded gloves and open shoes with padded soles should be worn to relieve 
pressure points.
Grade 1 
Any occurrenceContinue preventive strategies and in addition:
oSoak hands and feet in cool water.
oApply petroleum jelly to moist skin.
Grade 2 Any occurrence or 
Grade 3 Any occurrenceContinue supportive/management measures and add analgesic(s) for pain.
6.8.1.2 Diarrhea
Diarrhea is a common side effect of sorafenib.  The preventive and supportive care 
strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with local standard of care on sorafenib 
(e.g., anti-diarrheals, optimized hydration status for diarrhea, dietary modifications).
6.8.1.3 Treatment-emergent hypertension
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious AE associated with sorafenib 
treatment. Subjects will undergo brief physical examinations, including blood pressure 
monitoring, approximately every other week per Section 7.1.  Blood pressure 
measurements that are out of the normal range must be reported to the treating 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 43 of 106physician.  Blood pressure measurements considered out of the normal range are 
diastolic pressure > 90 mm Hg and/or systolic pressure > 140 mm Hg.
The choice of anti-hypertensive medication to be used in cases of treatment-emergent 
hypertension will be at the investigator's discretion and based on site-specific treatment 
guidelines as applicable.  All anti-hypertensive medications used for the management of 
treatment-emergent hypertension should be recorded in the subject’s records.
6.8.2 Nivolumab supportive care
6.8.2.1 Immune-related adverse events (irAE) on nivolumab
For potential immune-related adverse events (irAE) attributed to nivolumab, 
immunosuppressive therapy should be promptly initiated at discretion of treating 
investigator.  General guidelines for immunosuppressive therapy are provided below.  
Specific guidance for common irAE are provided in Appendix 14.6.  
Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may 
worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, 
which might require additional supportive care. These treatment guidelines are intended 
to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to nivolumab.
Suggested steroid regimens include:
1. Systemic steroids equivalent to prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day for severe immune-
related toxicity requiring immunosuppressive therapy.
2. Oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day or other equivalent steroid regimen for mild-
moderate immune-related toxicity requiring immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Topical corticosteroids for mild-moderate dermatitis.
4. Corticosteroid eye drops for ocular immune-related toxicity.
Supportive care on prolonged steroid therapy including blood pressure and blood 
glucose monitoring, gastroprotection with proton pump inhibition, and antibacterial 
prophylaxis (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylactic doses) should be 
employed at discretion of treating investigator according to institutional standards.
Once symptoms resolve or return to Grade 1/baseline, initiate slow steroid taper over at 
least 4 weeks, with close monitoring. It may be necessary to perform conditional 
procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of 
evaluation of the event.
6.8.2.2 Infusion reactions during nivolumab infusion
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely 
to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 44 of 106pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local 
treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:
1. For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not indicated)
oRemain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.
oFor future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are 
recommended: Diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) PO and 
acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg PO at least 30 minutes before additional 
nivolumab administrations.
2. For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption 
but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for  24 hours).
oStop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and 
acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg PO; remain at bedside and monitor subject 
until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may 
also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart 
the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no 
further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 
100% of the original infusion rate. The amount of study drug infused must be 
recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Monitor subject closely. If 
symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
oFor future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are 
recommended: Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO (or equivalent) and 
acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg PO should be administered at least 30 
minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  If necessary, 
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or 
equivalent) may be used.
3. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [i.e., not 
rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; 
recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for 
other clinical sequelae [e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life 
threatening; presser or ventilator support indicated).
oImmediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, 
epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration 
or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, 
and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or 
equivalent), as needed. 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 45 of 106oSubject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. 
oNivolumab will be permanently discontinued. 
oInvestigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of 
anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms.
4. In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).
6.9 Unacceptable toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation
If one study drug is discontinued for unacceptable toxicity, treatment with the other 
agent will also be discontinued. 
6.9.1 Unacceptable toxicity from sorafenib
The decision to discontinue sorafenib for toxicity should follow local standards of care 
as guided by the FDA label for sorafenib in HCC.  Grade ≥ 4 AE attributed to sorafenib 
require discontinuation of sorafenib.   
6.9.2 Unacceptable toxicity related to nivolumab
Treatment with nivolumab should be permanently discontinued for the following 
toxicities attributed to nivolumab therapy:
1. Any Grade ≥ 2 ophthalmologic irAE such as uveitis causing eye pain or reduction of 
visual acuity that does not improve to Grade ≤ 1 severity within 14 days of starting 
topical therapy or requires systemic treatment
2. Any Grade ≥ 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event that does not downgrade to 
Grade ≤ 2 within 7 days with optimal medical management including systemic 
corticosteroids and/or hormone replacement and/or does not downgrade to ≤  Grade 
1 or baseline within 14 days, with the following exceptions:
a. Any Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis irAE that does not improve to ≤ Grade 1 within 7 
days of initiation of maximal supportive care requires discontinuation
b. Any event of Grade ≥ 3 drug-related uveitis, bronchospasm, pneumonia or 
pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction regardless of 
duration requires discontinuation
c. Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation
d. Asymptomatic/uncomplicated Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities 
do not require treatment discontinuation
3. Hepatotoxicity as evidenced by the following lab values requires discontinuation:

b. AST or ALT > 15 x ULN irrespective of baseline or duration
c. Total bilirubin > 5 x ULN, irrespective of baseline or duration
4. Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality requires 
discontinuation, except for the following events which do not require discontinuation:
a. Grade 4 neutropenia < 7 days
b. Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia
c. Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis including no evidence of 
pancreatitis on CT or MRI imaging
d. Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances or abnormalities that are not 
associated with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation and 
appropriate management within 7 days of their onset
e. Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation
5. Any dosing delay for treatment-related toxicity lasting > 6 weeks (42 days) with the 
following exceptions: 
a. Dosing delays up to 12 weeks to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage 
drug-related irAE are allowed with approval from Study Chair.  
6.10 Discontinuation of therapy
Protocol treatment will be discontinued if criteria for withdrawal are met (Section 5.2) or 
for the following reasons:
1. Unacceptable toxicity attributed to either study drug (see Section 6.9)
2. Radiographic disease progression by RECIST 1.1
oSubjects meeting criteria for treatment beyond progression may continue 
treatment until progression confirmed on one follow up imaging study, 
according to Section 6.11 below
3. Complete response after 24 months of protocol treatment
Follow up for protocol endpoints including safety and survival will continue per Section 
7.1 after discontinuation. 
6.11 Treatment beyond progression
A subject may be granted an exception by Study Chair to continue on treatment with 
both sorafenib plus nivolumab until the next scheduled scan time point (approximately 8 
more weeks, or earlier if clinically indicated by signs or symptoms of progression) if 
scans within first 6 months of treatment demonstrate radiographic progression by 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 47 of 106RECIST 1.1, in order to account for possible delayed responses on immunotherapy, 
provided the patient meets criteria below:
1. No significant symptoms of progression
2. No evidence of impending complication due to tumor progression (such as 
radiographic evidence of impending obstruction or mass effect, bleeding, 
or liver failure) by treating investigator and Study Chair assessment
3. No other criteria for drug discontinuation are met (Section 6.10)
Subjects meeting criteria for treatment beyond progression will have note to file 
documenting appropriate to continue treatment post progression signed by Study Chair 
or designee and treating investigator signed in study chart.  Subjects will be informed by 
the treating Investigator and in the main consent form for the study, of the risks and 
benefits of continuing treatment beyond progression. Subjects will be informed the 
choice of continuing treatment is ultimately their decision. Treatment with both study 
drugs will continue according to schedule of procedures for originally assigned study 
cohort (Section 7.1).  If progression is confirmed at a follow up imaging time point, the 
subject will be discontinued from protocol therapy.  
6.12 Drug logistics and accountability
Nivolumab will be stored at the investigational sites in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements and the 
instructions given by the clinical supplies department of the Institution and will be 
inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  Sorafenib will be prescribed and provided by 
local Pharmacy to patients according to standard practice.
6.12.1 Drug accountability
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a 
careful record of the inventory and disposition of the agent (investigational or free of 
charge) using the NCI Drug Accountability Record or another comparable drug 
accountability form.  (See the CTEP website at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment  for the “Policy and Guidelines for 
Accountability and Storage of Investigational Agents” or to obtain a copy of the drug 
accountability form.)
6.12.2 Destruction and return of unused study drug
At the end of the study, unused supplies of nivolumab should be destroyed according to 
institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the site Investigational 
Pharmacy drug accountability records according to institutional Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP). The certificates of destruction should be sent to Bayer and BMS for 
sorafenib and nivolumab, respectively.
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 48 of 1066.13 Treatment compliance
An adequate record of receipt, distribution, and return of all study drugs (if applicable) 
must be kept in the form of a Drug Accountability Form according to site Investigational 
Pharmacy SOP. 
Subject compliance with protocol therapy includes willingness to comply with all aspects 
of the protocol, including safety and efficacy evaluations.  At the discretion of the 
principal investigator, a subject may be discontinued from the trial for non-compliance 
with follow-up visits, procedures, or study drug administration.
6.14 Concomitant therapy
All concomitant medications starting within 28 days of first dose and last dose of 
protocol therapy (including start/stop dates and indication) must be recorded in the 
subject’s source documentation.
6.14.1 Permitted concomitant therapies and medications
1. For patients with active HBV infection or prior HBV exposure, antiviral therapy and 
monitoring viral load should be administered per institutional standards.
2. Subjects may receive standard of care treatment for any underlying illness or 
infection.
3. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are permitted as supportive care for bone 
metastases and/or hypercalcemia at discretion of treating investigator.
4. Steroid and other immunosuppressive therapy is permitted for treatment of 
treatment-related irAE per Section 6.9.
5. Supportive care on steroid or immunosuppressive therapy such as proton pump 
inhibitor for gastroprotection or prophylactic antibacterial agents such as 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are permitted according to institutional practice.
6. Treatment with non-conventional therapies (e.g., herbs [with the exception of St. 
John’s Wart], acupuncture) and vitamin/mineral supplements is acceptable 
provided that, in the opinion of the investigator, such treatment will not interfere 
with the trial endpoints.
7. If AE of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, subjects may receive 
appropriate supportive care (e.g., transfusion, prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals 
and/or antivirals, hematopoietic growth factors).  This supportive care should not 
substitute a recommended dose modification.
8. Caution is recommended when administering substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 
with sorafenib.  Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 is 
expected to increase when these are co-administered with sorafenib.

The sub-site coordinator will send by secure e-mail or fax de-identified HIPAA-compliant 
copies of all consent and screening source documents to UCSF study team for eligibility 
confirmation.  Once eligibility is confirmed by the Study Chair or designee, a document 
of approval to treat indicating Cohort and dose level assignment as applicable will be 
provided by secure e-mail by the UCSF CRC to the sub-site coordinator and treating 
investigator as confirmation of enrollment to proceed with protocol therapy.
7.3 Clinical procedures and assessments
7.3.1 Adverse event (AE) monitoring
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential 
new or worsening AEs as specified in the Schedule of Procedures (Section 7.1) and 
more frequently if clinically indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded 
throughout the study according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action 
taken with regard to trial treatment. Please refer to Section 7.4 for further information on 
AE assessment and reporting.
7.3.2 Compliance with oral study drug
Patients will be provided a sorafenib drug diary to record time and dose of sorafenib 
administration each cycle (Appendix 14.7).  
7.3.3 Vital signs
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain vital signs at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Procedures (Section 7.1).   Vital signs should include temperature, 
pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), weight and blood pressure.  
Height will be measured at screening only.
7.3.4 Complete physical examination
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical examination 
according to institutional practice for the management and monitoring of patients with 
liver cancers. Complete physical exams are required at screening, C1D1, C1D15, 
C2D1, C2D15, C3D1, and every D1 after Cycle 3. They are also required at Safety 
Follow-up 30 days and 100 days after lase dose (SFUV1 and SFVU2). Clinically 
significant abnormal findings during Screening should be recorded as medical history.  
7.3.5 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Appendix 14.2) at 
the time points specified in the Schedule of Procedures (Section 7.1).

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 59 of 1067.3.6 Liver function assessment
The investigator or qualified designee will assess liver function by Child Pugh score 
(see Appendix 14.3) at the time points specified in the Schedule of Procedures (Section 
7.1). 
7.3.7 Tumor imaging and response assessment
Cross-sectional imaging with CT (preferred) or MRI abdomen plus pelvis and CT chest 
with/without or without contrast is required at screening then every 8 weeks (±14 days) 
until end of treatment.  Multiphase/triphasic liver imaging should be included as 
appropriate.  Additional baseline imaging such as PET scan, bone scan, or MRI brain 
are only required if clinically indicated by symptoms and/or to assess known bone 
metastases or other sites of known metastatic disease.  All baseline evaluations will be 
performed as close as possible to the beginning of treatment and ≤  approximately 28 
days before C1D1. The same imaging modality/modalities should be used if possible 
throughout study unless there is a clinical indication to use a different modality (i.e. 
based upon Radiology recommendation to better assess a target lesion, an event of 
new contrast allergy, etc.).  RECIST 1.1 measurements will be performed by a 
radiologist or qualified investigator.
7.3.8 Laboratory procedures/assessments
The specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this trial are

7.3.9 Tumor and blood sample collection and banking for correlative 
analyses
Archival tumor samples for all patients and peripheral blood samples for patients 
enrolled at UCSF will be obtained and stored for planned future exploratory and 
correlative analyses (see Sections 1.6 and 2.3) which will be performed in batch after 
completion of study and pending funding.   
7.3.9.1 Archival tumor sample collection
In all patients, left-over diagnostic tumor block and/or slides from any tumor sampling 
procedure(s) (e.g. biopsy, fine needle aspiration, and/or resection specimens) 
performed prior to enrollment, during study treatment, and/or after treatment 
discontinuation due to progression will be obtained to determine tumor PD-L1 
expression status, to characterize tumor immune infiltrates/T cell subsets, and (optional 
for UCSF patients only) to bank for future correlative analyses as part of the UCSF 
Hepatobiliary Tissue Bank and Registry (CC#124512) as a companion protocol to this 
study.  
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue blocks will be accessioned 
whenever available.  In addition to blocks or if a block is not available, at least 10 
unstained slides (prefer 10 µm) plus 1 H&E slide from a tumor tissue block may be 
accessioned.  Corresponding pathology reports from initial diagnosis and/or subsequent 
tumor sampling will be obtained.  Specimens will be obtained from the Pathology 
Department for banking as soon as possible after consent and/or occurrence of post-
enrollment tumor sampling and stored in the UCSF Biorepository.  Correlative analyses 
using archival tissue samples will be performed in batch at completion of study and 
pending funding.  See Appendix 14.8 for correlative specimen procurement and 
handling instructions.
7.3.9.2 Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection
In all patients enrolled at UCSF, approximately 60 mL of whole blood will be collected 
into green top tubes (e.g. six 10 cc tubes filled approximately to 10 mL) at the time 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 61 of 106points listed in the Schedule of Procedures (Section 7.1).  The tubes will be delivered 
directly to the UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Lab for PBMC isolation then freezing for 
future analysis in batch at end of study and pending funding.  See Appendix 14.8 for 
correlative specimen procurement and handling instructions.
 
7.3.9.3 Optional specimen banking
For patients enrolled at UCSF who consent to optional specimen banking as part of 
companion protocol CC#124512, all left-over blood and/or tumor samples will be 
banked under the UCSF Hepatobiliary Tissue Bank and Registry protocol. See 
Appendix 14.8 for correlative specimen procurement and handling instructions.
7.3.10 Electrocardiogram
A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained during screening at the study 
site per Section 7.1 in all patients.
7.4 Assessing and reporting adverse events (AE)
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment will be evaluable for safety 
from the time of informed consent until 100 days after last dose of protocol therapy or 
the start of a new anti-cancer therapy after study discontinuation, whichever is earlier. 
Any serious adverse events (SAE) occurring later than 100 days after the last dose of 
protocol therapy or after start of new anti-cancer therapy also should be recorded and 
reported if assessed as at least possibly related to study drug or a protocol-specified 
procedure.  All observations pertinent to the safety of the study treatment will be 
recorded and included in the final report.
Safety variables include the following: AEs, laboratory changes (complete blood counts, 
electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation) if determined clinically significant by treating 
investigator and/or Study Chair, changes in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, 
respiratory rate, and temperature), and in some instances, changes in imaging findings 
if indicative of a safety event. 
All AEs whether considered drug-related or not, will be recorded in case report forms in 
the OnCore® CTMS including Grade, attribution to one or both study drugs, other 
attribution(s), start/stop dates, and whether serious and/or unexpected.  For all events, 
the relationship to treatment and the intensity of the event will be determined by the 
investigator. This trial will use the NCI CTCAE v.4.03 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/) for 
assessment of toxicity and SAE reporting with regard to toxicity grade. Investigators 
should refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for sorafenib and 
nivolumab, including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected 
side effects of the study drugs.  
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 62 of 1067.4.1 AE and SAE definitions
7.4.1.1 Definition of adverse event (AE)
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant 
administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as 
an abnormal laboratory finding determined to be of clinical significance by the treating 
investigator or Study Chair), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used 
to assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE. 
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical 
history (e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints). Conditions that started before 
signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or treatment are present after 
signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity, are recorded as medical history 
(e.g. allergic rhinitis). Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed 
consent will be documented as AEs.
7.4.1.2 Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any AE that, at any dose, meets any of the following criteria:
1. Results in death.
2. Is life-threatening.
a. The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
a. A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as 
an SAE if at least one of the following exceptions is met:
b. The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours.
c. The admission is pre-planned. (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 63 of 106arranged prior to the start of the study)
d. The admission is not associated with an AE. (e.g., social hospitalization 
for purposes of respite care).
e. However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any 
hospitalization may fulfill the criterion of ‘medically important’ and as such 
may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, 
where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent 
definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
a. Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life’s functions.
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
6. Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity or infusion reaction to nivolumab.
7. Is another medically important serious event as judged by the investigator 
(defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the 
definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.) 
8. Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) 
via the study drug is an SAE. 
9. Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and 
cancer are not always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be 
handled as SAEs.
10.Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy 
should be reported as an SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due 
to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported).
7.4.2 Reporting of SAE to Bayer
All SAEs occurring from date of informed consent until 100 days after last dose of 
protocol therapy regardless of attribution should be reported to Bayer within 24 business 
hours/1 business day using a MedWatch Form 3500A (which can be accessed at

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 65 of 1067.4.4 SAE follow up reports
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 
business hours/1 business day to both Bayer (for patients enrolled to both Part 1 and 2) 
and BMS (for patients enrolled prior to protocol version 4.0 and not required after 
activation of protocol version 4.0) using the same procedures used for transmitting the 
initial SAE report.  All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. 
7.4.5 IND safety reporting
UCSF will report to the FDA all IND reportable events occurring in patients enrolled on 
this study (at UCSF or sub-site) using FDA Medwatch Form 3500A (which can be 
accessed at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ and in Appendix 14.9).  
Reportable events must meet the definition in Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32): 
1. Suspected adverse reaction (defined as a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational agent caused the adverse event)  
2. Unexpected (not listed in the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed)
3. Serious (as defined in Section 7.4.1.2)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted 
as an expedited IND safety report.  The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to 
FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after the Investigator determines that the 
suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).  Any 
unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA 
no later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 
CFR 312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety 
report will be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as 
soon as the information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)). 
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports will be submitted as 
required by FDA. 
The Study Chair or designee will cross reference this submission according to local 
regulations to the Bayer and/or BMS Investigational Compound Number (IND) at the 
time of submission, based upon investigator attribution of causality.  Additionally, Study 
Chair or designee will submit a copy of these reports to Bayer and BMS at the time of 
submission to FDA.
7.4.6 Expected adverse events
For this study, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the 
investigator’s brochure (IB) for each drug. Overview listings of frequent events that have 
occurred so far in the clinical development are shown in the current IBs.  If relevant new 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 66 of 106safety information is identified, the information will be integrated into an update of the 
corresponding IB and distributed to any participating site(s).
The expectedness of AEs and SAEs will be determined locally by the treating 
investigator and Study Chair or designee.  For reportable SAE, expectedness will also 
be assessed by Bayer and BMS according to the applicable reference document and 
according to all local regulations.
7.4.7 Pregnancies
The investigator must report to Bayer and BMS any pregnancy occurring in a study 
subject, or in his partner, during the subject’s participation in this study.  The report 
should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se 
is not considered an SAE.  
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and 
any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.
For the pregnancy of a study subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain 
similar information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.
For any reports of pregnancy occurring in study subject or WOCBP partner, a 
Medwatch form (Appendix 14.9) should be used for reporting as an SAE.
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
8.1 Analysis sets
8.1.1 DLT population (Part 1)
Subjects must receive 2 doses of nivolumab and at least 75% of sorafenib doses within 
28 days (1 cycle), or experience a qualifying DLT event (Section 6.2.3), to be evaluable 
for DLT.  Patients enrolled to Part 1 who are determined ineligible after enrollment 
and/or who are not evaluable for the endpoint of DLT will be replaced (see Section 
5.2.2). 
8.1.2 Safety population (Parts 1 and 2)
The safety population will include all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose 
each of sorafenib and nivolumab and have the potential to complete 1 cycle (28 days) of 
safety assessments.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity and safety assessment 
from the time of their first treatment with the investigational combination.  Patients who 
are determined ineligible after enrollment or who are not evaluable for safety (e.g. due 
to withdrawal of consent or discontinuation due to complications of HCC or underlying 
liver disease assessed as not related to tumor progression and not treatment-related

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 67 of 106toxicity before completing 1 cycle) will not be included in safety analyses (see Section 
5.2.2).
8.1.3 Efficacy population (Parts 1 and 2) 
The evaluable population for the secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR  will include all 
patients have received at least one complete cycle of therapy (4 weeks) and have had 
restaging imaging for response assessment (Section 7.3.5) or been removed for clinical 
progression.  Imaging to confirm progression should be obtained if possible. Patients 
who are determined ineligible after enrollment or who do not complete at least 1 cycle of 
therapy (4 weeks) and who do not have a qualifying progression event (radiographic or 
clinical) (e.g. due to withdrawal of consent or discontinuation due to complications of 
HCC or underlying liver disease assessed as not related to tumor progression and not 
treatment-related toxicity) will not be included in efficacy analyses (see Section 5.2.2).
8.2 Statistical and analytical plans
8.2.1 Primary endpoints
Primary and secondary endpoints will be measured in evaluable patients as defined in 
Section 8.1.  
8.2.1.1 Part 1: Dose Escalation Cohort primary endpoint
For Part 1, the primary endpoint of MTD will be determined according to Section 6.2.3.
8.2.1.2 Part 2: Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort primary endpoint
For Part 2: Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort, the primary endpoint is safety of the 
combination in patients with Child Pugh B liver function as measured by rate of grade 
≥3 AE (CTCAE v. 4.03) assessed as at least possibly related to sorafenib, nivolumab, or 
the combination of therapies. Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v.4.03 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/). Relationship to sorafenib, nivolumab, or combination will be 
adjudicated by the treating investigator and/or Study Chair. 
This is a pilot study. For Part 2, an acceptable rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AE 
would be ≤ 50% based upon rate of treatment-related grade ≥3  AE of 24.5% of Child 
Pugh B7-8 HCC patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate 040 Child Pugh B 
cohort,38 and 28% of Child Pugh B7-9 HCC patients treated with nivolumab in a 
retrospective institutional cohort,39  along with rates of grade 3-4 treatment-related AE of 
30-36% in Child Pugh B7-9 HCC in the GIDEON registry.40 
With an expected sample size of 12 patients with Child Pugh B7-9 HCC treated in Part 
2, the 95% confidence interval (CI) for determining the rate of grade ≥3 treatment-
related AE if the actual rate is 50% will be (0.22, 0.78).  If the actual rates are 30%, 40% 
or 60%, the 95% CI will be (0.07, 0.60), (0.14, 0.70) and (0.30, 0.86) respectively.

described along with 95% CI according to the sample size accrued at time of 
discontinuation (Table 8.2.1-1).

8.2.2 Secondary endpoints 
For secondary endpoints, due to the small sample size in this pilot study, descriptive 
statistics with mean and 95% confidence intervals will be used.  For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics will include the number of non-missing values, mean, 
standard deviation, median, min and maximum. For categorical variables, descriptive 
statistics will include counts and percentages per category. For comparison between 
subgroups, ANOVA and t-tests will be used when appropriate to determine the 
association of the efficacy endpoints and specific biomarkers.  
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 69 of 1068.2.2.1 Safety and tolerability
Safety events will be classified using NCI CTCAE v.4.03 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/).
Overall rates of AE and SAE will be summarized based on frequency and proportion of 
total subjects, by system organ class, preferred term, Grade, and investigator-assessed 
relationship to sorafenib, nivolumab, or the combination.  Dose reductions, dose delays, 
and discontinuations for toxicity will be summarized. 
8.2.2.2 Rate of irAE for combination overall and in Child Pugh B patients 
Safety events assessed by treating investigator and/or Study Chair as being at least 
possibly Immune-related on nivolumab (irAE) will be summarized based on frequency 
and proportion of total subjects, by system organ class and preferred term as for overall 
safety.  Rate of irAE in Child Pugh B patients in Part 2 will also be summarized.
8.2.2.3 ORR by RECIST 1.1 for overall study and in Parts 1 and 2 
individually
ORR is a key secondary endpoint and will be based on RECIST 1.15 as assessed by 
local radiographic review.  ORR will be analyzed for all efficacy-evaluable patients 
(Parts 1 and 2 combined) as well as for Part 1 and Part 2 individually. ORR defined as 
the proportion of subjects with RECIST 1.1-measurable disease at study entry (which is 
required for eligibility) who have a CR or partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 at any 
time during the main study.  Subjects with measurable disease at study entry who have 
unknown or missing response information will be treated as non-responders.  
The ORR of sorafenib was approximately 2% in SHARP trial,2 and the ORR of 
nivolumab as monotherapy was 10.2% in Child Pugh B7-8 patients treated with 
nivolumab in the Child Pugh B cohort of CheckMate 040.38 The ORR of nivolumab in 
Child Pugh A patients treated with nivolumab as 1st line therapy in CheckMate 459 was 
15%.45  Thus, an ORR of at least 15% for the combination of sorafenib plus nivolumab 
in this study would be an encouraging signal of efficacy, if accompanied by acceptable 
safety in Child Pugh B patients in Part 2 as defined above, and would warrant 
consideration of a larger study. 
For the overall study population, a sample size of 24 evaluable patients from Parts 1 
and 2 combined T will have 83% power with 1-sided alpha of 5% to determine true ORR 
>15%, using Chi-square tests with 1-sided alpha of 5%. 
8.2.2.4 Duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS for Child Pugh B 
Expansion Cohort and overall study population
In subjects who achieve PR or CR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented 
evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death.   
For all patients, PFS will be calculated in months from date of first dose of protocol 
therapy to date of first documented radiographic and/or clinical disease progression or 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 70 of 106death from any cause.  For patients discontinued from study for other reasons than 
progression or death (see Section 5.2), PFS will be censored at the date last known to 
be progression-free.  OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of protocol 
therapy to the date of death due to any cause. Censoring will be performed using the 
date of last known contact for those who are alive at the time of analysis.
Median DOR, median PFS and OS will be summarized overall and according to 
treatment group. Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles may be provided if data warrant.  
If data warrant, Kaplan-Meier quartile estimates along with the 95% CI will be 
calculated.  Descriptive summaries including swim lane plots may also be generated 
depending on results.
8.2.3 Exploratory endpoints
For exploratory endpoints, due to the small sample size in the study, descriptive 
statistics with mean and 95% confidence intervals will be used.  Depending on funding 
availability, we plan to explore immunologic and genomic biomarkers (including PBMC 
T cell subsets and TCR frequency and diversity, tumor immune subset composition and 
immune infiltrates) for relationships to clinical features including etiology of liver disease, 
baseline liver function, and to the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. No type I 
error will be adjusted for multiple endpoints. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics will include the number of non-missing values, mean, standard deviation, 
median, min and maximum. For categorical variables, descriptive statistics will include 
counts and percentages per category. For comparison between subgroups, ANOVA 
and t-tests will be used when appropriate to determine the association of the efficacy 
endpoints and the specific biomarkers. For association between biomarkers, Spearman 
correlations will be calculated to determine the significance of the association between 
the biomarkers of interest.  A selection of planned analyses is described further below.
8.2.3.1 PBMC immune cell subset frequencies and relationship to treatment 
and clinical outcomes
Serial blood samples for PBMC analyses will be collected at time points in Section 7.1, 
Schedule of procedures.  Immune cell subsets will be measured using flow cytometry as 
has been previously described, or similar updated methods.29,30  PBMC analyses for all 
patients will be performed in the UCSF CIL.
Baseline levels of individual PBMC T cell and other immune cell subset components as 
well as change in levels on combination treatment will be explored for relationship with 
ORR, baseline liver function, as well as secondary efficacy endpoints (including PFS, 
DOR, OS) to determine if there is an association using Fisher’s Exact tests.  
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 71 of 1068.2.3.2 PBMC T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype frequency and diversity and 
relationship to treatment and clinical outcomes 
If funds are available, the frequency of individual TCR clonotypes and the diversity of 
overall TCR clonotype repertoire from PBMC samples will be measured by next-
generation sequencing as has been previously described or by a similar, updated 
methodology.31  PBMC analyses for patients enrolled at UCSF will be performed in 
UCSF CIL.
The frequency of TCR clonotypes with identical sequences31 will be calculated by 
dividing the number of identical sequence reads by the total number of sequencing 
reads for that sample.  TCR repertoire diversity will be calculated as the number of 
unique clonotypes comprising the top 25% of cumulative reads sorted by abundance.31  
Baseline frequency and diversity as well as changes on combination treatment will be 
explored for relationship with ORR, baseline liver function, as well as secondary efficacy 
endpoints using Fisher’s Exact tests. 
PBMC TCR clonotype diversity/frequency will also be described at baseline and after 
starting combination therapy in Part 2 to characterize the time course of these effects 
and to better understand the relative impact of each study drug.
8.2.3.3 Tumor immune infiltrates, T cell subsets, and TCR profiling
The presence and composition of tumor immune infiltrates including T cell subsets in 
pretreatment archival tumor sample will be explored for relationship with ORR, baseline 
liver function, as well as secondary efficacy endpoints (including PFS, DOR, OS, AFP 
response) and with tumor PD-L1 status by IHC to determine if there is a relationship 
using Fisher’s Exact tests.  Descriptive comparisons between primary and metastatic 
site samples and according to tumor location (e.g. liver vs. non-liver) or etiology (e.g. 
viral vs. nonviral), will be performed between subsets in the overall study depending on 
sample availability.  TCR frequency and diversity may be analyzed depending on 
sample adequacy.
 
Any leftover archival material from any other tumor samples obtained on treatment or 
post-treatment for diagnostic purposes (e.g. if patient is determined to require palliative 
resection or need a biopsy to confirm progression) may be accessioned and analyzed 
for immune infiltration, T cell subsets, and TCR profile depending on quantity of 
evaluable tumor tissue available.
Tumor tissue immune cell profiling and TCR analyses will be performed in UCSF CIL 
depending on funding adequacy.
8.2.3.4 Tumor and immune cell PD-L1 expression
Tumor and immune cell PD-L1 expression will be tested in batch after completion of 
enrollment. The proportion of subjects with archival tumor samples positive for PD-L1 or 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 72 of 106PD-L1 and CD-45 expression by IHC will be reported along with 95% CI.  For subjects 
with more than one tumor sample available for testing, designation as positive for PD-L1 
expression will be based upon ≥1 positive sample.  Concordance and rates of positivity 
between primary and metastatic site, tumor location (e.g. liver vs. non-liver), etiology 
(e.g. viral vs. nonviral), and pre-treatment,  , and post-treatment samples (if available) 
will be described individually due to expectation of small subset/paired sample sizes.  
PD-L1 expression status in tumor and immune cells will be explored for association with 
ORR, PFS, and OS.
Tumor and IC PD-L1/CD45 analyses will be performed in UCSF CIL or other laboratory 
approved by Study Chair dependent upon funding and sample availability.
8.2.3.5 AFP response
Among patients with baseline AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL, baseline AFP levels (using various cut 
points from literature) will be explored for association with ORR, PFS, and OS using 
Fisher’s Exact tests or by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.  Changes in levels on therapy will 
be measured as an increase by ≥  20% and ≥ 50% from baseline, stable value within 
20% and 50% of baseline, or decrease by ≥ 20% and ≥ 50% from baseline.  The 
changes in level will be used to evaluate the predictive value for ORR, PFS, or OS.  
8.3 Planned interim analyses
8.3.1 Part 1: Dose Escalation Cohort DLT analyses
In Part 1, a standard 3+3 design for dose escalation and expansion decisions will be 
used as described above. 
8.4 Determination of sample size
The total sample size will be 6-24 patients for Parts 1 and 2 combined. 
8.4.1 Part 1: Dose Escalation Cohort sample size
It is estimated that 6-12 patients will be enrolled to Part 1 following 3+3 dose escalation 
rules in Section 6.2.2.  
8.4.2 Part 2: Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort sample size
The Part 2 expected evaluable sample size is n=12 patients.

monitoring entity for this study.  The UCSF DSMC will monitor the study in accordance 
with the NCI-approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for multi-center trials 
(Appendix 14.11).  The DSMC will routinely review all adverse events and suspected 
adverse reactions considered “serious”.  The DSMC will audit study-related activities to 
ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard 
operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Significant 
results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate 
regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as 
applicable.  See Appendix 14.11, Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for additional 
information.
9.8 Multicenter communication
The UCSF Coordinating Center provides administration, data management, and organizational 
support for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial.  The UCSF 
Coordinating Center will also coordinate, at weekly conference calls with the participating sites 
for Phase I dose escalation studies prior to each cohort escalation and at the completion of 
each cohort or more frequently as needed to discuss risk assessment.  The following issues will 
be discussed as appropriate:
Enrollment information 
Cohort updates (i.e. DLTs) and enrollment status
Adverse events (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse 
events and new safety information)
Protocol violations
Other issues affecting the conduct of the study
9.9 Record keeping and record retention
The Principal Investigator is required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of 
the drug, including dates, quantity, and use by subjects, as well as written records of the 
disposition of the drug when the study ends.  The Principal Investigator is required to 
prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories that record all observations 
and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual administered the 
investigational drug or employed as a control in the investigation. Case histories include 
the case report forms and supporting data including, for example, signed and dated 
consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the 
physician, the individual's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes. The case history for 
each individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation 
in the study.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 77 of 1069.12 Audit and inspection
Inspections by regulatory health authority representatives i.e. FDA and IEC(s)/IRB(s) 
are possible.  The investigator should notify Bayer and BMS immediately of any such 
inspection.
10. Protection of Human Subjects 
10.1 Protection from Unnecessary Harm 
Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all participants involved in human 
experimentation. This is accomplished through the IRB mechanism and the process of 
informed consent. The IRB reviews all proposed studies involving human 
experimentation and ensures that the participant’s rights and welfare are protected and 
that the potential benefits and/or the importance of the knowledge to be gained 
outweigh the risks to the individual. The IRB also reviews the informed consent 
document associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent document 
accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its 
associated risks and benefits. 
10.2 Protection of Privacy
Participants will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information 
generated from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this 
discussion, they will be asked to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. 
The original signed document will become part of the participant’s medical records, and 
each participant will receive a copy of the signed document. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the informed 
consent document.
11. Premature termination of the study
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at any time for reasons such as 
listed below.
If risk-benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
-Safety findings from this study (e.g. SAEs)
-Results of any interim analysis
-Results of parallel clinical studies
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 78 of 106-Results of parallel animal studies 
(on e.g. toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity).
If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop-out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable 
time frame.
For any of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.
All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; 
head of study center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
In case of a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study 
follow-up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.3.
12. Ethical and legal aspects
12.1 Ethical and legal conduct of the study
The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the investigator abide by Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and under the guiding principles detailed in the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keeping with applicable 
local law(s) and regulation(s).
Documented approval from appropriate IEC(s)/IRBs will be obtained for all participating 
centers before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regulations and 
organizations.  When necessary, an extension, amendment or renewal of the EC/IRB 
approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Bayer.
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects 
of study conduct; the investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in

signed and dated form. The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the 
investigator site file or, if locally required, in the patient’s note/file of the medical 
institution.
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects or 
legal representatives or proxy consenters will be revised whenever important new 
information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is 
an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject 
information and / or the written informed consent form.  The investigator will inform the 
subject or legal representative or proxy consenter of changes in a timely manner and 
will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study by signing the revised 
informed consent form.  Any revised written informed consent form and written 
information must receive the IRB’s approval in advance of use.
12.3 Publication policy
The Principal Investigator will ensure that the information regarding the study be publicly 
available on the internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
12.4 Confidentiality
All records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by 
the applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available.

The following algorithms from Nivolumab IB (v.15.0) represent clinical guidance to the 
treating investigator for management of selected irAE which have been associated with 
nivolumab.  Additional management including optimal supportive care should be 
employed in all cases as clinically appropriate, according to clinical judgment of treating 
investigator. Subspecialty consultation for additional management recommendations 
should be obtained whenever needed, e.g. for severe or refractory cases, at discretion 
of treating investigator.
Endocrine irAE*
*For cases with new onset diabetes mellitus, the role for steroid therapy is unknown and 
consultation with Endocrinologist is strongly recommended.  For symptomatic diabetes, 
nivolumab should be withheld, and insulin replacement should be initiated as needed. 
Monitoring of blood sugar should continue to ensure appropriate insulin replacement is

Subjects with advanced HCC generally have underlying cirrhosis with decreased 
hepatic function, thus this protocol allows inclusion of patients with AST or ALT 
elevations within the CTCAE Grade 2 range. The protocol-specific approach for the 
management of hepatic events in this population with baseline hepatic dysfunction is as 
follows:
1. If AST or ALT levels do not improve with a dose delay of 3-5 days or if the levels 
worsen, initiate steroid therapy at 0.5-2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral 
equivalent.
2. Check for alternate causes of elevated AST or ALT including test HBV or HCV 
viral load as applicable, discontinue any new medications or supplements, and 
consider imaging for tumor progression and/or vascular involvement.
3. For ALT or AST levels > 8x ULN, initiate steroid therapy promptly at 1-2 
mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent.
4. For all subjects initiating steroids, Hepatology/Gastroenterology consult is 
recommended if any evidence associated hepatic decompensation (e.g. new 
ascites, encephalopathy, or elevated INR).
5. If AST or ALT levels do not improve within 3-5 days or the levels worsen after the 
start of steroid therapy, it is recommended to contact Study Chair and consider 
adding mycophenolate mofetil at 1 g BID.
6. Tapering of steroids can start once AST or ALT levels have declined by 1 
CTCAE grade.
7. Taper steroids slowly over no less than 1 month.
As outlined in Section 6.7.2.1, nivolumab therapy may resume when AST or ALT have 
returned to near baseline unless the criteria for permanent discontinuation are reached.

Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 102 of 106APPENDIX 11: UCSF Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for 
Multicenter Institutional Study 
Oversight and Monitoring Plan
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and participant safety 
for all HDFCCC institutional clinical trials and cancer-specific trials at UCSF.  A summary of 
DSMC activities for this trial includes:  
 
Participant monitoring prior to dose escalation. 
Review of participant data in each cohort 
Approval of dose escalation by DSMC Chair or Vice Chair 
Review of serious adverse events 
Minimum of biennial regulatory auditing 
 
2. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines 
 
The Principal Investigator at the UCSF Coordinating Center will hold the role of Study Chair.  
The Study Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the trial and for monitoring its safety 
and progress at all participating sites.  The Study Chair will conduct continuous review of data 
and participant safety at weekly UCSF Site Committee meetings.  The discussions are 
documented in the UCSF Site Committee meeting minutes.  
The UCSF HDFCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for 
participant safety for all domestic sites for HDFCCC Multicenter and Consortium institutional 
clinical trials.  The International sites must be monitored by a Clinical Research Organization 
(CRO) that is formally approved by the HDFCCC Cancer Center Clinical Research Oncology 
Committee (CCCROC) and the HDFCCC DSMC via the HDFCCC Policy of Minimum Standards 
for Partnership with International CROs. 
All multicenter phase I dose escalation trials are monitored prior to the requested dose 
escalation of the dosing cohort. All participants are monitored through the Dose Limiting Cohort 
until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined.  Once the MTD is determined, then the 
trial is audited on an annual basis with twenty percent of the participants enrolled in this 
expansion cohort that are audited through their first five cycles of treatment. Scheduled auditing 
of participant source documents is complete after all files have been reviewed for five cycles of 
treatment (20% of participants). For Phase I high risk therapeutic trials that are not dose finding, 
all participants are monitored on a quarterly basis (depending on accrual) through the first cycle 
of therapy.    
DSMC Monitor/Auditors will send a follow-up report to the study team within 20 business days 
after the monitoring visit is complete for the PI and the study team to resolve all action items 
from this report within 20 business days.  An abbreviated regulatory review (i.e., reviewing 
protocol and consent versions, SAEs, PVs, DOA logs, 1572 forms, etc.) will occur at each 
participant monitoring review; however, a full regulatory review will occur on a biennially basis 
by the DSMC for regulatory compliance. 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 103 of 106 
Monitoring of enrolled participants in the dose expansion portion of the trial will be complete 
after 20% of enrolled participants have been monitored through two cycles of treatment.  
However, regulatory reviews of the trial, safety reviews (i.e., Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
reviews and Protocol Violation (PV) reviews), as well as audit/inspection preparation (as 
applicable) will continue until the trial is closed by the IRB.  
Multicenter communication 
The UCSF Coordinating Center includes the UCSF PI (Study Chair) and the UCSF study team. 
The UCSF Coordinating Center and provides administration, data management, and 
organizational support for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial.  The 
UCSF Coordinating Center will also coordinate monthly conference calls with the participating 
sites.  The following issues will be discussed as appropriate: 
Enrollment information. 
Cohort updates (i.e., DLTs). 
Adverse events (i.e., new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events 
and new safety information). 
Protocol violations. 
Other issues affecting the conduct of the study. 
 
Dose Level Considerations 
The PI/Study Chair, participating investigators, and research coordinators from each site will 
review enrollment for each dose level cohort during the regularly scheduled conference calls.  
The dose level for ongoing enrollment will be confirmed for each participant scheduled to be 
enrolled at a site.  Dose level assignments for any participant scheduled to begin treatment 
must be confirmed by the UCSF Coordinating Center via email. 
If a participant experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), the UCSF Coordinating Center will 
notify all sites within one business day of awareness.  If the DLT occurs at a participating site, 
the local investigator must report the DLT to the UCSF Coordinating Center within one business 
day.  The Study Chair has one business day (after first becoming aware of the event at either 
the UCSF Coordinating Center or the participating site) in which to report the DLT information to 
all participating sites.   
Adverse events reporting to the DSMC will include reports from both the UCSF Coordinating 
Center, as well as the participating sites.  The DSMC will be responsible for monitoring all data 
entered in OnCore® at the UCSF Coordinating Center and the participating sites as per the 
study-specific guidelines.  The data (i.e., redacted copies of source documents) from the 
participating sites will be downloaded into the PC console of OnCore prior to the monitoring 
visits or the DSMC will be provided with access to the participating site’s electronic medical 
record (EMR) access in order for the DSMC to perform remote monitoring of the participating 
site’s compliance with the protocol and applicable FDA regulations 
 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 104 of 106Dose Escalations 
At the time of dose escalation, a written and signed Dose Escalation Report will be submitted to 
the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and DSMC Director describing the cohorts, dose levels, 
adverse events, safety reports, and any Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) observed, in 
accordance with the protocol.  The report will be reviewed by the DSMC Chair or Vice Chair and 
written authorization to proceed or a request for more information will be issued within two 
business days of the request.  The report is then reviewed at the subsequent DSMC Committee 
meeting.  In the event that the committee does not concur with the DSMC Chair’s (or Vice 
Chair’s decision, study accrual is held while further investigation takes place.   
 
3. Review and Oversight Requirements  
3.1 Adverse Event Monitoring  
All clinically significant adverse events (AEs), whether or not considered to be expected or 
unexpected and whether or not considered to be associated with the use of study drug, will be 
entered into OnCore, UCSF’s Clinical Trial Management System.   
Adverse events are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) as developed and revised by the Common Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the 
National Cancer Institute.  Adverse events are further given an assignment of attribution or 
relationship to investigational agent or study procedure.  Attribution categories are: 
Definite – clearly related to the investigational agent(s) or study procedure. 
Probable – likely related to the investigational agent(s) or study procedure. 
Possible – may be related to the investigational agent(s) or study procedure. 
Unrelated – clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or study procedure. 
 
All adverse events entered into OnCore will be reviewed on a weekly basis at the UCSF 
Coordinating Center’s Site Committee meetings.  The UCSF Site Committee will review and 
discuss the selected toxicity, grade, and the attribution assignment for the adverse events that 
occurred at both the UCSF Coordinating Center and the participating sites. 
3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
By definition, an adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE) according  to the 
following criteria: 
  
•Death, 
•Life-threatening adverse experience*, 
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
Congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or 
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03/09/2022 Protocol CC#: 174523
Pilot – sorafenib, nivolumab Page 105 of 106•Any other experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side 
effect or precaution that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above, 
•Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of the study.  
* A life-threatening adverse experience is any AE that places the patient or subject, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Serious adverse event reporting will be in accordance with all IRB regulations. For trials 
conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, the SAE will be reported in 
accordance with Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312.32 and will be reported on a Med 
Watch form. 
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events: 
https://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event 
Med Watch forms and information:  
www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm 
All serious adverse events are entered into OnCore, as well as submitted to the IRB (per IRB 
guidelines).  All SAEs, whether expected or unexpected, must be reported to the UCSF 
Coordinating Center within 10 business days of becoming aware of the event or during the next 
scheduled conference all, whichever is sooner.  The SAEs are reviewed and monitored by the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on an ongoing basis and discussed at DSMC meetings, 
which take place every six weeks.  The date the SAE was sent to all required reporting agencies 
will be documented in OnCore.  
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration of the study drug(s) and is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely 
related either to the investigational drug or any research related procedure, the Study Chair at 
the UCSF Coordinating Center or the assigned designee must be notified within 1 business day 
from the participating site(s) and the Study Chair must then notify the DSMC Chair (or Vice 
Chair) and the DSMC Director within one business day of this notification.   
3.3 Review of Adverse Event Rates 
If an increase in the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (above the rate reported in the 
Investigator Brochure or package insert) is noted in the study, the Study Chair at the UCSF 
Coordinating Center is responsible for notifying the DSMC at the time the increased rate is 
identified via a report.  The report will indicate if the incidence of adverse events observed in the 
study is above the range stated in the Investigator’s Brochure or package insert. 
If at any time the Study Chair voluntarily holds enrollment or stops the study due to safety 
issues, the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DSMC Director must be notified within one 
business day via e-mail and the IRB must be notified their reporting requirements. 
3.4   Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Reports

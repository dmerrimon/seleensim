Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  1.0 Background  
1.1 Rationale for selected approach  
The third -generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole, 
all play a major role in the adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with early stage 
estrogen receptor α (ERα) -positive breast cancer1,2. The assumption is that for all three  
AIs the mechanism of action in inhibiting tumor growth is only through decreasing 
estrogen production from androgenic precursors, by inhibiting aromatase3, which is 
encoded by the CYP19A1 gene4-6. Whereas all three AIs are potent in terms of inhibition 
of in vivo  aromatization7-9, letrozole has been found to be the most potent10. However, 
large phase III adjuvant clinical trials do not indicate any difference in efficacy between the three AIs. Specifically, the MA.27 trial showed no significant difference between anastrozole and exemestane
11 in terms of DFS, a nd the FACE trial showed no difference 
between anastrozole and letrozole in terms of both DFS and OS12. 
We previously performed a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in 649 patients 
receiving anastrozole adjuvant therapy13 that showed 21% and 30%, respectively, had 
estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) concentrations above the lower limit of quantitation 
(LLQ) , with a broad range of detectable concentrations. 
Until recently there were no clinical studies which  systematically tested whether the 
degree of estrogen suppression is associated with AI efficacy in early stage ERα -positive 
breast cancer. To address this unmet need, matched case- control studies14 were performed 
utilizing data from the MA.27 and PreFace trials. MA.27 enrolled postmenopausal 
women with resected stage I -III ERα -positive breast cancer who were randomized to 
either anastrozole or exemestane for five  years. PreFace evaluated adjuvant letrozole in a 
single -arm phase IV trial. A breast event was considered to be any of the following: 
local -regional breast cancer recurrence [including ipsilateral DCIS], distant breast cancer 
recurrence, contralateral breast cancer [invasive or DCIS] , or death with or from breast 
cancer without prior recurrence.  
Due to the lack of an independent validation cohort, a bootstrap re-sampling approach 
was undertaken to determine ‘best’ cut points for the biomarkers, E1 and E2. 
Specifically, 500 bootstrap samples were constructed by sampling with replacement 
using 222 matched case -control sets from the 247 matched case -control sets. The set of 
potential cut -points assessed for each biomarker included values from its lower limit of 
quantification to its 85th percentile value (across all women). The ‘best’ cut point for a 
given biomarker was chosen using the maximum concordance approach of Liu.15 
Specifically, for each potential cut point y i, an indicator variable x i was constructed where 
xi=1 if the patient’s biomarker value was at or above y i; xi=0 otherwise. Then, for each 
bootstrap sample, j,  and each cut point, i, a concordance statistic C ij was generated from 
fitting a stratified Cox model with case- control set as the strata, time set to the constant of 
1, and the indicator variable for the cut point was fit to the data.16 The cut point where the 
maximum value of the concordance statistic, max C j, occurred was determined for each 
bootstrap sample j. The cut point most often found to be the max C j cut point across the 
500 samples was chosen for further evaluation. Having established cut points for E1 and E2, multivariate conditional logistic regression modeling using all 247 matched pairs was 
used to refine the model of risk. A secondary exploratory analysis was carried out using 
the refined model to obtain an estimate of the odds of EBCE for each treatment cohort separately. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.4 and the survConcordance() 
function in the survival package of R software. 
MC1931 6 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  The pre-AI E1 and E2 concentrations were similar among the 3 treatment cohorts , and 
were highly correlated within each treatment cohort with Spearman rank coefficients (ρ) 
of 0.84 for anastrozole; 0.89 for exemestane; and 0.90 for letrozole. After six months of 
AI therapy, E1 and E2 concentrations were below the LLQ in 41.3% and 11.9%, 
respectively, for anastrozole; 63.7% and 35.4%, respectively, for exemestane,  and 79.3 % 
and 48.7%, respectively, for letrozole . The correlation between E1 and E2 concentrations 
after six months of AI therapy was moderate for anastrozole (ρ= 0.54) and exemestane 
(ρ=0.52) but weak for letrozole (ρ= 0.15) . There was a very weak correlation between 
both E1 and E2 with AI concentrations after 6 months of treatment (ρ= -0.20 and -0.12 for 
anastrozole; - 0.18 and -0.12 for exemestane , and -0.11 and -0.09 for letrozole, 
respectively) . Six-month plasma concentrations of each of the AIs showed substantial 
inter-patient variability . 
1.2 Estrone and Estradiol Suppression and Risk of an Early Breast Cancer Event  
A potential cut point for E1  after six months of treatment  was searched for between its 
lower limit of quantification (1.0 pg/mL) and the 85th percentile  value of its distribution 
(1.7 pg/mL) . For each cut point, a stratified Cox model was fit to the first of 500 
bootstrap samples, and an estimate of the odds of EBCE and the concordance statistic 
was determined. This process was repeated fo r the remaining 499 bootstrap samples. 
From the 500 estimates of the odds ratio for a given cut point, the median and 2.5th and 
97.5th percentile value of its distribution was determined and presented in Figure 1 for E1 
and in Figure 2 for E2. The value of E1 most often having the maximum concordance 
value was 1.3 pg/mL and as such is the threshold for E1 (Figure 1). The process was 
repeated for E2 searching between the lower limit of quantification (0.3 pg/mL) and 85th 
percentile  value of its pre -treatment distribution (0.7 pg/mL) . The value of E2 most often 
having the maximum concordance value among the 500 bootstrap samples was 0.5pg/mL 
(Figure 2) .  
Using  the cut point values identified for E1 and E2, multivariate conditional logistic 
modeling was used to assess whether or not the risk of EBCE differed with respect to 
whether E1 and  E2 remain at or above its threshold after 6 months of treatment. Patients 
with E1 ≥1.3 pg/mL and E2 ≥0.5 pg/mL were found to have  a 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.42-
3.47) increase in risk of an EBCE relative to patients with E1, E2, or both below these 
thresholds. 
The question as to whether this relationship holds for each treatment group was 
determined . The risk of an EBCE was increased 3.0 fold (sets=91: 95% CI: 1.56-5.76, 
p=0.001) for those with E1 and E2 values at or above their threshold after 6 months of anastrozole ; but not  in those treated with exemestane (sets=9 5: 95% OR=1.66; CI: 
0.82- 3.33, p=0.16) or letrozole ( sets= 59: 95% OR=1.62; CI: 0.39- 6.82, p=0.51).  
In the case of anastrozole, a n odds ratio of three  means that a patient with an E2 and E1 at 
or above the thresholds had a three- fold risk of recurrence compared with a patient with 
the same matching factors (in this case: age, disease stage, BMI category, and adjuvant 
chemotherapy status) who had an E2 or E1 below the threshold.

Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  1.3 Preclinical laboratory studies supporting a difference between anastrozole and 
exemestane and letrozole  
Our preclinical data indicated  that anastrozole, but not letrozole or exemestane, behaved 
in a fashion similar to E2. Anastrozole could activate ERα -dependent transcription 
(Figure 3), but the effect decreased with increasing concentrations. Additionally, in the 
presence of 100 nM anastrozole, we also observed time- dependent ERα degradation. 
Given that these data indicated that anastrozole but not exemestane or letrozole, had a 
mechanism of action in addition to inhibition of aromatase, and was a ligand for ERα, we 
performed radioligand binding assays (Figure 4 ), surface plasmon resonance (Figure 5), 
and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Figure 6) that confirmed that, indeed anastrozole 
was a ligand for ERα.

We then tested the effect of anastrozole on cell proliferation in the presence of estrogen 
levels below, at, and above the thresholds identified in the clinical studies described 
above. In vitro, E1 and E2 below 1.3 pg/mL and 0.5 pg/mL, respectively, had little effect 
on CYP19A1 KO T47D cell proliferation. Anastrozole, but neither letrozole nor 
exemestane, potentiated estrogen effects on cell proliferation when estrogen levels were 
above the thresholds, compared to estrogen alone, especially when both E1 and E2 were 
above the thresholds (Figure 7 A-C). Anastrozole, but neither letrozole nor exemestane, 
potentiated estrogen- induced ERE luciferase activity when estrogen levels were above 
the thresholds (Figure 7 D-F).These phenomena were also observed in an MCF7 cell line.

of 3 independent experiments. **p<0.01.  
 
1.4 Trial Design  
To evaluate the clinical impact of these findings, this  clinical  trial is designed to evaluate 
anastrozole in the adjuvant setting for patients with early stage ERα -positive breast 
cancer. Specifically , E1 and E2 levels will be assessed in patient s who receive standard 
dose adjuvant anastrozole (1mg once daily). For patients who have  inadequate 
suppression of E1 and E2 after 2 months of treatment,  with levels above the thresholds of 
1.3 pg/ml and 0.5 pg/ml respectively, the dose of anastrozole will be escalated to 10 mg 
once daily . E1 and E2 levels will be re- assessed after 2 months of treatment  on 10 mg of 
anastrozole. E1 and E 2 will be measured by a CLIA -approved liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in the Immunochemical Core Laboratory at Mayo Clinic. Details of the methodology have been published
17-19. In addition, 
anastrozole and letrozole concentrations will be measured by Zeruesenay Desta, PhD, at Indiana University, a long- time collaborator , who has performed these assays in past 
studies
20. The main purpose of performing the AI assays is to ensure that the patients are 
taking the drug, but we are also interested in the steady state concentrations of 
anastrozole in the women who take the 10 mg daily dose. 
The 10 mg dose of anastrozole has been previously compared with standard 1 mg dosing 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer21. There was no difference in clinical efficacy 
and toxiciti es were comparable. Regarding the cost of anastrozole therapy, the 1 mg dose 

MC1931 11 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  costs about $2/day and the 10 mg dose costs roughly $20/day, which translates to 
$60/month and $600/month, respectively. For patients who receive anastrozole at 10 mg 
per day for 8 -10 weeks, patients will be advised to take letrozole, an FDA-approved 
agent, to complete their course of adjuvant endocrine therapy. After 8 -10 weeks of 
letrozole, patients will have blood samples obtained for E1, E2, and letrozole 
concentrations. The rationale for this approach is that further research will be required before it is known if continuing anastrozole at 10 mg per day will provide long term 
benefit to patients.  
1.41 Safety Run- in 
At the request of the FDA, re -registration to the ANA10 treatment portion of the 
trial will be initially limited to a maximum of 6 patients. After 6 patients have re -
registered, enrollment will temporarily halt. If  two or more of the se 6 patients 
develop a DLT (as specified in Section 7.0 of the protocol) within 28-35 days of 
starting ANA10, the study will remain closed to enrollment to allow the study 
team to review toxicity data thoroughly and make decisions regarding changes to 
the protocol. If at most one of these 6 patients develops a DLT  within 28 -35 days 
of starting ANA10, the FDA will be notified and re -registration  will be reopen ed. 
1.42 Adjustments to Eligibility in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and late 2020 surge in cases , some patients have 
experienced delays in their surgical procedures and have been started on endocrine therapy preoperatively to bridge to the operating room. Typically the 
time on treamtment is several weeks or up to 4 months. In response to this, the 
protocol has been amended to adapt to these circumstances, and allow patients who have received preoperative endocrine therapy to participate. Specifically, the 
half- life of anastrozole and letrozole is approximately 50 hours and exemestane 
is 24 hours; as such, these agents are cleared from the system after 5 half-lives. To this end, patients who received preoperative endocrine therapy with an 
aromatase inhibitor can participate if they have been off treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to registration. This will allow adequate elimination of the drug and 
baseline steady -state prior to study participation. Tamoxifen is much less 
commonly used in postmenopausal women as preoperative therapy. Due to its longer half- life of 5 -7 days, patients who received preoperative tamoxifen can 
participate if they have been off treatment for at least 12 weeks prior to registration .  
In alignment with these changes, prior receipt of an aromatase inhibitor or SERM 
(tamoxifen or raloxifene) for the prevention of breast cancer is allowed. In this 
setting, given these agents are typically administered for up to 5 years, a longer 
wash out of 6 months  is preferre d.  
Additionally, there have been delays for post-operative Medical Oncology consultation; as such, the requirement to complete all cancer treatment within 60 
days prior to  registration has been removed. Specifically, patients must have 
completed treatment, but any time between that and registration is permissible .

A research blood sample must be drawn at baseline prior to treatment or patient is unevaluable and must be replaced. 
All patients will be prescribed the FDA -appr oved dose of anastrozole at 1mg 
daily (standard adjuvant dose) for the fi rst 8-10 weeks.  
At the end of the first cycle, blood will be drawn for drug levels and E1 and E2 
levels.  
Patients  should be encouraged to take their anastrozole in the morning each day 
EXCEPT the day of the blood draw when they should take their anastrozole after 
this sample has been drawn.  
7.32 Blood draw at end of cycle 
Patients will have blood drawn for estrone and estradiol concentrations and all samples for the week will be batched for processing in the Immunochemical Core Laboratory the following Monday. 

MC1931 20 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  Results will be reported the following day (usually Tuesday).  
Patients who do not meet the following criteria will be given a recommendation 
for 5  years of anastrozole and go off study. 
E1≥1.3 pg/ml  
AND  
E2≥0.5 pg/ml  
Patients whose estrogen levels meet these criteria and are willing to continue will 
proceed to Cycle 2.

Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. 
Expedited Reporting  
Events reported to sponsor within 24 hours, 5 days or 10 days of study team becoming aware 
of the event.  
Routine Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor via case report forms 
Events of Interest  
Events that would not typically be considered to meet the criteria for expedited reporting, but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by the FDA or the sponsor).  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 5.0. 
b.
 Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.  
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 

MC1931 27 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure  
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agent(s) and Commercial Agent(s) on 
SEPARATE Arms  
• An AE that occurs on an arm using an investigational agent /intervention under an 
IND must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines for investigational agents.  
• An AE that occurs on an arm using a commercial agent on a separate treatment arm 
must be assessed as specified in the protocol . (Refer to the Commercial  Reporting 
Table in Section 10.4) .  
Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch  3500A  
10.32
 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to Expedited 
R
eporting 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur 
within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These events must still be reported via Routine Reporting (see Section 10.6).*  
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected 
adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or 
investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected 
as an expedited event.  
*Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be reported 
expeditiously by investigators ONLY if they exceed the expected grade of the 
event.

NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:  
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).
 
MC1931 29 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the sponsor within

MC1931 30 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  10.5 Other Required Reporting  
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS)  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS) in 
general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs.  
Note: If there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pregnant/impregnate others, then any pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 
reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the 
study should be reported as a UPIRTSO. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions:  
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPIRTSO, provide the appropriate documentation and use the Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center Expedited Event Report form 
 
h
e Mayo Cli nic Compliance  Unit  will 
review and process the submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB a nd work with the 
IND Coordinator for submission to FDA. 
10.52 Death 
N
ote: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited reporting within 24-
hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND  requires expedited 
reporting within 24- hours. 

MC1931 31 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the 
first 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease  that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE 
term associated with Grade 5  should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease  
progression ” under the system organ class (SOC) of General disorders 
and administration site conditions . Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
10.53 Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
10.55 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
If a female subject (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female should be advised to call her healthcare provider 
immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow- up as deemed necessary 
by her physician. If the baby is born with a birth defect or anomaly, a second expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information about a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
MC1931 32 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  form will need to be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient.  
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this form: 
10.551
 Pregnancy 
P
regnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is 
known. 
10.552 Fetal Death  
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by death in utero; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respiration, heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
Fetal loss at any gestational age should be reported expeditiously, as 
Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss ” under the SOC of “Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions ”” under the Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. 
10.553 Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn death occurring during the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by the investigator to be 
at least possibly due to the investigational agent/intervention.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “Death 
neonatal ” under the SOC of General disorders and administration  
site conditions.

kground and Methodology  
14.41 Estrone and estradiol assays 
Pre- and post- AI treatment E1 and E2 levels will be measured by CLIA -approved 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assays in 
the Immunochemical Core Laboratory at Mayo Clinic. Details of the 
methodology have been published.13,22 The assay involves liquid extraction of 0.5 
ML sample (plasma or serum depending on study) with methylene chloride 

MC1931 39 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  followed by derivatization with dansyl chloride, separation  using a two –
dimensional ultra-performance liquid chromatography system and analysis on an 
Agilent 6490 mass s pectrometer using elec trospray ionization on a positive 
mode. The combination of derivatization and two-dimensional chromatography 
(separation on two columns [Loading: Agilent Zorbax XDB-C18: 2.1 × 30 mm 
3.5 micron; Analytical: Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18: 2.1 × 50 mm 2.7 
micron]) afforded improved sensitivity and precision. Intra -assay CVs for E1 are 
17.8%, 7.5%, and 6.1% at 0.30, 0.50, and 0.84 pg/mL, respectively. Intra- assay 
coefficients of variation (CV) for E2 are 11.8%, 7.3%, and 6.0% at 0.25, 0.51, 
and 0.85 pg/mL, respectively. Inter -assay CVs for E2 are 10.8%, 8.5%, and 6.9% 
at 0.29, 0.50, and 0.77 pg/mL, respectively. 
14.42 Aromatase Inhibitor Assays 
14.421 Quantification of drugs and metabolites 
Anastrozole and letrozole and relevant metabolites will be measured in the laboratory of Zeruesenay Desta, Ph.D., at Indiana University 
School of Medicine, using liquid chromatography- tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assays. All chemicals (anastrozole and 
letrozole) and internal standards ( anastrozole and letrozole)  will be 
purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, 
Canada).
 LC-MS/MS grade water, methanol, acetonitrile, and 
formic acid were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Although relevant metabolites of anastrozole may be measured, 
these metabolites are pharmacologically  inactive  and their  
concentrations  are much  lower  than the parent compounds.  
14.422 Sample preparation  
Plasma or serum sample aliquots (50 µL) will be  spiked with 30 µL of 
an internal standard solution in methanol containing anastrozole (50 nM) for assay of letrozole samples and letrozole (50 nM) for assay of anastrozole samples. LC -MS/MS grade methanol (220 µL) was 
added to precipitate proteins followed by vortex mixing (90 seconds, 2,000 rpm), and centrifugation (20 minutes, 3,000 rpm, 4°C). The 
resulting supernatant (150 µL) will be  transferred to clean plates for 
analysis via LC -MS/MS.  
14.423 LC-MS/MS Method  
Chromatographic separation for anastrozole, letrozole, and respective 
metabolites will be  achieved using  an Acquity BEH C18 column 
(1.7 µM, 2.1 x 100 mm) with a Critical Clean precolumn filter (2.1 x 0.2 µM) (Waters) heated to 35°C and a binary gradient at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The gradient elution will be  held at 65:35 mobile phase A 
(5 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in water): mobile 
phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) for 1 minute. Then this 
will be  increased linearly to 52% mobi le phase B over 30 seconds, held 
at 52% for 2.5 minutes followed by increase to 100% mobile phase B over 30 seconds, and then held at 100% for 30 seconds before 
returning to initial conditions over 0.5 minutes. The total run time is 
expected to be  six minutes. Samples will be  analyzed (2 µL injection 
volume) using the QTRAP 6500+ UHPLC -MS/MS system (AB Sciex) 
with the turbo electrospray source operated in positive ion mode.

Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  15.0 Drug Information  
15.1 Anastrozole (Arimidex®)  
15.11  Background  
Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal, competitive inhibitor o f the aromatase enzyme 
system which binds to the heme group of aromatase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme 
that catalyzes  the conversion of androgens to estrogens.  
15.12 Formulation and storage 
Anastrozole is commercially available as 1 mg tablets. Store at controlled room 
temperature 20 -25˚C (68- 77˚F)  [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. 
15.13 Administration  
Administer orally with or without food. Refer to the treatment section for specific administration instructions.  
15.14 Pharmacokinetic information  
Absorption: Absorption of anastrozole is rapid and maximum plasma 
concentrations typically occur within 2 hours of dosing under fasted conditions.   
Food reduces the rate but not the overall extent of anastrozole absorption. Distribution : Plasma concentrations approach steady- state levels at about 7 days 
of once daily dosing. Anastrozole is 40% bound to plasma proteins in the 
therapeutic range.  
Metabolism : Metabolism of anastrozole occurs by N -dealkylation, hydroxylation 
and glucuronidation. 
Excretion : Eighty -five percent of radiolabeled anastrozole was recovered in 
feces and urine. Hepatic metabolism accounts for approximately 85% of 
anastrozole elimination. Renal elimination accounts for approximately 10% of 
total clearance. The mean elimination half -life of anastrozole is 50 hours.

MC1931 44 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Study Design  
This goal of this study is to assess whether women with inadequate estrogen suppression 
after 8 -10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 1 mg daily (ANA1) would benefit from 
increasing their dose of anastrozole to 10 mg daily (ANA10) . Two analytic approaches 
will be taken to address this objective. The first approach focuses on the set of patients 
who are adherent to treatment schedule, that is, if at least 80% of the planned dose is 
taken will adequate estrogen suppression be achieved. The second approach focuses on 
intentions, that is, among those patients who start a n 8-10 week course of anastrozole 
10 mg daily what proportion will have achieved adequate estrogen suppression at treatment discontinuation. Patients who fail to provide a blood sample after discontinuing treatment will be considered not to have achieved adequate estrogen suppression. 
The study was designed to assess in the adherent cohort whether the estrogen suppression 
rate with anastrozole 10 mg daily for 8- 10 weeks (ES -ANA10) after  inadequate estrogen 
suppression of  8-10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 1 mg daily is at most 25% against the 
alternative that it is at least 50%.  
Inadequate estrogen suppression is defined as E1>1.3 pg/ml and E2>0.5 pg/ml after 8-
10 weeks of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. 
Based on preliminary findings from MA27, we expect approximately 20% of women 
with ER+ primary breast cancer to have inadequate estrogen suppression with anastrozole 
1 mg daily for 8-10 weeks. Thus, if 160 patients were enrolled then we would expect 32 
of them to have IES- ANA1. There may be a few patients who refuse to switch to 
anastrozole 10 mg daily for 8-10 weeks followed by a blood draw for E1 and E2 testing. 
Assuming at most 3 women will refuse to continue or fail to adhere to treatment , 
29 patients who are adherent to treatment will be available to evaluate the primary aim.  
With a sample size of 29 patients in the adherence cohort , a one- sided binomial test of 
proportions with a significance level of 0.05 will have a 87% chance of rejecting the null 
hypothesis that the estrogen suppression rate with anastrozole 10 mg daily for 8-10 weeks is at most 25% when the true estrogen suppression rate with anastrozole 10 mg daily for 
8-10 weeks is at least 50%. Specifically, the null hypothesis is rejected if the number of 
women who are ES-ANA10 is 12 or more among these 29 patients. 
16.2 Analyses 
16.21 Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis will include a ll patients with inadequate estrogen 
suppression after  8-10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 1 mg daily who provide a 
blood sample after completing 8-10 weeks of  anastrozole 10 mg daily  will be 
included in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Patients who fail to provide a blood sample after discontinuing anastrozole 10 mg daily for 8-10 weeks 
Adverse events will be graded and their attributions assigned using NCI CTCAE 
v5.0. 
For each cohort, point and interval estimates for the  estrogen suppression rate 
with anastrozole 10 mg daily for 8-10 weeks will be constructed using the 
properties of the binomial distribution. 
MC1931 45 MCCC Amendment 2  
Protocol Version Date: 19 Nov2020  16.3 Accrual rate and enrollment  
Accrual Rate: MCR – anticipate 300 patients per year meeting eligibility criteria and 
100 patients per year agreeing to participate in the clinical trial.  
Total Expected Accrual: 160  minimum  to obtain 32 patients who reach Cycle 3 with 
29 patients evaluable for study endpoints  
16.4 Stopping rule s 
16.41 Feasbility stopping rule  
The percentage of patients who have inadequate estrogen suppression 
(E1>1.3 pg/ml and E2>0.5 pg/ml ) will be examined after every 25th patients has 
completed 8 -10 weeks of anastrozole at the 1 mg daily  dose. If this percentage is 
10% or less among the se 25  patients and all the previously enrolled patients is 
10% or less, the trial will temporarily halt for the study team to review study data 
to make a trial recommendation to FDA and IRB.  
16.42 Safety Stopping rule: 
Adverse events will be examined at the completion of each treatment. Enrollment 
to the trial will be temporarily halted if : 
(a) During or at completion of treatment Cycle 1 with anastrozole 1 mg daily, 
2 or more of the first 6 patients or 30% or more of the patients treated with 
the agent have developed a Grade 4 cytopenia or some other G rade 3 -4 
adverse event  during or at completion of that agent 
(b) During or at completion of treatment C ycle 2 with anastrozole 1 0 mg daily, 
if 2 or more of the first 6 patients develops a DLT (as specified in Section 7.0 
of the protocol) within 28-35 days of starting ANA10. The study will remain 
closed to enrollment to allow the study team to review toxicity data 
thoroughly and make decisions rega rding changes to the protocol. If at most 
one of these 6 patients develops a DLT within 28-35 days of starting 
ANA10, re -registr ation  will reopen.  
After at least  7 patients have been re- registered and have begun ANA10, 
30% or more of the patients treated with the agent have developed a Grade 4 cytopenia or some other G rade 3 -4 adverse event  during or at completion of 
that agent 
(c) During or at completion of treatment C ycle 3 with letrozole 2.5  mg daily, 
2 or more of the first 6 patients or 30% or more of the patients treated with 
the agent have developed a Grade 4 cytopenia or some other G rade 3 -4 
adverse event  during or at completion of that agent 
(d) A patient death on protocol treatment or within 30 days of discontinuing all 
protocol treatment that is considered possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment.  
The study team will review study data and then make a trial recommendation to 
FDA and IRB.  
16.5 Analysis Plan for Secondary Outcome and Translational Endpoint  
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the distribution of E1 and E2 concentrations following ANA1 0 and letrozole. The percent change in E1 and E2 concentrations from 
pre-AI levels will be determined and graphically depicted using spider plots.

Abstract  
Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) consists of alternating periods of breathing mildly hypoxic  
and normoxic air , and is a well -characterized stimulus to serotonin -dependent motor 
plasticity  (1, 2). More than two decades of research  from several independent laboratories 
indicate s AIH elicits meaningful res piratory and non -respiratory motor  recovery in both 
animal and human models of health and neurological injury, particularly  chronic 
incomplete spinal cord injuries  (3-7). Of particular importance, the “low dose” of 
intermittent hyp oxia represented by AIH is well below that encountered with sleep apnea, 
and elicit s functional  benefits in diverse  physiological systems without detectable 
pathology (8, 9). 
Our group is interested in the therapeutic potential of AIH for individuals with 
neuromuscular disease. In preliminary studies  on rodent models of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis ( ALS), brief AIH exposures restore lost respiratory function. Based on the 
efficacy of AIH in ALS rat s (10, 11), and the success in translating this novel therapy to 
humans with chronic neurological impairment, the potential benefits  of AIH in ALS 
patients warrant  careful investigation. Most ALS patients survive less than 5 years after 
diagnosis , and the main cause of death is respiratory failure  (12, 13). Few options  are 
available to preserve breathing other than mechanical ventilation , which diminishes the 
quality of life to an extent that it is often rejected by ALS patients. Any treatment options 
to preserve/prolong independent breathing ability will greatly enhance the quality (and 
duration) of life in those su ffering from ALS. Here, we seek proof of concept data t hat AIH  
may be a simple and effective therapeutic option to preserve independent breathing ability 
in ALS.  
The fundamental hypothes is guid ing this proposal is that even a single AIH 
trial improves resp iratory (and non -respiratory) motor function  in ALS patients. We 
propose to  evaluate respiratory and limb strength , minute ventilation and respiratory 
muscle EMG activity in ALS patients versus  healthy age and sex -matched controls  in 
response to AIH and sham AIH (normoxia) interventions . We will investigate the ability of 
a single AIH trial to increase voluntary respiratory motor function  (Aim 1 ). An additional , 
exploratory aim tests the hypothesis that ALS patients utilize  distinct pattern s of 
respirator y muscle recruitment  versus  healthy controls , and that these patterns are 
partially normalized by AIH ( Aim 2 ). Both aims are designed to collect preliminary safety 
and feasibility data  as we develop methods that improve  our ability to detect and treat 
respiratory impairment in ALS.  
  
Background  
Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) consists of short, repeated presentations of reduced 
oxygen in the inspired gas (~9-11% oxygen , ~1 – 1.5 minute s), interspersed with normal 
oxygen  periods  (~1-1.5 min, inspired O2=21%). AIH induced motor plasticity was first 
described more than two decades ago as a persistent enhance ment of  phrenic and 
hypoglossal neural activity lasting hours after AIH had ended . (14, 15) Subsequent 
research demonstrated that AIH preconditioning causes cumulative effects, and  
enhance s the extent of motor facilitation induced by a single AIH presentatio n (16, 17). 
These observations triggered investigations concerning the potential of  repeated AIH as 
a treatment to preserve and/or restore breathing ability with neural injury or disease  (3, 
9). 
More than two decades of research on animal models have produc ed a detailed  
understanding of mechanisms giving rise  to AIH-induced respiratory motor plasticity  (3, 
4, 6, 18, 19). Briefly, e ach hypoxic episode activates ventilatory chemoreflexes initiated 
by carotid body chemoreceptors. Carotid body sensory activity stimulates medullary 
respiratory neurons  that increase breathing  (1, 2) and raphe neurons that contain the 
neuromodulator, serotonin. During each hypoxic e pisode in the  AIH protocol , this neural 
network  is repeatedly activated . The e pisodic release of serotonin near respiratory motor 
neurons is at the heart of AIH -induced plasticity versus  low oxygen per se  (4). Episodic 
activation of serotonin receptors on  respiratory motor neurons initiates intracellular 
signaling cascades that trigger new brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  protein 
synthesis , strengthen ing synapses from medullary  respiratory neurons  that drive 
breathing (1, 6). Similar mechanisms occur in both respiratory and non -respiratory motor 
neurons as confirmed  in numerous  studies in both normal  (3, 20, 21) and injury/ disease  
rodent models (3, 22). When  AIH is repeated daily for many days -to-weeks , the 
magnitude and duration of plasticity  is amplified (22). 
The dose of intermittent hypoxia is critical in determining the direction and extent 
of plasticity , and the  potential for adverse events  (8). For example, high doses of 
intermittent hypoxia simulating obstructive sleep apnea [80 or more episodes per 
day/night ; severe hypoxemia within each episode] elicit pathology, including systemic 
hypertension, neuro inflammation, and cognitive impairment (23, 24). On the other hand, 
respiratory motor plasticity  is undermined by severe intermittent hypoxia protocols due to 
neuroinflammation (25). In striking contrast , repeated, low dose AIH [<15 episodes per 
day; modest hypoxemia per episode] elicits neuroplasticity without de tectable pathology 
(26-31). To the contrary, repetitive low dose AIH exert s beneficial effects in multiple organ 
systems by independent research groups (for review see: (8)).  
Here, we propose to study mechanisms of respiratory plasticity associated with a 
single presentat ion of mild AIH . AIH is simple to apply and well tolerated by most 
individuals . In eight  studies on humans with chronic spinal cord injury published to date, 
an AIH protocol similar to that proposed  here has not been associated with any adverse 
events (5, 7, 31-35). Several other completed, but not yet published studies from multiple 
laboratories increase our  collective  experience with (and confidence in) this protocol 
(Christensen et al., submitted; Sandhu et al., in preparation; Ahmed et al., in prepa ration) . 
All available evidence is consistent with the conclusion that  AIH protocols similar to that 
proposed here are safe in humans, although we do not yet have experience with ALS 
patients.  
 Accumulating evidence demonstrates that a similar  AIH protocol to that proposed 
here induces respiratory motor plasticity in humans. For example, in healthy sleeping 
adults, tidal volume and ventilation acutely increase during each hypoxic  episode , and 
remain above baseline >20 minutes post-AIH (36). Sustained motor facilitation is also 
observed in  genioglossus EMG activity, presumably stabilizing the upper airway (37). 
Using a slightly different AIH protocol (with a background of mild hypercapnia), prolonged 
increases in tidal volume (and ventilation) are  observed in awake humans with chronic 
spinal injury (34). In adult patients with chronic incomplete spinal injury, a single, 30 -
minute AIH session (15, 1 min episodes)  elicited >80% gain in ankle torque generation 
and EMG burst amplitude for up to 4  hours post-AIH (7). AIH-induced g ains in limb muscle 
torque correlate wit h enhanced motor recruitment  (5). Here, we propose to study 
effects of a similar, single AIH session  in normal subjects and ALS patients to gain 
proof of principle that AIH elicits plasticity and meaningful functional benefits in 
this patient population.  Although repeated, d aily AIH exposure for 5 days extend the  
duration of  motor enhancement  to weeks  (35), we do not yet feel justified in exposing ALS 
patients to such prolonged protocols  pending the outcome of these initial e xperiments .  
Based on abundant experience in humans, the AIH protocol proposed here is 
noninvasive , easy to administer and , importantly , has no history of adverse effects. 
Further, when people with chronic spinal cord injury are asked which day they had 
received AIH versus sham normoxia treatment, they are unable to tell (their guess has a 
50/50% chance of being correct); thus, AIH at these levels is not stressful (indeed is  barely 
detectable) for those with neurologic injury. The most notable discomfort reported during 
an AIH protocol is wearing the respiratory mask. Collectively, evidence from both animal 
models and humans with neurologic injury support the case that AIH is  a safe, simple 
(non-invasive) and effective means of improving both respiratory and non -respiratory 
motor function, and that it has the potential to at least transiently improve motor function 
in diverse clinical disorders that compromise movement (9). 
Early results (n=6) indicate respiratory motor gains in some, but not all subjects 
following AIH. While the primary means of AIH motor facilitation occurs via serotonergic 
signaling, AIH motor facilitation can occur through an alternative, adenosine -mediated 
signaling pathway (38, 39). The serotonergic and adenosine pathways compete for 
dominance via cross -inhibition, and when activated equally, they cancel one another (19, 
40). However, recent basic science data from our group indicates that pre -treatment with 
an adenosine receptor antagonist can restore AIH -induced respiratory motor function 
(41). Aim 3 is an optional/exploratory aim evaluating whether co -administration of low -
dose (3 mg/kg) caffeine, a non -selective adenosine receptor antagonist, augments 
respiratory and grip function to a greater degree than AIH alone. Caffeine is rapidly 
absorbed, and then degraded to paraxanthine in the liver via Cytochrome P450 1A2 
(CYP1A2). Maximal serum concentrations are reached within ~1 hour of 
consumption. (42) The plasma half -life of caffeine is ~4 hours, but ranges from 2 -8 hours 
between  individuals. (43) Caffeine freely crosses the blood -brain barrier and enters the 
CNS; 3 mg/kg of caffeine inhibits A2A (~60%) and A 1 receptors (50%); 6 mg/kg of caffeine 
yields ~75% A 2A and ~65% A 1 receptor inhibition. (44) Caffeine also inhibits 
phosphodiesterase activity, but only at doses >9 mg/kg. (45) Caffeine is the most widely 
used psychoactive drug worldwide (46), and is considered safe for use in most 
neurodegenerative disorders, in cluding ALS (47, 48). 
Preliminary studies in rodent models of ALS : 
Diminished b reathing ability can be partially restored by harnessing the intrinsic capacity 
for plasticity  (1). In rats with incomplete cervical spinal injury, even a single presentation 
of AIH increases phre nic/diaphragm function ipsilateral to injury (22, 49). Repetitive AIH 
for one week enhances both the magnitude and duration of this effect (20, 31, 35). The 
mechanism of functional recovery is a shifting function of time post -injury; for example, 1 
week of daily AIH beginning 1 week post -injury improves breathing capacity by an 
adenosine depend ent, serotonin -independent mechanism (31, 50). On the other hand, 1 
week of daily AIH elicits functional improvement of breathing capacity by a serotonin -
dependent, adenosine constrained mechanism. Thus, multiple, time -dependent 
mechanisms can contribute to the functional plasticity observed.  Both mechanisms of 
functional recovery are transient, although prolonged repetitive AIH exposures appear to 
elicit more robust and prolonged functional recovery. We are currently exploring optimal 
protocols with respect to both the amplitude and duration of functional improvement.  
Preliminary studies demonstrate  that even a single AIH exposure restore s 
diminished phrenic nerve activity during late -stage disease in a rat model of ALS, the 
SOD1G93A transgenic rat (10, 11, 51, 52). Indeed, in end-stage rats, AIH-induced phrenic 
motor fac ilitation is nearly double that found in wild -type littermates or in mutant rats 
during early stage disease  (52). In end -stage ALS rats, enhanced AIH-induced phrenic 
motor  facilitation utilizes the same  serotonin -dependent mechanism s as in wild -type rats 
(10). These preliminary data and proof o f concept studies in human s with incomplete  
spinal cord injury provide a strong rationale to evaluate responses to a single session of 
AIH in patients with ALS. Our initial investigations on a single AIH presentation will guide 
efforts as we work to evalua te repetitive AIH as a potential therapeutic modality in human s 
with ALS.  
 
Our plan:   
As a relentlessly progressive neuromuscular  disease that leads to paralysis from  motor 
neuron death , any strategy to preserve motor function for as long as possible will greatly 
impact the quality of life in those suffering from ALS. Current c linical ALS management 
include s various forms of assisted ventilation  (53). However, assisted ventilation 
atrophies respiratory muscles, further degrading independent breathing ability (54); it 
takes things in the wrong direction. AIH is a potential therapy to preserve independent 
breathing ability , delaying the need for assisted ventilation and improving the quality and 
duration of life for ALS patients . We begin this line of investigation with two, limited specific 
aims designed to establish proof -of-principle that AIH has the intended effect.  
 We will begin investigations of AIH in ALS patients by focusing on a single AIH  
session  to establish proof -of-principle before considering more extensive studies 
of repetitive AIH, which ha s greater potential to alter the course of disease.  
  Since the major cause of death in ALS is ventilatory failure (34), and studies  of 
AIH-induced  respiratory motor plasticity led to the principle repeated AIH as a 
therapeutic modality  (9), our initial focus will on  AIH and breathing  ability in ALS 
patients.  
 We will collect additional preliminary data on limb function (grip strength) since AIH 
increases strength in several motor systems, potentially benefiting patients.  
 Aim 3 (optional aim) will independently evaluate the effect of pre -treatment with 
caffeine on respiratory and non -respiratory motor performance post -AIH. 
 Our goal with this initial project is to collect preliminary data necessary to provide 
proof -of-concept, and to provide the foundation for extramural grant applications.  
Specific Aims  
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a single AIH trial increases maximal respiratory and 
non-respiratory motor function  in ALS.  Dependent variables  will include:  maximal 
inspiratory pressure  (MIP)  and maximal handgrip force  (MHGF) . We will address the 
following questions:  
 a. Does  AIH increase voluntary inspiratory pressure generation ?  
b. Does  AIH increase maximal handgrip force ?   
c. Are baseline  MIP and MHGF  inversely related to AIH-induced  facilitation ?  
 
Aim 2:  Test the hypothesis that a single AIH trial increases resting  respiratory 
motor function in ALS . Dependent variables will include: resting tidal volume , 
respiratory EMG at rest, resting ventilatory drive.  Three questions will be addressed:  
a. Does AIH increase resting tidal volume?  
b. Does AIH increase the resting ventilatory drive?  
c. Does AIH increase  respiratory muscle  activation and restore more normal 
respiratory muscle recruitment patterns?  
Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that pre-treatment with caffeine will augment respiratory 
and non -respiratory motor function. Dependent variables will include: maximal 
respiratory pressures, maximal grip force, resting tidal volume, EMG . Three questions will 
be addressed:  
a. Does acute consumption of caffeine enhance AIH-induced  facilitation of 
respiratory and non -respiratory motor function ?  
b. Is there a difference in AIH -induced facilitation of respiratory and non -
respiratory motor function between slow and fast caffeine metabolizers?  
c. Does acute consumption of caffeine improve the AIH -induced increase  in          
respiratory muscle  activation?  
 
Research Plan  
Design:  Subjects will be 
screened for eligibility on 
Day 1  (Figure 1); those 
who meet the criteria will 
continue with the study.  
 
The study design ( Figure 2) will consist of  up to three  separate testing sessions, 
separated by approximately two weeks  (+/- 3 days) . One session will be a single, ~45-
minute AIH  protocol . The other will be 45 minutes of Sham AIH  (ie. normoxia) . Session 
order will be random. A third, optional session will be offered to eligible subjects (caffeine 
+ AIH). Each session is expected to last ~3 hours, including  equipment setup, patient 
positioning and pressure relief, rest breaks, AIH/Sham AIH, and post -intervention tests.  Figure 1: Proposed screening procedures .

Subjects  who elect to participate in Aim 3 will be scheduled for a third study session 
consisting of administration of 3 mg/kg of caffeine, followed by AIH 1 hour after caffeine 
consumption.  
Study outcomes  in Aim 1  include strength tests (respiratory and handgrip ; MIP and 
MHGF ), respiratory drive  (P0.1), tidal breathing, and the hypoxic ventilatory response 
(HVR) . In Aim 2, r espiratory muscle recruitment will be tested at normoxic rest, during 
hypoxia , and with maximal voluntary inspiratory pressure generation. Aim 3 outcomes 
include maximal respiratory pressures, MHGF, tidal breathing, and saliva tests of caffeine 
metabolism.  
 
Subjects:  We propose to study 
18 ALS patients and up to 30  
healthy age/sex matched control 
subjects . Patients who meet 
study criteria will be identified by 
Dr. Wymer (Co -I) through the UF 
adult neuromuscular clinic. The 
study PI will screen and consent 
patients. The PI will review the 
eligibility criteria, study 
procedures, participation  risks, 
and the ability  of subjects to 
withdraw from the study at any 
time.  
 
Eligibility Criteria.  
Subject s will be eligible to participate if they have a clinical diagnosis of ALS  or are a 
healthy adult ; are between 21 and 75 years of age; and have a baseline FVC >6 0% 
predicted for age, sex and height. Baseline FVC is routinely performed at every clinic for 
ALS patients.  The AIH study team (PI or coordinator) will email a PFT report request to 
the clinic respiratory therapist, in advance of clinic. On the day of clinic,  the respiratory 
therapist will upload the requested PFT reports directly into EPIC. After clinic, the AIH 
study coordinator will locate the PFT report in EPIC and save it to the electronic study 
binder. If the PFT report indicates the FVC is within study criteria, the subject can be 
contacted for an appointment. If the FVC falls below study eligibility, the patient will not 
be scheduled for a screening visit.  
Patients will be classified  into two groups: 1) uses no form of external respiratory 
support (IND) ; and 2) and uses non -invasive external respiratory support while sleeping 
for at least 2  night s per week to assist night  time breathing or treat sleep apnea  (NIV) . 
Since  4-6 subjects in each group may fail to meet all eligibility criteria or attend the second 
testing session , we request to enroll up to 18  patients with ALS , with the goal of 
completing all study procedures in 12 patients . In addition, we request enrollment  of up 
to 30 healthy controls to complete all study procedures in  20 (up to 20 healthy controls 
may be needed as a reference set for the EMG data analysis  described on page 10). The 
healthy controls will be recruited via listings for this study on CT.gov a nd the 
StudyConnect website.  Fig 2 Proposed study design .  
  

 Patient and control p articipants are ineligible if they: are pregnant , have diagnosed 
cardiovascular disease , have a BMI >3 5 kg/m2, currently take selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor s (SSRI) , have a history of seizures , have a history of hospitalization for 
sepsis , had a respiratory infection or took antibiotic medications with in the past 4 weeks , 
use external respiratory support during any waking hours , participate in a pharmaceutical 
trial to treat ALS , or have any other medical condition the PI (Smith) or medical director 
(Wymer) identify would make it unsuitable to participate.  
Additionally, subjects will be ineligible to participate in Aim 3 ( caffeine+AIH) if they: 
report negative side effects to caffeine consumption  (e.g. anxiety, dizziness) ; have a 
diagnosis of  diabetes (due to effect of caffeine on glucose metabolism  (55) or hepatic 
cirrhosis (impaired metabolism  of caffeine (56), or take  antiarrhythmic or bronchodilator 
medications (57). 
 The sample size is consistent with the time and budget required to acquire strong 
pilot data for an NIH R01 grant, which is the major  goal of this project.  
 Eligible subjects who agree to participate and sign the informed consent form 
approved by UF will undergo further screening procedures prior to beginning study 
procedures. Screening will include a detailed medical and pharmacological history,  
caffeine consumption questionnaire,  forced vital capacity (FVC) testing and resting 3 -lead 
ECG. The likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea will be evaluated using the STOP -BANG 
questionnaire.  Subjects will be informed of their STOP -BANG questionnaire results, and 
if sleep apnea is suspected, then the y will be referred for possible clinical treatment  (which 
is outside of the scope of this study) . If they choose to pursue clinical treatment for sleep 
apnea, then they will be included in the study after 3 months of treatment have elapsed. 
If they choose not to seek treatment, they will be included in th e study. This plan is 
consistent with recommendations of a recent Intermittent Hypoxia workshop considering 
the inclusion/exclusion of subjects with sleep apnea; recommendations were made in 
based on input from two nationally known sleep apnea experts part icipating in that 
workshop (Drs. David Gozal, University of Chicago, and S. Badr at Wayne State 
University ).  
At the screening session, subjects who meet all study criteria will be invited to 
participate in a third study session consisting of caffeine + AI H. Subjects who decline to 
participate in Aim 3 remain eligible to participate in Aims 1 -2. 
 
Screening Tests   
 Forced vital capacity  – the maximal volume of gas that can be forcefully exhaled, 
following full inspiration. FVC is a standard measure for clinical care and research, but 
lacks sensitivity in mild neuromuscular diseases, including ALS  (58). Upright FVC will 
be conducted as per published A merican Thoracic Society and European Respiratory 
Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines  (59-61). Study team will conduct FVC test ing on 
screening/study visit #1 when any of the following conditions are present: (1) the most 
recent VC is <63% predicted, (2) most recent VC is >30 days from screening, or (3) 
written verification of the clinic VC is unavailable. Individuals with an FVC <60% of 
predicted will be ineligible for further participation in this study.   
 3-lead EKG  – cardiac rate and rhythm will be evaluated. The presence of resting 
tachycardia (HR>110 bpm), atrial fibrillation or other dysrh ythmias will exclude 
subjects from parti cipation.  
 Sleep apnea screening. Subjects  
o STOP -BANG questionnaire  - a validated screening tool for  OSA  (62). All subj ects 
must complete the STOP -BANG questionnaire, which consists of  4 yes-no 
questions regarding the presence of symptoms of OSA, plus 4 questions regarding 
known physical risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea. Individuals who present 
with a high risk for  OSA and are currently not receiving treatment (e.g. overnight 
positive pressure ventilation or mouthpiece) will be referred to a clinical sleep 
specialist for further evaluation.  
o Overnight sleep monitor – subjects will have the option to wear an overnight sensor  
that non -invasively monitors arterial oximetry and actigraphy (WatchPAT, Itamar 
Medical) , to estimate the severity of  sleep -disordered breathing. Home -based 
peripheral arterial tonometry has a hig h specificity/sensitivity for detecting OSA  
(63). If clinically -significant OSA is detected by the sleep monitor (an apnea -
hypopnea index > 10 events/hour ), subjects will be referred to a clinical sleep 
specialist for further evaluation.  
o Caffeine consumption questionnaire - subjects will be asked about their usual daily 
caffeine consumption habits. We will also ask the subjects about their possible 
reactions  after consuming caffeine. This questionnaire will help us understand the 
responsiveness of the subjects to caffeine and help rule out individuals with 
adverse reactions to caffeine.  
 
Independent Variable - Acute Intermittent Hypoxia  (AIH)  vs Sham AIH  
Subjects will undergo a single session of AIH and a single session of Sham AIH  (Figure 
3). Test sessions will be scheduled two weeks apart at the same time of day. Subjects 
will be instructed to avoid caffeine and nicotine products for >6 hours prior to and avoid 
eating within 30 minutes  of test 
sessions . Subjects will sit upright in a 
chair with the head and trunk 
supported while breathing through a 
sealed face mask . The mask will b e 
connected to a pneumotachograph 
and pressure transducer (Hans 
Rudolph) to measure respiration, and 
a commercially -available hypoxicator 
(Hypoxico , Inc. ) will provide either 
hypoxic or normoxic gas mixtures. 
Respiratory rate, end-tidal CO 2, heart 
rate, Sp O2, and respiratory muscle 
EMG will be continuously monitored  during the testing sessions (PowerLab, 
ADInstruments) .  
 
1. AIH.  A single, 45-minute AIH session will consist of 15, 1 minute  hypoxi c 
episodes (O 2=9-12%) separated by up to 2 minute s of normoxia (O 2 =21%)  (to 
enable SpO2 to return to at least 92% for 1 full minute) . The oxygen content of 
the hypoxic gas will be set at 9%, and adjusted upwards if necessary to maintain  Fig 3.  Schematic of AIH and Sham AIH interventions.  
Each AIH session will consist of 1 -minute intervals of 
hypoxia (9 -12% O 2, shown in blue) separated by up to 2 -
minute intervals of normoxia. Sham AIH will use identical 
equipment, but the hypoxicator machi ne will deliver room 
air continuously.  
 

SpO 2 above 78 % for safety reasons. We do have reasons to believe that the 
specific SpO 2 within this range is an inverse indicator of therapeutic efficacy 
since the proximate stimulus to plasticity is activation of carotid body 
chemoreceptors (with neural activation) versus tissue hypoxia per se. If SpO 2 
levels below 78 % are observed, the hypoxic episode will end early and the 
hypoxicator will be  adjust ed to raise that value prior to the next episode . Healthy 
individuals and patients with spinal  cord injury typically have difficulty in 
distinguishing room air from the mil d hypoxic conditions proposed here.  
2. Sham AIH.   Sham AIH will consist of 45 minutes of normoxic gas  delivered by the 
hypoxicator through the identical facemask system  with identical procedures 
(other than the level of inspired oxygen per se).  
3. Caffeine + AIH. Following baseline testing, subjects will consume 3 mg/kg of 
caffeine. Caffeine capsules will be prepared for each subject based upon the 
weight recorded at the screening visit. AIH will then commence in the same pattern 
as described above beginning 1  hour after caffeine consumption.  
 
 
 
Aim 1  Dependent Variables  – Maximal Voluntary Contractions   
 Maximal respiratory pressures  – maximal voluntary static contractions of the 
inspiratory or expiratory muscles against a closed valve, measured at the mouth  (64). 
Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure measures inspiratory force generation at the nose. 
This more natural maneuver has lower variability and learning effects  (65) and 
appears to decline in conjunction with the need for nocturnal ventilation in ALS  (66, 
67). The test  will be repeated until 3 measurements are obtained within 10% 
variability ; a minimum 20 -second rest will be provided between  measurements . 
Maximal inspiratory pressures will be measured at baseline and 60 mi n post-AIH.  
 Peak cough flow -  the maximal expiratory airflow measured through a facemask 
during a maximal -effort voluntary cough. Subjects will repeat 3 -5 voluntary coughs to 
achieve 3 measurements within 10% variability. The peak cough flow  will be measured 
at baseline and 30 min po st- intervention.  
 Maximal voluntary grip force  – maximal static voluntary handgrip contractions will be 
evaluated in a seated position  with the arm at the side and elbow flexed to 90 degrees. 
The test will be repeated until 3 measurements are obtained with  <10% variability, and 
a minimum 15 -second rest between measurements. Significant gains in isometric 
force have been reported with a single AIH session in patients with spinal cord injury. 
Grip strength will be measured at baseline , 30 and 60 minutes post -intervention.  
 
Aim 2 Dependent Variable s – Resting /automatic  respiratory motor function  
 Minute ventilation  – the pneumotachograph and pressure transducer connected to the 
face mask  will record breath -by-breath flow, volume, mouth pressure, and breathing  
rate. After achieving a stable tidal volume, 5 minutes of tidal breathing will be recorded. 
Tidal breathing will be measured at baseline, during hypoxic episodes, immediately 
following AIH, and at 30 and  60 minutes post -intervention . 
 Ventilatory drive.  Respiratory drive will be estimated with pressure  generation against 
a transiently occluded airway in the first 0.1 sec of inspiration  (ie. P0.1); subjects will 
be seated upright and breathing quietly through the face mask. An inspiratory valve 
will be man ually occluded during the expiratory phase of a breath and will be 
maintained until the end of the subsequent inspiratory effort. Five measurements will 
be conducted , with 5 -15 un -occluded breaths between each P0.1 measurement. This 
validated test is resis tant to learning or sensory bias an d reflects unaltered 
neuromuscular effort  (68, 69). P0.1 will be measured at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes 
post-intervention . 
 Respiratory muscle EMG.  Surface EMGs of the respiratory muscles (up to six 
muscles, bilaterally: scalene, sternocleidomastoid, 2nd parasternal, 5th external 
intercostal, 8th external intercostal, and diaphragm ) will be recorded during the test 
session. The root mean square (RMS) of each muscle  will be averaged . Multi -muscle 
activation will be calculated using a validated, vector -based analysis (70) that provides 
a magnitude (Response Vector) and pattern (Similarity Index) of composite EMG 
activity. We will then compare multi -muscle activity from each ALS subject to the 
Prototype Response Vector calculated as the average Response Vector and Similarity 
Index calculated from the pooled  control subjects  (71). 
 
Aim 3 Dependent Variables  
 Maximal respiratory pressures – as described in Aim 1  
 Maximal voluntary handgrip force – as described in Aim 1  
 Tidal breathing pattern – as described in Aim 2   
 Markers of caffein e metabolism and adenosine -mediated AIH. Saliva specimens 
will be collected at the screening visit and processed for single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in three specif ic genes.  Polymorphisms in CYP1A2 (rs762551), 
ADORA2 A (rs5751876), and BDNF (rs6265) will be  tested using a commercially 
available TaqMan assay with PCR instrument and genotyping analysis software . 
 Salivary caffeine – Saliva specimens will be collected before baseline testing and 
60 minutes post -AIH, to measure changes in salivary caffeine levels.  Salivary 
caffeine will be analyzed using a HPLC assay.  The caffeine powder used by 
Westlab Pharmacy will be available to UF’s ICBR to create a caffeine standard for 
assay analysis.  
 
Statistical Analysis   
The outcomes for both aims are largely quantitative and continuous. Sample distributions 
and summary statistics will be calculated for each outcome, and non -linear data 
distributions will be transformed as needed. Study outcomes for Aims 1 -2 include acute  
changes in voluntary strength, resting ventilation, and respiratory drive. Each of t hese  will 
be evaluated with 3 -way repeated measures ANOVAs . Factors will be  subject group  
(patient vs control) , AIH condition  (AIH vs Sham AIH) , and time (pre, 0 minutes po st, 30 
minutes post, 60 minutes post ); Tukey’s post hoc test will be used to assess individual 
differences. A separate ANOVA will compare the independent effect of caffeine on motor 
function 60 minutes post -AIH. We will work with BERD to use genetic testin g results to 
model independent effects of caffeine metabolism genotype on AIH motor facilitation, as 
pilot data to estimate sample size for a larger, future project. For the analysis of sEMG 
Response Vector  and Similarity Index , baseline FVC will be used as a covariate. These 
will be tested with 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA s (AIH only, factors: subject group 
and time) . Relationships between variables will be evaluated with Pearson’s correlation. 
Statistical significance will be  p<0.05.  
 
Possible Discomforts and Risks  
The physiological (and perceptual) effects  of intermittent hypoxia  in humans are well 
studied at the degree and duration of hypoxia as proposed here,  and appear  safe and 
well-tolerated (7, 33). Similar  AIH protocol s have been shown to improve ventilation  (72, 
73), enhance cerebral blood  flow (26), and increase muscle sympathetic nerve activity . 
More severe hypoxia (3-6% O 2) and recurrent (>>15 episodes per day) have been 
associated over time with  hypertension, increased systemic inflammation and 
neurocognitive deficits , as seen clinically in obstructive sleep apnea  (8, 74, 75). On the 
other hand, intermittent hypoxia protocols consisting of less severe (>9% O2) and 
recurrent (<15 episodes/day) are associated with the opposite outcome, including 
reduced blood pressure, anti -inflammatory effects and neurocognitive enhancement (8, 
74, 75). The hypoxia dose and duration have been carefully selected to optimize impact 
while minimiz ing known risks. We will monitor  subjects continuously  to detect adverse 
events, if any . 
 While this AIH protocol is well-tolerated and appears safe in most individuals , some 
patients may report transient light-headedness, dizziness, or reduced vision . Some 
patients also report an increase in resp iratory sensation (mild to moderate shortness of 
breath) , or rarely notice an increase in breathing (tidal volume) during the hypoxic periods. 
During and after the AIH protocol, we continuously monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, 
end tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) and oxygen saturation (Sp O2) as well as the rating of dyspnea . 
The FiO 2 will be closely titrated to maintain SpO2 > 78% during hypoxic episodes . While 
excessive HR and BP responses have not been reported, AIH will be stopped in the 
unlikely event the heart rate increases or decreases >30% from the resting value , and/or 
systolic blood pressure changes more than 30% from the resting value . Subjects will be 
informed that they can request to stop the study at any time. If SpO2 falls below 75%, the 
AIH interventi on will be terminated and supplemental O 2 provided.  
 
Additionally, the mask interface  for administering AIH and measuring breathing can feel 
warm, moist, and/or confining to some individuals. To offset discomfort, the mask will be 
removed during rest periods and between post -AIH measurements. We prefer to use a 
mask interface, since subjects are able to easily communicate while using a mask and it 
can accommodate patients with bulbar/oral weakn ess. However, if subjects cannot 
tolerate the mask, a mouthpie ce and nose clip can be offered as an alternative .  
 
Neurologic e ffects of low - to moderate -dose caffeine  (3-6 mg/kg) include increases in 
alertness, mood, reaction time, and motor function (lim b and possibly respiratory muscle 
strength, gait).  (76-79). Higher doses  of caffeine elicit concurrent  A1 receptor  competitive 
inhibition , which may  increase heart rate and/or blood pressure . However, both population 
studies and controlled studies in heart failure i ndicate caffeine has either a neutral or 
protective effect on cardiovascular risk  (80, 81) as well as  arrhythmias  (82), in acute doses 
up to 500 mg (83). Caffeine  may promote feelings of anxiety or fear in some individuals. 
Caffeine -induced anxiety has been linked to known polymorphisms of the ADORA2A 
gene and is associated to an aversion of chronic caffeine consumption (84). Caffeine is 
also a weak, non -specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. While phosphodiesterase 
inhibition occurs only at high doses (> 9 mg/kg) that exceed typical human 
consumption (45, 85), some individuals report stomach pain or queasiness after 
consuming caffeine.  
 
To minimize possible side effects of caffeine, we will exclude subjects with known 
sensitivity to caffeine. This study w ill use a standard dose of 3 mg/kg, which is considered 
by FDA and EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)  (86) to be a safe and well -tolerated 
quantity in most individuals. Additionally, caffeine  is generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) 
by FDA's  regulations solely in cola -type beverages up  to 0.02% (200 ppm). 21 C.F.R. § 
182.1180.  
The caffeine capsules will be compounded by Westlab Pharmacy, a  PCAB Accredited® 
compounding pharmacy  located approximately 2 miles from the University of Florida’s 
campus. Capsules will contain caffeine powder an d filler  (cellulose gum)  in order to help 
in the breakdown and absorption of the caffeine. Westlab Pharmacy will compound 
individual capsules at a dose corresponding to  3 mg caffeine per kg body weight. To meet 
the minimum compounding requirements of the e xternal pharmacy, we will order 3 -5 
capsules corresponding to several pre -determined body weights ( e.g. 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, 
70, 80, 90, and 100 kg). Westlab Pharmacy will then provide subjects with the minimum 
number of capsules needed to approximate  (but n ot exceed)  a 3 mg/kg  dose. E ach 
subject will orally ingest the caffeine capsules  with water .  
 
Respiratory strength testing  procedures increase voluntary respiratory drive of subjects, 
which in some patients can result in a briefly elevated heart and/or respiratory rate , and 
decreased SpO2, feelings of shortness of breath and exertion. Some individuals find the  
transient exertion caused by breathing tests to be uncomfortable or anxiety -provoking  
(87). These effects occur infrequently and resolve upon removal of the respiratory 
stimulus. Nevertheless, we will monitor vital signs during the respiratory tests and be 
certain that patients understand they can rest as long as they like between test bouts or 
stop any test at any time.  
 
The surface  EMG electrodes  are secured to subjects with a double -sided adhesive tape, 
which can cause skin redness or irritation in some i ndividuals with adhesive sensitivities. 
Subjects will be asked about any known skin sensitivities, and if present a hypo -allergenic 
tape will be used.  
 
The sensors attached  during the ECG and overnight sleep monitoring  may also be 
uncomfortable and cause mild skin irritation in some individuals sensitive to adhesive 
tape. The study team will attach the ECG stickers. A hypo -allergenic tape will be used 
instead for these individuals.  
 
Patients with ALS will be recruited from the UF ALS clinic, which encompas ses a large 
catchment area. The study risks of travel  for patients with neuromuscular disease include 
fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and difficulty with pressure relief and toileting regimens. In 
addition, test performance may be diminished by fatigue. Up to $200 reimbursement has 
been budgeted for the cost of overnight lodging for patients .  
 
For testing of caffeine metabolism genes , risks are extremely small but include the risk of 
exposing a subject’s genetic information. To offset these risks, we wil l de-identify the 
samples, and focus  upon specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 3 genes that 
have essential known functions relating to caffeine metabolism  (CYP1A2 and ADORA2A)  
and synaptic plasticity  (BDNF) . Caffeine metabolism genes and saliv ary caffeine levels 
will be analyzed at UF’s ICBR, to minimize exposure of a subject’s genetic information.  
 
Safety  oversight will occur internally through the UF IRB -01 as well as through a  data 
safety monitoring board (DSMB) . The DSMB  will be convened  before enrollment of the 
first patient, after completion of the first three patients , and at least annually thereafter. 
The DSMB will  include three members - 1 expert in intermittent hypoxia, one in 
sleep/pulmonary medicine, and one in rehabilitation. At least 1 member will be external, 
since a wealth of external expertise in  intermittent hypoxia expertise is  available and this 
issue is  of great interest to the scientific community . Notes will be taken and available for 
the IRB at continuing review.   
Testing and enrollment of subjects will be paused and the DSMB will be convened, if any 
of the following events occur: (1) a clinically sig nificant respiratory event determined by 
the PI to be related to study procedures, (2) a clinically significant cardiovascular event 
determined by the PI to be related to study procedures, (3) a serious adverse event as 
defined by IRB -01. Any subsequent st udy activities would only be resumed when cleared 
or modified by the IRB -01 and DSMB.  
 
Possible Benefits  
The expected outcome of this study is an increased knowledge of the effects of AIH on 
short -term maximal muscle recruitment /contraction  and minute vent ilation. No direct 
benefit is anticipated for the participants. Based upon this increased knowledge of 
respiration and AIH, we hope to evaluate the feasibility for studying longer -term benefits 
of AIH on breathing in patients in ALS. This could eventually lead to the investigation of 
future treatments for respiratory problems in  motor  neuron  diseases  such as ALS .

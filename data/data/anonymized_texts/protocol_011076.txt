3.0 OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Objective
The primary  object ive is to evaluate the efficacy o f vortioxet ine (5, 10, and 20 mg) versus 
placebo during the first 28 weeks of the 32 -week double -blind treatment period in the prevent ion 
of relapse in subjects with MDD who responded to acute treatment with vortioxetine 10 mg.
3.2 Secondary Objective
To evaluate the overall efficacy  of vorti oxetineversus placebo during continuation treatment of 
subjects with MDD.
3.3 Safety Objective
To evaluate long -term safet y and tol erabili ty of vorti oxetine versus placebo in subjects with 
MDD .
3.4 Additional Objectives
To assess the effect of long -term treatm ent wi th vortioxetine and placebo on suicidal ideat ion 
and behavior.
Determine the pharmacokinet ic(PK) param eters of vorti oxetine using a popul ation 
pharmacokinet icapproach.
Samples for pharmacogeno mics will be co llected and stored for possible exploratory  
investigat ion of drug response or disease. Pharmacogenomics analyses may be conducted to 
explore gene polymorphism relat ionships wi th drug responses, as indicated by  the findings.
3.5 Study Design
This study  is a randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, Phase 4 study  to eval uate 3 fixed 
doses (5, 10, and 20 mg oral tablets) of vortioxet ine once daily in the prevent ion of relapse in 
adult subjects wi th MDD who have responded to acute treatment with vortioxet ine.
This study  is com prised of a 16- week open -label trea tment peri od followed by a 32- week 
doubl e-blind rando mized treatment periods. This study  will enroll approximately 1100 subjects 
into the open -label phase in order to target approximately 600 subjects to be enrolled into the 
doubl e-blind treatment phase and will be conducted at approximately 60 sites in the United 
States.
Men and wo men between the ages of 18 and 75, incl usive, meet ing the diagnostic criteria fro m 
the Diagnosti c and Stati stical Manual  of Mental  Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revisio n (DSM -
IV-TR) for recurrent MDD, who have had at least 2 major depressive episodes (MDEs) prior to 
the curren t episode, wi th a current epi sode of between 8 weeks and 18 months duration fro m 
screening, a MADRS total score of ≥26, and who sign the informed consent form will be further 
assessed for study  eligibilit y at a screening visit. At Baseline I, subjects who continue to meet all 
inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into a 16 -week open -label

Statistica l Analysis Plan, Final 12 June 2019
treatm ent peri od. During the open -label period all subjects will receive 10 mg vortioxet ine. 
Subjects will take their first dose of study  medication the morning after their Baseline I visit. 
During the open -label treatment period, subjects will be seen every  2 weeks until randomizat ion 
(Baseline II).
Subjects who are in response (defined as a ≥50% reduction in MADRS total score fro m Baseline
I) at Week 8 will cont inue for an addi tional 8 weeks of treatm ent (Stabilizat ion peri od) and will  
continue to receive 10 mg vortioxet ine. Subjects must continue to meet response criteria as 
assessed at every  study  visit during the Stabilizat ion peri od. In addit ion, subjects m ust meet 
remission criteria (defined as ≤12 MADRS total score) at weeks 14 and 16 to be eligible for 
rando mizat ion into the double -blind treatment period. Subjects who do not meet the response 
and/or remissio n criteria will be withdraw n from the study  and will  com plete an early  withdrawal 
visit. Subjects are to remain on 10 mg throughout the open -label period. If a subject requires a 
dose-adjust ment, they  shoul d be wi thdrawn from  study .
At Baseline II, subjects who have met the randomiz ation cri teria (response and remissio n as 
described above) and have not met any  other wi thdrawal  criteria will be rando mized in a ratio of 
1:1:1:1 of the following 4 treatment groups for 32 weeks of double -blind treatment: vortioxet ine 
5 mg; vorti oxetine 1 0 mg; vorti oxetine 20 mg; and placebo .
Subjects will be seen twice the first month and then once monthly during the remainder of the 
32-week double - blind treatment period. Subject well- being calls will be made every 2 weeks 
after Week 20, in between schedu led subject visit s. 
Subjects will be considered as “relapsed” and withdrawn fro m the study  if the following cri teria 
are met: MADRS 22, or lack of efficacy as determined by the invest igator. In addit ion, 
investigator judgment should be used to determine unsatisfactory  treatm ent response indicat ive 
of relapse to depression, such as subject hospi talizati on for depressi on, m edicat ion prescribed for 
MDD, electroconvulsive therapy , suicide attem pt, etc.
A safet y follow-up phone call will be made 30 days after completion of double -blind treatm ent. 
Subjects (either in open -label or doubl e-blind) who discont inue or who are withdrawn prior to 
study  com pletion will come to the site for an early withdrawal visit as soon as possible and will 
be contacted for a safet yfollow-up 30 days after the last dose of study  medicat ion. 
NOTE: The invest igators will be requested to make a note of the approximate date of relapse 
within the period since last visit rather than specify the visit at which relapse was detected. If 
necessary , subjects that are suspected of relapse or impending relapse (eg, clinically relevant 
worsening of depressio n symptoms) should co me to the study site as soon as possible to be 
assessed.
A schemat ic of the study  design is included as Figure 3.a. A schedule o f assessments is listed in 
the protocol.

4.0 ANALYSIS ENDPOINT S
4.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is the time from rando mizat ion to relapse during the first 28 weeks of the 
32-week double -blind treatment with relapse defined as depressio n Montgomery -Asberg 
Depressio n Rat ing Scale ( MADRS 22),or lack of efficacy as determined by the invest igator.
4.2 Secondary En dpoints
Change from double -blind baseline (ie, Baseline II) in MADRS total score at all t ime points 
assessed.
Change from double -blind baseline in Clinical Glo bal Im pressi on Scal e –Severi ty of Illness 
(CGI-
S)score at all t ime po ints assessed.
Clinical Gl obal Impressi on Scale –Global Im provem ent Scal e (CGI-I)score at all time 
points assessed.
Time fro m randomization to relapse during the entire 32 -week double -blind treatment period 
with relapse defined as depressio n (MADRS ≥22), or l ack of efficacy as de termined by the 
investigator.
4.3 Safety Assessments
Safety and tol erabilit y of vortioxetinewill also be evaluated using the following general 
assessments:
Adverse events (AEs).
Laboratory  values.
Vital signs.
Weight.
Electrocardiograms (ECGs).
4.4 Additional Endpoints
The time fro m rando mizat ion to wi thdrawal  for any  reason during 28 weeks of double -blind 
treatm ent.
Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS) summary  data at all t ime points assessed.
Estimate individual exposure parameters of vortioxet ine,including area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve fro m time 0 to time tau (AUC 0-τ), average serum concentrat ion
(Cavg), maximum  observed plasma concentration (C max).

5.0 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Assuming a cumulat ive relapse rate at 28 weeks of 15% for the vortioxetine group versus 30% 
for the pl acebo group, a total  of 600 subjects ( 150 per treatment group) will provide 85% power 
to find a statist ically significant difference between each dose of vortioxetine and placebo at a 
5% significance level (ie, alpha=0.05) .The total number of relapse events required in the 
placebo and three vortioxetine groups i s about 110.
It is ant icipated that approximately 55% of the patients enro lled into the open -label peri od will  
qualify  for the double -blind study  phase. Therefore, a total of about 1100 patients will need to be 
enrolled into the open -label period of the study . 
If the number of subjects who relapsed during the double -blind treatment period is much le ss 
than expected, sample size adjust ment will be considered. After approximately  75% of  planned 
subjects (825) are enrolled into the open -label period of the study , the total  number of relapse 
events, the numbers o f subjects who have completed or are still in the double -blind treatment 
period, and the numbers of subjects in the open -label phase will  be used to predi ct the final total 
number of relapse events. If the predicted total number of relapse events is far smaller than 110, 
with the pl anned 1100 enro lled subjects, more subjects will be enro lled in the study . All of these 
evaluat ions will be done while maintaining the study  blind. The details for these analyses are in 
Appendix E
.
As the number of rando mized subjects, and ult imately the number of relapse subjects, are partly 
dependent on the number enrolled in the open label period, the final number enro lled may be 
more than the est imated 1100.

6.0 METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION
6.1 General Considerations
6.1.1 Statistical Software
Statistical analysis will be performed using the SAS System®, Versi on 9. 4 or greater , on a 
Windows platform.
6.1.2 Summary Statistics and Precision
All tabulat ions of analysis results will include summarie s for the foll owing treatm ent groups: 
placebo, vortioxetine5mg QD, vortioxetine10mg QD, and vortioxetine 2 0mg QD.
All confidence intervals, statist ical tests, and resulting p -values will be reported as nominal 
2-sided and will be assessed at the 5% si gnificance level. No adjust ments will be made for 
multiplicit y aside from those for the primary  effica cy analyses (seesection 6.9.5 ).
For continuous variables, desc riptive stati stics will include the number of subjects (n), mean, SD 
or standard error (SE), as appropriate, minimum, median, and maximum . The number of decimal 
places displayed for each statist ic will be determined as fo llows:
Mean and median: 1 more than the number of decimal places allotted in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF) except for the CGI scales, where 2 decimal places will be reported.
SD and SE: 2 more than the number of decimal places allotted in the eCRF.
Minimum and maximum: equal to the number of decimal places allotted in the eCRF.
Confidence intervals will be presented using the same number of decimal places as the 
param eters (eg, m ean).
For categorical data, frequency counts and percentages will be presented. Percentages will be 
repor ted to 1 decimal place.
The data summaries will be accompanied by individual subject data list ings sorted by  treatm ent, 
study  center and subject ident ifier. All data available fro m eCRFs will be listed. The actual day  
relative to the start of treatment wil l be determined and included in the list ings.
Derived analysis datasets will be produced from raw data and laboratory  data. Thi s allows f or 
convenient reviewing of the data as well as any necessary supplemental analyses. All data from 
the raw datasets will be included in the derived datasets. Derived dataset specifications will be 
developed to include the names and definit ions of derived variables in the derived SAS datasets.
6.1.3 Definition of Study Day and Study Visit Windows
Visit windowing will  not be used f or the primary  efficacy  analysis and other time -to-event 
analyses in this study . For other analyses, a windowing convent ion will be used to determine the 
analysis value for a given study  visit that applies to observed data.
In general, S tudy Day  -1 corresp onds to the date of the Baseline I or II visit . Other study  days are 
defined relat ive to Study  Day  1, the date of first study  drug dose in the open label period or 
Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use

Lu AA21004_402 Page 12of 39

doubl e blind period . Rel ative day is calculated as (date of interest – date of first dose +1 ) for 
study  days on or after the date of first dose and as (date of interest –date of first dose) for study 
days pri or to the first dose date.
For each visit, a window will be defined such that the lower and upper bounds o f each window is 
generally the mi dpoint between 2 consecutive study  visits. The visi t windows and applicable 
study  day ranges are presented below in Table 6.aand  Table 6.b.

(a) Baseline II day has been defined as Day -1 in keeping with Clinical Data Interchange Consortium standards. 
There is no Day 0. The first dose in this table is the first dose in the double -blind study medication. Baseline value is 
the last no n-missing observ ation prior to the first dose of the double -blind study  medication.
More than 1 result for a parameter may be obtained in a visit window. In such an event, the result 
with the date cl osest to the scheduled visit day  will be used. In the event of 2 observat ions 
equidistant to the scheduled visit day, the later of the observ ations will be used. Double- blind 
treatment Period Last Visit values will be defined irrespective of falling in a part icular window. 
Hence, the windowed Week 48 value may be different than the Last Visit value.
In general, the baseline value , Baseline I or Baseline II, for a variable is defined as the last 
observat ion prior to the first dose of open -label or double -blind study  medicat ion (visit date ≤ 
first dose date) respectively , including the screening value, if necessary.
Adverse events that start more than 30 day s after the last dose of study  medicat ion (start date 
–
last dose date >30) will be listed, but excluded from the summaries and analyses. For efficacy 
and other safet y data, data that are obtained more than 7 days after the last dose of study  
medicat ion (visit date –last dose date >7) will be listed, but excluded fro m summaries and 
analyses.
If the date of the first open -label dose is missing, then the date of the first dose dispensed + 1 day  
will be used. If the date of the last open -label dose is missing and the subject is not randomized 
into doubl e-blind period, then the earlier of the 2 dates will be used for the last open -label dose 
date for analysis and summary purpose: the early terminat ion visit date or the last open -label 
drug di spense date +7 days . If the date of the l ast open -label dose is missing and the subject is 
rando mized into double -blind period, then the date of first double- blind dose –1 day  will be 
used.
If the date of last double -blind dose is missing, then the earlier of the following 2 dates will be
used for the last dose date for analysis and summary purpose: the final visit (Week 48) /early

termination visit date or the last double -blind drug dispense date +7 days . If the date of the first 
doubl e-blind dose is missing ,then the first dose dispensed date + 1 day will be used for analysis 
and summary  purposes.
The study  window convent ion will not be applied to the eCRF data list ings. The data list ings for 
eCRF data will display  the raw data as collected and entered in the eCRF. For MADRS, CGI- I, 
and CGI -S, windowed visit s will also be shown on the list ings.
6.1.4 Grouping of Centers
Before unblinding the data, centers will be pooled with geographically similar centers to 
minimize artifacts in the statistical analyses fro m imbalan ces in subject counts within the centers.
The pooling of the centers will be reviewed and approved by  the clinical  team  for agreem ent, and 
is then used in the appropriate analyses once the database is locked and unblinded.
6.2 Major Protocol Violations
All subjects with major protocol vio lations will be ident ified in the minutes of the subject 
evaluabilit y assessment performed prior to unblinding, and will be listed by study  center and 
subject number.
Subjects with the following major protocol vio lations will b e excluded from  the per protocol  set 
(PPS) defined in Sect ion 6.3:
No eval uable baseline MADRS assessment.
No eval uable post -baseline assessment of MADRS.
Low study  drug com pliance (<70%) or missed stu dy drug for 6 consecut ive days.
Doubl e-blind study  medicat ion exposure less than 14 day s (last dose date –first dose date 
+1<14).
Subjects switch treatment during study .

were randomized and received at least 1 dose of double -blind study  medicat ion.In safety  
summaries for the double -blind period , subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they  
received. In the event that a subject inadvertent ly took capsules from more than 1 drug dose 
level , the actual  treatm ent will  be defined as the onetaken most frequent ly. If the most commo n 
treatm ents were taken with equal  frequency, the rando mized treatment will be used as the actual 
treatm ent.

6.6 Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions
Medical history  refers to the si gnificant condi tions/di seases that stopped at o r prior to Screening 
(time of informed consent). Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing 
condi tions/diseases present at Screening (time of informed consent).
For parti ally missing end dates, the following will be conducted:
Day missing: the minimum between last day  of the m onth and date of transfer will be used to 
impute the end date.
Month and day  missing: the minimum between last day  of the y ear and date of transfer will 
be used to impute the end date.
Medical history  and concurrent me dical  condi tions will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary 
for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) version 18.0 or hi gher and will be summarized by  
treatm ent group and overall using 
system  organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The table 
will include numbe r and percentages of subjects . SOC will be sorted i n alphabet ical order and 
the PT will be sorted in decreasing frequency  based on the total number of subjects . A subject 
will only be counted once within a part icular cl ass even if he/she has mult iple 
condi tions/symptoms. Summaries will be based on all enrolled subjects in open -label period and 
allrandomized subjects in double -blind period .Concurrent medical condit ions in the double -
blind period include significant ongoing condit ions or di seases present at the time of informed 
consent.

and details of the medical history  or condi tion.
6.7 Medication History and Concomitant Medications
The m edicati on history  and conco mitant medicat ions are defined as fo llows:
Medicat ion history refers to the m edicat ion that the study  subjects stopped taking within 
90days prior to signing of informed consent .
Concomitant medicat ion is defined as medicat ion that the study  subjects conti nued taking or 
took fro m Screening through end of study :
–Conc omitant m edicat ion that started and stopped prior to baseline I (ie, stop date ≥ first 
screening visit date, and stop date ≤ first dose date).
–Concomitant medicat ion that started prior to Baseline I and was ongo ing in the open -
label period (ie, start date <first dose date, and stop date ≥ first dose date).
–Concomitant medicat ion that was ongoing in the double -blind period for the randomized 
patients (ie, start date ≤ last double -blind dose date , and stop date>first double -blind dose 
date).
–Concomitant medi cation taken during the study  (ie, start date ≤ last dose date, and stop 
date ≥first dose date.
–If start date and stop date are missing, medicat ion will be assumed to occur both prior and 
concomitant ly.
For missing dates of conco mitant m edicat ion, the following will be conducted:
Missing start date:
–Day missing: the first day  of the m onth will be used for the start date.
–Month and day  missing: January  1 of that y ear will be used for the start date.
–Year, m onth and day  all missing: If date of birth is av ailable, use the date of birth as the 
start date. If date of birth is not available, estimate date of birth using the screening date 
and age, and use the est imated date of birth as the start date.
Missing end date:
–Day missing: the l ast day  of the m onth wi ll be used for the end date. If the imputed end 
date i s before the start date, keep the end date same as the start date.
–Month and day  missing: December 31 of that y ear will  be used for the end date.
–Year, m onth and day  all missing: December 31 of the last dose y ear will be used for the 
end date. If the imputed end date is before the start date, keep the end date same as the 
start date.
Medicat ion history  and concomitant m edicat ions will be coded using the 01MAR201 5Eversio n 
of the Worl d Heal th Organizat ion(WHO) Drug Dictionary  and summarized by  giving the 
number and percentage of subjects by  preferred term wit hin each therapeut ic class, with 
therapeuti c class and medicat ions in each class sorted in alphabetical order. The total number of

subjects wi th medications will also be summarized overall for open -label period, by  treatm ent 
groups and overall for the double -blind period . If a subject reports taking 2 drugs belo nging to 
the sam e class, he/she will only be counted once wit hin that class . Summaries of me dicati on 
history  and concomitant m edicat ion will be based on all subjects in the open -label period and 
rando mized subjects for the double -blind period.
All prior and conco mitant m edicati ons will be listed by  treatm ent, study  center and subject 
number. The listings will contain subject ident ifier, WHO Drug preferred term and reported 
term, dose, uni t, route, frequency , the indicat ion for whi ch the m edicat ion was being taken, start 
date, stop date, and whether the medicat ion was ongoing.
6.8 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance
The summary of study  drug exposure and com pliance will be based on the safet y set. Duration of 
exposure to study  medicati on is defined as (date of last dose –date of first dose +1 ). Since study  
medicat ion for the same subject in the open -label and double -blind periods may be different, the 
summary will be provided separately. Date of last dose is defined as the last dose in the treatment 
period.
Treatment duration will be summarized by durat ion category  in days (open -label period: 1 to 13 
days, 14 to 27 days, 28 to 41 days, 42 to 55 days, 56 to 69 day s, 70 to 83 days, 84 to 97 day s, 98 
to 111 days, and ≥112 days; double -blind period: 1 to 13 day s, 14 to 27 days, 28 to 55 day s, 56 
to 83 days, 84 to 111 days, 112 to 195 day s, and ≥196days) and the number of subjects in the 
doubl e-blind durat ion category  by treatm ent group. Treatment duration (weeks) will also be 
summarized using descript ive statist ics (n, m ean, SD, m edian, minimum, and maximum).
Percent of study  drug com pliance is defined as {(number of capsules dispensed –number of 
capsules returned)/(date of last dose –date of first dose +1)}x100%. If a value for the number of 
returned capsules is missing or the return date is missing, then 100% compliance will be assigned 
for each day up to the number of capsules dispensed or up to the date of return whichever is 
earlier.
For each treatment group, study  medicat ion compliance will be summarized by compliance 
category  (<80%, 80 to 120%, and ≥120%) and the number of subjects in each compliance 
category . Study  medicati on com pliance will  also be summarized as a continuous variable using 
descript ive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment group.
All study  drug administration and accountabilit y data will  be listed by treatm ent, study  site, and 
subject number. The fo llowing variables will be listed: subject identifier, visit number, first and 
last dose dates, medicat ion ident ificat ion number, date dispensed and returned, number of 
capsules dispensed and returned, and p ercent compliance.
6.9 Primary, Secondary and Additional Analyses
6.9.1 Overview of Primary, Secondary and Additional Variables
The analyses and summaries will be based on the FAS.
Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use

Lu AA21004_402 Page 19of 39
Statistical Analysis Plan, Final 12 June 2019
Relapse is defined as either:
a MADRS total score of 22 or more or
lack of efficacy  as determined by  the invest igator
other unsat isfactory  treatm ent response j udged by the invest igator .
The ‘Time to Relapse’ is in general defined as:
Date of Relapse –Date of Rando mizat ion (Vi sit 10) + 1
The date of relapse will normally be equal to the date of study  drug di scont inuat ion in the 
doubl e-blind treatment period. If the date of study  drug di scontinuati on is missing, date of last 
contact from study  visit discont inuat ion will be used. 
The time t o relapse will be analysed using two different convent ions:
Relapse Convention 1: Within 28 Weeks (primary):
This convent ion essent ially only considers data during the first 28 weeks of the 32- week double -
blind treatment, i.e., data up to week 44.
All wit hdrawals (relapses or other reasons) occurring after Visit 18/Week 44 will be regarded as 
censored observations and will be assigned the date of Visit 18 as censoring time. 
Patients who di d not rel apse and wit hdrew before or at Visit 18 will be con sidered as non -relapse 
and will receive the date of study  drug wi thdrawal as censoring time. If the date of study  drug 
withdrawal  is missing, the date of last contact will be used as censoring t ime.
The variables associated with these convent ions will be d efined as below,
Status_1: “0”indicat ing “Censoring”; “1” indicating “Relapse”
T_Rel apse_1: Time to Censoring or Relapse.
These variables will be the basis for the primary  analysis o f efficacy.
Relapse Convention 2: Complete double -blind period (Secondary):
All relapses occurring in the ent ire 32-week double -blind period will be considered. All 
withdrawals who did not relapse will be considered as non -relapse and will receive the date of 
study  drug wi thdrawal  as censoring time. If the date of study  drug wi thdrawal  is missing, the 
date of l ast contact will be used as censoring t ime.
The variables associated with these convent ions will be defined as below,
Status_2: “0”indicat ing “Censoring”; “1” indicating “Relapse”
T_Rel apse_2: Time to Censoring or Relapse .
These variables will be the basis for secondary  analysis o f efficacy.
The primary , secondary and addit ional variables for this study  are presented i n Table 6.c.

6.9.2 Missing Items on Rating Scales
The general rule when individual items are missing fro m a multiple-item assessment i s as 
follows: the total  score will be calculated using a SAS funct ion CEIL, as CEIL[(sum o f 
nonmissing items)×(total number of items)/(number of nonmissing items)]. If more than 20% of 
the items are missing, the total score will be set to missing. The MADRS total score will be set to 
missing if the number of missing items is at least 3. The result ing calculated total scores will be 
used in all analyses.
6.9.3 Analysis of P rimary Variable
The time fro m rando mizat ion to rel apse during the first 28 weeks of the 32- week double -blind 
treatm ent will be the primary variable. Primary  analysis will com pare the efficacy  of vorti oxetine 
(5, 10, and 20 mg) versus placebo based on a Cox proporti onal hazards model using an exact 
method to handle ties, with treatm ent as the factor and baseline MADRS total score a s the 
covari ate of  the Cox m odel.
The SAS code for the time -to-relapse analysis will be as fo llows:
proc phreg;
–class treat;
–model T_Relapse_1*status_1(0) =treat baseline / ties=exact;
Here, baseline is the MADRS score at the double -blind baseline (Baseline II). The analysis will 
be supplemented with plots of Kaplan -Meier estimates of relapse. The tests will be 2 -sided 
comparing eac h of the 3 doses of vortioxetine to placebo. Ninet y-five percent confidence 
intervals will be presented together with the estimated p -values.
In order to support the results of the primary  analyses, a number of sensit ivity analyses will be 
perform ed includ ing the one described in the secondary  analyses. In addit ion, since covariate 
adjustm ent in the Cox regression model requires stronger model assumpt ions, the covariate 
baseline MADRS total score will be excluded and only the treatment factor will be kept a s the 
independent variable in the Cox model of the primary  analysis. The standard log- rank test and

the accelerated failure t ime models will be also performed. Various distribut ion will be studied in 
the parametric models e.g. Weibull, log -normal and log-l ogistic. Sensit ivity analyses, using the 
same m ethodol ogy as for the primary  analysis, will be performed where patients with relapses 
occurring within the first 14 day s of the double -blind period are excluded (considered to have 
rebound instead of relapse) and where AE withdrawal is counted as relapse event, respectively. 
The primary  analyses (Cox m odel) will be also be repeated based on the PPS.
Some covari ates incl uding pool ed center, race, Baseline I and II MADRS scores, sex, baseline 
weight, BMI, and age with interaction terms may also be added to the Cox model of the primary  
efficacy  analysis for exploratory  analyses. 
For the primary  efficacy variable , subgroup analyses by:
age ( ≤median, >median).
sex (female, male).
race ( white, non -white).
Baseline IIMADRS ( ≤ median, > m edian).
and other variables, if necessary , will be perform ed if each of the subgroups con tains at l east 
20% of the total s ubjects in the study . The treatm ent groups will be co mpared within each 
subgroup. Addit ional exploratory  analyses examining subgroup effect and treatment by  subgroup 
interact ion may be perform ed.
6.9.4 Analysis of Secondary Variables
Change from double -blind Baseline II in MADRS total score will be analyzed using a mixed 
effects model for repeated m easurements (MMRM) analysis wit h treatment, week, baseline 
MADRS total score, treatm ent-by-week interacti onas fixed effects, center as ran dom effect, and 
acompletely  unstructured covari ance matrix .Study  visits wi th at least 50% of the subjects have 
non
-missing values will be included. Com parisons between the different doses of vortioxetine 
and placebo will be performed over all the assessment poi nts. 
The SAS code for the MMRM analysis will be as follows:
Proc mixed data=all;
–class week treat center subject;
–model Change = treat center week baseline week*treat /solution;
–repeated week/subject=subject ty pe=UN;
–rando m center;
–lsmeans week*tre at / cl  pdiff.
Here, b aseline is the MADRS score at baseline II, change i s the change in MADRS score from 
baseline II, and week is to be recounted from baseline II.
Change from Baseline II in the CGI -S will be analyzed by  study  visit (including all  visits for 
which at least 50% of the subjects have non -missing values) using MMRM similar to the model

Lu AA21004_402 Page 22of 39
Statistical Analysis Plan, Final 12 June 2019
described above for the change of MADRS total score. It should also be noted that the above 
longitudinal analyses (MMRM) on MADRS score change and CGI -S may be biased due to the 
unknown dropout pattern among the treatment groups. 
Observed CGI -I scores will be summarized by treatment group for each visit.
Time fro m randomization to relapse of MDD occurr ingduring the ent ire 32-week double -blind 
treatm ent peri od w ill be analyzed using a Cox model similar to the one described in 6.9.2 for the 
primary  variable. It may also be considered a sensitivit y analysis of the primary  variable.
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided and at the 5% l evel of significance. Ninet y-five percent 
confidence intervals will be presented together with the estimated p -values.
6.9.5 Analysis of Additional Variable s
The time fro m rando mizat ion to wi thdrawal for any  reason during 28 weeks of double -blind 
treatm ent, will  be analyzed using a Cox model similar to the one described in 6.9.2 for the 
primary  variable. 
The fo llowing summaries will be presented for C -SSRS scale:
Descript ive statistics by study visit.
Number of subjects with posit ive reports at baseline and during treatment.
A shift -table to dem onstrate changes in C -SSRS scores from  baseline during treatment.
A subject wi th a posi tive report at baseline if the subject reported any  of the f ollowing suicidal 
ideat ion or behavior:
Active suicidal ideat ion with som e intent to act, without specific plan.
Active suicidal ideat ion with specific plan and intent.
Any actual suicide attem pt.
Any interrupted suicide attempt.
Any aborted suicide attempt.
Any preparatory  acts or behavior.

6.9.6 Controlling Type I Error
To control  the ty pe I error for the primary efficacy endpo int, com parison between each dose of 
vorti oxetine and placebo will be tested in the sequent ial order of 20 mg vs placebo, 10 mg vs 
placebo, and 5 mg vs placebo at significan ce level  0.05; as soon as a dose is non -significant from 
placebo at 0.05, the testing procedure st ops for all subsequent dose(s).
6.10 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The pl asma concentration will be listed for each subject and summarized by each time point for 
each treatm ent group in both open -label and double -blind period (N, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum).
The populat ion pharmacokinetics of vortioxetineand i ts metabo lites will  be assessed by means 
of nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). Individual exposure parameters (eg, AUC 0-τ, 
Cavg, Cmax) maybe estimated and thei r correl ation wi th relevant pharmacodynamic parameters 
may be explored (effect and tolerabilit y/safet y). A separate populat ion pharmacokinet ics plan 
and report will be written.
6.11 Pharmacogenomic Analyses
No pharmacogeno mic analyses will be performed.
6.12 Safety Analysis
The safet y data will be summarized for the open -label period and double -blind period separately.
Safety summaries will be based on the safet y set.Conventions for the definit ion ofbaseline 
values and visit windowing are given in Section 6.1.3 . Missing safety  data will  not be imputed.
Safety summaries will include descriptive statist ics for values, changes, and incidence of events 
for all treatm ent groups combined in addit ion to summary by treatment group.
For adverse events with co mpletely or partially missing date, the fo llowing will be conducted:
Missing AE start dates:
–Day missing: 
•If the month and y ear are the same as those in the first dose date, the first dose date 
will be used to impute the start date.
•If the month and y ear are after the first dose date, the first of the month will be used 
to impute the start date.
–Month and day  missing:
•If the year is the same as the y ear of  the first dose, the first dose date will be used to 
impute the start date.
•If the year is after the year of the first dose, set the start date as January 1 .
–Year, m onth, day  all missing: the first dose date will be used to impute the start date.

Statistical Analysis Plan, Final 12 June 2019
Missing AE stop dates:
–Day missing: the l ast day  of the m onth will be used to impute the end date. If the imputed 
end date is before the AE start date, keep the end date same as the start date. If the subject 
died, use the date of death to impute the end date.
–Month and day  missing: If the year i s the same as or before the y ear of the l ast dose, set 
the end date as December 31. If the year is after the y ear of the l ast dose, set the end date 
as January  1.
–Year, m onth, day  all missing: Im pute the end date as December 31 of the last dose y ear. 
If the imputed end date is before the AE start date, keep the end date same as the start 
date. If the subject died, use the date of death to impute the end date.
6.12.1 Adverse Events
All adverse events will be coded using MedDRA version 18.0 or hi gher. In this dict ionary, each 
verbat im term is coded to a lower level term, and then mapped to a preferred MedDRA term, 
which is then mapped to an SOC. All adverse events will be included in the d ata list ings, but 
only treatm ent-emergent adverse events will be included in the summary  tables.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that 
occurs after receiving study  drug (AE start date ≥ first dose date) and within 30 days after 
receiving the last dose of study  drug (AE start date –last dose date ≤30). The first dose date and 
last dose date for the open label period and double blind period may  be defined different ly based 
on the summary table in the two treatment periods. A TEAE may also be a pretreatment adverse 
event or a concurrent medical condit ion diagnosed pri or to the date of first dose of study  drug 
that increases in severit y after the start of dosing. Adverse events data with onset occurring more 
than 30 days after last dose of study  drug (AE start date –last dose date >30) will be listed, but 
not included in the summary tables. Adverse events with missing onset dates will be summarized 
regardl ess of severit y and relati onship to study  medication.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) with onset that occurs after receiving study  drug (AE start date 
≥first dose date) and within 30 days after receiving the last dose of study  drug (AE start 
date -last dose date ≤30) will be summarized.
In the high -level adverse event summary  tables, TEAEs will  be summarized regardless of 
intensity and rel ationship to s tudy drug. Wi thin each subject, mult iple reports of events that map 
to a commo n MedDRA term will be counted only once.
At the adverse event level, the summary tables will present the number of subjects reporting each 
of these MedDRA events, ie, the number of subjects reporting 1 or more events that map to the 
given MedDRA term.
At the SOC l evel, the summary  tables will  present the number of subjects reporting 1 or more

In selected summaries (TEAEs overview, and TEAEs by  SOC and preferred term ), adverse 
events will be summarized by the number of events reported in add ition to the number and 
percentage of subjects with events.
For the summary  of TEAEs by  SOC, preferred term and maximum intensit y, if a subject 
experiences more than 1 episode of a particular coded adverse event, the subject will be counted 
only once within peri od by the maximum intensit y of the episode (preferred term). Similarly, if a 
subject has more than 1 adverse event within an SOC, the subject will be counted only once by 
the maximum intensit y in that SOC. Adverse events with missing severit y will beclassified as 
having the highest severit y.
TEAEs cl assified in the eCRF as possibly  or probably  related to the study  medicat ion will also 
be summarized by preferred term and SOC. If a subject experiences more than 1 episode of a 
particular coded adverse e vent, the subject will be counted only  once by  the m ost rel ated report 
for the preferred term. Similarly , if a subject has more than 1 adverse event within an SOC, the 
subject will be counted only  once by the m ost rel ated report i n that SOC. Adverse events with 
missing relat ionship will be classified as having the highest relationship to study  drug.
The fo llowing summaries will be presented separately for the open -label period and double -blind 
period:
Overview of TEAEs during the study - number and percenta ge of subjects, number of events.
TEAEs by  SOC and preferred term - number and percentage of subjects, number of events.
TEAEs by  SOC and preferred term  by sex (male and female) -number and percentage of 
subjects, number of events.

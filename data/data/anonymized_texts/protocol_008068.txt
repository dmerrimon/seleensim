PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  Intravenous Dexamethasone for Prolongation of Analgesia Following  
Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block for Shoulder Arthroscopy: A 
Randomized,  Controlled, Phase IV Dose  Response  Study  
Protocol Number:  2015 -853 
Protocol Date:  9/29/2016  
Sponsor:  Anesthesia Research Fund  
Principal Investigator:  Meghan Kirksey  
Products:  IV Dexamethasone (Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC)  
Objective:  The study is looking for findings that may allow clinicians to use lower 
doses of IV dexamethasone to maximize improve patient satisfaction, 
and minimize side effects.  
Study Design:  Randomized Control Trial  
Enrollment:  140 
Subject Criteria:  1. Patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy under regional 
anesthesia  
2. Ages 18 -80 
Study Duration:  • 5/23/16 -10/20/2017  
Data Collection:  Name, ID, age, ethnicity, race, gender, height, weight, BMI, ASA, 
time of IV Dexamethasone administration, block injection time, 
Midazolam dose, Midazolam time administration, Fentanyl time 
administration, Fentanyl dose, deviation from protocol, fingerstick 
blood glucose, NRS Score, NRS (average, worst, best), hand 
grip, motor exam, sensory exam, time of motor block resolution 
wrist, motor block resolution elbow, pain relief from block, time to 
first pain, time of normal s ensation , total daily amount of opioid 
taken, total daily amount of antiemetic taken, nausea, vomiting, 
pruritis, satisfaction with post op analgesia, Postop complications 
nerve injury, wound healing, infection, reason for dissatisfaction 
with postop analg esia, dose of IV dexamethasone . 
Outcome Parameters:  Duration of motor block from the supraclavicular block will be defined as 
the time from block placement to restoration of normal strength at both 
the wrist and elbow. Strength will be assessed before dis charge from 
PACU, on POD#1 and POD#2, and on POD#3 (if the block persists). A 
hand grip strength test will also be performed preoperatively  
in the holding area and postoperatively in the PACU.

1.0 INTRODUCTION : 
In order to determine the effects of IV dexamethasone on block duration and blood glucose  
levels, it is necessary to know the duration of such blocks in the absence of IV dexamethasone and 
the impact of surgery and anesthesia on blood glucose in the absence of IV dexamethasone. Should 
any patient develop postoperative nausea refractory to zofra n, other standard antiemetics can be 
administered, such as scopolamine, Trimethobenzamide, and reglan. IV dexamethasone can be 
administered for nausea in the PACU at the discretion of the prescriber, however this will be 
considered a deviation from protoco l and data from these patients will be analyzed as part of an 
intention to treat analysis.  
2.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION :  
Numerous studies have confirmed that perineural dexamethasone prolongs  
bupivacaine and ropivacaine brachial plexus blocks by approximately 10 hours  
(from approx. 12 to 22 hours) (1) without clinical evidence of toxicity. However,  perineural toxicity in an 
animal model has raised concern about its use as a  peripheral nerve block adjuvant (2). Moreover, 
recent studies suggest that high dose  IV dexa methasone (810mg)  prolongs analgesia to a similar 
degree as perineural  dexamethasone for interscalene  (3), supraclavicular  (4) and sciatic nerve  (5) 
blocks  performed with ropivacaine and bupivacaine. However these studies only utilized  fixed, high 
level do ses of IV dexamethasone. Moreover, there remains a concern  that high dose IV 
dexamethasone may lead to postoperative hyperglycemia and  could possibly increase the risk of 
postoperative wound infection  (6,8). Open surgery  under general anesthesia has been shown to 
increase blood glucose levels with a  peak at approximately 2 hours postinduction  and results have 
been conflicting  regarding whether or not IV dexamethasone causes greater increase  (9,10). To our  
knowledge, it is not yet known if arthroscopic surg ery under regional anesthesia  triggers a similar 
increase in blood glucose levels and if this is impacted by  administration of IV dexamethasone.  
3.0 OBJECTIVE OF CLINICAL STUDY  
A supraclavicular nerve block is an injection of numbing medication (local anesthet ic) near nerves 
that supply your shoulder that is often used to  provide numbness both during and after surgery.  The 
purpose of this study is to determine  the effect of a medication called  dexamethasone on the duration 
of the supraclavicular nerve block tha t you will receive for your surgery today. Advantages of 
prolonging the duration of a nerve  block include lower  pain levels  
and less of a need to use pain -killers, postoperatively.  
4.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES  
IV dexamethasone prolongs analgesia after supraclavicula r nerve blocks  
performed for shoulder arthroscopy and the effect is dose dependent.  
5.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is the “gold standard” for clinical research. These prospective  
studies have at least two groups. Patients meeting strict  
inclusion/exclusion criteria are  enrolled and randomly assigned to  
receive either an experimental intervention or to receive what is  
considered to be an acceptable alternative – usually the current  
standard of care or a placebo (e.g., study of hylauronic acid injection  
versus cortisone f or arthritis).

5.1 Study Duration  
There will be follow ups for the following days:  
POD0, POD1, POD2, POD3, POD 21.  
5.2 Endpoints  
 
5.2.1  Primary Endpoint  
• Participation will involve, at most, 5 study contacts – which will include one 
preoperative contact and up to four  following surgery. Follow up will be by phone on 
the first and second day after surgery to ask questions about pain, sensation, use of 
pain medication, and any problems after surgery.  If there are still numb from the 
block on the second day after surgery  (this is unlikely), we will follow up with a call on 
the third day.   
Secondary Endpoints  
• Three weeks after surgery (day 21), we will place a call for a final time to ask about 
subject’s experience and satisfaction with subject’s  care. Each  contact is expected to 
average about 15  minutes.  
5.2.2  Safety Evaluations:  
• Glucose test, surveys/questionnaires, randomization, surgery.  
5.3 Study Sites  
The study will be performed at the main hospital.

case. The designated dose of IV dexamethasone (either 0mg, 4mg, 6mg, or 8mg) will be  
prepared by someone other than the anesthesia provider  within a blinded syringe.

8.4 Adverse Event Relationship  
Participation in this research involves the potential risk of a breach of confidentiality to your 
stored health information.  HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some direct 
identifiers from stored information (i.e., names, social security nu mbers, medical recor d 
numbers) ; (ii) securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to information that would 
identify you ; and (iii) limiting access to informati on stored to HSS investigators.

9.0 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES, RECORD AND REPORTS  
 
9.1 Subject Consent and Information  
Patients will be identified from the OR schedule on the day before surgery. On the day of surgery, the 
RA or anesthesiologists will approach and consent eligible  patients in the holding area.  
9.2 Subject Data Protection  
Any information collected electronically will be stored on the REDCap server. The REDCap server 
and data are hosted by Weill Cornell Medical College CTSC, with the servers physically located in the 
Payson building of Weill Cornell New York Presbyterian Hospital. Access to this space is limited to 
members of the Hospital’s informatics department. Electronically, several intrusion protection  
mechanisms, including firewalls and encryption, are in place to protect the server and its data. Any 
paper based data sheets utilized for the study will be stripped of all personal identifiers whenever 
possible and stored the department’s locked office.

9.4 Protocol Reviews  
Literature searches will be conducted on a routine basis to search for latest news  
concerning dexamethasone and patient safety. If the drug is deemed unsafe at  
any point, or if significant development arise, immediate changes will be made to  
the study protocol and informed consent form.

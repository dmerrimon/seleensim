 1.0 Introduction 
Diabetes is one of the prevailing epidemics of the century. The increasing global 
prevalence of diabetes is challenging traditional approaches towards diabetes 
management.  Novel self-management tools, which aim to engage patients in daily 
diabetes care and optimize the role of health care professionals, may facilitate a more 
robust, scalable, and effective approach to the management of diabetes.  
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is a valuable tool for helping patients achieve and 
maintain target blood glucose levels to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. 
Particularly, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential requirement to 
adequately manage diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2. When performed and utilized 
properly, blood glucose meters for self-measurement of blood glucose allow diabetic 
patients to determine their blood glucose level and to use the information as part of their 
treatment program.  
Health coaching is defined as health education, promotion and support by a medical 
professional to enhance the well-being of individuals and facilitate the achievement of 
their health-related goals. Diabetes health coaching is provided by certified diabetes 
educator (CDE) giving overall guidance related to all aspects of diabetes to increase 
subject’s knowledge and skills about the disease and to promote self-care behaviors for 
effective self-management and glycemic control.  
A connected BGMS with a digital platform that enables real-time accessibility by the 
health coach to the patient’s clinical data, provides an effective way to intervene on real 
clinical information. Intervention in close proximity to recorded clinical events (e.g. 
hyperglycemic events, continuous out of range (OOR), etc.) on easy to remember 
occurrences may lead to more effective life change activities by the patient. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of digital self-monitoring blood glucose and 
diabetes health coaching, in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and its impact on diabetes 
clinical and wellness indicators over a period of 3 months.

 adverse event to the study device will be documented. The PI will sign the adverse event 
form. 
8.1 Definitions  
A
dverse Event  (AE) means any undesirable experiences (sign, symptom, illness, or other 
medical event) occurring to a subject, whether or not associated with the investigational 
product or related procedures. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any adverse event experience that results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to 
a body structure, or necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) means any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.2 
8.2 Reporting Requirements 
A
ccording to the study category (see Error! Reference source not found. ), the reporting 
requirements appropriate for this study are provided in 21 CFR 812.150(b) (1): 
“Unanticipated adverse device effects. A sponsor who conducts an evaluation of an 
unanticipated adverse device effect under § 812.46(b) shall report the results of such 
evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRB’s and participating investigators within 10 
working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect.  Thereafter the sponsor 
shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests .” 
Additionally, the clinical site staff is required to report all possible device malfunctions or 
failures observed during the study. These incidents will be documented in the relevant 
page of the CRF.

 8.3 Anticipated Adverse Events 
A
nticipated adverse events for the Dario™ BGMS include those that are reasonably 
expected to occur in association with any other type of commercially available BGMS 
intended for home use, which includes local pain at the finger prick site. Due to the fact 
that the device will be used only at the site and its results will not serve for treatment 
decisions, there are no other anticipated adverse events.   
 
Additional anticipated adverse events that may occur in the study are these associated 
with obtaining capillary blood sample e.g., local pain at needle insertion site, small 
hematoma, etc. 
8.4 Adverse Event Recording 
A
ll adverse events occurring during the study must be recorded by the investigator or 
delegate on the appropriate AE form in the subject’s CRF within a reasonable time (up to 
5 calendar days from being aware of the event).  
8.5 Expedited Reporting of SAE 
I
n the unlikely occurrence of a serious adverse event, such event must be reported to the 
sponsor within 24 hours of investigator’s/delegate's knowledge of the event by calling or 
emailing the information to: 
 
 
If applicable, the investigator should also inform the representative of the IRB within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the event. A copy of the report cover letter should be filed in 
the SSF.  
  
The sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the device and, if 
applicable, communicating the information with the FDA.

 9.2 Data Analyses 
D
ata will be analyzed comparing the quality of life and clinical outcome before and after 
the program.  
 
To assess the outcome of the study, the effect of intervention along with digital self-
monitoring will be evaluated. Paired group tests will be applied for comparing the results 
gathered on the same subjects after three months to the baseline values.  
 
 
10.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
10.1 Study Monitoring 
T
his study will be monitored by the sponsor’s representatives. The investigator will 
allocate adequate time to accommodate such monitoring activities.  The investigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given 
access to all study-related documents and study related facilities (e.g., clinic, laboratory, 
etc.). 
 
The sponsor will monitor the study as follows: 
- In the first week of the study 
- Six weeks into the study 
- In the end of the study 
10.2 Study Auditing and Inspecting 
T
he investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, 
the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies of all study related documents (e.g. CRF).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related 
facilities (e.g., clinic, laboratory, etc.). 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable compliance and quality assurance 
officers on behalf of the sponsor.

Title of the Protocol :  
An Open -Label Phase 1/2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Safety and Act ivity of Aldoxorubicin 
plus Ifosfamide /Mesna in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or Unresectable Soft Tissue 
Sarcoma  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the preliminary safety  of administration of 
aldoxorubic in in combination with ifosfamide  in subjects with metastatic , locally a dvanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events 
(AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs , echocardiograms 
(ECHO) or multiple -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan s, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and weight.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin  in combination with 
ifosfamide /mesna  in this population , assessed by overall response rate, progression -free survival 
(PFS) and PFS at 4 and 6 months.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulat ed in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models and i n patients with soft tissue 
sarcomas when compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas have a poor 
prognosis with progression -free survival of around 4-5 months and median overall survival  of 
approximately 15 months  after treatment with single agent doxorubicin.   Several chemotherapy 
regimens have been explored as palliative therapy for subject s with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. 
Combinations of ifosfamide and doxorubicin appear to offer t he highest response rates and longest 
time to progression.  However,  as currently administered  these regimens  are quite toxic  and have not 
significantly increased survival in these individuals.  Aldoxorubicin  in combination with a less toxic 
schedule for a dministering ifosfamide  may improve the activity of this combination without increasing 
its toxicity as has been demonstrated  for ifosfamide  as a single agent .

Protocol Number:  
ALDOXORUBICIN -P1/2-STS-03 Phase of Development: 1b/2 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 1 b/2 open -label study evaluating the preliminary safety and activity of aldoxorubicin  
administered at  either  170, 250 or 350  mg/m2 (125, 185 and 260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent s)  
intravenously ( IV) on Day 1 every 2 8 days plus 1 gm/m2/day ifosfamide  by continuous intravenous 
infusion for up to 14 days v ia a portable/ambulatory infusion pump using a central line such 
as port -a-cath or PICC line every 28 days  starting on Day 1 of each cycle,  with equivalent dose of  
mesna via IV infusion daily with ifosfamide  administration  until disease progression, unacc eptable 
toxicity or withdrawal of consent . A subsequent dose level of aldoxorubicin may be administered if < 2 
of 3 or < 3 of 6  subjects experience a DLT  during  Cycle s 1 and 2. The subsequent dose level may not 
be initiated until all subjects have complete d at least 2 cycles at the current dose level and approval is 
granted by the CytRx Medical Monitor.  
Subjects will visit the study site every 28 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete 
blood count [ CBC ], and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG  performance status  and 
ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using either ECHO  or 
MUGA scans . All subjects will have a CBC  on Day s 8, 11, 15, and 21  and a basic metabolic panel on 
Days 8, 15, and 21  at either the study site or at their local laboratory. Treatment will continue every 28 
days until tumor progression is observed,  unacceptable toxicity  occurs , or consent is withdrawn . 
Subjects will return to the study site on Days 4, 8, and 11 to have their ifosfamide infusion pump re -
filled and receive intravenous anti -emetics  and hydration therapy, if necessary.  On Day 15, subjects 
will return to the  study site to have their infusion pump turned off.  
Tumor response will be monitored every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1  through week 33, and then 
every 12 weeks until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST ) 1.1 cri teria.   For those subjects who stop treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression  and who d o not start another therapy, will  be followed 2 months following the End of 
Treatment scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  Progression -free survival , 
progression -free survival at  4 and 6 months will be monitored as other primary objectives.

Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 1 b/2 open -label stu dy evaluating the preliminary safety and activity of aldoxorubicin  
administered at  either  170, 250 or 350  mg/m2 (125, 185 and 260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent s)  
intravenously ( IV) on Day 1 every 2 8 days plus 1 gm/m2/day ifosfamide  by continuous intravenou s 
infusion for up to 14 days via a portable/ambulatory infusion pump using a central line such 
as port -a-cath or PICC line every 28 days  starting on Day 1 of each cycle,  with equivalent dose of  
mesna via IV infusion daily with ifosfamide  administration  until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or withdrawal of consent . A subsequent dose level of aldoxorubicin may be administered if < 2 
of 3 or < 3 of 6  subjects experience a DLT  during  Cycle s 1 and 2. The subsequent dose level may not 
be initiated un til all subjects have completed at least 2 cycles at the current dose level and approval is 
granted by the CytRx Medical Monitor.  Treatment with granulocyte colo ny-stimulating factor (G -CSF)  
should be administered for all subjects as per investigator’s cli nical judgment or  according to ASCO 
Guidelines (Appendix E).  Note:  aldoxorubicin, at higher doses, has been associated with >20% 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.    
Subjects will visit the study site every 28 days for their IV infusions, at which t ime safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry  and 
complete blood count [ CBC ]), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG  performance status  and 
ECG s will be performed.  All subjects  will have bl ood drawn for serum electrolytes to evaluate the 
anion gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using 
either ECHO  or MUGA scans . All subjects will have a CBC  on Day s 8, 11, 15, and 21  and a basic 
metabolic panel on Days 8, 15, and 21  at either the study site or at their local laboratory. Treatment 
will continue every 28 days until tumor progression is observed,  unacceptable toxicity occurs , or 
consent is withdrawn . Subjects will return to the study site on D ays 4, 8, and 11 to have their 
ifosfamide infusion pump re -filled and receive intravenous anti -emetics  and hydration therapy, if 
necessary.  On Day 15, subjects will return to the study site to have their infusion pump turned off.  
Tumor response will be mo nitored every 8 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle 1 -Day 1  through week 32, and 
then every 12 weeks (±5 days) until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria.   For those subjects who stop treatment for reasons  other than 
disease progression  and who d o not start another therapy, will  be followed 2 months following the 
End of Treatment scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  Progression -free 
survival , progression -free survival at  4 and 6 months will be monitored as other primary objectives.

Protocol Number:  
ALDOXORUBICIN -P1/2-STS-03 Phase of Development: 1b/2 
 
Title of the Protocol :  
An Open -Label  Phase 1/2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Safety and Activity of Aldoxorubicin 
plus Ifosfamide /Mesna in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or Unresectable Soft Tissue 
Sarcoma  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective  of this study is to det ermine the preliminary safety  of administration of 
aldoxorubicin  in combination with ifosfamide  in subjects with metastatic , locally a dvanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events 
(AEs), abnormal f indings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiograms 
(ECHO) or multiple -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan s, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and weight.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin  in combination with 
ifosfamide /mesna  in this population , assessed by overall response rate, progression -free survival 
(PFS) and PFS at 4 and 6 months.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin  is a novel prodrug that binds c ovalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor  activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models and in patients with soft tissue 
sarcomas when compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas have a poor 
prognosis with progression -free survival of around 4-5 months and median overall survival of 
approximately 15 months  after treatment with single agent doxorubicin.   Several chemotherapy 
regimens have been explored as palliative therapy for subject s with advanced soft tissue sarcomas . 
Combinations of ifosfamide and doxorubicin appear to offer the highest response rates and longest 
time to progression.  However,  as currently administered  these regimens  are quite toxic  and have not 
significantly increased survival in these individuals.  Aldoxorubicin  in combination with a less toxic 
schedule for administering ifosfamide  may improve the activity of this combination without increasing 
its toxicity as has been demonstrated  for ifosfamide  as a single agent .

Protocol Number:  
ALDOXORUBICIN -P1/2-STS-03 Phase of Development: 1b/2 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 1 b/2 open -label study evaluating the preliminary safety and activity of aldoxorubicin  
administered at  either  170 or 250 mg/m2 (125 and 185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent s)  intravenously 
(IV) on Day 1 every 2 8 days plus 1 gm/m2/day ifosfamide  by continuous intravenous infusion for 
up to 10-14 days  (based on tolerability)  via a portable/ambulatory infusion pump using a 
central line such as port -a-cath or PICC line every 28 days  starting on Day 1 of each cycle,  with 
equivalent dose of  mesna via IV  infusion daily with ifosfamide  administration  for 6 cycles. A 
subsequent dose level of aldoxorubicin may be administered if < 2 of 3 or < 3 of 6  subjects 
experience a DLT  during  Cycle s 1 and 2. The subsequent dose level may not be initiated until all 
subjects have completed at least 2 cycles at the current dose level and approval is granted by the 
CytRx Medical Monitor.  Treatment with granulocyte colo ny-stimulating factor (G -CSF)  should be 
administered for all subjects as per investigator’s clinical judgme nt or according to ASCO Guidelines 
(Appendix E).  Note:  aldoxorubicin, at higher doses, has been associated with >20% incidence 
of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.   Subjects with response (CR,  PR, or SD) to initial combination therapy 
may continue with aldoxoru bicin alone every 21 days at the same dose as used with the combination  
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  
Subjects will visit the study site every 28 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry  and 
complete blood count [ CBC ]), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG  performance status  and 
ECG s will be performed.  All subjects  will have blood drawn for serum electr olytes to evaluate the 
anion gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using 
either ECHO  or MUGA scans . All subjects will have a CBC  on Day s 8, 11, 15, and 21  and a basic 
metabolic panel on Days 8, 15, and 2 1 at either the study site or at their local laboratory. Subjects will 
return to the study site on Days 4, 8, and 11 to have their ifosfamide infusion pump re -filled and 
receive intravenous anti -emetics  and hydration therapy, if necessary.  Between  days 11 -15, subjects 
will return to the study site to have their infusion pump turned off. Treatment with aldoxorubicin  and 
ifosfamide /mesna will continue every 28 days for 6 cycles.  Subjects with response (CR, PR, or SD) 
to initial combination therapy may  conti nue with aldoxorubicin alone every 21 day s at the same dose 
as used with the combination until disease progression is observed,  unacceptable toxicity occurs , or 
consent is withdrawn .  
Tumor response will be monitored every 8 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through week 32, and 
then every 12 weeks (±5 days) until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria.   For those subjects who stop treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression  and who d o not start another therapy, will  be followed 2 months following the 
End of Treatment scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  Progression -free 
survival , progression -free survival at  4 and 6 months will be monitored as other primary objectives.

Title of th e Protocol :  
An Open -Label Phase 1/2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Safety and Activity of Aldoxorubicin 
plus Ifosfamide /Mesna in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or Unresectable Soft Tissue 
Sarcoma  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objecti ve of this study is to determine the preliminary safety  of administration of 
aldoxorubicin  in combination with ifosfamide  in subjects with metastatic , locally a dvanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma as measured by the frequency and severity of advers e events 
(AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiograms 
(ECHO) or multiple -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan s, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and weight.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin  in combination with 
ifosfamide /mesna  in this population , assessed by overall response rate, progression -free survival 
(PFS) and PFS at 4 and 6 months.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demons trated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models and in patients with soft tissue 
sarcomas when compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas have a poor 
prognosis with progression -free survival of around 4-5 months and median overall survival of 
approximately 15 months  after treatment with single agent doxorubicin.   Several chemotherapy 
regimens have been explored as palliative therapy for subject s with adv anced soft tissue sarcomas. 
Combinations of ifosfamide and doxorubicin appear to offer the highest response rates and longest 
time to progression.  However,  as currently administered  these regimens  are quite toxic  and have not 
significantly increased survi val in these individuals.  Aldoxorubicin  in combination with a less toxic 
schedule for administering ifosfamide  may improve the activity of this combination without increasing 
its toxicity as has been demonstrated  for ifosfamide  as a single agent .

Study D esign and Methodology:  
This is a phase 1 b/2 open -label study evaluating the preliminary safety and activity of aldoxorubicin  
administered at  either  170 or 250 mg/m2 (125 and 185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent s)  intravenously 
(IV) on Day 1 every 2 8 days plus 1 gm/m2/day ifosfamide  by continuous intravenous infusion for 
up to 10-14 days  (based on tolerability)  via a portable/ambulatory infusion pump using a 
central line such as port -a-cath or PICC line every 28 days  starting on Day 1 of each cycle,  with 
equivalent dose of  mesna via IV infusion daily with ifosfamide  administration  for 6 cycles. A 
subsequent dose level of aldoxorubicin may be administered if < 2 of 3 or < 3 of 6  subjects 
experience a DLT  during  Cycle s 1 and 2. The subsequent dose level may not b e initiated until all 
subjects have completed at least 2 cycles at the current dose level and approval is granted by the 
CytRx Medical Monitor.  Treatment with granulocyte colo ny-stimulating factor (G -CSF)  should be 
administered for all subjects as per inve stigator’s clinical judgment or  according to ASCO Guidelines 
(Appendix E).  Note:  aldoxorubicin, at higher doses, has been associated with >20% incidence 
of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.   Subjects with response (CR,  PR, or SD) to initial combination therapy 
may continue with aldoxorubicin alone every 21 days at the same dose as used with the combination  
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  
The study is being expanded to further evaluate  both the safety and efficacy observ ed to date  with 
this combination .  Seven subjects were enrolled in the aldoxorubicin (170 mg/m2) + ifosfamide /mesna  
dose group without any dose -limiting toxicities.  Similarly, 17 subjects have been enrolled in the 
aldoxorubicin (250 mg/m2) + ifosfamide /mesna dose group without any dose -limiting toxicities.  The 
most common Grade 3/4 adverse events across both cohorts have been neutropenia and anemia, 
both medically manageable. To date, there have been 6 subjects with confirmed partial responses  
and 10 subj ects with stable disease across both dose groups.  Ten additional subjects , for a total of 
40 subjects,  will be added across two cohorts: 1) 250 mg/m2 aldoxorubicin + ifosfamide /mesna  (10-
14 days)  dose group  in previously untreated subjects (current study  design), and 2) 250 mg/m2 
aldoxorubicin + ifosfamide /mesna  at a dose of 1 gm/m2 for  up to 10 days in previously treated 
subjects.  
Subjects will visit the study site every 28 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry  and 
complete blood count [ CBC ]), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG  performance status  and 
ECG s will be performed.  All subjects  will have blood drawn for serum electrolytes to evalu ate the 
anion gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using 
either ECHO  or MUGA scans . All subjects will have a CBC  on Day s 8, 11, 15, and 21  and a basic 
metabolic panel on Days 8, 15, and 21  at either the  study site or at their local laboratory. Subjects will 
return to the study site on Days 4, 8, and 11  (except for those receiving up to 10 days of ifosfamide 
treatment)  to have their ifosfamide infusion pump re -filled and receive intravenous anti -emetics  and 
hydration therapy, if necessary.  Between  days 11 -15, subjects will return to the study site to have 
their ifosfamide infusion pump turned off. For those subjects receiving ifosfamide for  up to  10 days, 
they will return t o the study site between days 10-11 to have their  ifosfamide  infusion pump turned off. 
Treatment with aldoxorubicin  and ifosfamide /mesna will continue every 28 days for 6 cycles.  
Subjects with response (CR, PR, or SD) to initial combination therapy may  continue with 
aldoxorubicin alone every 21 day s at the same dose as used with the combination until disease 
progression is observed,  unacceptable toxicity occurs , or consent is withdrawn .  
Tumor response will be monitored every 8 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle 1 -Day 1  through week 32, and 
then every 12 weeks (±5 days) until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria.   For those subjects who stop treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression  and who d o not start another therapy, will  be followed 2 months following the 
End of Treatment scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  Progression -free 
survival , progression -free survival at  4 and 6 months will be monitored as other primary objectives.

days)  dose group  in previously un treated subjects (current study design), and 2) 250 mg/m2 
aldoxorubicin + ifosfamide /mesna  at a dose of 1 gm/m2 for  up to 10 days in previously treated 
subjects.  
The aldoxorubicin 250 mg/m2 + ifosfamide/mesna dose group is being expanded a second time to 
further assess the preliminary activity and safety of this combination. Thirty -one (31) subjects (22 first -
line and 9 previously treated) have been enrolled in the aldoxorubicin (250 mg/m2) + 
ifosfamide/mesna dose group without any dose -limiting toxicities .  The most common Grade 3/4 
adverse events have been neutropenia and anemia, both medically manageable. To date, there have 
been 4 subjects with confirmed partial responses and 13 subjects with stable disease in the 250 
mg/mg2 + ifosfamide/mesna dose grou p.  Forty additional subjects, for a total of 80 subjects (73 in the 
250 mg/m2 + ifosfamide/mesna dose group), will be added equally (20 subjects per cohort) across 
two cohorts: 1) 250 mg/m2 aldoxorubicin + ifosfamide/mesna (10 -14 days) dose group in previ ously 
untreated subjects (current study design), and 2) 250 mg/m2 aldoxorubicin + ifosfamide/mesna at a 
dose of 1 gm/m2 for up to 10 days in previously treated subjects.

Study Design and Methodology  (cont.) : 
Subjects will visit the study site every 28 da ys for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, 
including AEs, a directed physical examination, laboratory evaluations (serum chemistry and 
complete blood count [CBC]), vital signs, weight measurements, ECOG performance status and 
ECGs will be performed.  All subjects will have blood drawn for serum electrolytes to evaluate the 
anion gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically using 
either ECHO or MUGA scans. All subjects will have a CBC on Days 8, 11, 15, and 21 and a basic 
metabolic panel on Days 8, 15, and 21 at either the study site or at their local laboratory. Subjects will 
return to the study site on Days 4, 8, and 11 (except for those receiving up to 10 days of ifosfamide 
treatment) to have t heir ifosfamide infusion pump re -filled and receive intravenous anti -emetics and 
hydration therapy, if necessary.  Between days 11 -15, subjects will return to the study site to have 
their ifosfamide infusion pump turned off. For those subjects receiving if osfamide for up to 10 days, 
they will return to the study site between days 10 -11 to have their ifosfamide infusion pump turned off. 
Treatment with aldoxorubicin and ifosfamide/mesna will continue every 28 days for 6 cycles.  
Subjects with response (CR, PR , or SD) to initial combination therapy may continue with 
aldoxorubicin alone every 21 days at the same dose as used with the combination until disease 
progression is observed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or consent is withdrawn.  
Tumor response will be monitored every 8 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through week 32, and 
then every 12 weeks (±5 days) until disease progression using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.  For those subjects who stop treatment for reaso ns other than 
disease progression and who do not start another therapy, will be followed 2 months following the 
End of Treatment scan, and then every 3 months until disease progression.  Progression -free 
survival, progression -free survival at 4 and 6 month s will be monitored as other primary objectives.

Num ber of Subjects:  
Up to 80 study subjects will be treated  at US study centers . 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  adding a solution of 
50% ethanol:  50% sterile water, administration completed  within 2 h ours (of being reconstituted)  as a 
30 min ute IV infusion  in Lactated Ringer’s solution .  Total dose of  170 or 250 mg/m2 (125 and 185 
mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent s). 
Ifosfamide single -dose vials for constitution and a dministration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams 
of sterile ifosfamide , USP . Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. Injections are prepared for parenteral use by 
adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP , or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP  (benzyl 
alcohol or parabens preserved) to the vial and shaking to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution  and may be admin istered as a continuous IV infusion for 
up to  14 consecutive days . 
Adjunctive  Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Mesna Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous solution of colorless to light pink appearance in 
clear glass multidose vials for i ntravenous administration. Mesna injection contains 100 mg/mL 
mesna, 0.25 mg/mL edetate disodium, sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment and q.s with Water for 
Injection. Mesna injection multidose vials also contain 10.4 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol as a 
preservati ve. The solution has a pH range of 6.5 to 7.4.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Activity :

Protocol Number:  
ALDOXORUBICIN -P1/2-STS-03 Phase of Development: 1b/2 
 
Safety:  
The following safety variables will be assessed over the duration of the study : 
 Adverse events  
 Ability to remain on assigned treatment (tolerability)  
 Clinical and laboratory data including physical exami nations, vital signs, weight , 
MUG A/ECHO , ECG results and laboratory test results  
 Use of concomitant medications  
Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the modified intention -to-treat principle, all enrolled  subjects who enter active 
treatment and have had at least 1 dose of study medication and 1 post -dose efficacy measurement 
will be included in the primary  efficacy analyses .   
Activity :   
Tumor response will be monitored every  8 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle 1 -Day1 through week 32, and 
then every 12 weeks  (±5 days)  until disease progression . Objective response will be evaluated using 
the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).[29] Changes (i.e., improvements ) 
in tumor measurements from baseline values will be assigned a status of CR or PR. Objective 
response measurements will comprise the sum of CR plus PR. The overall response rate, as well as 
the rates for the individual categories of response (i.e., CR, PR , SD, and PD), will be estimated by the 
percentage of subjects achieving these criteria . For the estimation of progression -free survival a 
Kaplan -Meier analysis will be performed.  The percentage of subjects with complete or partial 
responses, or stable  disease will be evaluated at 4 and 6 months.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, 
and abnormal laboratory tests will be summarized for each cohort . Adverse events, ability to remain 
on ass igned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, 
weight, ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant medications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment groups.  Desc riptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provided.

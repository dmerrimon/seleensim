Introduction:  
VT-1161 is an orally -available inhibitor of  fungal CYP51 that has shown high potency and selectivity in 
in vitro  studies.  VT-1161 blocks the production of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell 
membrane, which is critical to fungal growth.  In vitro  and in vivo  pharmacology studies have 
demonstr ated that VT -1161 is highly active against Candida albicans , including fluconazole -resistant 
C. albicans , and non- albicans Candida species that cause vulvovaginal candidiasis  (VVC) .  VT -1161 is 
highly selective for fungal CYP51 relative to off -target human  CYP enzymes, and data to date suggest 
that it may avoid the side -effect profile that limits the use of commonly prescribed azole antifungal 
agents.  
Oral VT -1161 has been evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 studies and shown to be safe, well tolerated , and 
highly effective in the treatment of vulvovaginal infections caused by Candida species.  For example, i n 
a Phase 2b study in subjects with recurrent VVC (RVVC) , subjects in the 12- week VT -1161 treatment 
group ( 150 mg VT -1161 once daily for 7 days followed by 150 mg VT -1161 once weekly for 11 weeks) 
showed a 4.8% recurrence rate through Week  48 compared with a 52% recurrence rate in the placebo 
group in the intent -to-treat analysis.  
RVVC , defined as 3 or mor e acute VVC episode s over a 12 -month period, is experienced by 5 to 
7 million women each year in the US.  Candida albicans is the leading cause of recurrent vulvovaginal 
yeast infections in the United States.  However, there has been an increasing trend in the number of 
vaginal yeast infections attributable to non-albicans spec ies such as C.  glabrata and C. tropicalis .  In 
addition to the use of topical products to treat VVC, the majority of the women visiting healthcare 
professionals receive fluconazole for the treatment of each acute episode.  A  smaller percentage are 
prescribed a fluconazole maintenance regimen although fluconazole is not currently approved for the 
treatment of RVVC.  Since some of the C. albicans  and the majority of non- albicans isolates are resistant 
to fluconazole, the management of RVVC has become even more challenging.  
In both nonclinical studies and clinical trials conducted to date, VT -1161 has demonstrated a favorable 
safety and tolerability profile, with no discernable adverse effect on liver function.  In reproductive 
toxicity studies  in pregnant rats or rabbits , VT-1161 was not teratogenic at any exposure studied.  In a 
recent CYP3A4 drug -drug interaction study utilizing midazolam as the substrate, no clinically significant 
inhibition and only weak induction of midazola m metabolism was observed.  These data are favorable 
when compared to other oral antifungal agents  such as fluconazole.  This study is to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of VT-1161 compared to fluconazole  in treating acute VVC infections in  RVVC  subjects.

6 Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral VT -1161 in the prevention of culture -verified acute episodes 
of VVC through Week  50 in RVVC subjects . 
• To compare the efficacy of oral VT -1161 and fluconazole in the treatment of an acute VVC  
episode in  RVVC  subjects. 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral VT- 1161 through Week 50. 
Methodology:  
Study Design: 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
VT-1161 oral capsules versus fluconazole in the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes in 
subjects with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.  In addition, the study will evaluate the efficacy of oral 
VT-1161 compared to placebo in the prevention  of RVVC th rough Week  50 after treating the acute 
episodes of VVC with treatment of VT -1161 or fluconazole .  Approximately 1 80 subjects will be 
randomized, 120 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 60 subjects in the fluconazole and placebo arm.  
Subjects must have a histor y of RVVC, defined as at least 3 episodes of acute VVC in the past 12 months, 
as described below:  
• Subjects must have an acute VVC episode at the time of Screening, with a documented positive 
potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) performed at the investigative site  
• Subjects must also have had 2 or more additional episodes of acute VVC in the past 12  months, 
with at least 1 of the episodes documented by a positive confirmatory laboratory test (i.e., culture, 
PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, a documented Papanicolaou (Pap) test, or other approved diagnostic 
tests)  
Subjects must also have an acute VVC episode at Screening, defined as a total  signs and symptoms score 
of ≥3. 
The study consists of two Phases:  
1) an Induction Phase for the treatment of the acute VVC episode  in which s ubject s will be randomized 
to receive one of the following:  
• 600 mg VT -1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) 
on Day 2, or  
• 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of over -encapsulated fluconazole. 
2) a Maintenance Phase in which subjects initially randomized to receive VT -1161 in the Induction Phase 
will receive 150 mg VT-1161 (1 x 150 mg capsule) weekly for 11 weeks and will then enter a 37 -week 
follow- up period.  Subjects randomized to receive over-encapsulated  fluconazole in the Induction Phase 
will receive placebo weekly for 11  weeks and will then enter a 37 -week follow-up period. 
Once subjects have provided informed consent  or assent (for those ages 12 -17) the investigational site

7 will evaluate al l subjects by completing a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital signs, 
weight and height, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests, reviewing clinical signs and symptoms 
of vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of the 
vagina, performing a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear to confirm the presence of yeast, and 
collecting vaginal swabs to establish a baseline culture for identification of fungal species.  Eligible 
subjects must have an acute VVC episode at Screening, defined as a total signs and symptoms score of 
≥3 and a positive local KOH wet mount preparation from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous 
hyphae/pseudohyphae and/or  budding yeast cells, and must meet other initial entr y criteria.  Once 
eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized to enter the Induction Phase.  
At Screening (Day 1), subjects presenting with an acute infection and meeting all study eligibility criteria 
will enter the Induction Phase where they wi ll be randomized 2:1 ratio to receive either 600 mg VT -1161 
(4 x 150  mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2, or 3 sequential 
150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of over-encapsulated fluconazole.  Subjects will return approximately 
14 days after the first dose of VT-1161 or over -encapsulated  fluconazole to determine if the acute VVC 
infection ha s resolved (defined by a signs and symptoms score of <3).  If the acute VVC has not resolved, 
the subject will be considered a screen failure and encouraged to see their physician for follow- up care.  
All subjects in which the acute VVC infection has resolved will continue into a Maintenance Phase . 
Subjects initially randomized to receive VT -1161 in the Inducti on Phase will  receive 150 mg VT-1161 
(1 x 150 mg capsule) weekly for 1 1 weeks and will then enter a 37 -week follow -up period.  Whereas 
subjects randomized to receive over-encapsulated fluconazole in the Induction Phase will  receive 
placebo weekly for 11 we eks and will then en ter a 3 7-week follow-up period. 
Subject’s Day 1 (Screening ) is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
administration and subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive days thereafter.   
Subje ct’s Day 14  is defined as the first day of weekly dosing of IMP administration.   
Study Duration: 
The study duration is  expected to be approximately 18 months from screening of the first subject until 
last follow -up of the last subject. 
Subject Participation:  
The duration of individual subject participation will be approximately 50 weeks.  See Table 1 for the 
Schedule of Assessments and Procedures  which will be performed.   After Screening, subjects will return 
to the clinic on Day  14 (±2 days) , the start of the Maintenance Phase.  Subjects will then have visits on 
Weeks 8 (±7 days), 14 (±14 days)  (end of treatment [EOT]) , 20 (±14 days), 26 (±14 days), 32 (±14  days), 
38 (±14 days), 44 (±14 days) and 50  (±14  days) (end of study [EOS]).  Subjects who return to the clinic 
for a recurrent acute VVC episode should be evaluated as per the unscheduled visit noted in the Schedule 
of Assessment and Procedures.

8 Scoring of Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms:  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptom s will b e evaluat ed at  Screening and at each subsequent study visit.  
Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be scored  and the individual scores 
combined, for a maximum score of 18 using the following scale: 
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation 
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows: 
0 = none (complete absence of any sign or symptom) 
1 = mild (slight)  
2 = moderate ( present ) 
3 = severe (marked, intense) 
 
Mycology Assessment:  
A local mycological assessment using KOH wet mount followed by microscopy will be evaluated at the 
Screening (Day 1) and at any study visit where a recurrent acute VVC episode is suspected.  In addition, 
a vaginal swab for culture test ing will be obtained and sent to the central mycology laboratory at the 
Screening and each subsequent study visit.  
Plasma Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples for assay of VT -1161 plasma concentrations will be collected from subjects at Day 14, 
Week 1 4 and Week  50 visits.  
Intense sampling will be obtained  from approximately 12 consenting subject s at participating sites on 
Day 1 and on Day 2, at time points predose and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing.   
Safety:  
Subject safety will be monitored by collection of adverse events (AEs) , changes in vital signs, physical 
and vaginal exam parameters, ECGs, and safety laboratory parameters, including pregnancy tests for 
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). 
Concomitant Medications:  
The following prescription and over-the-counter drug products are prohibited during the study and will 
be considered a protocol deviation:  
1. Topical or oral antifungal drugs ( with the exception of fluconazole when prescribed by the 
Investigator to treat  a subject with a recurrent  VVC epis ode.  If subject fails to respond to 
fluconazole treatment, the Investigator may employ treatment options corresponding to the site’s 
standard of care treatment to treat the infection upon consult with the Medical Monitor.)  
2. Topical products applied to the  vulva or vagina (e.g. antibiotic, antitrichomonal, corticosteroids, or 
anti-inflammatory agents).  
3. Oral antibacterial or antitrichomonal agents for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas, 
or other concomitant  urogenital infection unless prescribed by the Investigator . 
4. Oral or injectable corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs for the duration of the study. Use of 
topical (no vulvar or vaginal steroids), inhaled, ophthalmic, or intraarticular and intralesional

Study Populations:  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Per Protocol Population (PP): All randomized subjects who had the following:  
• Had no deviations to inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact treatment outcome. 
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% compliance during the 
Induction Phase and ≥50% compliance during the Maintenance P hase.  
• Had the Week 50 visit completed within the acceptable time window (±14 days).  
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome. 
Modified ITT: All enroll ed subjects who had the following: 
• Positive KOH at Screening.  
• Positive culture at Screening.  
• Negative culture at Day 14 . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in Table 1. Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT, PP, and mITT Populations.  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more culture- verified 
acute VVC episodes (post -randomization through Week 50) in the ITT population, which will include 
the subjects who failed  clearing their infection during the Induction Phase . An acute VVC episode 
(considered a recurrent episode) is defined as a positive culture for Candida  species and a clinical signs 
and symptoms score of ≥3. 
The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following:

14 a. The pro portion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections  (clinic al signs and symptoms 
score of < 3) at Day 14 following treatment with VT -1161 or fluconazole.  
b. The proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and 
symptoms of ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase ( post Day 14  through Week 50). 
c. Time to first recurrence of a culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and symptoms score 
≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14  through Week 50). 
d. The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the Maintenance 
Phase.  
Safety:  
All safety analyses will be perfo rmed on the Safety Population.  AEs will be collected throughout the 
study.  Physical and vaginal examination findings and vital signs will be recorded at Screening  and 
throughout the study per Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
ECGs  and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained throughout 
the study. All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to Screening through 
the Week 50 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  Pertinent and all major medical 
conditions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.    
Subject s who want to discontinue from the study  should be encouraged to remain in the study for all 
remaining visits through Week 50 for safety and efficacy assessments.  All subjects who discontinue 
early from the study should have all EOS procedures performed on the day of discontinuation.  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
A statistical analysis plan will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled . 
Efficacy Analysis:  
The statistical objective s of this study will be: 
1. To determine if there is a difference in the proportions of subjects with one or more episodes of 
culture- verified acute VVC in those receiving VT -1161 compared to those receiving placebo  
2. To determine if there is a difference in the ability of VT- 1161 and fluconazole to resolve acute 
episodes in subjects with RVVC. 
A sample size of 82 subjects  in the VT -1161 arm and 41 subjects in the fluconazole/ placebo arm provides 
at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference between the VT -1161 treatment group and the 
fluconazole / placebo treatment g roup with a type 1 error rate of 0.05.  Sample size calculation assumes 
50% of the subjects in the placebo arm will have at least one culture- verified acute VVC episode post -
randomization through Week 50. For the first key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with 
resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment 
with VT -1161 or fluconazole,  a sample size of 120 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 60 subjects in the 
fluconazole/placebo arm provides at least 88% power to detect non- inferiority between the VT -1161 
treatment group and the fluconazole treatment group with a non- inferiority margin of 15% and a type 1 
error rate of 0.05. The s ample size calculation assumes that 90% of the subjects in the f luconazole arm 
will resolve their acute VVC infection by Day 14. 
For the efficacy analyses, missing values for the investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and symptoms 
or the culture result will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  For subjects who 
discontinue the study early and have missing assessments for all visits after discontinuation, the missing

15 values for the expected scheduled visits will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  
The missing values will be imputed using the following auxiliary information: region, treatment, baseline 
BMI, baseline age, ethnicity, and visit.   
A chi -square test will be used to compare the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -verified 
acute VVC in those receiving VT -1161 compared to those receiving fluconazole and placebo.  The 
proportion of subjects who have cleared their infection at Day 14 in those receiving VT -1161 will be 
evaluated for non- inferiority versus those receiving fluconazole  utilizing a non -inferiority margin o f 
15%. 
Safety Analysis:  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s® dictionary.  The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting treatment- emergent AEs will be tabulated by system organ class, 
preferred term, and greatest severity with a breakdown by treatment group.  Mean changes from pre -
treatment in vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
No formal statistical hypothesis testing related to pharmacokinetics will be conducted.  VT-1161 
concentrations will be presented by visit with descriptive statistics.  The pharmacokinetic data will be 
used in a cross -population pharmacokinetic analysis that will be presented in a separate report.  
Blood samples for assay of  VT-1161 plasma concentrations will be collected from subjects prior to IMP 
on Day 14 and Week  14 and at Week 50. Intense sampling will be obtained only from consenting subject s 
at participating sites on Day 1 and Day 2 (predose  and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing , with ±10-minute 
window per timepoint).

17 a. All medic ation taken 30 days prior to Screening  and all non- pharmacologic treatments received 72 hours prior to Screening  will be recorded through the EOS 
visit.  
b. Weight only . 
c. Vital signs include sitting heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate.   
d. Limited physical examination, i.e. vaginal spec ulum examination plus a symptom directed physical examination . 
e. Subjects participating in the intense Day 1 and Day 2 PK collection will have samples taken predose and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing.  All subjects will 
have PK draws prior to IMP on  Day 14 and Week 14 and at Week 50.  
f. Serum chemistry (creatinine, BUN, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, albumin, total protein, total carbon dioxide, glucose, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphorus,  creatine phosphokinase [CK] , cholesterol and triglycerides ). Testing for HbA1c is performed only in 
known or suspected diabetic subjects at Screening. Cultures to test  for Chlamydia trachomatis  and Neisseria go norrhoeae  will be taken at Screening and sent 
to the central lab . Testing for bacterial vaginosis  will be done locally at Screening. An OSOM® Rapid test or similar test will be performed for Trichomonas 
vaginalis  locally at Screening . 
g. For WOCBP, a  local lab urine and central lab serum pregnancy test will be obtained at the Screening  Day 1 visit. A central lab serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Weeks 1 4, 26, and 50. 
h. IMP is to be administered within 30 minutes after the subject’s main meal of the day (as determined by the subject) at approximately the same time of the day 
consistently throughout the study. Approximately 240 mL (approx. 8 oz.) of wa ter is to be consumed with each dose of IMP.  
Subject will be randomized to receive either 600  mg VT-1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2 followed 
by 11 weekly doses of 150 mg VT -1161, or 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of over-encapsulated fluconazole followed by 11 weekly doses 
of placebo. In the Induction Phase, IMP may be over -encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be provided to maintain study blind. Subjects 
participating in the intense PK collection will be required to take the Day s 1 and 2 IMP at the Investigational site.  
Remind subject to bring IMP to each visit to assess  compliance.  
i. Only subjects participating in the intense PK will come in for the Day 2 visit.  
j. All procedures listed are to be completed only for unscheduled visits where a recurrent VVC episode is suspected. If the unscheduled visit is for repeat 
procedures (i.e., ECG, safety labs, etc.), only those specific procedures need to be performed, along with collection of any changes in medical treatments or medications and collection of any AEs.

26 1 INTRODUCTION 
Lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), an enzyme essential for fungal growth, catalyzes an early step 
in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation 
and integrity ( Yoshida, 1988).  Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of 14- methylated 
sterols, some of which are toxic to the fungus.  CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs 
referred to as ‘azole antifungals’.  All currently approved azole drugs contain either an imidazole 
or triazole ring system that binds tightly to the catalytic heme -iron of fungal CYP51 as well as to 
the heme- iron of many off- target mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes.  This inherent lack of 
selectivity is responsible for many of the side effects associated with the azole antifu ngals.  
For example, the potent inhibition of one or more human cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes 
found in the liver (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) or in the adrenal and sex organs (e.g. CYP19, CYP17, CYP21), is the basis for azole drug -drug interactions ( Bates and Yu, 2003 ) 
and reproductive warnings ( Zarn et al., 2003), respectively.  Additional azole class toxicities that 
are less well understood but may be related to off -target protein in teractions include hepatic 
toxicities, skin photosensitivity, and vision impairment.  In the acute care setting, these dose -
limiting side effects prevent attainment of plasma drug levels that might reduce the longstanding 
40% mortality rate attributed to invasive fungal infections.  The safety profile of the class similarly 
limits its use for chronic treatment of non -life-threatening fungal infections, such as recurrent 
vulvovaginal candidiasis ( RVVC)  and onychomycosis (OM).  A safer antifungal drug would also 
improve treatment options for infections seen in otherwise healthy individuals, such as RVVC and 
OM, which require protracted treatment in a patient population where significant side- effect risks 
are unacceptable.  
1.1 Background Information 
Mucosal candidiasis, also known as thrush, describes a group of yeast -like fungal infections that 
involve the mucous membranes including the mouth, urinary tract and genitals, notably the vagina and surrounding skin in women.  Infection is typically caused by Candida albicans , however more 
rare and difficult -to-treat Candida strains such as  C. glabrata are becoming more prevalent.  
Mucosal candidiasis occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients but  may also arise 
in immunocompetent individuals.

27 1.1.1 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
1.1.1.1 Epidemiology 
Symptoms of vulvovaginitis (inflammation of the vagina and vulva) are common and are among  
of the most frequent reasons for women’s visits to physicians.  Vulvovaginitis is associated with 
considerable morbidity including genital discomfort, decrease in sexual pleasure, loss of 
productivity, and psychological distress ( Eschenbach, 2004).  There are several  etiologies for 
vulvovaginitis; candidiasis being the second most common after bacterial vaginitis.  Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common disorder, with nearly 75% of all adult women having had at least one 
“yeast infection” in their lifetime.  Approximately half of these women experience a recurrence, 
with 5 to 8% developing recurrent VVC, defined as 3 or more e pisodes in one year ( Sobel, 2016).  
Estrogen increases the glycogen co ncentration of the vaginal lining; glycogen is a substrate on 
which C. albicans  thrives.  As estrogen levels are significantly lower in both pre -menarchal and 
post- menopausal females, the incidence of VVC is lower in these populations.  Vulvovaginal 
candid iasis is most common in women aged 25 to 34 years  (Foxman et al., 2013). 
1.1.1.2 Pathophysiology 
Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs when there is an overgrowth of the normal yeast in the vagina.   
Most cases (85% - 95%) are caused by C. albicans , followed by  C. glabrata, and infrequently by 
C. parapsilosis , C. tropicalis , and C. krusei .  Vulvovaginitis caused by non- albicans Candida 
species, in particular C. glabrata, is clinically indistinguishable from C. albicans  VVC but is more 
resistant to current treatments.  
Candida organisms gain access to the lumen and secretions of the vagina primarily from the 
adjacent perianal region.  Normal anti -Candida defense mechanisms allow for long -term 
persistence of Candida as com mensal organisms in the vagina without signs or symptoms of 
vaginitis.  Factors predisposing to VVC versus asymptomatic colonization include those attributed to the health (immunosuppression, use of antibacterial agents, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) and behavior (frequent intercourse, orogenital sexual activity, use of oral contraceptives 
or estrogen- based hormonal replacement therapy) of the host.  Other dermatologic conditions such 
as psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosus also predispose women to VVC  (Goncalves et al., 
2016). 
1.1.1.3 Presentation and Diagnosis 
The clinical array of signs and symptoms of VVC include genital pruritus associated with edema, 
an erythematous rash and excoriation of the vulva and surrounding skin, a burning sensation in the vagina and vulva, and a vaginal discharge.  These symptoms may persist for days to weeks and

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2, 1 7 January 2019 
 
28 may also recur with each menstrual cycle.  Women with VVC typically most commonly present 
with acute pruritus and a vaginal discharge, though neither is specific for candidiasis.  
The discharge may range from being watery to quite thick and “cottage -cheese-like”.  
Common symptoms include vaginal soreness, irritation, vulvar burning, dyspareunia, and external dysuria.  Phy sical examination typically reveals erythema and edema of the vulva with fissures 
and a pustulopapular rash, vaginal erythema, and a normal cervix.  Symptoms often worsen the week prior to menses. 
The diagnosis of VVC requires more than a history and physi cal examination as symptoms and 
signs, in particular pruritus, are often non- specific.  Diagnosis is made by microscopic examination 
of a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount showing the presence of yeast cells and mycelia 
and the absence of both clue cells (pathognomonic of bacterial infection) and trichomonads.  The vaginal pH is normal, approximately 4.0%.  A vaginal culture should also be performed, 
particularly for women with negative microscopy, as up to 50% of patients with culture -positive 
VVC wi ll have no findings on microscopy ( Sobel, 2007); additionally, a culture will p recisely 
identify the organism . Papanicolaou  (Pap)  smears are also not reliable, typically positive in only a 
quarter of patients with VVC.  
As up to 15% of asymptomatic women are colonized with Candida species and are thus culture 
positive, the final diagnosis of VVC requires a comprehensive assessment of clinical findings, microscopic examination, and vaginal culture. 
1.1.1.4 Treatment and Outcome 
In general, women who are asymptomatic carriers of Candida do not require treatment.  
Acute VVC in symptomatic women requires individualized treatment, the selected agent and 
duration of therapy being based on whether the VVC is categorized as either:  
• Uncomplicated, defined as having all of the following characteristics: (mild or moderate in 
symptom severity, sporadic in frequency, C. albicans as the infecting organism, in non-
pregnant women with normal immune function), or 
• Complicated, defined as having any one or more of the following characteristics: severe in 
symptom severity, recurrent, a non -C. albicans  organism as the infecting agent, abnormal 
immune function, or pregnant ( Eschenbach, 2004).  
Women with uncomplicated VV C can be treated with single -dose or short -course treatments, while 
those with complicated VVC require longer- term therapy, at least 5 to 7 days and possibly

29 maintenance therapy  up to 6 months  (Sobel et al., 2004).  Pregnant w omen, who are at higher risk 
of developing VVC, can only be treated with topical agents because of the potential teratogenic 
effects of azoles when administered systemically.  Topical agents are limited by local side effects, especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore,  most patients prefer the oral regimens.  
However, the systemically administered azoles listed in Table 2 are characterized by systemic 
toxicities and drug -drug-interactions (DDIs ) and  have poor activity against C. glabrata and 
fluconazole resistant C . albicans .

Abbreviations: mg  = milligrams; d  = day; q.d.  = once daily ; Rx = prescription . 
 
1.1.1.5 Recurrent, Resistant and Non -Albicans VVC 
Up to 20% of women will develop recurrent, resistant, or complicated VVC.  In a study that 
compared a 6 -month maintenance weekly fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with 
recurrent VVC, the time to recurrence increased from 4.0 to 10.2 months, and the cure rate at 
12 months doubled versus placebo from 22% to 43% (Sobel et al., 2004).   However, fewer than 
half of patients remained disease- free after discontinuation of fluconazole which highlights the 
unmet medical need for these patients.  
The prevalence of infection with non- albicans species, in particular C. glabrata, is increasing, 
especially in patients who are immunosuppressed and/or are diabetics; C. glabrata is poorly 
sensitive to current azole antifungal agents. 
1.2 VT-1161 
VT-1161 is a novel oral antifungal agent with a lower affinity for heme -iron and a greater affinity 
for the fungal lanosterol 14 α- demethylase (CYP51) than the currently available azole drugs.  
As a result, VT -1161 more potently inhibits fungal CYP51  than current azoles  and less potently 
inhibits host cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in greater cytochrome selectivity.  
These properties should translate to greater efficacy with an improved safety and tolerability 
profile.

30 VT-1161 is being developed for the treatment of patients with mucosal or superficial fungal 
infections.  It is formulated with standard excipients known to be chemically stable when combined 
with VT -1161 into tablets or capsules  for the investigational drug product. 
A detailed description of the non -clinical binding and inhibition, metabolism, microbiology, 
toxicology, safety pharmacology, Phase 1 clinical studies in which 72 subjects were exposed to 
VT-1161 and Phase 2a proof -of-concept studies, in which 78 subjects were exposed to VT 1161 
can be found in the VT -1161 Investigational Brochure.  In the Phase 2b studies, 378 subjects were 
exposed to VT -1161.  These studies are summarized below.  The following sections provide data 
from non- clinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials supporting the use of VT ‑1161 for patients 
with RVVC . 
1.2.1 Non-Clinical Pharmacology 
1.2.1.1 Binding and Inhibition  
In vitro  pharmacology studies demonstrated that VT -1161 is a potent inhibitor of fungal CYP51 
and binds more than 2200-fold more tightly to fungal CYP51 than to human CYP51.  VT-1161 is  
also highly selective for fungal CYP51 versus key human cytochrome P450 enzymes, non-cytochrome metalloenzymes, and a broad panel of receptors, ion channels, and transporters. 
1.2.1.2 Metabolism  
VT-1161 was not significantly metabolized when incubated with mouse, rat, dog or human 
hepatocytes.  Only 1 possible metabolite consistent with hydroxylation and glucuronidation of 
VT-1161 was detected in dog hepatocytes.  No additional metabolites were detected in any of the 
4 species.  
1.2.1.3 Microbiology 
VT-1161 was tested against a broad range of Candida clinical isolates and showed potent activity 
( 
 
 
 
Table 3).  It was also active against dermatophytes, including Trichophyton rubrum , 
T. mentagrophytes , and T. tonsurans .

In the Phase 2b RVVC study (VMT -VT-1161- CL-006), 413 clinical isolates were collected from 
subjects at screening visits until the end of the study.  The minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole for the isolates collected were; <0.0005  – >0.5 µg/ml 
and <0.06- 32 µg/ml, respectively.  The MIC 50 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 
0.004 µg/ml and 0.125 µg/ml, respectively, and the MIC 90 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole 
were 0.06 µg/ml and 4 µg/ml, respectively. These data further demonstrated that VT -1161 has 
potent in vitro  activity against the Candida strains obtained from  clinical strains.  For all tested 
isolates, VT -1161 demonstrated MIC 50 and MIC 90 that were 5 dilutions lower than those 
demonstrated by fluconazole.   
1.2.1.4 Activity in Animal Models of VVC  
VT-1161 was evaluated as an oral treatment of vaginal candidiasis ( C. albicans ) in a murine model 
(Garvey et al., 2012).  Three days after infection, VT -1161 was dosed orally once daily at 4, 10, 
or 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days.  Fungal burden measured in vaginal lavage fluid was highly 
significantly suppressed (p <0.0002) compared to vehicle -treated controls at all doses and when 
measured 1 or 4 days after treatment ended.  Plasma and vaginal tissue levels of the lowest dose 
of VT -1161 indicated that levels as low as 1 µg/mL resulted in this high degree of efficacy. 
1.2.1.5 Pharmacokinetics  
VT-1161 formulated as a suspension in carboxym ethylcellulose was well absorbed and exhibited 
approximately dose linear pharmacokinetics (PK) and a long plasma half -life in both rats and dogs.

32 There was no evidence of an effect of gender on the PK of VT -1161 in either rats or dogs.  
VT-1161 accumulated during repeat -dosing in rats and dogs as expected based on the long 
half-life.  VT -1161 was widely distributed into tissues and was mostly excreted in bile and feces 
in the rat.  In vitro plasma protein binding of VT -1161 is high with approximately 99.5%  binding 
to rat, dog and human plasma and slightly lower binding in mice (97.6%).  The absolute oral 
bioavailability of the capsule formulation used in Phase 1 studies administered to dogs was 
approximately 40% in the fasted state and approximately 100% when administered in the fed state.  
1.2.1.6 General Toxicology 
Oral VT -1161 was evaluated in general Good Laboratory Practice toxicity studies of up to 
6 months and 9 months in duration in rats and dogs, respectively.  Rats were more sensitive to the toxicological effects of oral administration of VT -1161 than dogs.  The no observable adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) for the 6 -month rat toxicity study was determined to be 0.5 mg/kg/day, 
based on an increase in incidence and severity of chronic progressive nephropathy, a  rat-specific 
finding.  The NOAEL for liver findings was 1.5 mg/kg, based on adverse findings at the high dose of 5 mg/kg/day including a minimal increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and an increase in frequ ency of minimal focal necrosis and 
single cell necrosis.   Findings of liver hypertrophy, sub- capsular necrosis and multinucleated 
hepatocytes were considered rat -specific and associated with metabolic adaptation.   Focal necrosis 
may be an exaggerated respo nse to hepatocellular hypertrophy which is known to cause 
sub-capsular and single cell necrosis.   The findings were reversible and similar to  the findings 
observed in a prior 28 -day study in the rat, providing support that the increased treatment duration 
in the 6-month rat study did not result in new findings of clinical concern.  At the 1.5 mg/kg dose 
at steady state on Day 182, maximum plasma concentration ( C
max) was 4,055 ng/mL and area 
under the curve ( AUC 0-24) was 81,900 ng·h/mL.  The NOAEL for the 9 -month dog study was 
determined to be the high dose of 17 mg/kg/day (Day 273 C max was 74,700 ng/mL and AUC 0-24 
was 1,675,000 ng·h/mL), as no adverse findings were identified.  The NOAEL in the previous 28-day dog study was 10 mg/kg/day, based on decreased body weight and mild effects on 
lymphoid organs including increased tingible body macrophages in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and in the Peyer’s patches at 30 mg/kg and higher.  These findings were largely 
reversed during the recovery period. 
1.2.1.7 Genotoxicity 
VT-1161 was found to be negative for genotoxicity in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay, 
the chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and the in vivo  bone marrow 
micronucleus assay in rats.

33 1.2.1.8 Reproductive Toxicology 
VT-1161 at doses resulting in maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decrease in body weights) did 
not cause alterations in uterine and ovarian pa rameters in embryofetal development studies in rats 
and rabbits.  Mean fetal body weights were slightly reduced in rabbits in the high dose group as a 
direct result of maternal toxicity and decreased maternal body weights.  No external, visceral and 
skelet al malformations and variations were observed at any of the dose levels evaluated.  
There were no effects on male or female fertility at clinically relevant doses.  
1.2.1.9 Safety Pharmacology 
The effects of VT -1161 on the neurological and pulmonary systems were evaluated in 
Sprague -Dawley rats.  The data demonstrated that there were no VT ‑1161- related effects in either 
the neuropharmacological or pulmonary studies in rats given an oral dose of up to 1,000 mg/kg VT-1161, the highest dose tested.  
Evaluation of cardi ovascular function in telemetered dogs revealed no treatment -related changes 
in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm or morphology, including the QT/QTc  (Fridericia 
correction) interval, at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. 
1.2.1.10 In Vitro Cytochrome P450 Interactions  
VT-1161 inhibited cytochrome P450 enzymes with the following potencies:  
CYP1A2  (half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC
50] ≥10 µM), CYP2B6 (IC 50 = 4.0 µM), 
CYP2C8 (IC 50 = 1.4 µM), CYP2C9 (IC 50 ≥10 µM), CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 9.7 µM), 
CYP2D6  (IC 50 = 9.4 µM), and CYP3A4 (IC 50 = 9.6 µM [testosterone], IC 50 ≥10 µM [midazolam]).  
Based on the high plasma protein binding of VT -1161, no clinically significant drug -drug 
interactions are expected.  
1.2.1.11 Effects of VT -1161 on Cardiac Repolarization 
An in vitro  human ether -à-go-go related gene study was conducted to assess the potential of 
VT-1161 to inhibit the repolarizing current of the cardiac action potentia l.  VT -1161 inhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go related  gene potassium current by 94.7 ± 1.3% at 6 µM.  The  IC50 was 
calculated to be 1.9 µM (Hill coefficient = 2).  However, a cardiovascular safety study in dogs 
showed that VT -1161 was well tolerated and did not induce any deleterious cardiovascular effects 
or affect QT intervals at test doses of up to 300  mg/kg, the highest dose tested, with exposures 
reaching 24,000 ± 6,881 ng/mL at 30 hours post- dose.

34 1.2.2 Clinical Studies  
1.2.2.1 Phase 1  Studies  
VT-1161 has been evaluated in 4 Phase 1 trials, a single ascending dose  trial, a multiple ascending 
dose trial , a DDI study with midazolam as a sensitive substrate , and an ethnic  PK study comparing 
Japanese and Western subjects.  The primary objectives of these studies were to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability , PK and drug interaction potential of VT -1161 in healthy adult subjects.  D etailed 
descriptions of the trials can be found in the VT-1161 I nvestigational Brochure . 
1.2.2.1.1 Single  Dose -Escalation Study (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-001) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-001 was a single -center, Phase 1, double- blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, dose -escalating study in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of single oral doses of VT -1161.  Sixty -four subjects (43 males and 
21 females) between 18 and 55 years of age were enrolled in 8 dose groups.  Within each dose -
group, 6 subjects received VT -1161 and 2 subjects  received placebo.  In the first 7 cohorts, 
escalating single oral doses (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg) or matching placebo were administered in the fasted state.  An 8th cohort received a single 320 mg oral dose of VT -1161 or 
matching placebo after ingesting a high -fat breakfast.  Subjects in Cohorts 1 to 6 were followed 
for 14 days for safety and PK assessments.  Visits on Days 28 and 42 were added for Cohorts 7 and 8.  Dose escalation proceeded only after safety and PK of the previous dose was determined.   
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.  There were no treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that led to discontinuation from the study.   Overall, mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and electrocardiogram [ECG]s) were generally small and were considered not clinically significant.  None of the  treatment -emergent physical examination abnormalities were of clinical 
significance.  The maximum tolerated dose for the study was the highest dose administered, 320 mg, administered in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT ‑1161 in the fasted  state, median time to reach maximum 
plasma concentration (T
max) ranged from 4 to 10 hours.  Overall, C max increased slightly less than 
proportional to dose. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC
inf) values generally increased with increase in dose, ranging from an average of 
16,145 ng•hr/mL at 20 mg to 241,971 ng•hr/mL at 320 mg.  The mean half -life ranged from 393 to 
1,467 hours.  Administration of 320 mg VT-1161 with a standard high- fat meal resul ted in higher 
plasma concentrations than those observed following 320 mg in the fasted state in a separate group

35 of subjects.  Average fasting C max was 338 ng/mL and this increased to 988 ng/mL in the fed state.  
AUC inf also increased from 241,971 ng•hr/mL  when subjects were fast ed to 953,119 ng•hr/mL 
with a high -fat meal.  
1.2.2.1.2 Multiple  Dose -Escalation Study (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-002) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-002 was a Phase 1, single -center, randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled, multiple dose -escalating stu dy in healthy adult subjects.  The study was designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple oral doses of VT-1161.  In addition to plasma 
PK, concentrations of VT -1161 in nails and skin were assessed.  A total of 32 subjects participated  
in the study and received VT -1161 at 40, 80, 160 or 320 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days after 
ingestion of a high- fat meal.  In each cohort of 8 subjects, 6 subjects received VT -1161, and 2 
subjects received placebo.  Subjects were followed for safety  and PK assessments for 42 days after 
the last dose of study drug. 
There were no deaths or SAEs reported.  Most TEAEs were mild in intensity and no severe TEAEs 
were reported.  
Mean changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulat ion, urinalysis, 
vital signs, and ECGs) were generally small and not considered clinically significant.  There was 
no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on physical examinations in any dose 
group at any time point.  The maximum tolera ted dose for the study was the highest dose 
administered, 320 mg, administered once daily  for 7  days in the fed state.  
Following oral administration of VT -1161 in the fed state, median T max values ranged from 4 to 
6 hours after dosing.  The increase in mean C max was nearly proportional to dose over the 40 to 
320 mg dose range.  The concentrations were 3 to 4- fold higher on Day 7 than they were on Day  1, 
indicating accumulation during the 7- day dosing interval, with a mean C max of 3,300 ng/mL on 
Day 7 at 320 mg.  The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing 
interval (AUC τ) values on Day 7 also increased nearly proportionally to dose over the 40 to 320 mg 
dose range.  The mean half -life ranged from 1,905 to 3,046 hours.   
1.2.2.1.3 Drug-Drug  Interaction  Study  (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-007) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-007 was a Phase 1, single -center, open- label study in healthy adult 
subjects to evaluate the effect of single and multiple oral doses of VT ‑1161 when co- administered 
with single oral doses of midazolam (DDI cohort) and to evaluate the PK of a single oral dose of 
an alternate strength of VT -1161 alone (pharmacokinetic evaluation [PKE] cohort).  All dosing

36 was conducted 30 minutes after the start of a high- fat, high- calorie meal.  A total of 36 subjects 
were enrolled in the study.   
In the DDI cohort, 28 subjects were enrolled in a fixed- sequence design to receive a 2 -mg oral 
dose of midazolam on Day 1, followed by 14 daily 600 mg oral doses of VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg 
tablets) on Day 3 through Day 16 with single 2 mg oral doses of midazolam on Day 3 and Day  16.  
Subjects were followed for safety, tolerability and PK assessments through Day 17, 1 day after the 
last dose of study drug.  Twenty -four subjects in the DDI cohort completed the study and 4 subjects 
withdrew from the study prior to completion; 2 subjects voluntarily withdrew consent and 
2 subjects withdrew due to an AE (discussed in more detail below).   
There were no deaths reported in the study.  One SAE (acute psychosis) was reported in a subject 
in the DDI cohort on Day 11 of the study, leading to discontinuation.  The Investigator determined the subject likely had a pre -existing psychiatric condition based on patient report and assessed 
causality as unlikely -related to VT -1161.  One additional subject in the DDI cohort withdrew from 
the study due to an AE of abnormal ECG on Day 3 of the study.  The AE occurred prior to the first dose of VT -1161; the Investigator assessed causality as unrelated to study drug.  Otherwise, mean 
changes from baseline in safety parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, vital 
signs, and ECGs) in both the DDI and PKE cohorts were generally small and not considered clinically significant and there was no evidence of any clinically significant effect of VT -1161 on 
physical examinations in either cohort.  
In the DDI cohort, midazolam mean plasma C
max increased 30% and AUC inf decreased 15% on 
Day 3 (after the first dose of VT ‑1161) relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  Midazolam mean 
plasma  Cmax decreased 3% and AUC inf decreased 37% on Day 16 (after 14 daily doses of VT ‑1161) 
relative to Day 1 (midazolam alone).  
In the PKE cohort, 8 subjects were enrolled to receive a single 600 mg oral dose of VT-1161 (2 x 300 mg tablets) on Day 1.  Subjects in the PKE cohort were followed for safety, tolerability and PK assessments through Day 2, 1 day after the dose of study drug.  All 8 subjects in the PKE 
cohort completed the study.  VT -1161 mean plasma C
max and AUC 0-24 values after a single oral 
adminis tration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (2 x 300 mg) on Day 1 were 1,946 ng/mL and 
28,070 ng•hr/mL, respectively.  These values are similar to VT -1161 mean plasma C max and 
AUC 0-24 values after a single oral administration of 600 mg VT ‑1161 (4 x 150 mg) in the DDI 
cohort (1,994 ng/mL and 25,330 ng•hr/mL, respectively), indicating the bioavailability of the 2 
strengths of tablets is similar.

37 1.2.2.1.4 Japanese Bridging  Study  (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-008) 
Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-008 was a single -center, open- label study in healthy adult Ja panese and 
Western subjects.  The objective of this ethno- bridging study was to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of VT -1161 in these 2 ethnic populations after subjects receive d 14 once daily 
oral doses of VT -1161 administered in the fed state.  There w as a total of 51 subjects enrolled. 
In the 300- mg dosage -group, there were 13 Japanese and 14 Western subjects.  In the 600 mg 
dosage group, there were 12 Japanese and 12 Western subjects.   The mean age of subjects was 
36.5 years, ranging from 19 to 55 years  across treatment groups.  The subjects were evenly divided 
by sex across all groups and the race of the Western subjects was evenly divided by white and 
black.   
The study drug was overall well tolerated by both Western and Japanese subjects.  There were no 
significant differences between the 2 populations in any of the safety assessments.  A slight 
increase in AEs was seen in the 600  mg dosage group as compared with the 300 mg dosage group, 
but no SAEs were observed.  Only 1 subject was withdra wn from the study for a n AE of  rash 
(subject request), which was categorized as an unlikely -related TEAE.  There was 1 pregnancy in 
a subject who was non- compliant with contraception requirements, which was electively 
terminated by the subject.  
Of the 51 subjects enrolled in the study, 11 Japanese subjects from both dose groups and 12 Western subjects from both dose groups were included in the full PK analysis population. Trough concentrations on Days 1 through 14 rose each day; thus, steady -state conditions had not 
been met by Day 14.  Larger differences between the 2 ethnic groups were seen in C
max and 
AUC 0-72 following the 300 mg dose compared with the 600 mg dose. At the 300 mg dose, C max and 
AUC 0-72 were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects com pared with Western subjects. 
At the 600- mg dose, C max and AUC 0-72 were approximately 10% higher in Japanese subjects 
compared with Western subjects. However, median T max was similar across doses at 4 hours for 
Japanese subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages and 6 hours for Western subjects at both the 300 mg and 600 mg dosages. The terminal elimination phase was very flat and half-life 
exceeded 1800 hours. Total clearance following the 300- mg dose was 1.642 L/hr for the Japanese 
subjects compared wi th 2.332 L/hr for the Western subjects.  Following the 600 mg dose, clearance 
was similar for the Japanese and Western subjects (2.000 and 2.086 L/hr, respectively).

38 1.2.2.2 Phase 2 Studies  
1.2.2.2.1 Dose Ranging Study in Tinea Pedis (Study VMT -VT-1161- CL-003) 
VMT -VT-1161- CL-003 was a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 over -encapsulated tablets compared to placebo in the treatment 
of subjects with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis.  A total of 50 subjects participated in 
the study across 4 dose groups: 1) VT -1161 200 mg once daily  for 4 days, followed by 50 mg once 
daily  for 10 days  (low dose) ; 2) VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 4 days, followed by 150 mg once 
daily  for 10 days  (mid -dose) ; 3) 600 mg twice daily  for 4 days, followed by 300 mg once daily  for 
10 days  (high dose ; or 4) placebo matching the VT -1161 treatment regimen.  VT-1161 plasma 
concentrations increased with dose and were as high as 6,230 ng/mL on Day 14 in the 600 mg 
twice daily/300 m g once daily  dose group. Subjects were enrolled into the high -dose cohort 
following an interim analysis that included safety data generated through the test of cure ( TOC ) 
visit (Day 42) of the 2 lower dose groups.   
VT-1161 was safe and well tolerated at all dose le vels through 6 months of follow -up.  No SAEs 
were reported.  Most AEs reported were mild to moderate in severity  and considered unrelated to 
study drug .  A single VT-1161 treatment related AE was reported (rash) that was considered by 
the Investi gator to be “possibly related.”  The subject discontinued treatment after the first dose, 
and the rash completely resolved by the following day.  There were no clinically significant 
treatment -emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs, or la boratory parameters.  
One subject experienced a significant elevation of creatine kinase ( CK) along with a slight increase  
in ALT and AST that was associated with a rigorous exercise program.  These changes were 
considered unrelated to treatment and all en zyme levels returned to normal at a subsequent follow -
up visit.   
At the Day 42 TOC visit, 42%, 42%, 50% and 0% of subjects receiving low dose, mid- dose or 
high dose VT -1161 or placebo were determined to have achieved effective therapeutic cure 
(defined as  having a total severity score of ≤2 with no individual severity score of >1, and also, 
having negative mycology [culture and KOH]) in the intent- to-treat ( ITT) population.   
1.2.2.2.2 Dose Ranging Study in Acute Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  (Study VMT -VT-1161-

39 across 4 dose groups: 1) VT  1161 300 mg once daily for 3 days, 2) 600 mg once daily  for 3 days, 
3) 600 mg twice daily  for 3  days, or 4) a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg followed by matching 
placebo.  Subjects were enrolled into the high- dose cohort following an interim analysis that 
included safety data generated through the TOC visit (Day 28) of the 2 lower dose groups.  
An additiona l interim analysis was conducted when the high -dose subjects had completed their 
TOC visit.   
VT-1161 was determined to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through Day 28.  No SAEs 
were reported and no subjects discontinued because of an AE.  Most AEs reported were considered 
unrelated to study drug and were mild in severity.  There were few treatment -related TEAEs of 
clinical concern.  Most TEAEs were reported in the low - and mid- dose cohorts and only 1 TEAE 
(insomnia) was noted in the high -dose cohort.  One subject developed urticaria that was considered 
possibly related to study drug and which resolved with prednisone.  There were no clinically 
significant treatment- emergent changes in vital signs, physical findings, ECGs or laboratory 
parameter s. 
The efficacy of VT -1161 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe acute VVC was evaluated at the 
TOC visit in the ITT population (defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least 1 dose of study drug) and the per protocol ( PP) population (defined as s ubjects that were compliant with all 
key aspects of the protocol).  Subjects in the ITT population were randomized into the 
VT-1161 300 mg once daily  for 3 days (n = 14), VT -1161 600 mg once daily  for 3  days (n  = 12), 
VT-1161 600 mg twice daily  for 3 days (n = 14) or fluconazole (n =  15).  Effective clinical cure 
rate (defined as having a total severity score of 0 or 1 and a negative culture) were 29%, 83%, 86% and 73%, respectively.  Subjects in the PP population achieved effective therapeutic cure at a rate of approximately 87%, 86%, 86% and 75%, respectively, in the low -dose, mid- dose, or high -dose 
VT-1161 or fluconazole groups at the Day 28 TOC visit.

In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with distal 
and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the toenail w ere evaluated.  A total of 259 subjects 
participated in the study in 5 treatment  groups and were administered either: 
• Low dose 12 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 10 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks.

40 • Low dose 24 -week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 22  weeks.  
• High dose 12- week: Loading doses of 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 600 mg once weekly

• High dose 24- week: Loading doses of 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 600 mg once weekly 
for 22 weeks. 
• Matching placebo 
Subjects in all cohorts were followed for 60 weeks.  Consenting subjects were enrolled into an 
extension study to assess the long- term safety and PK of VT -1161 through Week 96.   
The incidence of  adverse events  (AEs) was balanced across the VT -1161 treatment arms and 
placebo.    A total of 148 subjects (57%) had at least 1 TEAE, and the frequency was within the range of 49% to 67% for all treatment groups.  The majority  of TEAEs were considered by the 
Investigator to be mild or moderate and unrelated to study drug.  Most TEAEs were transient and 
occurred during the first 12 weeks of treatment for all treatment groups, including placebo.  Nineteen subjects reported related TEAEs through Week 60.  Sixteen subjects were on VT-1161 
and three subjects were on placebo.  The only related TEAE reported by more than 2 subjects was 
nausea.  Eleven subjects reported a total of 16 SAEs, which were considered unrelated to study 
drug.   
The incidence of study drug related TEAEs was wi thin the range of 6% to 11% for all treatment 
groups, with the highest frequency in the 600 mg 24-week group.  The most common (≥2 total 
subjects) TEAEs that were considered related to VT -1161 were nausea, dysgeusia, dizziness, 
constipation, and decreased appetite.  The most common TEAE that was considered related to 
placebo was dizziness.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was low, in the range of 0% to 6% 
for all treatment groups. 
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by the Investigators with vital signs, physical 
exam findings or ECGs. There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -1161 on chemistry, hematology or urinalysis 
parameters.

41 Overall, VT -1161 was
 safe and well -tolerated at all doses and treatment du rations including the 
highest dose and longest duration evaluated of 600 mg 24- week treatment group.  The TEAEs 
were typical of the subject population being studied and were generally balanced across the 
VT ‑1161 treatment a
nd placebo group. 
The primary ef
ficacy endpoint was complete cure at Week 48.  The proportion of subjects in the 
ITT population with complete cure at Week 48 ranged from 32% to 42% in the VT -1161 treatment 
groups, with the lowest rate in the 300 mg 12–week treatment group and the highest rate in the 
600 mg 12–week treatment group. No subjects receiving placebo experienced complete cure at 
Week 48.  The proportion of ITT subjects with complete cure was statistically significantly higher 
for all VT -1161 treatment groups compared with placebo at Week 48 (p<0.001). 
Overall, the efficacy at Week 48 was clearly demonstrated in all the VT -1161 treatment groups, 
with little to no improvement seen in the placebo group.   
1.2.2.2.4 Phase 2b Study in Subjects  with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis 
In this Phase 2b study, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of VT -1161 in subjects with 
recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis was evaluated.  A total of 215 subjects participated in the study , 
were randomized to 5 treatment groups and were administered either:  
• Low dose 12- week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks. 
• Low dose 24- week: Loading doses of 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• High dose 12- week: L oading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 11  weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks. 
• High dose 24- week: Loading doses of 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly 
for 23  weeks.  
• Matching placebo  
In general,  the incidence of AEs was balanced across the VT -1161 treatment arms and placebo. 
Two subjects discontinued VT -1161 because of a TEAE.  Of these two, only one TEAE was 
considered related to VT-1161 by the study investigator .  Most TEAEs were considered unrelated 
to study drug and were mild or moderate in severity.  Six SAEs were reported  through Week 48

42 of the study, none of which were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  Interestingly, 
a higher incidence of b acterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections was reported in the placebo 
arm.   
There were no clinically -relevant findings noted by the investigators  regarding  vital signs, physical 
exam findings or ECGs. There was no obvious clinically -relevant effect of VT -1161 on chemistry, 
hematology or urinalysis parameters.  
The primary e
fficacy outcome measure was the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC episodes during the Maintenance Phase through Week 48 of the study  in the 
ITT population.   Culture- verified acute VVC was defined as a positive fungal culture for Candida 
species associated with a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3.   The proportion of subjects 
with one or more culture -verified acute VVC episode through Week 48 was  lower in VT ‑1161 
dosing regime
ns: 4.8% in 150 mg 12 weeks, 7.0% in 150 mg 24 weeks, 0.0% in 300 mg 12 weeks, 
and 4.9% in 300 mg 24 weeks, treatment group s compared with 52.2%  in the placebo group. 
The difference was statistically significant in the VT ‑1161 dosing regim
ens compared with 
placebo (p<0.0001). 
In conclusion, VT -11
61 was determined to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated at all dose levels 
through the final visit at Week 48 of the study. 
1.3 Study Rationale  
RVVC  can be treated with topical and/or oral agents  and patients may  receive maintenance 
treatment for up to 6 months or longer once the acute infection has resolved.  F or most patients, 
available agents do not provide the desired delay to recurrence of an acute VVC episode, 
underlining the need for more effective treatments for RVVC.  Fluconazole has been used to treat 
acute VVC episodes in patients with recurrent disease. However, fluconazole has relatively lesser  
activity against some non- albicans  species th at are more common in patients with complicated 
VVC.   The current study has been designed to compare the ability of a short dosing regimen of 
VT-1161 or fluconazole in their ability to effectively treat the acute VVC infection in women with 
RVVC.  
VT-1161 has demonstrated superior in vitro antifungal activity when compared to fluconazole 
when tested against clinical isolates collected in the recently completed Phase 2b RVVC study 
VMT -VT-1161- CL-006. The MIC ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole against the C. albicans  
isolates collected during the study (n = 355) were between <0.0005 – 0.125 µg/mL and 
<0.06 – 4 µg/mL, respectively. When all 413 collected Candida spp. isolates were considered, the

43 MIC ranges for VT -1161 and fluconazole were <0.0005 – >0.5 µg/mL and <0.06 – 32 µg/mL, 
respectively.  The mean MIC 50 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 0.004 µg/mL and 
0.125 µg/mL, respectively, and the MIC 90 values for VT -1161 and fluconazole were 0.06 µg/mL 
and 4 µg/mL, respectively ( Table 4).

Abbreviations: MIC,  minimum inhibitory concentration.  
 
These data suggest that VT -1161 has the ability to treat the acute infection in the RVVC patient 
population and warrant further clinical investigation evaluating its effectiveness compared to 
current standard -of-care. 
While approved oral antifungal agents often offer improved efficacy, they suffer from safety issues 
associated with their narrow therapeutic windows and off target toxicity.  Since VT-1161 is much 
more selective for fungal CYP51 and CYP metabolizing enzymes than currently used oral agents, the probability of  safety issues, including  hepatotoxicity and DDIs , should be significantly 
reduced , as evidence in the clinical safety data generated with VT -1161 to date.  The PK profile 
and extended half- life associated  with VT -1161 should also limit recurrence of VVC. 
1.3.1 Rationale for Induction Phase Treatment  
Fluconazole is an approved treatment for  acute VVC and is used off -label to treat patients with 
recurrent disease.  The proposed dose regimen of 3 doses of over- encapsulated fluconazole taken 
72 hours apart corresponds to a  regimen that is often used as the standard of care and has been 
regularly employed during the induction phase of similar clinical studies designed to study RVVC .   
1.3.2 Dosing Regimen for VT-1161 and Fluconazole with Matching Placebo  
At Screening,  subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatment groups :  
• VT-1161: Loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and 450 mg on Day 2, then 150 mg once 
weekly for 11 weeks.

1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits of Participating in the Study  
The Phase 1, Phase 2a , and Phase 2b studies with VT -1161 incorporated monitoring for AEs often 
reported with other azole antifungal drugs.  No clinically significant study drug related AEs were 
observed in clinical studies with VT -1161, suggesting th at it may be better tolerated than 
commonly used azole agents.

46 3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more culture -
verified acute VVC episodes (post -randomization through Week 50) in the ITT population, which 
will include the subjects who failed clearing their infection during the Induction Phase .  An acute 
VVC episode (considered a recurrent episode) is defined as a positive culture for Candida species 
and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3.  
Secondary:  
• The proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms 
score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment with VT -1161 or fluconazole. 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and 
symptoms of ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (Post Day 14 through W eek 50). 
• Time to first recurrence of a culture- verified acute VVC episode with signs and symptoms 
score ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through Week 50 ). 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the 
Maintenance Phase.

4.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study. 
The stud y is designed to  evaluate the efficacy and safety of VT -1161 oral capsules versus 
fluconazole and placebo in the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes in subjects 
with RVVC . 
Subject s must have a history of RVVC , defined as at least 3 episodes of acute VVC in the past  
12 months, as described below:   
• Subjects must have an acute  VVC episode at the time of Screening,  with a documented 
positive KOH performed at the investigative  site 
• Subjects must also have had 2 or more  additional episodes of acute VVC in the past 12 
months , with at least 1 of the episodes documented by a positive confirmatory laboratory 
test (i.e., culture, PCR, Affirm test, KOH test, a documented Pap  test, or other approved 
diagnostic test)  
The study consists  of two Phases: 1) an  Induction Phase  for the treatment of the acute VVC 
infection in which subjects will be randomly assigned to receive  with either 600 mg VT -1161 
(4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2 and 
matching placebo capsules or 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of  over-
encapsulated  fluconazole together with matching placebo capsules , and 2)  a Maintenance Phase in 
which subjects will receive VT -1161 or placebo  for 11  weeks and will then enter a 3 7-week follow -
up period. 
Once subjects hav e provided informed consent  or assent (for those ages 12-17), the investigational 
site will evaluate all subjects  by completing a review of pertinent medical history, obtaining vital 
signs,  weight and height, ECG and laboratory tests, reviewing clinical signs and symptoms of 
vulvovaginitis, performing a complete physical examination including speculum examination of 
the vagina, perform ing a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear  to confirm the presence of 
yeast , and collect ing vaginal swabs to establish a baseline culture for identif ication of fungal 
species .  Eligible subjects will have a composite vulvovaginal  signs and symptom score of ≥3 as 
outlined in Section  9.1.7, a positive local KOH that confirmed the presence of yeast, and must 
meet other initial entry criteria .

48 Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized and enter the Induction P hase.  
During the Induction Phase, t he presenting acute VVC infection  will be treated with either 600 mg 
VT-1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1 and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 2 
or 3 sequential 150 mg oral doses (every 72 hours) of  over- encapsulated  fluconazole.  Subjects 
will return approximately 14 days after the first dose of VT-1161 or over- encapsulated fluconazole 
for evaluati on and, if the acute VVC infection has resolved (defined by a signs and s ymptoms 
score of <3), they will  enter into the Maintenance Phase to receive either VT -1161 or a matchi ng 
placebo regimen .  Day 1  (Screening ) is defined as the first day of investigational medicinal product 
(IMP)  administration and subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive days 
thereafter.   If the acut e VVC has not resolved (defined by  a signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3), the 
subject will be considered a n Induction failure and encouraged to see their physician for further 
evaluation and follow- up care.   
4.2 Treatment Arms and Duration of Study  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VT-1161 or fluconazole and  placebo. 
The duration of individual subject participation will be approximately 50 weeks: including the 
2-week Induction Phase, the 11- week Maintenance Phase,  and 37 weeks of follow -up. 
Assessments and procedures will be performed as outlined in  Table 1. Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures .  Subjects  who return to the clinic for a  recurrent VVC episode should 
be evaluated as per the unscheduled visit noted in the Schedule of Assessment and Procedures. 
The planned study duration is approximately 18 months from Screening of the first subject until 
the last follow -up of the last subje ct. 
4.3 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 360 screened and 180 randomized subje cts are planned for this study.  Assuming 
a 20% discontinuation rate for the remainder of the study, approximately 144 subjects are expected 
to complete the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 45 U.S. sites . 
4.4 Design Justification 
One of the study goals will be to compare the efficacy of oral VT -1161 versus fluconazole in the 
treatment of acute VVC episodes in RVVC  subjects .  The proposed dosing regimen w ill 
incorporate an Induction Phase to treat the initial acute infection with either fluconazole or VT -
1161.

49 The fluconazole dosing regimen to be employed in the Induction Phase is in alignment with the 
recommendation proposed by the Infectious Disease Soci ety of America (IDSA) for the treatment 
of vulvovaginal candidiasis, in which fluconazole, 150 mg, is given every 72 hours for a total of 3 
doses. This is recommendation is strongly supported by IDSA and for which high- quality evidence 
is available to support its clinical effectiveness.  
VT-1161 has previously been evaluated in a Phase 2a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, 
active- controlled, parallel -group, dose -ranging study in patients with moderate -to-severe acute 
VVC (described in Section 1.2.2.2.2).  A total of 55 subjects with moderate -to-severe acute VVC 
(severity score ≥6 and a positive fungal KOH test) participated in the study across 4 dose groups:  
1) VT -1161 300 mg qd for 3 days; 2) 600 mg qd for 3 days; 3) 600 mg bid for 3 days; or 4) a single 
dose of fluconazole 150 mg followed by matching placebo.  VT-1161 was shown to safe and well 
tolerated when administered for 3 days.  There were no serious AEs reported and no TEAEs led 
to study discontinuation.  No safety signals of clinical concern were observed from the safety 
assessments.  
The efficacy of VT -1161 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe acute VVC was evaluated at the 
TOC visit in the Per Protocol population at the Day 28 test of cure TOC visit was, 87%, 86%, 86%, and 75% of subjects receiving the low , mid- , or high -dose VT -1161 or comparator arm of 
fluconazole , respectively, achieved an effective therapeutic cure (defined as having a total clinical 
signs and symptoms severity score of ≤1 and a neg ative culture for Candida species) in the Per 
Protocol population 
It is predicted based on plasma levels obtained in previous clinical studies that the proposed 
loading dose regimen of 600 mg on Day 1 and 450 mg on Day 2 will provide for clinically effecti ve 
plasma levels  (approximately 2 µg/mL) to treat the presenting acute Candida spp. infection a 
manner that will afford comparison of the efficacy of oral VT -1161 and fluconazole in the 
treatment of an acute VVC episode in subjects with RVVC.   
Similar and higher doses of VT -1161 have been studied previously in subjects with onychomycosis 
(VMT -VT-1161- CL-005), with a maximum high dose of 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 600 
mg once weekly for 22 weeks administered (see Section 1.2.2.2.3). 
The proposed VT-1161 dosing regimen for the current Phase 3 studies  will also  incorporate a 
150 mg once weekly maintenance dose phase for 11 weeks.  Based on the PK results from the 
Phase 2b study, it is expected  that this will provide a mean plasma concentration of approximately 
2.5 µg/m L at the end of the dosing period (Week 14).

50 4.4.1 Justification for Inclusion of Adolescents in the Study  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis, a nd especially RVVC, is rare in pre- menarchal girls (typically pr e-
adolescents less than 12 years of age) and epidemiological data is generally lacking for this 
population. 
Adolescent females (ages 12 to 17 years, inclusive) represent a menarchal population that is newly 
influenced by reproductive hormones. The changes in reproductive hormones in adolescents cause  
vast changes in tissues and may increase the susceptibility to VVC . In this population, cases of 
VVC and RVVC exist but are substantially less common than in adult females. While 75% of 
healthy women will likely experience one episode of VVC  in their lifetime , and potentially 9% 
will be characterized as having recurrent disease, the prevalence of symptomatic acute VVC in 
adolescents is less than 2% of the population and there is no published data that addresses the 
incidence of RVVC in this patient population ( Fidel, 2002; Blostein, 2017; Barousse, 2004). 
Presenting symptoms of VVC in menarchal adolescents are similar to those in the a dult population, 
and treatment typically consists of topical antifungal preparations while oral antifungal agents are 
prescribed only in severe or complicated cases ( Joishy, 2005 ).  The dose and administration of the 
agents us ed in adolescents are the same as those used in adult females with VVC and RVVC.  
The United States FDA Draft Guidance Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: Developing Drugs for Treatment states that while uncomplicated VVC is unlikely to occur in healthy pre -menarchal  girls, 
post-menarchal adolescent girls with VVC should be included in Phase 3 trials.  Accordingly, the present study will follow guidance received by the United States FDA reviewers and will allow 
enrollment of subjects 12 to 17 years of age (inclusive) to collect as much information as possible 
on the treatment of the adolescent population with RVVC.

period and where this is the usual life style of the subject. Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational amenorrhoea method are not considered to be acceptable methods of contraception. 
c Because of the teratogenic risk associated with repeat dosing of fluconazole, OPTION 3 
contraceptive, methods cannot be used during Screening and the Induction Phase of the study 
[from Screening (Day 1) until Day 14 of the study].

59 7 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
7.1 Investigational Medicinal Product Administration and Dosing Schedule  
7.1.1 Induction Phase (Screening/Randomization to Day 14) 
At Screening all subjects will be randomized to receive either:  
• 600 mg VT -1161 (4 x 150 mg capsules) on Day 1, and 450 mg VT -1161 (3 x 150 
mg capsules) on Day 2, OR 
• 3 sequential doses (every 72 hours) of over- encapsulated fluconazole 150 mg 
starting on Day 1  
The number of capsules with active pharmaceut ical ingredient (VT -1161 or fluconazole) and 
inactive capsules (placebo) for each treatment arm during the Induction Phase is described in 
Table 5.

Regarding the dosing of fluconazole in adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age, inclusive), 
fluconazole exposure at the planned dose is anticipated to be similar to that in adults and 
proportional to weight. AEs associated with fluconazole would also be expected to be similar in 
adolescents as in adults. There are currently no United States FDA - or European- approved doses 
or regimens of fluconazole for treatment of VVC or RVVC in adolescents. While the United States 
FDA -approved labeling for fluconazole ( Diflucan, Pfizer 2017) is silent on treatment of 
adolescents with VVC, the European prescribing information for fluconazole (Diflucan® Summary 
of Product Characteristics [ 2017 ]) provides the following guidance; “If treatment is imperative in 
adolescents (from 12 to 17 years old), the posology should be the same as in the adult population.”  Therefore, adolescent subjects (ages 12 to 17 years) enrolled in the study will receive the same 
150 mg doses of fluconazole as adult subjects.

       Version 2, 1 7 January 2019 
 
60 7.1.2 Maintenance Phase ( Day 14 to Week 1 4) 
Subjects  returning to the site approximately 14 days after the first dose of VT -1161 or over -
encapsulated fluconazole and demonstrating resolution of the VVC infection (defined by a signs 
and symptoms score of <3) will receive either:  
• 150-mg once weekly dose of VT -1161 for 11 weeks,  if initially randomized to 
receive VT -1161 or  
• a matching  placebo regimen for 11 weeks , if initially randomized to receive 
fluconazole.   
Subjects will be instructed to take the doses of VT -1161 within 30 minutes after ingestion of the 
subject’s main meal (as determined by the subject) , at approximately the same  time of the day 
consistently throughout the study.  Subjects should consume approximately 240 mL 
(approximately 8 oz.) of water with each dose of IMP.  Subject’s Day 14 is defined as the first day 
of weekly dosing of IMP administration. 
7.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Each s ubject who completes the study Screening  assessments, meets all eligibility criteria, and is 
accepted for the study will be assigned a unique sequential identification number and will receive the corresponding treatment according to the randomization scheme described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  For more information on subject randomization, see Section 7.7. 
7.3 Dose Interruptions and Modifications  
If any subject experiences a Grade 3 AE that is considered possibly  related , or related to IMP , 
dosing will be discontinued in that subject and the AE will be followed until resolution ( refer to  
Section 9.2 for AE reporting ).  Dosing of IMP will not be re -initiated in any subject who 
experiences a possibly related or related Grade 3 AE.  Although these subjects should stop the 
study drug, they are encouraged to return for their remaining study visits.  Elevation in laboratory values that do not require medical or surgical treatment or discontinuation from the study will not be considered AEs  (Section 9.2.1). 
If any subject experiences a Grade 4 AE that is considered possibly related or  related to IMP,  the 
subject may be unblinded  at the discretion of the Mycovia Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor and 
Investigator and dosing of IMP will be discontinued, and the AE will be followed until resolution.  
Dosing of IMP will not be re -initiated in any subject who experiences a possibly related or related 
Grade 4 AE.

61 7.4 Prohibited  and Permitted  Medications/Non -Medications 
All medications taken 30 days prior to the Screening visit including all prescription and non-
prescription medications (e.g., herbal and/or vitamin supplements), through the End of Study 
(EOS ) visit will be recorded  for each subject.  
All concomitant therapies and  proce dures (including any surgical and diagnostic procedures) that 
were performed 72 hours prior to Screening  through the EOS visit will be recorded  for each 
subject . 
7.4.1 Prohibited Medications/Non -Medications  
The following prescription and over -the- counter drug products are prohibited during the study  and 
will be considered a protocol deviation: 
1. Topical or oral antifungal drugs (with the exception of fluconazole when prescribed by the 
Investigator to treat a  subject with a recurrent  VVC episode. If subject fails to respond to 
fluconazole treatment, the Investigator may employ treatment options corresponding to us the 
site’s stand ard of care treatment to treat the infection upon consult with the Medical Monitor.)  
2. Topical products applied to the vulva or vagina (e.g. antibiotic, antitrichomonal, corticosteroid s, or anti- inflammatory  agents ). 
3. Oral antibacterial or antitrichomonal agents for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas, or other concomitant urogenital in fection unless prescribed by the Investigator.

62 Medications to treat any AEs the subject experiences during the study are permitted .  If a subject 
is unable to comply with the excluded medications criteria  (Section 7.4.1) , the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be re -evaluated by the Investigator , in consultation with Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor.  
7.5 Treatment Compliance  
IMP will be administered or dispensed only to eligible subjects under the supervision of the 
Investigator. 
7.6 Replacement of Study Subjects   
Any subject who receives ≥1 dose of study drug will be considered evaluable and will not be 
replaced.  
7.7 Randomization and Blinding  
A randomized design through an interactive web response system  (IWRS)  will be used to assign 
subjects in a 2:1 ratio to the dose regimen  of VT -1161 or fluconazole and placebo.  Day 1  
(Screening ) is defined as the first day of VT -1161/fluconazole a dministration and subsequent study 
days are defined by the number of consecutive days thereafter.  
The subjects, study I nvestigators and their staff, all clinical staff  members within Mycovia  
Pharmaceuticals , the c linical study monitor, the study project team, and the study Medical 
Monitor (s) will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until the completion of the 
study.  The Unblinded Statistician responsible for creating the final randomization list and the 
IWRS personnel responsible for loading  the final randomization list into the IWRS  will be 
unblinded to the treatments .  The bioanalytical personnel responsible for assay of VT -1161 in 
plasma samples will also  be unblinded to subject treatments.

63 7.8 Conditions for Breaking the Blind  
In the event the breaking of the blind is required, the following will apply: 
• The Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an 
emergency  (i.e., a Grade 4 AE)  OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge 
of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the 
subject as judged by the Investigator  (ICH GCP 4.3.1) .  If the SAE requires that an expedited 
regulatory report be sent to 1 or more regulatory agencies, a copy o f the report, identifying the 
subject’s treatment assignment, may be sent to Investigators in accordance with local regulations. 
• The Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor or appropriate Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals 
study personnel to communicate the reasons for  unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment 
immediately after the unblinding occurred (ICH GCP 4.7). 
• If unblinding is required, t he Mycovia Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor  and the Investigator  
will be provided with the treatment assigned to the  subject. The Investigator  mus t NOT 
disclose the treatment assignment to the subjec t and/or other study personnel including other 
site personnel, monitors,  or the Sponsor ’s project team ; nor should there be any written or 
verbal disclosure of the code in any of the corresponding subject documents.  The treatment 
assignment of the subject is to be revealed only if  that information is important to the safety of 
subjects currently in the study. 
• The date and reason for unblinding must be fully documented in t he eCRF.  
7.9 Treatment After the End of the Study  
After the completion of the study, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will follow local 
regulatory/ International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) guidelines for any follow -up 
treatment provided to subjects.  The Investiga tor is responsible for ensuring that consideration has 
been given to the post-study care of a subject’s medical condition.

79 9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Safety Tests and Assessments  
Safety assessments will include attention to relevant changes in the following parameters, 
which are identified as occurring after the start of IMP, regardless of whether the change is in 
an examination finding, test result, or symptom (s) reported by a subject, and regardless of 
presumed relationship to IMP ( VT-1161 or fluconazole and  placebo) . The Investig ator will 
follow all clinically significant abnormal findings after IMP treatment until resolution, return 
to baseline, or permanent documented change in medical history.  
9.1.1 Height and Weight 
Height and body weight will be collected at times specified in Table 1. Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
9.1.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs to include body temperature, heart rate (pulse), breathing rate, and blood pressure 
will be obtained in a sitting position  after resting for at least  5 minutes  at times specified in 
Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and  Procedures . 
9.1.3 Physical Examination 
Comprehensive Physic al Examination : general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
thyroid/ neck  (endocrine) ; chest and lungs; cardiovascular system, abdomen, pelvic exam, 
musculoskeletal system, lymph nodes, extremities/skin, and neurological system will be 
performed at Screening .  Special attention should be given during the vulvovaginal 
examination to erythem a, edema, and excoriation.   For proper assessment, it is best the subject 
is not menstruating at time of the  study visits.   
Symptom Directed Physical Examination: A symptom directed physical exam consists of a 
very brief history of present illness. Investigators should use the symptom directed exam for 
all study visits after the Screening visit. If the subject has no present illness th is should be 
documented by the Investigator or qualified designee.   
9.1.4 Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12- lead ECGs to assess heart rate, rhythm, and interval information such as PR, QRS, 
QT, and QTc will be obtained in the supine position at times specified in Table 1. Schedule of

80 9.1.5 Laboratory Determinations  
After the Screening  (Day 1)  visit, laboratory test values that fall outside the reference range on 
the laboratory reports and are deemed clinically significant by  the Investigator may be repeated 
at the discretion of the Investigator.  Those values deemed clinically significant should be 
followed until resolution or permanent documented change in medical history.    
The following laboratory samples will be obtained at times specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures  and analyzed by the central laboratory : 
9.1.5.1 Pregnancy Testing  
All WOCBP  must undergo urine and serum  pregnancy testing at Screening to assess protocol 
eligibility. Serum pregnancy tes ts will be performed thereafter  as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
9.1.5.2 Immunology 
HIV antibody, HBsAg, anti -HCV at Screening.  Laboratory results are not required prior to 
start of IMP.  Investigators are to follow local and/or state laws in regards  to parental disclosure 
of any positive pregnancy tests or reportable and treatable serologies or STDs in adolescents. 
9.1.5.3 Clinical Chemistry Panel 
Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, conjugated 
bilirubin, albumin, total protein, total carbon dioxide, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
calcium, phosphorus, CK, cholesterol and triglycerides . Testing for HbA1c should be  
performed in known or suspected diabetic subjects at Screening. Laboratory results are not 
required prior to start of IMP . 
After the Screening  (Day 1) visit, subjects  may  be re -tested for ALT, AST and total bilirubin  
to confirm any abnormal values and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing.  
The Investigator will also assess the subject for any associated emergent symptoms.  
9.1.5.4 Hematology 
A complete blood count with differential to include red blood cell count, total and differential 
white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW  and

Testing for glucose, ketones, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, pH, protein, and specific gravity 
will be performed at times specified in Table 1. Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
Laboratory results are not required prior to start of IMP.  
9.1.5.6 Chlamydia Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae 
Cultures to test for Chlamydia trachomatis  and Neisseria gonorrhoeae  will be taken at 
Screening.  
9.1.5.7 Trichomonas Vaginalis 
An OSOM® Rapid test or similar test will be performed for Trichomonas vaginalis  locally at 
Screening .  Instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping samples to the central 
laboratory are outlined in the laboratory manual. Testing for Bacterial vaginosis  will be done 
locally.  
9.1.6 KOH Wet Mount Tests  and Fungal Cultures  
A local KOH wet mount test will be  performed locally at the Screening  visit and at unscheduled 
visits where a recurrent VVC episode is suspected .  A vaginal fungal culture will be obtained 
at Screening and  all subsequent visits and sent to the central mycology laboratory for fungal 
identification and susceptibility testing according to approved C linical Laboratory Standards 
Institute  methods.  Subjects  should not be menstruating at time of the study visits to ensure 
proper sample collection of the vaginal fluid.  Details as to the collection of samples, shipping, 
testing methods and analysis will be delineated in a laboratory manual.   Mycology samples 
may be retained for future analysis for a period of up t o 15 years, after which time the samples 
will be destroyed.  
9.1.7 Vulvovaginitis Clinical Assessment  
Vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be evaluated at Screening and each subsequent study visit.  Each of the following vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be sco red and the individual 
scores combined for a maximum score of 18, using the following scale:  
a. Signs: erythema, edema, and excoriation  
b. Symptoms: itching, burning, and irritation 
 
Scoring Scale: Each score should be objectively defined on a scale of 0 to 3 as follows: 
0 = none (complete absence of any signs or symptoms)

9.2 Adverse Event  Reporting 
9.2.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
Monitoring of all AEs will be conducted throughout the study as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
An AE is any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms, 
disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human participating in a 
clinical study with a Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  product, regardless of causal relationship. 
A “pre -existing” condition is one that is present prior to the start of I MP administration  and is 
reported as part of the subject ’s medical history.   Pre-existing conditions should be reported as 
AEs only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre-existing condition worsens during the study. 
Any abnormal safety assess ments , such as ECGs, radiological  scans, vital sign measurements,  
that are judged by the I nvestigator to be clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or 
SAE provided it meets one of those definitions.  Laboratory abnormalities generally are not 
considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or  require medical 
intervention.  A laboratory abnormality (e.g., a clinically significant change detected on 
clinical chemistry, hematology) that is independent from a known underlyin g medical 
condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to IMP interruption or 
discontinuation, should be considered an AE.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied are not considered AEs unless their severity is greater 
than expected in the judgement of the Investigator .  
In addition, the following apply: 
• All AEs, including clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities, will be documented 
as an AE and followed until resolution.

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
83 • All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of taking the first dose of  IMP until 
the last follow -up visit of the study, at the time points specifie d in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
• Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of IMP but after obtaining informed 
consent or assent (for those ages 12- 17) should be recorded in the medical history 
section of the eCRF.  
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects.  
However, if the Investigator learns of an SAE, including a death, at any time after a 
subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably 
related to the study treatment o r study participation, the Investigator must promptly 
notify Mycovia Pharmaceuticals . 
9.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE occurring after the first administration  of IMP that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Deatha 
• Is a life -threatening experienceb 
• Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacityc 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above .  Example:  allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home. 
NOTES:  
a. “Death” is an outcome and is NOT the AE.  In the event of death, the cause of death 
should be recorded as the SAE.  The only exception is “sudden death” when the 
cause is unknown.

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
84 b. Life-threatening SAEs include any adverse drug experience, which, in the view of 
the Investigator, places the subject  at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurs.  It does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, 
might have caused death.  
c. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
All SAEs, regardless of causal relation ship, must  be reported to Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals 
(or designee) within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  The initial report must be 
captured in the electronic SAE CRFs within 1 business day. 
The SAE report should provide as much of the required informa tion as is available at the time.  
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject  identification  
number , reporting source, and an event outcome.  Supplemental information may be entered 
into the electronic SAE CRFs  and should not delay the initial report.   Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  
(or designee) may contact the investigational site to solicit additional information or to follow -
up on the event. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information will be 
treated as an SAE for the purposes of this protocol. All SAEs will be follow ed until resolution, return to baseline (when worsening of a pre -existing 
condition is reported), or permanent documented change in medical history. All relevant documentation pertaining to the SAE (additional laboratory tests, consultation 
reports, discharge summaries, post -mortem reports, etc .) will be provid ed by the Investigator 
to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  (or designee) in a timely manner.  
9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Subjects  should be instructed to report all AEs to the Investigator.  In addition, the Investigator 
should seek to elicit any clinical or objective reactions by open- ended questioning (“How have 
you been feeling?”) and, as appropriate, by examination.  All AE information obtained during 
the subject questioning should be documented in the subjects’ clinical records and entered into 
the CRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed because of an AE should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.  The component parts of the diagnosis may be listed for verification.  If the AE is a laboratory 
abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the

       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
85 syndrome or diagnosis rather than the individual laboratory abnormality.  It should also be 
documented, verbatim, directly on the laboratory report. 
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all AEs should be recorded in standard 
medical terminology on the CRF and on the me dical record rather than in the subject ’s own 
words.  Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, 
association with the IMP, action(s) taken, and outcome. 
9.2.4 Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be assessed by the Investigator or MD designee for severity, according 
to the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( DMID ) Adult Toxicity Table, (Draft, 
November 2007) Appendix A .  For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value which is 
not addressed in the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, the most recent version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 published by the National Cancer 
Institute will be used.  
Where discrepancies in the ULN  and lower limit of normal (LLN)  laboratory ranges occur 
between those included in the DMID and those of the central laboratory that performs the 
assays, the values provided by the central laboratory will be used for assignment of severity 
grade.  
For AEs involving a body system or laboratory value not addressed in the DMID Adult 
Toxicity Table, the following general scale may be used with I nvestigator discretion to assign 
severity:  
• GRADE 1 Mild : An event easily tolerated by the subject ; transient or mild discomfort 
(usually <  48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required. 
• GRADE 2 Moderate : An event that may interfere with normal, everyday activities; some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
• GRADE 3 Severe : An even t that prevented the subject  from performing their normal, 
everyday activities; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy 
required; hospitalizations possible. 
• GRADE 4 Life -threatening : At the time of the event the subject  was at risk o f death or 
the event resulted in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity.

Protocol  VMT -VT-1161 -CL-017 IND 111675  
       Version 2 , 17 January 2019  
 
86 • GRADE 5 Death : An event that resulted in death. 
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the experience that  day should be noted. If the severity category changes over 
several  days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
NOTE: An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event (such as mild, moderate, or severe 
myocardial infarction).  However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, (such as a severe headache), and both AE(s) and SAE(s) can be assessed as severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in  Section 9.2.2. 
Where discrepancies in the ULN  and lower limit of normal of laboratory ranges occur between 
those included in the DMID tables and those of the central laboratory that performs the assays, the values provided by the central laboratory will be used for assignment of severity grade. 
9.2.5 Causa lity Assessment  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the IMP  and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE by using his or her best clinical judgment.  It should be clearly documented 
in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/ SAE and that they are the ones providing 
the assessment of causality.  Other elements to be considered, such as the history of the 
underlying disease, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the IMP will be con sidered and investigated.  The Investigator will also consult 
the VT -1161 Investigat ional B rochure  and the study Medical M onitor in estimating the 
relationship. 
An SAE may be recorded when the Investigator has minimal information to include in the 
initial report.  However, the Investigator must always make an assessment of causality for every 
event prior to reporting the SAE report. The Investigator may change his or her opinion of the causality upon evaluation of  follow- up information or discussions with the study Medical 
Monitor with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is one of the 
criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements and should not be left blank.  
For each reported adverse reaction, the Investigator must assess  the relationship of the event 
to the IMP using the following scale:

• Does not follow a known response pattern to the suspect IMP (if response pattern is 
previously known). 
• Can clearly be explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Unlikely Related:  
• The temporal sequence from administration of the IMP suggests that a relationship is 
unlikely. 
• Follows a response pattern that is unlike that of the suspect IMP (if response pattern is 
previously known). 
• Could be reasonably explained by the subject ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject. 
Possibly Related: 
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. 
• May follow a known response pattern to the suspect IMP (if response pattern is previously 
known). 
• Could also be reasonably explained by the subject ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject. 
Related:  
• Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. 
• Could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical 
state or any other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
• Is confirmed by improvement on stopping or slowing administration of the IMP, if 
applicable.

88 If an assessment is not provided, the event will be treated as Possibly Related for purposes of 
regulatory reporting. 
9.2.6 Action Taken Following Adverse Events 
For each reported AE and SAE, the Investigator must document the action taken according to 
the following criteria:  
• No action taken  
• Non-pharmacologic treatment added  
• New drug therapy added  
• IMP interrupted 
• Discontinued from study 
• New or prolonged hospitalization 
9.2.7 Outcome of Adverse Events  
For each reported AE and SAE, the Investi gator must document the outcome according to the 
following criteria:  
• Resolved 
• Ongoing 
• Unknown 
• Death  
The appropriate AE or SAE report page will be updated once the outcome is determined.  
The Investigator will also ensure that additional follow -up information includes any 
supplemental data that may explain causality of the event(s).  
For SAEs, new or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE 
report, with all changes signed and dated by the Investigator or designee.  The updated SAE 
report will then be signed by the Investigator and resubmitted to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  (or 
designee).

Reports of overdose (with or without an AE), abuse, dependency, inadvertent or accidental 
exposure, pregnancy and unexpected therapeutic benefit should be forwarded to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  (or designee) in the same time frame as an SAE.  
Overdose occurs when a subject  is administered or has taken a dose substantially greater than 
the intended or scheduled dose specified by the protocol. 
All pregnancies occurring from the time the subject takes their first dose of IMP through the 
last study visit (Week 50) must be followed for information regarding the course of pregnancy, 
delivery, and condition of the newborn.   Follow- up should be provided by the Investigator to 
Mycovia Pharmaceuticals in a timely manner.

10.1 Sample Collection and Handling  
Blood samples for determination of VT-1161 plasma concentra tions will be collected at visits 
specified  in Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  Timing of samples will be with respect 
to the day and time  study drug is administered.  Intense PK blood draws for VT -1161 plasma 
concentrations will be obtained from consenting subjects, at participating sites , on Day 1 and 
Day 2 , (predose and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing , with ±10-minute  window per timepoint ).  
The date and time of each PK sample will be recorded in the CRF.  PK samples should be 
stored frozen at -20°C or colder.  Detailed shipping instructions will be provided in the lab 
manual.  
10.2 Analytical Procedures 
Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of VT-1161 using a validated , 
specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method at a 
bioanalytical laboratory  designated by  Mycovia Pharmaceuticals .  Pharmacokinetic samples 
may be retained  for future analysis of the metabolite profile for a period of up t o 15 years, after 
which time the samples will be destroyed.  
10.3 Pharmacokinetic  Parameters  
For subjects in the VT -1161 treatment arm, VT -1161 concentrations will be presented by visit 
with desc riptive statistics.  The PK data may be used in a cross -population PK analysis that 
may be presented in a separate report.

91 11 STUDY TERMINATION AND SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION  
11.1 Screening/Baseline Failures 
Subjects who sign and date the informed consent form  or assent (for those ages 12-17)  but fail 
to be randomized are defined as screen failures.   Site personnel should maintain documentation 
for all subjects who sign an informed consent or assent .  Study completion is defined as when 
the last subject has complet ed their last study visit.  
11.2 Subject Withdrawal or Premature Discontinuation from the Study  
The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a 
required study visit: 
• The incidence or severity of AEs in the study indicates a potential health hazard to subjects. 
• The site must attemp t to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible. 
• The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow -up’, the I nvestigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain  contact with the subject ( e.g., multiple telephone calls  on 
various dates/time, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address , or 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will they be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”. 
A subject may be withdrawn due to lack of tolerability or safety concerns, including study 
drug- related AEs or development of clinically -significant study drug -related  laboratory 
abnormalities.  If a subject is withdrawn from treatment, the subject must be followed clinically until the event is resolved or deemed stable. A subject must be discontinued from the study drug if ALT or/and AST is > 5 times  the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or/and AST is 
> 3 times the  ULN and serum total bilirubin is > 2 times the ULN.

92 A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or  may be withdrawn 
at any time at the discretion of the Invest igator for safety, behavioral , or administrative reasons.   
If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any laboratory 
samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records and 
communicate this request  to Mycovia Pharmaceuticals . 
Subject who want to discontinue from the study should be encouraged to remain in the study 
for all remaining visits through Week 50 for safety and efficacy assessments.  All subjects who 
do discontinue early from the study should  have all EOS procedures performed on the day of 
discontinuation.  
If a subject is prematurely discontinued from study treatment for any reason other than 
withdrawal of consent , the Investigator (or designee) should request that the subject continues 
to participate in the study, attending all remaining visits in accordance with the  Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . Subjects who prematurely discontinue study medication, but 
remain in the study, may be treated according to the standard local practice.   If the subject does 
not agree to remain in the study , the Investigator (or designee) must make every effort to 
perform  the early withdrawal visit/EOS visit procedures. 
11.3 Subject and Study Completion  
A completed subject is one who has completed all visits , Screening through Week 50 (EOS),  
as defined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures . Study completion is defined as 
when the last subject has completed their last study visit.

94 12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
A formal SAP will be finalized before 50% of subjects are enrolled .  The SAP  will provide a 
more technical and detailed description of the proposed data analysis methods and procedures. 
Any deviation from the analyses outlined in the protocol will be described in the SAP. 
The primary statistical objective s of this st udy are:  
1. To determine if there is a difference in the proportions of subjects with one or more 
episodes of culture- verified acute VVC  in those receiving  VT-1161 compared to those 
receiving placebo; and  
2. To determine if there is a difference in the ability of VT -1161 and fluconazole to resolve 
acute episodes in  RVVC  subjects . 
12.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The study will enroll 180 total subjects (120 in the VT -1161 arm and 60 in the 
fluconazole/placebo arm).  For the primary efficacy endpoint determination, a  sample size of 
82 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 41 subjects in the fluconazole/ placebo arm  provides at 
least 9 0% power to detect a treatment difference between the VT -1161 treatment group and 
the fluconazole / placebo treatment group with a type 1 error  rate of 0.05. (PASS 2008: Fisher's 
exact test, two -sided alpha  = 0.05, and assuming 50% of placebo subjects have 
recurrence).   For the first key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with resolved 
acute VVC infections (clinical signs and symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment 
with VT -1161 or fluconazole, a sample size of 120 subjects in the VT -1161 arm and 60 subjects 
in the fluconazole/placebo arm provides at least 88% power to detect non- inferiority between 
the VT -1161 treatment group and the fluconazole treatment group with a non- inferiority 
margin of 15% and a type 1 error rate of 0.05. (PASS 2008: Z -test for two independent 
proportions, one -sided alpha = 0.025, non- inferiority margin = 15%, and assuming that 90% 
of fluconazole subjects resolve their acute VVC infection).     
12.2 Analysis Populations  
ITT Population: All randomized subjects.  
Safety Population: A ll randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP.  
PP Population: All randomized subjects who had the following:

95 • Had no deviations to inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact treatment 
outcome. 
• Were compliant with the assigned study treatment, defined as ≥80% compliance  
during the Induction P hase and ≥50% compliance during the weekly dosing phase. 
• Had the Week 50 visit completed within the  acceptable time window  (±14 days) . 
• Had no major protocol violations that would impact treatment outcome. 
Modified ITT:  All randomized subjects who had the following: 
• Positive  KOH at S creening.  
• Positive culture  at Screening.  
• Negative culture at Baseline.  
All statistical populations will be defined in the SAP.  
12.3 Missing Data  
For the efficacy analyses, missing values for the Investigator’s assessment of clinical signs and 
symptoms or the culture result will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  
For subjects who discontinue the study early and have missing assessm ents for all visits after 
discontinuation, the missing values for the expected scheduled visits will be imputed using the method of multiple imputation.  The missing values will be imputed using the following 
auxiliary information: region, treatment, baseli ne BMI, baseline age, ethnicity, and visit.  
The procedure PROC MI in SAS will be used to generate 10 possible imputed datasets. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint to assess the impact of missing data on the results. The details of these sensitivity analyses will be outlined in the SAP.   
12.4 Multiple Testing  
If the comparison for the primary endpoint is significant (two- sided p -value < 0.05), then 
testing will continue for the key secondary endpoints. To control for the type  I error rate at 
0.05 for multiple secondary endpoints, the hierarchical/gate -keeping method will be used.  
Each key secondary endpoint will be test ed according to the hierarchy.

12.5 Demographic and Baseline Characteristic Analyses  
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and study drug exposure will be 
summarized  by treatment group . 
12.6 Efficacy Analyses  
Clinical and mycological assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures . 
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects with one or more  culture-
verified  acute VVC episodes (post- randomization through Week 50) in the ITT population, 
which will include the subjects who failed clearing their infection during the Induction Phase . 
An acute VVC episode (considered a recurrent episode) is defined as a positive culture for 
Candida species and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3 . The primary efficacy outcome 
will be a nalyzed with a chi -square test.  The Wilson -Hiferty transformation will be applied to 
the Chi- square t est statistics prior to combining the 10 results using PROC MIANALYZE.

97 The key secondary efficacy outcome measures include the following: 
• The proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections (clinical signs and 
symptoms score of <3) at Day 14 following treatment with VT -1161 or fluconazole. 
• The proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute VVC episode 
with signs and symptoms of ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through 
Week 50). 
• Time  to first recurrence of a culture -verified acute VVC episode with signs and 
symptoms score ≥3 during the Maintenance Phase (post Day 14 through Week 50).  
• The proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the 
Maintenance Phase. 
 
The secondary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with resolved acute VVC infections at 
Day 14 in the VT -1161 arm will be evaluated for non- inferiority versus the fluconazole arm.  
A non- inferiority margin of 15% will be used.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval 
for the difference in proportions between the VT -1161 arm and the fluconazole arm is greater 
than -15% then non- inferiority will be claimed.  
Justification of the non- inferiority margin :  Fluconazole clears  80% of acute VVC 
infections.  Women can clear a VVC infection without intervention only when the infection is 
mild and even then , the complete clearance of the infection  is very rare.   Thus, a conservative 
estimate for the effect of fluconazole to treat a  VVC infection versus no intervention is at least 
70% (assuming 10% clear with no intervention).  Per the FDA guidance document on Non-
Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness, a non -inferiority margin that is half the 
effect of the control drug should be used.  A non- inferiority margin of 15% was selected for 
this trial which is equivalent to approximately 21% of the effect of fluconazole, which is 
substantially less than the recommend ed use of 50% of the effect  of the control drug for the 
non-inferiority margin .   
The secondary endpoints  of the proportion of subjects with at least one culture -verified acute 
VVC episode during the Maintenance phase, and the proportion of subjects with at least one positive culture for Candida during the Maintenance phase , will be analyzed using a similar 
method as the primary efficacy outcome. The secondary endpoint of time to first recurrence will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method. Subject’s with no recurrence will be

98 censored at their last non -missing  assessment. Differences between treatment groups will be 
assessed using a log -rank test.  
Subject who want to discontinue from the study should be encouraged to remain in the study  
for all remaining visits  through Week 50 for safety and efficacy assessments .  Subjects  who do 
discontinue early from the study should have all Week 50/EOS assessments performed on the 
day of discontinuation.  
12.7 Safety Analyses  
To meet the safety dataset  requirement, approximately 150 subjects will be screened to 
randomize approximately 180 subjects that would meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. 
Assuming a 20% discontinuation rate, it i s expected that approximately 1 44 subjects will 
complete the study.  
All subjects who receive at least one dos e of IMP will be included in the safety analyses. 
Subjects will be analyzed as per the treatment they receive.   The number and percentage of 
subjects having TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term with a 
breakdown by treatment group.  Mean changes from pre- treatment in vital signs, ECGs, and 
clinical laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group.  
AEs will be collected from the date of the f irst dose of  IMP through Week 50 (EOS).   Physical 
examination findings, vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry) will be obtained throughout the study as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures .  All concomitant medications taken during the period from 30 days prior to 
Screening through the Week 50 (EOS) visit will be recorded in the CRF.  Pertinent and all 
major medical cond itions will be recorded on the Medical History CRF.   
For subjects discont inuing early from the study, every effort will be made for all EOS 
procedures to be performed as outlined in the  Schedule of Assessments and Procedures .  
AEs will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA
®) version 
21 dictionary, or higher.  The number and percentage of subjects having treatment -emergent 
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class and MedDRA® preferred term with a breakdown 
by treatment group.  Mean changes from pre -treatmen t in vital signs, ECG, and clinical 
laboratory variables will be summarized by treatment group.  The AE profile will be 
characterized with severity and relationship to IMP.  SAEs and AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of IMP will be identified.

99 Treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory test results will be identified.  Treatment- emergent 
abnormal laboratory tests results are those in which the baseline value is within normal 
laboratory limits and at least 1 post- baseline value is outside normal laboratory limits .  Baseline  
will be defined as the last clinical laboratory result obtained before the first dose of IMP.  Per protocol, the baseline for laboratory values should be obtained at the Screening ( Day 1 ) 
visit.   
Change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and final vital sign value after first dosing will be summarized descriptively.   
ECG measurements will include heart rate, QT interval, QT c interval, PR interval, and QRS 
interval.  Baseline for ECG measuremen ts is defined per protocol as the value pre -dosing at 
the Day 1 (Baseline) visit.  Change from baseline will be summarized descriptively at each scheduled evaluation.  Subjects with clinically significant changes in ECG rhythm or 
waveform will be identifie d.  Subjects who meet each of the following criteria from ICH 
Guideline E14 “Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic 
Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs” (October 2005) for QT and corrected QT intervals 
will be identified.  
• QT or Fridericia -corrected QT >450 msec  
• QT or Fridericia -corrected QT >480 msec  
• QT or Fridericia -corrected QT >500 msec  
• QT or Fridericia -corrected QT increases from baseline by at least 30 msec  
• QT or Fridericia -corrected QT increases from baseline by at least 60 msec  
12.8 Pharmacokinetic  Analyses

are correct  and complete.  Prior to or between visits, the Medical Monitor  or clinical s tudy 
monitor may request copies of the eCRFs for preliminary medical review.  Once the eCRFs are 
complete and source verified, the Investigator must sign and date all required pages, verifying 
the accuracy of all data contained within the eCRF.  
Training will be provided for the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All personnel using 
the EDC system must have the  appropriate education, training, and experience, or any 
combinati on thereof. The Investigator will be provided with SOPs (contained in the 
Study P rocedures Manual  or a vendor -specific SOP) on the use of the EDC system.  
Documentation for employee education, training, and previous experience that pertains to the EDC syste m must be present in the Investigator files.  
If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by Mycovia 
Pharmaceut icals are used for documentation and data capture, the Investigator must ensure that 
the systems are validated and ensure regular data back -up. 
The eCRF will be signed by the Principal Investigator  listed on the Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) 1572 form .  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure 
the eCRFs are completed and submitted to Mycovia Pharm aceuticals (or designee) in an 
accurate and timely manner.   The processing of eCRFs will include an audit trail (to include 
changes made, reason for change, date of change, and person making change).  At the 
completion of the study, the Investigator will be provided with a final copy of the eCRFs for 
their subjects.  Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will be provided with a final copy of all subject  eCRF  
data for the study.

13.7 Study and Site Closure  
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the representative (or des ignated 
clinical study monitor ) of Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will conduct site closure activities with 
the Investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable regulations 
including GCP.  Mycovia  Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to tem porarily suspend or 
prematurely discontinue this study at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety 
or ethical issues or severe non- compliance.  For multicenter studies, this can occur at 1 or more 
or at all sites.   If the Sponsor determines such action is needed, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will 
discuss the reasons for taking such action with the Investigator or head of the medical 
institution (where applicable).   When feasible, Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will provide advance 
notification  to the Investigator or head of the medical institution (where applicable) of the 
impending action.  If the study is suspended or prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, 
Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will promptly inform all Investigators, heads of medical institutions 
(where applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study.  Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  will 
also promptly inform the relevant regulatory authorities of the suspension or premature discontinuation of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required by applicable 
regulations, the Investigator must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for 
the suspension or premature discontinuation. 
13.8 Records Retention  
Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site s tudy records (except 
for those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere), in a safe and secure 
location.  The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed (e.g., 
for a Mycovia Pharmaceuticals  audit or regulatory  inspection) and must be available for review 
in conjunction with the assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and relevant site staff.  
When permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the records can be maintained in  a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); 
however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken.  The Investigator must

117 Appendix C: Child- Pugh Classification of Hepatic Impairment  
 
The Child- Pugh classification is a means of assessing the severity of liver cirrhosis.  
Score  1 2 3 
bilirubin (micromol/l)  <34 34 – 50 >50 
albumin (g/l)  >35 28 – 35 <28 
PT (s prolonged)  <4 4 – 6 >6 
encephalopathy  none  mild marked  
ascites  none  mild marked  
If there is primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis then bilirubin is classified as <68  =1; 
6 – 170 = 2; >170 = 3. 
The individual scores are summed and then grouped as: 
• <7 = A (Mild impairment)  
• 7 – 9 = B (Moderate impairment)  
• >9 = C (Severe impairment)  
A C classification forecasts a survival of less than 12 months.

1.0 Protocol Summ ary  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate a targeted approach for the management of the plantar lesions of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). The 
drug to be tested is called sirolimus (Rapamycin),  it is a mammalian Target of 
Rapamycin (mTOR) inhi bitor to be used as a topical agent for treatment of the 
blistering /callus lesions on the soles of f eet.  
 Sirolimus 2 % ointment , has been shown to reduce expression of keratin (KRT) 
6/16 and improve walking ability in a related condition affecting the feet, pachyonychia congenita, as well as being safe. Since sirolimus may have similar effects on the paired KRT 5/14  which are affected in EBS , we are  
conduct ing a prospective, double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, 
crossover study .  
 Participants will be assigned t o treat both feet with either  topical sirolimus 2% 
ointment  twice daily or placebo (vehicle- control) for 12 weeks  followed by a 
washout period of four weeks , then retreatment to both feet with t he switched 
intervention followed by a washout period of four weeks, and then a post -study 
phone call at 8 weeks  thereafter.  
 This study  will exploit the naturally occurring transcriptional regulation of keratin 
sequences, the known gene aberration causing EBS, and assess the potential for mTOR pathway  inhibition in treatment of EB patient’s plantar lesions.  
  
2.0 Background and Rationale 
 
2.1 Disease background  
 Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) represents a spectrum of conditions characterized by blistering and mechanical fragility of the skin. Individuals with EB display tremendous clinical diversity, as the dermal -epidermal basement membrane 
zone contains a number of specialized adhesive structures that link  the basal 
epidermis cytoskeleton to the papillary dermis. The molecular basis of EB has been linked to 18 genes, leading to the classification of 28 clinical (15 EBS, 8 JEB, 14 DEB, 1 Kindler)  
EB subtypes and four  major EB groups (Fine et al., 2014). With importance to 
this proposal, the EB simplex (EBS) subtype has been well -characterized 
genetically, and it is this characterization the authors plan to exploit with the goal of improving current state of the art.  
 EBS refers to a group of rare inherited disorders caused by blister formation within the epidermis. The clinical features of all forms of EBS manif est with skin 
 Page 6 of 30 blistering. Palmoplantar -keratoderma, nail dystrophy and shedding, alopecia 
and oral involvement can be seen. Excruciating pain and severe impairment in 
quality of life in EBS patients has been reported (Fine at el., Clin Exp Dermatol 
2004). Causes of early mortality in EBS patients  include infections and protein 
loss leading to malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and anemia. 
Patient care has been limited to supportive measures, including wound care, 
nutritional  support, and antibi otics. In 1991, two groups published in Cell and 
Science independently revealing the first keratin disorder with a genetic basis in 
humans, EBS. EBS is usually caused by missense mutations in the genes 
encoding keratin 5 and 14 (KRT5 and KRT14, respectively) leading to a 
dominant negative effect on the function of normal keratins (Lane et al ., J Pathol 
2004), resulting in keratin cytoskeleton dysfunction. The prevalence is estimated to be 6 to 30 per 1 million live births . 
 2.2 Sirolimus  
 
Sirolimus  binds to immunophilin FK506 binding protein- 12 and creates a 
complex that inhibits the activation of mTORC1 that  leads to decreased 
translational initiation. Consequently, sirolimus  has shown to decrease overall 
protein synthesis by 20% and cause cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. ( Castedo et 
al., 2001) Other effects of sirolimus  include apoptosis, inhibition of T -cell 
activation and reduced expression of specific proteins involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, specifically hypoxia inducible factor -1a (HIF -1a) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (Guba et. al 2002)  
 Systemic use of sirolimus  is associated with side effects that include 
opportunistic infection, mucositis, hypercholesterolemia, decreased renal function, elevation in liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and delayed wound healing. Minor adverse cutaneous events of systemic therapy include acne like eruptions, edema, and nail disorders. mTOR inhibitors in topical preparations show promise as an ideal delivery system to mini mize 
systemic adverse effects in the treatment of dermatological disease.   
 Topical  formulations of sirolimus  are being used off -label in a variety of 
dermatological diseases ( see Table 1)  (Fogel et al, 2015) . Formulations are 
mostly crushed sirolimus from tablet compounded with petrolatum to form an 
ointment, with a few studies utilizing the commercially available oral sirolimus  
solution (1mg/ml). Most of the topical formulations were found to have no local adverse effects, with irritation being more common using the aqueous solution. In all cases the systemic level of sirolimus was less than 2ng/ml that  is below 
the standard serum levels required for immunosuppression (5- 15 ng/ml). 
Treatment duration and frequency varied according to condition.   2.3 Ratio nale 
 The development of new treatment modalities is critical in improving disease state and the quality of life for EBS patients.  Disease classification has changed 
from descriptive to a detailed pathogenesis over the past several decades, and 
 Page 7 of 30 now scientists are drawn to ask the question, “How can we approach this 
disease in a targeted fashion?”  
 Therapeutic approaches  targeting the deleterious effects of abnormal and 
abundant keratins are emerging.  Topical sirolimus 2%  is one potential  
medication yet to be utilized in EBS patients. It has been shown to selectively 
block 5’oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation thereby altering mRNAs 5’TOP motifs  (Raught et al., 2001) . Published sequence data suggest KRT5 mRNA, 
but not KRT14 mRNA, contain the 5’TOP motif ( Hickerson et al., 2009) and thus 
are viable drug targets of mTOR for the treatment of EBS variants.  
  
3.0 Hypothesis  
 
Our hypothesis is th at the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus  will down regulate the 
translation of defective KRT5 protein, therefore ameliorating the severity of EBS in patients affected. Additionally, altering the mTOR pathway may  directly affect 
pain and itch (R Kasper, May 2015, unpublished correspondence). Itch and pain are two of the three top symptoms that matter to patients living with EB (Challe nges & Unmet Needs in EB, Jemima Mellerio, EB2015 Conference, 
Atlanta, GA), both of which are secondary outcome measures in this study.    
 
4.0 Objectives and Scientific aims  
 
Aim 1: To assess the safety of topical sirolimus 2%  use in the treatment of plantar 
lesions in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS).   
Aim 2: To assess the efficacy of topical sirolimus 2%  to improve the clinical

6.0 Study Design  and Intervention 
 Page 9 of 30  
6.1 Study Design  
 
This study is  a prospective, double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled 
crossover study at Stanford Univer sity School of Medicine, USA.  It includes  a 6-
week screening period,  followed by  a 4 Phase Pilot Clinical Trial (see Table 2).  
 
Screening:  Up to 6 weeks  
Phase 1:  12-week treatment period  
Phase 2:  4-week wash- out period  
Phase 3:  12-week treatment period  
Phase 4: 4 - week wash out  period  
Follow -up: 8 weeks after end- of-trial visit.  
 This research study is expected to take approximately 40 weeks. There will be 2 different parts of the study which the subject  may receive for initial treatment 
period either (a) placebo (no drug) or (b) study drug for 12 weeks, during their 
enrollment in the 40- week study. After the initial 12- week period, there will be a 
washout period consisting of 4 weeks, before starting secondary treatment. 
During the secondary treatment period, a switch will occur and subject  will 
receive either the (a) placebo (no drug) or (b) study drug depending on which 
treatment was received ini tially. At some time point during the 40- week study, at 
least both feet will receive study drug. There will also be a post -treatment visit at 
week 16 and week 32, with a post study phone call at Week 40. The end of 
treatment period will occur at Week 12 and Week 28, with the final in- person 
study visit  occurring at week 32. Structured phone calls made by a physician will 
occur at Week 2, Week 14, Week 18,  and Week 40.  
 The EBDASI feet score needs to be within 20% of baseline to progress to Phase 3. If subject’s score  does not meet this criteria the Phase 2 wash- out can 
be extended to 6 weeks.   
 Treatments are switched after Phase 2.  
 In-person study visi ts:  
 Week 0 (screening/baseline)  
 Week 4 
 Week 12 
 Week 16 
 Week 20 
 Week 28 
 Week 32 
 Structured  physician phone- call will be scheduled at: 
 Week  2 
 Week  14 
 Week 18 
 Week 40

6.2 Recruitment Process  
 
EBS is a rare orphan disease and Stanford is one of several multidisciplinary 
clinics in the world that focuses on the treatment of EB.  With a prevalence of 6-10 per million, there are roughly 3,200 patients in the United States.  This study aims to e nroll a total of 8- 10 patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital 
Stanford. We cooperate with national and international networks of families, researchers, and physicians who care for children and adults with EB and plan to use these groups to recruit subjects for this study. In addition we will use our email listserv (ebcarenetwork@lists.Stanford.edu) to inform our national communities that we are recruiting for this study.  Patients have previously 
signed Consent Forms that have been approved by the Stanford ethics 
committee to be involved in these databases  and contac ted. Over 20 0 people 
are contained within these databases , 24 of which have EB with know n EBS 
genetic  KRT 5/14  mutation.  We will access these databases to gain participant 
names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses that  we will  use to 
invite them  to participate in the study. Preference in enrolment will be given to 
particip ants in proximity to the study site and those with genetic KRT 5/14 
mutations. Genetic testing is not a requirement for EBS diagnoses nor study enrollment. The mechanism of dise ase in EBS is well known as an autosomal 
dominant defect in keratin 5 or keratin 14. We will not be genotyping, the cost of genotyping is high at  $3-4k per subject . If genotyping is already known, this 
information will be utilized.  Our recruitment methods will not involve material 
inducements .  A telephone recruitment form has been submitted with this IRB 
request . Study personnel will  not receive incentives for recruiting study 
participants or for any other purpose directly related to the study . 
  
6.3 Compensation for  participation  
 
There will be no compensation for participation in this study but travel expenses 
may be reimbursed e .g. by using IPTA AS (Isolated Patients Travel and 
Accommodation Assistance Scheme) . 
 6.4 Screening/Baseline  Period  
 
Before any s tudy-specific interventions are performed, the appropriate written 
informed consent must be obtained for the trial and a separate consent for skin 
biopsy , which is an optional additional procedure.   
 To assess subject eligibility, all screening  assessments as follows should be 
completed: eligibility criteria, medical history and physical exam , weight and 
height, demography, vital signs, concomitant medications, Epidermolysis Bullosa Diseases Activity S core (EBDA SI), Quality of Life in Epidermolysis 
Bullosa (QOLEB),  collection of blood for: metabolic p anel, complete blood cell 
count with differential, urinalysis , lipid profile .  
 Page 11 of 30  
The participant will also be initiated in how to use the Fitbit and completion of 
daily diaries and the various different questionnaires to be used in the trial.    6.5 Treatment P eriod – Phase 1  
 Participants  who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomiz ed 1:1 to receive 
either topical sirolimus 2%  or placebo ointment . The on- site Registered Nurse 
will teach the participant how  to apply the ointment to both feet and will 
administer the first dose of IMP at week 0. Subsequent twice  daily application of 
IMP to both feet will be performed by the participant, this will continue for 12 
weeks.   6.6 Wash -Out P eriod – Phase 2  
 After co mpletion of Phase 1 the participant will stop applying the IMP to the feet 
for a period of 4 weeks at which point their baseline activity will be assessed. If their EBDASI feet score is within 20% of baseline they can proceed to Phase 3.  
 6.7 Treatment P eriod – Phase 3 
 Participants who received topical sirolimus 2%  during phase 1 will switch to 
placebo ointment  and vice versa. Twice  daily application of IMP will be 
continued by the participant for  a further 12 weeks. The trial will remain double-
blinded t hroughout.  
 6.8 Wash -Out Period – Phase 4 
 
After completion of Phase 3 participants will enter a further 4- week wash- out 
period where they will stop applying the IMP to their feet. At the end of Phase 4 they will attend for their final end- of-trial physician visit.  
 6.9 Follow -up P eriod  
 Week 3 2-40 will be the follow -up period with a structured physician phone 
consultation at Week 40.   Participants  who withdraw from treatment will also 
enter the follow -up period.  
  
7.0 Study T reatment  
 
7.1 Investigational P roduct  
 Topical sirolimus 2%  and placebo ointment  will be made and supplied by PCCA 
compounding pharmacy . Placebo ointment  will consist of vehicle only – i.e. all 
the same components as the topical sirolimus 2%  ointment  minus the active 
 Page 12 of 30 ingredient. Both wi ll have the same appearance, texture and odor and will be in 
a matching container  or tube.   
 
Tubes will contain vehicle or sirolimus 2% ointment in a 60 gram supply, the amount of topical for twice daily application over 2 weeks. We expect 360 grams for each phase of the treatment, 720 grams total with 360 grams intervention 
and 360 grams vehicle. Vehicle is an ointment plasticized base contained no water that provides at least 6 months sirolimus stability (Chemistry RX, Lars Brichta April 8 communication;  PCCA plasticized base information provided in 
Section 16). 'A kit' describes two components in a plastic bag or cardboard box: (1) vehicle (placebo) or intervention (sirolimus 2%) ointment in 60 gram tubes and (2) our "Study Drug Application Kit Instructions' (provided in Section 16).  
 Contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requir ements .   
 
Study Drug Storage:  The IP will be stored at room temperature  in a dry place, 
away from direct sunlight.  
 
  At each physician visit the participant will be re- supplied with sufficient IMP until 
their next visit. The containers will also be weighed to monitor how much IMP is being used.  
 Patients will be instructed to wear gloves and change gloves between applications.  
  7.2 Treatmen t Assignment  
 
Participants who provide informed consent and undergo screening assessments receive a unique participant number. This assignment of participant  numbers 
occurs at the screening and baseline visit and serves to identify data in an anonymous fas hion. Participant eligibility will be established at the conclusion of 
the baseline evaluations (prior to randomization and first dose of IMP at Week 
0). Participants  who meet all entry criteria will then be randomized in a 1:1 
allocation to receive either  topical sirolimus 2%  or placebo ointment  according to 
a computer -generated randomization list.   
 The participants and the investigator staff (except the unblinded pharmacist)  will 
be blinded to the treatment assignment.  Participants who withdraw from the 
study following informed consent, but before randomization to study treatment, will be classified as screen failures.  
 7.4 Blinding  
 
This is a double- blind study. All study staff (which includes the investigator, sub-
 Page 13 of 30 investigators, other site staff ) and p articipants  will be blinded to the treatment 
allocation throughout the trial.  
 
The blinded study treatment assignments for individual participants  will be 
maintained by a Central System  used by the study pharmacy . Emergency 
unblinding will be available vi a the central system  in a case where the identity of 
the IMP must be known in order to treat an emergent adverse experience for an individual patient . 
 If the treatment blind is broken for a participant in the treatment period, the  
participant  in question will be withdrawn from the treatment period and moved 
into the follow -up period.  
 During the study, investigators will not receive central laboratory data that have the potential to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment.  
 
7.5 Prohibited concomitant medications  
 
Participants  may take other medications for treatment of the symptoms 
associated with EBS, so long as they do not fall into any of the prohibited medications categor y (see exclusion criteria).  
  
8.0 Study A ssessments  
 
Table 2  shows  the schedule of a ssessments for the study. The investigator s 
(medically qualified) are to conduct all study assessments. The investigator or designee must obtain written informed consent prior to performing any of the study information that will be recorded in source docum ents.  
 If a visit cannot be scheduled on the appropriate date, the visit should be re-scheduled as close as possible to the planned date, ideally within 3 days.  
 The study participants and caregivers will be given specific instructions about gentle skin care and avoid possible irritants on the treated area during the entire study. Patients will also be instructed to inspect the plantar surface daily to ensure no trauma.  
 8.1 Medical h istory  and examination  
 
A complete medical history will be taken at the Screening Visit. Information from the medical history is important to establish the baseli ne condition of the 
participant  and will impact the safety monitoring assessments during the study. 
Any significant medical conditions affecting the participant  in the past 5 years 
should be recorded. The history should include the following:  
 
 Page 14 of 30 • A thorough review of systems, including any past or current conditions  
• Prior surgical procedures  
• Full medication history  
• Prior immunosuppressive therapies, including type, number, and duration  
• Allergies and significant allergic reactions  
• Significant infections, or history of recurrent infection, including urinary and 
respiratory tract infections  
• Smoking history (current or previous smoker, number of packs per day 
smoked) 
• Full physic al examination will be performed by an experienced medical 
practitioner.  
 
8.2 Epidermolysis bullosa simplex h istory  
 
Details of the participant’s  EBS history will be collected (e.g. dates of symptom 
onset,  diagnosis) and recorded.  These data are critical for establishing  subject 
eligibility, as well as establishing a baseline for subsequent clinical 
assessments .  
 8.3 Primary outcome m easures  
 1. Foot function utilizing the validated Foot Health Status Questionnaire 
(FHSQ)  as a change from baseline to the end  of each treatment.  
2. Safety and tolerability of topical sirolimus 2% ointment (serum trough 
sirolimus levels, monitoring for adverse events) . 
 8.4 Secondary  Outcome  Measures  
 
1. Plantar defect  size measurements using  3D photography (% change in total 
defect  area) from baseline to the end of each treatment.  
2. EB Disease Activity and Scarring Index (EBDASI)  feet activity scores  as a 
change from baseline to the end of each treatment  
3. Quality of life assessment in EB (QOLEB) as a change from baseline to the 
end of each treatment.  
4. Itch severity  measured  using 5- D Pruritus Scale as a change from baseline 
to the end of each treatment.  
5. Participants will wear a FitBit® for the duration  of the study to assess 
number of steps walked per day as a change from baseline to the e nd of 
each treatment.  
6. Changes in foot plantar pressure measurements  before and after treatment 
using the Podotech Elftman Foot Scanner from baseline to the end of each 
treatment . 
7. Molecular biology study of skin biopsies assayed for mTOR pathway inhibition (e.g. determination of phosphoprotein inhibition included ribosomal 
protein S6, S6 kinase and/or eIF -4E binding protein) as a change from 
baseline to the end of each treatment.  
 
 Page 15 of 30 8.5 Safety Assessments 
 
Safety and tolerability of the medication will be ass essed at each visit through 
recording of adverse events, serious adverse events, evaluation of systemic 
absorption through measurement of trough sirolimus levels  in serum , and 
additional safety laboratory tests listed below will also be performed.  
 Invest igator assessment of local skin reaction (including increased erythema, 
edema, weeping/exudates, flaking/scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, and erosion/ulceration) will be assessed independently of other adverse effects . 
 Serum sirolimus  levels  
Trough s erum sirolimus  levels are a frequently run outpatient laboratory ELISA 
assay and will be performed at Stanford University  at specific study visit s from 
baseline . 
 Other Safety Laboratory Assessments  
The clinical safety laboratory parameters will be assessed at each study visit. Laboratory tests may be repeated more often if clinically indicated.  
 All out -of-normal range laboratory values must be evaluated by the Investigator 
or subinvestigator as to whether they are clinically significant (i.e., require medi cal intervention or have clinical signs and/or symptoms). Abnormal clinical 
laboratory parameters that are considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be recorded on the A dverse Event (AE)  Case Report Form 
(CRF)  except Baseline visit. Clinic ally significant laboratory abnormalities noted 
from the Baseline visit will be recorded as medical history. The AE  should be 
reported as a clinical diagnosis when possible. Laboratory tests will be performed at S tanford Children’s Health clinics .  
 Urine Pregnancy Tests (UPT) will be performed at each scheduled visit on 
female subjects  of childbearing potential  starting at Baseline. If a UPT results in 
a positive test, the subject must be discontinued.  
 Sample management (collection, storage, shipping, etc…) will be done according to Stanford Clinical Laboratories standards and policies.  
 Clinical safety laboratories will include:  
• Full blood count  (CBC , Metabolic Panel, Liver function tests ) 
• Lipid  panel profile  
• U rinalysis  
• Sirolimus trough (at specific study visits)  
 These will be performed at each scheduled study  visit from screening /baseline 
visit (7 total) , except for sirolimus trough.

8.6 Efficacy A ssessments 
Clinical assessments of the extent and severity of plantar lesions will be 
performed throughout the study.  
 Foot Health Status Questionnaire  (FHSQ) 
The purpose of this questionnaire is primarily to measure foot health related to 
foot function and quality of life. There are 19 q uestions regarding foot health and 
its impact  with 4 subscales: foot pain, foot function, footwear and foot health. It 
has been shown to have excellent validity and ability to detect change in clinical 
trials  and has demonstrated good reliability ( Riskowski  et al., 2011).  
 Epidermolysis B ullosa Disease Activity Score (EBDASI)  
The EBDASI is a validated scoring system that objectively quantifies the severity of EB  affecting the entire body . It has been designed to evaluate the 
response to new therapies for the treatment of EB. It was developed and validated many time over in the literature ( Loh et al., 2014)  
 EBDASI feet score  
Is a subsection of the EBDASI and objectively quantifies activity and damage 
levels relating to the feet only.  Activity is graded according to size and number 
of lesions  (blisters/erosions)  in specific anatomical area. Damage is graded 
according to the presenc e/absence of the following signs: erythema, 
pigmentation, poikiloderma, atrophy, hyperkeratosis, scarring and milia.  
 Method of  defect  assessment  
Tracing of affected wounds will be performed using Visitrak  Digital Wound 
Assessment System . This is a portable device that provides accurate, 
reproducible data for tracking wound progress  (See Figure 2). 
 Quality of life in Epidermolysis Bullosa (QOLEB)  
QOLEB is a Qual ity of Life Q uestionnaire specifically designed for people with 
EB. The QOLEB can be used to identify everyday life occurrences  negatively 
affected by EB. It assesses change in quality of life over time, an important 
measure when assessing the success of new treatments for EB  (Frew et al., 
2009) . 
 Plantar Pressure Measurements  
The Podotech  Elftman foot pressure scanner uses 1600 electronic sensors 
incorporated into a thin mat to measure pressures at various points on the soles of the feet. This analysis can be performed while standing to get a static analysis or when walking to get a dynamic analysis. Peak pressures can be calculated and can correlate with areas of hyperkeratosis and changes in loading due to pain. A before and after assessment of participants feet using this device will give us insight into how hyperkeratosis has changed as well as 
 Page 17 of 30 changes in loading and pain.  This technology is extensively investigated in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients (Van der leeden et al 2008) . 
 Fitbit Pedometer Mobility Measurements  
Each enrolled study subject will receive a FitBit®/pedometer during their partic ipation in the study to track their activity levels. This purchase will be made 
using our SPARK grant funding and be provided to subjects at no cost. Will add the information below to the consent and in Section 16.  
 The FitBit / pedometer will sync stats wirelessly to a deidentified premium account at www.fitbit.com/zip. An Excel form of the data will be downloaded on health protected computers every two weeks. FitBit pedometers have been 
demonstrated in the literature as reliable and accurate (Storm FA et  al. Step 
Detection and Activity Recognition Accuracy of Seven Physical Activity Monitors. PLoS ONE, 2015).  
 Erythema score of soles of feet  
An erythema score of a specified location on the soles of the feet will be 
obtained through use of Mexameter® MX 18  to detect  any change in erythema 
at each study visit. This will be an objective measure of local skin irritation at the 
treatment site. This is an easy, quick and economical tool to measure erythema 
by reflectance. The instrument is worldwide established and used in many 
scientific studies.  
 Skin biopsies assayed for mTOR pathway inhibition The skin biopsies  are optional and will be assayed for transcriptional factors of 
mTOR pathway inhibition using Western blot / immunohistochemical  methods 
(Transderm la boratory, Santa Cruz USA) e.g. determination of phosphoprotein 
inhibition included ribosomal protein S6, S6 kinase and/or eIF -4E binding 
protein. Tissue samples will be transferred to Transderm laboratory deidentified 
and without identifiable personal health information. A separate consent, and if applicable, assent form(s) will be used.  
 5-D Pruritus Scale  
People with EBS can experience the aggravating symptom of itch.  This validated tool will be utilized to assess the effect ( if any ) topical  sirolimus ha s on 
this symptom (Elman et al., 2010)  
 8.7 Adverse E vents  (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
The investigator is responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the star t of 
study treatment through the protocol -specified  follow -up period.  
 
Definition of an AE: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
 Page 18 of 30 temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. This also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i .e. lack of efficacy), abuse, or misuse.  
 A serious advers e event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
e. Results in a  congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 8.8 Pregnancy  
 
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to starting treatment with study drug . Females of non -
childbearing potential are defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: (1) over the age of 60 years  (2) amenorrheic for at least 2 years, (3) 
have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. All other females (includin g those with tubal ligation) will be considered to be of childbearing 
potential. At visits 2 -12 urine pregnancy testing need only be performed if the 
subject has missed a menstrual cycle.  The pregnancy must be followed up to 
determine outcome (including premature termination) and status  
of mother and child.  
 
9.0 Data and Statistical Analysis  
 
9.1  Hypotheses  
The null hypotheses is that there is no difference in efficacy between topical sirolimus 2%  and placebo ointment  in improving the clinical 
severity/ function/ pain scores of the plantar lesions in EBS. The alternative 
hypothesis is that topical sirolimus 2%  is superior to placebo ointment .  
 9.2  Sample size calculation  
Recruitment of 8 subjects needed to detect an average 30% improvement of 
foot function scor e between topical sirolimus 2% and placebo with standard 
deviation of 40%, with power >0.8 and two- sided significance level of 5% 
(Stanford Statistician Group, USA ). 
 9.3  Treatment comparisons  
The primary comparison of interest is between placebo and topi cal sirolimus 2%  
on foot function using the validated F oot Health Status Questionnaire.  
 Secondary comparisons of interest will be made between placebo and  
topical sirolimus 2%  on the secondary outcome measures.

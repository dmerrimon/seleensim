and from week 12 to week 24 across all scales in each treatment group.  
Exploratory Objective s: 
1. The m ean change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD -7) scale from baseline to 
week 8 and week 12, and from week 12 to week 24 in each treatment group.  
Methodology:  
This protocol describes a 2 -part study. The first part will be a randomized, multicenter , double -
blind (raters and participants), 12 -week, controlled study in parallel balanced groups of 
depressed patients to evaluate  the impact of GeneSight Psychotropic on response to ps ychotropic 
treatments listed in Appendix 1  of this protocol. Patients enrolled in this study will be required to 
have Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision 
(DSM -IV-TR) diagnosis of MDD, a total score ≥11 on the QIDS -C16 and QIDS -SR16, and an  
inadequate response within the current episode to at least 1 psychotropic treatment. For the 
purpose of this protocol, inadequate response is defined as inadequate efficacy after 6 weeks of 
treatment or discontinuation of a psychotropic treatment due to a dverse events (AEs) or 
intolerability. Upon completion of the double -blind part of the study, participants will contin ue 
in a 12 -week open -label part of the study to evaluate the long -term impact of the use of 
GeneSight Psychotropic .  
Patients suffering from MDD will be enrolled in the study and randomized on a 1:1 basis to 
treatment as usual or to treatment decision utilizing GeneSight Psychotropic . 
Screening Period  
Screening procedures will include GeneSight Psychotropic genotyping (b uccal swab). After 
signing an informed consent form  (ICF) , patients will be evaluated for inclusion in the study not 
more than 2 weeks, and preferably 3 days prior to enrollment (results of the buccal swab will be 
available within 3 days).  
Screening evalu ations will include: demographics, medical history, medication history and 
response including previous and current psychotropic treatment, physical examination, vital 
signs, height, weight, psychiatric assessments including Mini International Neuropsychiat ric 
Interview, DSM -IV-TR criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, QIDS -SR16, QIDS -C16, 
laboratory parameters (to exclude hepatic insufficiency) , pharmacogenomic blood sample  and 
Urine Drug Screen.  
Patients’ psychotropic medication should not be modified (in  terms of type and dosage) during 
the screening period.  
Randomization  
Upon completion of the screening procedures, patients will be evaluated for eligibility against 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study and ra ndomized to 
one of two groups (treatment as usual or to treatment decision utilizing GeneSight Psychotropic ). 
Upon inclusion into the study, participants will be evaluated with HAM -D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9,

GAD -7, CGI-S, and SF -36. 
Upon inclusion in the study,  investigators will be given the results of the GeneSight Psychotropic  
test for the participants randomized to the treatment decision utilizing GeneSight Psychotropic  
group. Investigators will be unblinded  and use the report to support their treatment decision s for 
patients in the GeneSight Psychotropic group . However, raters  and participants will be blinded.   
Sites should use the same blinded Site -Rater to conduct the QIDS -C16 throughout the trial.  Each 
site should have a qualified back -up Rater for the QIDS –C16 in the event they must conduct 
ratings in the absence of the primary rater.  The Treating Clinician should never conduct the 
QIDS -C16. 
Double -Blind Treatment Period  
Throughout the 12 -week double -blind treatment period, participants will be followed up (in -
clinic visit) for efficacy, tolerability, and safety, at the end (± 3 days) of Weeks 4, 8, and 12.   
During the in -clinic visits, participants will be evaluated with HAM -D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9, and 
GAD -7.  At the end  of Week 12 visit, participants will also be evalu ated with CGI-S, CGI -I, 
CGI-EI, and SF -36. 
12-Week Open -Label Extension  
Following completion of the double -blind period, participants will continue in the study for an 
additional 12 weeks to evaluate the longer term impact of GeneSight Psychotropic . At the start of 
the open -label extension a ll participants will be given the re sults of their GeneSight Psychotropic  
test and will therefore be unblinded and treating clinicians can utilize GeneSight Psychotropic  
for treatment decision support of all participants. This phase of the study will have an in-clinic 
visit at the end (± 2  weeks) of Week 24, and evaluat ion with  HAM-D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9, 
GAD -7, CGI-S, CGI -I, CGI -EI, and SF -36. 
Early Termination Visit  
If early termination occurs  after Visit  2, the subject should attend an in -clinic visit as soon as 
possible to complete early termination procedures that will consist of all procedures scheduled 
for Week 24.  
Duration of Study for Individual Participants  
Individual participation in the double -blind period will last a maximum of approximately 26 
weeks (up to 2 weeks screening; 12 -week double -blind treatment  and a 12 -week  follow -up 
period ). 
Number of Participants Planned:  A sufficient number of participants will be enrolled in the 
study to have at least 1200 participants complete the Week 8 visit.  
Study Population:  
Males and females, outpatients, ≥18 years of age, diagnosed with MDD having had an 
inadequate response to at least 1 psychotropic treatment within the current depressive episode 
will be enrolled in the study. Inadequate response is defined as lack of effic acy after 6 weeks of

Statistical and Analytical Plan:  
Continuous variables (defined in section 12) will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics including means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. Categorical variables 
(defined in section 12) will be summarized with frequencies and percentage s. Relative risk of 
response and remission will be determined between groups. Ninety -five percent confidence 
intervals will be provided for descriptive statistics, as warranted.  
 
Diagnostics will be performed on the data to determine appropriate statistical modeling prior to 
all analyses. When standard modeling assumptions of normality, independence, and 
heterogeneity of variance are met for continuous outcomes, statistically signi ficant differences 
between groups will be determined with repeated measures ANOVA models when modeling 
change in outcome scores across all time points or with 1 -way independent ANOVA models 
when modeling change in outcome scores using week 8, week 1 2, and baseline scores. 
Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) will be applied when standard modeling assumptions 
are not met.  
 
Comparisons between composite phenotype subgroups will be conducted with independent t -
tests when standard modeling assumptions are m et, or with z -tests using GEEs when 
assumptions are not met.  
 
Time to response/remission will be plotted using Kaplan -Meier curved and statistically 
significant differences in time to response/remission will be tested using Cox proportional hazard 
models.

5.1 Background on Major Depression  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent (Hasin et al., 2005) mental disorder and a 
leading source of disease burden worldwide (L opez et al., 2006). Epidemiological studies 
estimate 12 -month and lifetime prevalence for MDD in the United States to be 5.3% and 13.2%, 
respectively (reviewed in Blanco et al., 2010). MDD is expected to be the second greatest cause 
of disability by 2020 a nd has been shown to cause significant morbidity, affecting people’s 
ability to work, function in relationships, and engage in social activities. Moreover, MDD 
increases the risk of suicidal ideation, attempted suicide , and death by completed suicide.  
 
Prospective longitudinal studies of patient samples show that MDD is a chronic illness, 
characterized by remitting and recurrent depressive episodes (Solomon et al., 1997; Mueller et 
al., 1999). A major depressive episode is characterized by a low mood or an inability to 
experience pleasure (anhedonia), or both, for more than 2 weeks, combined with several 
cognitive and vegetative symptoms and the occurrence of distress or impairment (reviewed in 
Rot et al., 2009). In the US, nearly 1 in 5 people will exper ience a major depressive episode at 
some point in their lives (reviewed in Rot et al., 2009).  
 
Drugs currently available to treat depression fall into the categories of those that have their main 
effect by increasing norepinephrine (NE) (the tricyclic or t etracyclic antidepressants [TCAs]), 
those that increase serotonin ( 5-HT) (the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), and 
those that increase both NE and 5 -HT (the monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs] and the 
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake  inhibitors [SNRIs]). While all antidepressants achieve 
similar levels of efficacy, treatment failures are relatively high ranging from 30 to 60% (Simpson 
and DePaulo). Additionally, many of these compounds are associated with significant adverse 
events (A Es). 
 
5.2 Background on GeneSight Psychotropic  
 
The GeneSight Psychotropic  product is a pharmacogenomic decision support tool that helps 
clinicians to make informed, evidence -based decisions about proper drug selection, based on the 
testing for clinically important genetic variants in multiple pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic genes that affect a patient’s ability to tolerate or respond to medications.    
The GeneSight Psychotropic  product contains the most commonly prescribed antidepressant and 
antipsychotic medication s, including a full representation of the SSRI and SNRI drug classes.  
Tricyclic antidepressants , an MAOI, and typical and  atypical antip sychotics are also represented . 
 
The clinical utility of GeneSight Psychotropic has been evaluated in th ree previous prospective 
trials.   Hall-Flavin et al reported the results of a n open -label  pilot study (n = 44) comparing 
GeneSight guided treatment to t reatment as usual (TAU) without the benefit of 
pharmacogenomic testing (2012).  The GeneSight guided arm demonstrated a 30.8% 
Proto col No. ARX 1006  CONFIDENTIAL  Assurex  
04/21/15  14 improvement in HAM -D17 score by the end of the 8 week treatment period, compared to an 
18.2% improvement in the TAU arm (p = 0.04) .  Results of the larger (n = 165) open -label trial 
(Hall -Flavin, et al 2013) mirrored these findings, demonstrating a 46.9% improvement in HAM -
D17 score in the GeneSight arm, compared to a 29.9% improvement in the TAU arm (p < 
0.0001).   The third trial us ed a randomized, double -blind trial design (n = 51).  Due to the small 
sample size, the trial was underpowered to detect a significant difference in improvement 
between the two arms (TAU and GeneSight).  However, effect sizes of improvement reflected 
those  seen in previous trials.  The GeneSight group experienced a 30.8% improvement in HAM -
D17, compared to 20.7% in TAU.  Odds ratios for response were calculated, showing that 
GeneSight -guided subjects had a 2.14 times greater likelihood of response compared to TAU 
subjects, which was similar to the 4.67 (smaller trial) and 2.06 (larger trial) odds ratios calculated 
for the other two studies.  
 
5.3 Study Rationale  
Previous studies utilizing an open -label design have shown significant improvement in patient 
outcomes  following use of the GeneSight test.  However, although effect sizes were similar to 
those seen in the open -label studies, a small (n = 51) blinded, randomized controlled trial did not 
detect a statistically significant outcome.  Therefore, the primary ra tionale for this trial is to 
replicate previous findings of improvement in clinical outcomes in subjects treated with the 
benefit of GeneSight testing utilizing a double -blind, randomized control trial (RCT)  design.   
 
It is expected that results from this  trial will be used to inform guidelines for the use of 
pharmacogenomic testing for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  Results may also be 
shared with regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad.  
 
 
 
5.4 Known and Potential Benefits and Risk  
 
There is a potential risk that a patient’s protected health information be identified despite all the 
measures taken to protect such information  
 
A potential benefit of the study consists of patients understanding their gene -drug interactions by 
receiving  the GeneSight Psychotropic  test.

7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This protocol describes a 2 -part study. The first part will be a randomized, multicenter, double -
blind (raters and participants), 12 -week, controlled study in parallel balanced groups of 
depressed patients .  The  study will evaluate  the impact of GeneSight Psychotropic  on response to 
psychotropic treatments listed in Appendix 1  of this protocol. Patients enrolled in this st udy will 
be required to have Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text 
Revision ( DSM -IV-TR) diagnosis of MDD, a total QIDS -C16 score ≥11, a total QIDS -SR16 score 
≥11, and an inadequate response within the current episode t o one or more psychotropic 
treatment s. For the purpose of this protocol, inadequate response is defined as lack of efficacy  
after at least 6 weeks of treatment or discontinuation of a psychotropic treatment due to AEs or 
intolerability. Only patients treated for their MDD with at least one of the psychotropic 
medications listed in Appendix 1  will be enrolled in the study.   
 
Upon completion of the double -blind part of the study, participants will contin ue in a 12 -week 
open -label extension of the study to evaluate the long -term impact of the use of GeneSight 
Psychotropic .

04/21/15  17 more than 2 weeks, and preferably 3 days prior to enrollm ent (results of the buccal swab will be 
available within 3 days).  
 
Screening evaluations will include:  
 
 Demographics  
 Medical history  
 Medication history and response including previous and current psychotropic treatment  
 Physical examination ; 
 Vital signs , height, weight  
 Psychiatric assessments including :  
o Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (by treating clinician or qualified 
delegated personal)  
o DSM -IV-TR criteria  for Major Depressive Disorder   (by treating clinician or qualified 
delegated personal)  
o QIDS -C16 (to be performed by the blinded Site - Rater only)  
o QIDS -SR16 
 Urine drug screen   
 Urinalysis  
 Laboratory blood test (to exclude hepatic insufficiency)  
 Buccal sample  
 Pharmacogenomic blood sample  
 Collection of AEs  
 
Patients’ psychotropic medication should not be modified (in terms of type and dosage) during 
the screening period , except for treatment with benzodiazepines .  
 
7.1.3 Randomization  and Inclusion in the Study   
Upon completion of the screening procedures, patients will be evaluated for eligibility against 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
enrolled in the study and randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two groups: treatment as usual or to 
treatment decision utilizing GeneSight P sychotropic . Randomization occurs before the Baseline 
visit to ensure that the GeneSight report is available at the Baseline visit, if applicable.  
 
 
Upon inclusion in the study, investigators will be given the results of the GeneSight Psychotropic 
test for  the participants randomized to the treatment decision utilizing GeneSight Psychotropic 
group. Investigators will use the report to support their treatment decision based on this 
information. However, raters and participants will be blinded.  Sites should use the same Rater 
for the QIDS -C16 throughout the trial.  Each site should have a qualified back -up Rater in the 
event they must conduct ratings in the absence of the primary rater.

04/21/15  18  
Upon inclusion into the study, participants will be evaluated in the following manner (in 
chronological order):  
 
 HAM -D17 (administered  using a centralized phone -based rater system ).   
 QIDS -C16 (onsite blinded rater administrated) , 
 PHQ -9, SF-36 and GAD -7 (patient -rated using a paper -based or electronic system) ,  
 CGI-S (administered  by the treating clinician  only),  
 Medication reconciliation (including medication switching and augmentation) .   
 
7.1.4 Double -Blind Treatment Period  
Throughout the 12 -week double -blind treatment period, participants will b e followed up (in -
clinic visit) for efficacy, tolerability, and safety at the end (± 3 days) of Weeks 4, 8, and 12.   
 
During the in -clinic visits, participants will be evaluated with HAM -D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9, and 
GAD -7 in the same manner utilized at the b aseline visit .  At the end -of Week 12 visit, 
participants will also be evaluated with CGI-S, CGI-I, SF-36, and CGI-EI.  All assessments will 
be administered by the site with the exception of the HAM -D17, which will be administered by a 
central rater.  
 
7.1.5 12-Week Open -Label Extension  
Following completion of the double -blind period, participants will continue participation in the 
study for an additional 12 weeks to evaluate the longer term impact of GeneSight Psychotropic . 
All participants will be given the resu lts of their GeneSight Psychotropic  test and will therefore 
be unblinded and treating physicians can utilize GeneSight Psychotropic  for treatment decision 
support of all participants  starting at the 12 week visit after all 12 week assessments have been 
completed .  
 
Those who enroll in this additional follow -up phase of the study will be followed up (in -clinic 
visit) at the end (± 2  weeks) of Week 24, and evaluated with HAM -D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9, 
GAD -7, CGI-S, CGI -I, CGI -EI, and SF -36. 
 
7.1.6 Early Termination Visit  
If early termination occurs  after Visit 2, the subject should attend an in -clinic visit as soon as 
possible to complete early termination procedures that will consist of all p rocedures scheduled 
for Week 24, namely:   HAM -D17, QIDS -C16, PHQ -9, GAD -7, CGI-S, CGI -I, SF-36, and CGI-EI.

8.1 Study Population  
At least  1,400 males and females, outpatients, ≥18 years of age, diagnosed with MDD having 
had an inadequate response to at least one psychotropic medication within the current depressive 
episode will be enrolled in the study. Ina dequate response is defined as lack of efficacy after 6 
weeks of psychotropic treatment or discontinuation of psychotropic treatment due to AEs or 
intolerability.  
 
Participants will be randomized to either “treatment as usual” or “treatment guided by GeneS ight 
Psychotropic ” using a 1:1 allocation. Under the assumption of a 16.7% rate of premature 
discontinuation by Week 8 (primary endpoint), it is anticipated that approximately 1,200  fully 
evaluable patients will be available for primary endpoint analyses, roughly 600 in the  “treatment 
as usual” and 600 in the  “treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic ” (see Section 12 for 
justification of patient numbers and power calculation).  
 
8.2 Patient Inclusion Criteria  
To be eligible, all patients must:

04/21/15  28  
Reasons for which the Investigator  or Sponsor may withdraw a patient from the study include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
 
1. Patient wishes to withdraw;  
2. Investigator jud ges that for any reason continuation of the study is inappropriate for the 
patient.  
 
The reason for any early discontinuation will be stated on the case report form (CRF) as one of 
the following:  
 AE 
 Termination of study by the Sponsor  
 Protocol violation: (specify)  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Lack of efficacy  
 Other: (specify)  
 
The Investigator should immediately notify the designated medical monitor when a patient is 
discontinued.  
 
If early termination (ET) occurs, the patient should attend a vi sit as soon as possible to complete 
all procedures scheduled for Visit 6 (End of Week 24/ End of Open -Label Follow -Up visit).  
If a patient fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine 
the reason. If the patient cannot  be reached by telephone after two attempts, a certified letter 
should be sent to the patient requesting contact with the  Investigator . This information should be 
recorded in the study records.  
 
The Investigator  or designee must explain to each patient, be fore enrollment into the study, that 
for evaluation of study results, the patient’s protected health information obtained during the 
study may be shared with the study Sponsor, regulatory agencies, and the IRB/  IEC. It is the 
Investigator ’s (or designee’s)  responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health 
information per applicable regulations (i.e., HIPAA in the US) from each patient. If permission 
to use protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility t o obtain a 
written request, to ensure that no further data will be collected from the patient and the patient 
will be removed from the study.

be assigned a screening number upon signing the ICF. All screening numbers will be assigned by 
the site in strict numerical sequence and no numbers will be  skipped or omitted (e.g., each 
patient will be assigned to the lowest screening number available). Upon enrollment (baseline 
Visit) , all qualified patients will be assigned a patient number. Patient numbers will be assigned 
in a strict numerical sequence and no numbers will be skipped or omitted. This unique identifier 
will be on all case report form (CRF) pages.

04/21/15  30 9.0 TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
9.1 Treatments Administered  
During the study, patients will continue treatment with psychotropic medication as judged best in 
terms of type of medication(s), dose, and dose regimen by the treating physician.  
 
Patients will be required to not have any change in psychotropic medication during the screening 
period prior to randomi zation.  
 
After completing screening procedures, patie nts will be randomized to “treatment as usual” or 
“treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic ” for 12 weeks, followed by a 12 -week open -label 
extension in which all patients may receive treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic .  
 
Upon randomization, the treating physician will receive the results of the GeneSight 
Psychotropic  test for patients randomized to “treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic .” 
Guided by these results, the treating physician may decide to modify a participant’s psychotropic 
medica tion, in terms of type of medication, dose, dose regimen  or number of medications . 
 
9.2 Blinding  
This study will be conducted under double -blind conditions so that neither the patient nor study 
staff members involved in patient assessments will know whether the patient is receiving 
“treatment as usual” or “treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic .”  
 
At randomization, the treating physician will receive the results of the GeneSight Psychotropic  
test for patients allocated to “treatment guided by GeneSight Psychotropic ” and may decide to 
change the participant’s treatment based on the results of the t est. The treating physician will 
therefore not be blind.  
 
9.3 Treatment Compliance  with Prescribed Psychotropic Medication  
Site personnel will assess treatment compliance at each visit. Noncompliance will be defined as 
taking less than 80% or more than 120% of  psychotropic medication prescribed by the treating 
physician during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit). Assessment of compliance will 
be done as per medical judgment ; no pill counting or other formal compliance measure will be 
used to asses s for compliance  other than the general guidelines outlined above .   
 
9.4 Description of the GeneSight Psychotropic  Test 
A buccal swab of the patient’s cheek is taken by the clinician and mailed to the lab in a secure 
envelope  labeled with a unique identifier to ensure accuracy and validity . Once received, the 
GeneSight Psychotropic  lab analyzes the sample and determines the patient’s genotypes and 
phenotypes for each of the tested genes.  These phenotypes will provide a clear picture of how 
Proto col No. ARX 1006  CONFIDENTIAL  Assurex  
04/21/15  31 functional each gen e is with respect to drug metabolism (for CYP450 genes) or drug response 
(for neurotransmitter transporter and receptor genes).   
After laboratory testing is completed and phenotypes are assigned, GeneSight Psychotropic  
technology integrates the genetic data with the pharmacology for each medication on the 
GeneSight Psychotropic  panels, incorporating data gleaned from FDA -approved labels and 
published literature.  
 
Within three days of sample receipt at the laboratory, results are returned to clini cians in the 
form of an interpretive report that categorizes medications into three independent bins titled “Use 
as Directed” or the Green Bin, “Use With Caution” or the Yellow Bin, and “Use with Increased 
Caution And With More Frequent Monitoring” or the Red Bin.  Medications in the Green Bin 
are likely to be unaffected by any genetic polymorphisms the tested individual may possess.  
Medications in the Yellow Bin are at risk for a gene -drug interaction that may necessitate 
alternative dosing or medication selection.  Medications in the Red Bin are at high risk for a 
gene -drug interaction that may necessitate alternative dosing or medication selection.   
 
9.5 Concomitant Medications  
During the study, patients will be allowed to use concomitant medications  at the  Investigators’ 
discretion . The dose and dose regimen of concomitant medications should be recorded on the 
CRF.

AssureRx’s la boratory isolates DNA by utilizing MagMAX
  magnetic bead -based 
technology on MagMAX
  Magnetic Particle Processor (Life Technologies). The GeneSight test 
is analyzed by QuantStudio 12K Flex Real -Time PCR System and comprises of two distinct 
assays –  
a) OpenAr ray Assay  – The TaqMan OpenArray Genotyping chip is a 63 -mm x 19 -mm 
mid-density reaction plate containing 3072 reaction through -holes with each hole 
preloaded with a dried down TaqMan assay.  
b) 2D6 Copy Number Assay  – TaqMan copy number assay is a real -time PCR reaction 
designed to detect and measure variation in the copy number of CYP2D6 gene and a 
reference gene (human RNase P H1 RNA gene).  
The QuantStudio™ 12K Flex Real -Time PCR System uses TaqMan R 5’ -nuclease assay 
chemistry to perform the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP2D6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 , CYP3A4, CYP2B6 (516G>T)  and HTR2A. Each predesigned 
TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay includes two allele -specific TaqMan® MGB probes 
containing distinct fluorescent dyes and a PCR prime r pair to detect specific SNP targets. These 
TaqMan® probe and primer sets (assays) are spotted on to a high density chip to provide 
unmatched specificity for the allele of interest and ability to process samples in a high 
throughput manner. CYP2D6 copy nu mber is determined by running TaqMan® Copy Number 
Assays simultaneously with a TaqMan® Copy Number Reference Assay (for example, the 
human RNase P H1 RNA gene) in a duplex real -time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
number of copies of the target sequen ce in each test sample is determined by relative quantitation 
(RQ) using the comparative CT method (also known as deltadeltaCT, where CT is cycle 
threshold and is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to exceed 
background leve l). This method measures the CT difference (ΔCT) between target and reference 
Proto col No. ARX 1006  CONFIDENTIAL  Assurex  
04/21/15  35 sequences, and then compares the ΔCT values of test samples to a calibrator sample(s) known to 
have two copies of the target sequence.  
CYP2B6 (785A>G) genotype is determined using PCR -RFLP assay by amplifying the 
relevant genomic regions with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent restriction 
digest of PCR products and detection of DNA fragments using capillary electrophoresis on 
QIAxcel (QIAGEN).  
 Alternatively, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and HTR2A 
genotypes are determined using multiplex xTAG® assay s (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics) .  Luminex  
xTAG® assays incorporate  multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)  and multiplex Allele Specific 
Primer Extension (ASPE) with Luminex's Universal Tag sorting system on the Luminex® 100/200™ 
xMAP®platform.  Target gene regions are amplified in a multiplexed PCR reaction(s) that are then 
treated with Exonuclease 1 and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to remove excess nucleotides and 
primers.  Treated PCR products are extended using allele -specific primers that cont ain xTAG® 
universal tag sequence at the 5’ end.  The 5’ universal tag sequences are then hybridized to the 
complementary anti -tag sequences coupled to the color -coded microspheres that are read on a 
Luminex xMAP instrument and results are analyzed using da ta analysis software .  
 
Assurex detects specific mutations with in SLC6A4 by amplifying the relevant genomic 
regions with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting PCR fragments with gel 
electrophoresis.  
 
 
10.2.1.8  Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at screening only.  
 
Blood samples will be collected for the following clinical laboratory tests:  
 
 Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with 
differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) and platelet count.

ketones, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrites, leukocytes , and, if necessary, 
micro scopic examination.  
 
Any abnormal laboratory value must be assessed, with written notation, by the Investigator. If an 
abnormal laboratory value is clinically significant, the Investigator must immediately contact the 
medical monitor to discuss the patient ’s continued eligibility in the trial.  
 
Any information obtained at screening that appears to conflict with a patient’s eligibility for 
participation must be addressed by the Investigator in source documentation prior to 
randomization.

10.2.1.9  MINI for Axis I  
The MINI was developed as a short and efficient diagnostic interview to be used in clinical as 
well as research settings (Sheehan et al ., 1998). It follows DSM -IV and the ICD -10 criteria for 
psychiatric disorders, screening for 17 Axis I disorders, with brief suicidality and antisocial 
personality modules. The Axis I disorders included in the MINI were selected based upon the 12 -
month prevalence reported in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study (Regier et al ., 1984) and 
the National Comorbidity Survey (Kessler  et al., 1994). The MINI has been va lidated in the U.S. 
and Europe (reviewed in Jana et al ., 2005) . Administration time ranges from approximately 15 -
20 minutes for individuals with few positively endorsed symptoms to 20 -30 minutes for 
individuals who meet criteria for current diagnoses.

Appendix 3 ) 
The 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D17) is the primary efficacy endpoint for 
this study and assesses mood, feelings of guilt, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight 
loss and somatic symptoms. The 17-item questionnaire is administered by a qualified rater at 
Baseline and at End of Weeks, 4, 8, 12 and 24.  
 
10.2.2.2  16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive  Symptomology (QIDS -C16; Appendix 4 )  
The clinician -rated, 16 -item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS -C16) has 
been extensively evaluated in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD ; Rush et al, 2003; 
Trivedi et al, 2004). The scale assesses the nine DSM -IV criteria symptom domains for major 
depression: sad mood, concentration, self -outlook, suicidal ideation, involvement, 
energy/fatigability, sleep disturbance (4 items: initial, middle, late inso mnia, and hypersomnia), 
appetite/weight increase/decrease (4 items), and psychomotor agitation/retardation (2 items).   
 
10.2.2.3  9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9; Appendix 5 )  
The PHQ -9 consists of nine questions, ra ted 0 –3 according to the increased frequency of 
difficulty experienced in each area covered. Scores, with a possible range of 0 –27, are summed 
and can then be interpreted as follows: no depression (0), minimal (1 –5), mild (6 –9), moderate 
(10–14), moderatel y severe (15 –19), or severe (>20) depression.  
 
10.2.2.4  Clinical Global Impression (CGI;  Appendix 6 )  
The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) is a brief clinician -rated instrument that consists of 
three different global m easures. 1. Severity of illness: overall assessment of the current severity 
of the patient's symptoms (CGI -S); 2. Global improvement: overall comparison of the patient's

Definitions  
Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore b e any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a n investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  Any worsening of a preexisting condition  (i.e., 
any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) which is temporally 
associated with the use of the investigational  product, is also an adverse event.  
Evaluating and Recording of Adver se Events  
At each visit all adverse events that are observed, elicited by the Investigator, or reported by the 
subject, will be recorded in the appropriate section of the AE  eCRF and evaluated by the 
Investigator.  
Proto col No. ARX 1006  CONFIDENTIAL  Assurex  
04/21/15  40 Minimum information required for each AE i ncludes type of event, duration (start and end 
dates), severity, seriousness, causality to study drug, action taken, and outcome.  
Severity of AEs will be graded by the Investigator using the following criteria as guidelines:  
1.  Mild:  Nuisance, barely noti ceable.  
2.  Moderate:  Uncomfortable, troublesome symptoms not significantly interfering with 
daily activities or sleep.  
3.  Severe:  Symptoms significantly interfere with daily activities or sleep.  
 
The relationship of the AE to the study drug should be spe cified by the Investigator, using the 
following definitions:  
1.  Not Related:  Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association 
with study drug.  
2.  Unlikely  Related : The event  has little or no temporal sequence from administration of t he 
study drug, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
3.  Possibly Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study drug but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or 
other factors or medication s 
4.  Probably Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study drug, unlikely to be attributed to  concurrent disease or other 
factors or medications. A clinically reasonable response may be 
observed if the study drug is withdrawn or dose reduced.  
5.  Definitely Related:  the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study drug and is definitive pharmacologically;  cannot to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other factors or medications. A c linically 
reasonable response should be observed if the study drug is withdrawn 
or dose reduced.  
 
If discernible at the time of completing an AE  eCRF, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on  the AE  eCRF.  However, if an 
observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not 
considered by the Investigator to be a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it 
should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE  eCRF (clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities are those that are identified as such by the Investigator and/or those that require 
intervention).

04/21/15  41 Investigators should follow the FDA process for reporting untoward events to of marketed 
medications by  submitting a MedWatch for a Serious Adverse Event:  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (including 
overdose) that  meets one or more of the following criteria : 
 Is fatal , as a direct outcome of the AE  
 Is life threatening  
This serious criterion applies if the subject, in the view of the Investigator, is at substantial 
risk of dying from the AE as it occurs.  It does not apply if an AE hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires or pro longs inpatient hospitalization  
This serious criterion applies if the reported AE necessitates an inpatient admission (in the 
US) or a minimum 24 -hour inpatient hospitalization (outside US) or, if in the opinion of the 
Investigator, prolongs an existing ho spitalization.  A hospitalization for an elective procedure, 
a routinely scheduled treatment or a social admission is not an SAE.  
 Results in permanent or significant disability/incapacity  
This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by the rep orted AE results in a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
This serious criterion applies if a subject exposed to the investigational product gives birth to 
a child  with congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Important medical events that do not meet any of the criteria above may be considered serious 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

04/21/15  42 12.0 STATISTICS  
 
Sample Size  
The sample size required for this study was calculated using effect size estimates drawn from a 
previous study conducted by Hall -Flavin et al (2013, Pharmacogene tics and Genomics ). 
Assuming an effect size of .30 favoring the treatment group, statistical power of 90%, and an 
alpha level of 0.05, a total of 1400  subjects are required to detect the same effect in this study. 
However, due to expected subject attrition  (see below) and to support an interim analysis with 
adequate power, a total of 1200  subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
 
Hall-Flavin et al experienced significant subject attrition during the course of their investigation. 
Post hoc analyses using ITT analyses, however, revealed little differences between the observed 
data and inputed data (e.g., LOCF and EM algorithm imputat ion). Therefore, to account for 
subject attrition in the current study, ITT with LOCF and EM algorithm imputation will be 
employed to account for missing data, assuming the data is missing completely at random.  
 
Data Analysis  
Descriptive Statistics    Cont inuous variables will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics including means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. Categorical variables will 
be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will 
be provided for descriptive statistics, as warranted.  
 
Diagnostics    Prior to formal statistical analyses, diagnostics will be conducted to determine 
appropriate statistical models. The independence assumption of ANOVA will be tested by 
examining the correlation between error terms for each dependent variable across leve ls of the 
indicator variable. To this end, the Durbin -Watson test statistic will be used to determine if the 
independence assumption was upheld. Values approaching 2.0 from the left or right were 
considered to be an indication of independence. The normalit y assumption will be tested by 
plotting residuals against the normal probability plot and by deriving the Shapiro -Wilk (S -W) 
test statistic. The dependent variable will formally be considered to be non -normally distributed 
if the p -value for the S -W test w as < 0.05. Homogeneity of variance will be tested by employing 
the statistic derived by Brown and Forsythe. If the associated p -value for the test statistic is < 
0.05, then the dependent variable will be assumed to exhibit non -constant variance. If a given  
dependent variable did not meet the above mentioned assumptions (e.g., clustering due to study 
site), generalized estimating equations (GEEs) will be employed to account for the lack of 
independence between outcomes using an autoregressive correlation str ucture and identity link 
function.  
 
Continuous outcomes   If the Hamilton Depression (HAM -D17) scores from baseline to end of 
Week 8 of the study meet the assumptions of ANOVA modeling, repeated -measure (i.e., mixed) 
ANOVA models will be used to model the outcome scores over time. This model accounts for a 
between -group and within -individual effect, which allows for the examination of average 
differences between groups while also accounting for the correlation between subject scores 
between each measurement . If the HAM -D17 scores do not meet standard ANOVA assumptions, 
GEEs will be used to model repeated measurements of outcome scores over time, as these 
Proto col No. ARX 1006  CONFIDENTIAL  Assurex  
04/21/15  43 models are more robust to departures from the standard assumptions and also allow the 
investigator to spe cify the correlation structure of the repeated measurements. Mean change for 
all continuous measures will be calculated using the standard formula ( 𝑦2−𝑦1
𝑦1)*100. For all 
continuous measures, a responder will be defined as a participant with 50% change from baseline 
in total scale score. Remitters at week 8 and at week 12 will be defined as HAM -D17 ≤7, QIDS -
C16 ≤5, PHQ -9 <5, or CGI -S ≤1 in each treatment group. Differential time to response/remission 
of depressive symptoms over 8 and 12 weeks will be plo tted using Kaplan -Meier curves and Cox 
proportional hazard models will test the null hypothesis of no difference in time to 
response/remission between groups.  
 
Categorical Outcomes   Categorical outcomes (i.e., remission, response) will be analyzed with 
2x2 contingency tables, logistic regression, or loglinear models, where appropriate. Relative risk 
of response and remission will be determined between groups using the standard formula𝑎/(𝑎+𝑏)
𝑐/(𝑐+𝑑), 
where a is the number of responders/remitters in th e GeneSight group, b is the number of non -
responders/non -remitters in the GeneSight group, c is the number of responders/remitters in the 
TAU group, and d is the number of non -responders/non -remitters in the TAU group. Standard 
chi-square tests will be used to determine if the relative risk of response/remission is statistically 
significant between groups. If expected frequencies are too small for asymptoti c assumptions, 
Fisher’s exact tests will be employed to test for differences in categorical outcomes between 
groups. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be calculated and provided for the relative 
risk of response/remission between groups.  
 
With in-Group and Between -Group Composite Phenotype Analyses    A three -level indicator 
variable will be created using a proprietary algorithm which combines genotype, phenotype, and 
drug metabolism information for each subject with respect to CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CY P2C19, 
CYP2C9, SLC6A4, and HTR2A in an effort to reduce the dimensionality inherent to such data to 
arrive at a single composite phenotype for each subject. The final indicator variable will be 
labeled ‘composite_phenotype,’ with the first level scored as ‘green,’ (e.g., use medication(s) as 
directed) the second level scored as ‘yellow,’ (e.g., use medication(s) with caution) and the third 
level scored as ‘red’ (e.g., use medication(s) with caution and frequent monitoring).  If 
parametric assumptions are up held, 1 -way independent ANOVA models will employed to test 
the independent ability of the composite phenotype variable to predict each respective 
continuous outcome (i.e., percent improvement from baseline for QIDS -C17, HAMD -17, PHQ -
9, respectively) betwee n study groups. If parametric (i.e., standard) assumptions are not met, 
GEEs will be employed test the independent ability of the composite phenotype variable to 
predict each respective continuous outcome. Three tests will be conducted for each continuous 
outcome: an overall ANOVA test and two planned contrasts involving the comparison of the first 
level to that of the third, and the first two levels of the composite phenotype variable to that of 
the third level. To account for multiple testing, the Sidak c orrection will be employed using the 
formula 1 – (1-α)1/n where n is the number of independent tests and α is the nominal level (i.e., 
05) of statistical significance  
 
Decision Rule   An overall alpha -level of 0.05 will be used to determine statistical sig nificance 
and all statistical tests will be two -sided. All data will be analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute, 
Inc., Version 9.3).

13.1 Study Monitoring  
INC is responsible for monitoring the sites and study activities. They wil l contact and visit the 
Investigator  regularly. The actual frequency of monitoring visits depends on  patient enrollment 
and on study site performance. Among others, the following items will be reviewed:  
 
 study progress  
 compliance with the protocol  
 completion of CRFs  
 source data verification  
 AEs and SAEs  
 Essential documents  contained within the regulatory binder.  
 
Source data verification (verification of data by comparing CRF entries with  patient records)  
include:  patient identification, informed co nsent (procedure, signature, and date), selection 
criteria, and primary efficacy and safety parameters (i.e., AEs).  
 
13.2 Data Generation and Analysis  
Once the completed CRFs are monitored, INC and the Sponsor  (or designee) will further check 
the CRFs for completeness and plausibility of the data. INC will utilize quality systems in order 
to verify accurate entry and completeness of the data, including additional checks of the data 
upon computerization (e.g., range checks, cross checks, and other edit checks). Where required, 
the Investigator  will be as ked for supplementary information or CRF corrections upon a data 
clarification form or query. After all data is entered and checked, a Quality Control audit will be 
conducted to verify accuracy of the data entry. The database will then be locked and a 
biostatistician will complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the SAP.  
 
13.3 Audits and Inspections  
Audits and inspections may be carried out by the Sponsor ’s quality assurance department or 
designee, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or other regulat ory authorities to whom

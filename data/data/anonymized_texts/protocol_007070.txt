Name of Active Ingredient: Carotuximab  
Title of Study:  
A PHASE 1B DOSE -ESCALATION STUDY OF CAROTUXIMAB  IN COMBINATION WITH 
NIVOLUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC NON -SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER  
Study center(s): This study will be performed at up to 3 United States center s  
Principal Investigator : Dr. Francisco Robert  
Studied period:  
Date firs t patient enrolled: November  2017  
Estimated date endpoint obtained: January  2019 
Estimated date last patient completed: June 2019 
Total number of estimated patients: 30-42 
Estimated duration of treatment per patient: 4 months  Phase of Development: 1b 
Rationale:  
Nivolumab is an antibody that binds the programmed death receptor 1 (PD -1) and promotes anti -
cancer immunity by inhibiting regulatory T-cell function to sensitize tumors to immune surveillance.  
Nivolumab is approved for the treatment of metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has 
progressed following platinum -based chemotherapy, based on improved overall survival versus 
docetaxel in squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) (median overall survival [OS] of 9.2 
months versus 6.0 months , respectively ) and in non -squamous NSCLC (median OS of 12.2 versus 9.4 
months).  The overall response rate (ORR) in this setting is 15% to 20%.   
Carotuximab is an investigational antibody to endoglin, a receptor expressed on proliferating 
endothelial cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).  MDSCs also inhibit anti -cancer 
immunity, but by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that inhibited by nivolumab.  
Carotuxim ab inhibits tumor growth in preclinical models and complements the activity of antibodies 
that target the PD -1 pathway.  Carotuximab  has been studied in more than 500 cancer patients and is 
tolerable as a single agent and when combined with chemotherapy or  inhibitors of the vascular 
endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway.  Its toxicity profile is distinct from that of nivolumab.  By 
targeting MDSCs, carotuximab  has the potential to complement nivolumab and improve clinical 
efficacy over that seen with sin gle agent nivolumab.  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose  (RP2D)  for 
carotuximab when added to standard dose nivolumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC

Page 4 of 78 Secondary:  
• To assess preliminary evidence of antitumor activity when carotuximab  is added to 
nivolumab, by assessing response rate and progression -free survival  including  in patients  who 
have not been treated previously with a PD -1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor and have  
histological disease recurrence or progression during or after prior platinum -containing 
doublet chemotherapy regimen  (Expan sion Cohort  1) or have relapsed follo wing prior 
treatment with a PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitor ( Expan sion Cohort 2) .  
• To characte rize the pharmacokinetic profile of carotuximab  when given with nivolumab  
• To evaluate the formation of carotuximab anti-product antibodies  (APA)  
Exploratory:  
• To explore effects of carotuximab and nivolumab on tumor immune effector cells  
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, open -label, nonrandomized, Phase 1b, dose -escalation study of carotuximab  in 
combination with standard dose nivolumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC .  Beginning with Dose 
Level 1, standard dose nivolumab will be given every two we eks of recurring 28 day cycles  starting 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) . Carotuximab  will be administered weekly for 4 weeks and then given 
every 2 weeks , in combination with  nivolumab , starting on C1D1 .

aThe first weekly carotuximab dose will be split into 2 doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on Cycle 1 Day 
1 (C1D1) and the balance is administered on Cycle 1 Day 4.  
bExpan sion Cohort 1:  Patients who have not been treated previously with a PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitor  
and have  histological disease recurrence or progression during or after prior platinum -containing doublet 
chemotherapy regimen.  
cExpan sion Cohort 2:  Patients who have relapsed following prior treatment with a PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint 
inhibitor without Grade 3 immune -related toxicity.  
The dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period will be the first 4 weeks (28  days) of combination 
therapy dosing .  Each cycle will be 4 weeks (28 days) in duration.  
Three patients will be initially enrolled and treated at each dose level.  If none of these 3 patients 
experiences a DLT during the initial 28-day evaluation period  of combination dosing , dose escal ation 
will proceed  following review of safety data with the study principal Investigator s. 
If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to 6 patients.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients e xperience DLT at a given dose 
level where at least 6 patients have been evaluated  (including the expan sion cohort s).  DLT will have

related to nivol umab or carotuximab during the first 28 days of combination therapy .  Patients who 
exit the study for reasons other than DLT prior to compl etion of the 28 -day DLT evaluation period 
will be replaced  to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort .  Patients who experience 
DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose of carotuximab or nivolumab due to documented 
toxicity during the DLT evaluation period will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes.  
A given carotuximab  dose level may be reenrolled at an intermediate dose level upon agreement of 
study Investigators.

Parameters to be Assessed:  
Safety : 
Safety assessments will include physical exam inations , vital signs, ECOG  performance status, 
laboratory tests (complete blood counts [CBC] and serum chemistry) , 12-lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ), and additional studies as may be clinically indicated.   
Pharmacokinetics : 
Serum carotuximab  and nivolumab concentrations will be measured using validated methods at the 
time points specified in the Schedule of Events.  
Immunogenicity:  
Carotuximab anti-product antibodies (A PA) will be measured using validated methods at time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events.  
Exploratory Biomarkers:  
Optional t umor biopsies from prior to study start and on study for PD -L1 tumor expression and T -cell 
and MDSC content  will be assessed . 
Efficacy : 
iRECIST  will be applied to as sess response and progression .   
Statistical Methods:  
The study analysis population for safety and efficacy of carotuximab includes all patients receiving at 
least a portion of 1 dose of carotuximab .  
The number of patients to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the observed safety profile, 
which will determine the number of patients per dose level and the number of dose escalations.  It is 
anticipated that a total of 18 to 30 patients will be en rolled in this study.  
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each underlying true DLT rate is shown in 
the table below.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there is a > 95% probability 
of escalating.  Conversely, for a more common toxi city that occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability 
of escalating is < 5%.  
Probability of Escalation to the Next Dose by True Underlying DLT Rate at a Dose Level

Descriptive statistics (such as means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous data 
and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient characteristics, treatment 
administration/compliance, immunogenicity, efficacy, phar macokinetic parameters, protein 
biomarkers, and archival tumor tissue.  Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate.  
Adverse events (AEs) and DLTs will be summarized by category (hematologic and non -hematologic) 
and by Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) Preferred Term (PT) and System 
Organ Class (SOC).  The number and percentage of patients with the following types of treatment -
emergent AEs will be summarized: all AEs, all serious AEs, AEs related to study drug ( carotuxima b 
and nivolumab), AEs resulting in study drug discontinuation, and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities.  Trough (pre -dose) serum carotuximab  and nivolumab concentrations will be measured 
using validated methods .  The carotuximab pharmacokinetic  data may be assessed for potential 
correlations with response, progression -free survival ( PFS), survival, AEs, and baseline 
characteristics using descriptive statistics and models as appropriate.  The best response to iRECIST  
for each patient with measura ble disease who received at least 1 dose of study drug will be listed  by 
cohort .  At least 3 responses out of 12 evaluable patients in Expan sion Cohort 1 and a t least 1 
response out of 12 evaluable patients in Expan sion Cohort 2 will be required  to further evaluate the 
combination of TRC105 and nivolumab in these respective patient populations(s). Anti-product 
antibody (APA) to carotuximab  concentrations will be measured at the time points specified.

Page 20 of 78 2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)  
Advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been historically difficult to treat, and novel 
agents that are safe and effective are in dire need.  Prognosis is poor, with 1 -year survival rates 
ranging from 30% to 40%.  Two -drug platinum -based chemothera py regimens have long been 
the traditional treatment of choice, but a plateau effect is inevitably reached and survival is 
approximately 8 months regardless of regimen administered [1, 2].   
The addition of bevacizumab (Avastin®), a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, 
improves the overall survival (OS) of patients with non -squamous NSCLC when dosed with a 
platinum doublet as evidenced in a study that demonstrated an overall survival advantage of 2 
months in the bevacizumab arm (12.3 months vs 10.3 months , respectively ) [3].  The rates of 
clinically significant bleeding were slightly i ncreased in the bevacizumab group (4.4% vs 0.7%).  
This trial study led to the standardization of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab as the 
preferred first -line therapy for patients with advanced non -squamous NSCLC.  Subsequently, the 
AVAiL (Avastin in Lung) study confirmed the progression -free survival (PFS) benefit of adding 
bevacizumab to first -line cisplatin/gemcitabine, although an OS advantage was not demonstrated  
[4].  Bevacizumab is approved by the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
for a number of indications, including NSCLC with carboplatin and paclit axel for first -line 
treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease.  Currently, the 
regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab followed by maintenance bevacizumab 
remains the standard first -line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.   
Nivolumab (Opdivo®) is an a human monoclonal antibody that binds the programmed death 
receptor 1 (PD -1) and blocks its interaction with its ligands, programmed death receptor ligands 
PD-L1 and PD -L2, promot ing anti-cancer immunity by inhibiting regulatory T-cell function to 
sensitize tumors to immune surveillance.  Nivolumab is approved by the FDA for a number of 
indications, including the treatment of metastatic NSCLC that has progressed following on or 
after platinum -based chemotherapy (patients with epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or 
activin receptor -like kinase [ALK] genomic tumor aberrations should have had disease 
progression on FDA -approved therapy for these aberrations), based on improved OS versus 
docetaxel in squamous NSCLC (median 9.2 months versus 6.0 months) and in non -squamous 
NSCLC (median OS 12.2 versus 9.4 months)  (nivolumab package insert) .  The overall response 
rate (ORR) in this setting is 15% to 20%.   
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) is ano ther human monoclonal antibody that binds PD -1 that is 
approved for the patients with NSCLC.  Pembrolizumab is approved in three setting s in NSCLC: 
for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD -L1 
expression  (Tum or Proportion Score (TPS) ≥  50%) , as a single agent for the treatment of patients 
with metastatic  NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 (TPS ≥  1%) with disease progression on 
or after  platinum -containing chemotherapy, and in combination with pemetrexed and 
carbo platin, as first -line treatment of patients wi th metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC .  Patients

approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving  pembrolizumab  (see package insert) . 
2.2. Endoglin and Tumor  Immunity  
Endoglin  (CD105 ) is a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein that was initially identified as a 
human leukemia -associated antigen [5] and later also found to be densely expressed on 
endothelial cells [6, 7].  Endoglin  is a transforming growth factor beta ( TGF -β) coreceptor th at is 
essential for angiogenesis [8, 9] and is strongly expressed on the proliferating vascular 
endothelium of solid tumors [7, 10].  The essential nature of endoglin is underscored by 
developmental abnormalities observed in endoglin -/- homozygous mice, including absent 
vasculature and mortality in utero .  Endoglin i s highly expressed on angiogenic vasculature.  
Preclinical models of cancer indicate substantial activity for endoglin antibodies as monotherapy, 
in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies, and in combination with VEGF inhibitors.  
Endoglin antibodies al so inhibit angiogenesis in a standard murine model of choroidal 
neovascularization.   Endoglin is also expressed on activated myeloid derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs)  [11], a cell type that inhibit s cancer immunity  by a mechanism of action that is distinct 
from that inhibited by immune checkpoint inhibitor  nivolumab.  In preclinical models, the 
endoglin ant ibody carotuximab  inhibits tumor growth and  complements the activity of antibody 
that targets the PD -1 pathway.   
Carotuximab was studied in a syngeneic tumor model, where in MC38 colorectal cancer cells 
were implanted orthotopically in the larg e intestine of mice, prior to treatment with isotype 
control antibody, PD -1 antibody, endoglin antibody M1043, endoglin antibody carotuximab  or 
the combination of endoglin and PD -1 antibodies.  MC38 tumors were grown in a subcutaneous 
donor C57/BL6 mice an d then harvested, and divided into pieces of ~  1 mm3 that were 
transplante d to the c ecum of recipient C57/BL6 mice.  Eight days following tumor 
transplantation, mice were randomized based on bioluminescent signal and treatment was started 
and continued for  4 weeks, at which time mice were sacrificed and tumor volume was 
determined.  
As shown in  Figure  1, the combination of carotuximab  and PD -1 antibody inhibited tumor 
growth that was statistically superior to isotype control antibody and to single -agent PD -1 
antibody treatment (p  = 0.0002 an d p = 0.025, respectively).  Notably, when combined with PD -
1 antibody, the endoglin antibody carotuximab  was more effective than M1043, which was 
consistent with the superior antibody -dependent T -cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC) activity of 
the carotuxim ab towards endoglin expressing cells  in this mouse model .   
In clinical trials of carotuximab  in bladder cancer patients as well as prostate cancer patients, 
carotuximab  decreased T regulatory cells among CD4 -positive T cells in the peripheral blood  
[12]. As well, carotuximab  therapy increased PD -1 expressio n on peripheral blood CD8 -postivie 
T cells  [13]  These  immunomodulatory effect s would be expected to complement  a therapy 
targeting the PD -1 axis.  In sum, b y targeting MDSCs, carotuximab  has the potential to 
complement nivolumab and improve clinical efficacy over that seen with single -agent 
nivolumab .

2.3. Carotuximab Background  
Carotuximab is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed 
against human CD105, a growth proliferation receptor found on the surface of normal and 
proliferating endothelial cells [7, 14, 15].   
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine variable region sequences 
and human constant region sequences [16].  Carotuximab  has an approximate molecular weight 
of 148 kDa.  Carotuximab  has a binding avidity for human CD105 of approximately 5 pM.  
Carotuximab  is formulated as 20 mM L -Histidine/L -Histidine Monohydrochloride, 240 mM 
Trehalose, and 0.01% Polysorbate 20 For mulation at a concentration of 25 mg/m L.  The primary 
mechanism of action of carotuximab is the competitive inhibition of BMP9 binding to the 
endoglin/BMPR2/ALK1 receptor complex, which inhibits BMP9 -mediated angiogenesis.   This 
primary pharmacologic activity of carotuximab has been corroborated through multiple lines of 
evidence.   Nonetheless, ADCC may not be completely ruled out as a contributi ng mechanism of 
action  as engagement of t he effector functions via the I gG1 constant regrion can mediate the low 
grade infusion reactions noted in the clini c [17].  Carotuximab has been studied in more than 5 00 
cancer patients and has been generally well tolerated  as a single agent and when combined with 
various chemotherapy agents and with inhibitors of the VEGF pathway.  
2.3.1.  Carotuximab  Clinical Summary  
Carotuximab  has been studied in a total of 20 completed or ongoing clinical trials.  These 20 
trials have administered carotuximab to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma 
(each 3 studies); advanced o r metastatic renal cell carcinoma, metastatic or refractory 
choriocarcinoma, and advanced or metastatic solid tumors (each 2 studies); and metastatic breast 
cancer, advanced soft tissue tumors including angiosarcoma, refractory gestational trophoblastic 
neoplasia, non -squamous cell lung cancer, advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer, and recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/or primary 
peritoneal carcinoma (each 1 study).  One study is a continuation clinical  trial for patients from 
previous carotuximab  studies.

Page 23 of 78 Carotuximab  was studied in doses ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg (every 2 weeks) and up 
to 15 mg/kg weekly in a first -in-human Phase 1 trial of advanced cancer patients.  The 
recommended Phase 2 dose of carotuximab  was 10 mg/kg weekly or 15 mg/kg every other week 
by intravenous ( IV).  Subsequent investigation indicated the tolerability of carotuximab  dosed at 
10 mg/kg weekly by IV infusion for the first month followed by 15 mg/kg by every 2 weeks 
thereafter, given in combination with axitinib or pazopanib.  The dose -limiting toxicity observed 
with carotuximab  dosed at 15 mg/kg weekly was anemia, characterized by a low reticulocyte 
production index, an on -target effect, reflecting endoglin expression on the proerythroblast, an 
erythrocyte precursor known to express CD105.  Anemia is manageable with standard supportive 
measures, including growth factors and packed red blood cell trans fusion, as well as carotuximab 
dose reduction and/or dose interruption, as appropriate.  
The risk profile has also been predictable based on known attributes of the target inhibition, 
endoglin, the known phenotypes of the Osler -Weber -Rendu syndrome (a syndr ome of endoglin 
heterozygosity), and in general the class effects common to immunoglobulin G Class 1 ( IgG1 ) 
antibodies.  The most frequently reported adverse events ( AEs) have been anticipated events 
with regard with the biological activity of carotuximab  and underlying oncologic diseases and 
their complications, are most commonly reported as low to moderate severity grade events, and 
are generally easily manageable in clinical practice.   
The most common adverse reactions to carotuximab  administration can be explained based on 
known attributes of the target inhibition of endoglin (CD105), the known phenotypes of the 
Osler -Weber -Rendu syndrome (a syndrome of endoglin heterozygosity), and in general the class 
effects common to IgG1 antibodies.  Specifically, the headache and telangiectasia are known 
presentations of Osler -Weber -Rendu syndrome, and hemorrhagic events such as epistaxis and 
gingival bleeding are known consequences of the telangiectasia.  The hypoproliferative, non -
hemolytic anemia is believed to result from carotuximab -mediated suppression of 
proerythroblasts, the only cells in the marrow known to express substantial levels of CD105.  As 
a monoclonal antibody, carotuximab , like other similar infusional agents may be associated with 
a risk for infu sion-related reactions and their associated signs and symptoms.   
Toxicities typically associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria, and 
thrombosis, do not appear to be prominent in patients receiving carotuximab  (alone or in 
combin ation with large and small molecule VEGF inhibitors).   
Although most carotuximab  trials to date have not been designed to primarily assess efficacy, 
some patients have been observed to benefit from treatment with carotuximab .  Signs of efficacy 
include re ductions in tumor volume (including partial and complete responses by RECIST  and 
by Choi criteria in patients with renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, choriocarcinoma, hepatocellular 
cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer), serum tumor mark er reductions, and 
reduction in pain.  Based on durable complete responses in angiosarcoma patients, carotuximab 
in combination with pazopanib is being assessed in an ongoing  Phase 3 randomized trial in 
angiosarcoma, a protocol that completed a Special Pro tocol Assessment by the US FDA.

2.4. Study Rationale  
Nivolumab is an antibody that binds PD -1 and promotes anti -cancer immunity by inhibiting 
regulatory T -cell function to sensitize tumors to immune surveillance.  Nivolumab is approved 
by the US FDA for the treatment of metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has 
progressed following platinum -based chemotherapy, based on improved over all survival versus 
docetaxel in squamous cell  non-small cell  lung cancer ( NSCLC) (median overall survival [OS] 
9.2 months versus 6.0 months, respectively) and in non -squamous NSCLC (median OS 12.2 
versus 9.4 months.  
Endoglin (CD105) is expressed on activa ted myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs ) [11], a 
cell type that inhibits cancer immunity by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that 
inhibited immune checkpoint by inhibitors such as nivolumab.  In preclinical models, the 
endoglin antibody carotuximab inhibits tumor growth and complement s the activity of antibody 
that targets the PD -1 pathway .  Nivolumab had limited activity in NSCLC following first -line 
treatment (15  to 20% response rate ), and assessment of concurrent endoglin and PD1 blockade  is 
of significant clinical interest.  
Carotuximab  is an investigational antibody to e ndoglin, a receptor expressed on proliferating 
endothelial cells and myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).  MDSCs also inhibit anti -
cancer immunity, but by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that inhibited by nivolumab.  
Carotuximab  has been s tudied in more than 500 cancer patients and is tolerable as a single agent 
and when combined with chemotherapy or inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) pathway.  Its toxicity profile is distinct from that of nivolumab.  By targeting M DSCs, 
carotuximab  has the potential to complement nivolumab and improve clinical efficacy over that 
seen with single -agent nivolumab.  
This trial is a Phase 1 b dose escalation safety study of  carotuximab  in combination with standard  
dose nivolumab with  patients with metastatic  NSCLC  that has progressed on or after platinum -
based chemotherapy  or PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibition , as a single agent or with 
chemotherapy .  A standard “3+3” dose -escalation design will be employed , followed by 
expa nsion  cohort s to further assess  the safety , tolerability , and preliminary efficacy  of the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP 2D) of carotuximab  with nivolumab .  The purpose of the dose 
escalation portion is to determine the maximum tolerated do se (MTD) of carotuximab  when 
given in combination with nivolumab  and to determine the dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs) .  
Patients are eligible for continued therapy with nivol umab and carotuximab  until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of consent, or other reasons .  Patients will be 
scanned every 8 weeks  to determine disease status.

2.6. Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients  
2.6.1.  Potential Risks  
Carotuximab  
Based on an assessment across all carotuximab  clinical trials, the most likely adverse reactions to 
carotuximab  administration consist of anemia, headache, epistaxis, g ingival bleeding, infusion -
related reaction, telangiectasia, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, flushing, pyrexia, and 
fatigue.  Other potential adverse reactions to carotuximab that are a current focus of monitoring 
in carotuximab studies to better und erstand whether there is increased risk due to carotuximab 
administration include infections, especially urinary tract infection, pneumothorax, 
hypersensitivity, and thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism.  Further details are 
available in the carotuximab  Investigator Brochure  (IB).  
Nivolumab  
The m ost commonly observed adverse reactions to single -agent nivolumab  are fatigue, rash, 
musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, 
decreased appetite, back pain, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia .  Side 
effects of nivolumab include immune -mediated disorders, such as hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, 
endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, skin reactions, and encephalitis, as  well as 
infusion reactions.  The most current nivolumab package insert  should be referenced for the most 
complete and updated information .  
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans  
Patients will be exposed to a relatively small amount of radiation as a result of th e CT scans 
required in this study.  This degree of exposure has not been associated with harmful health 
effects.   In addition, the frequency of CT scans performed in this study is similar  to the standard 
of care frequency.  Patients with a medical contrain dication to CT scans or known iodinated 
contrast allergies may instead undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ).  There is minimal 
risk of  MRI imaging in patients able to undergo this type of exam including very rare reports  of 
gadolinium -induce nephrogeni c systemic fibrosis in patients with poor renal function.  
Venipuncture  
Patients could also experience side effects from venipuncture for tests that will be done as part of 
this study , including pain, tenderness , and bruising at the site of collection, and rarely infection 
may occur at the spot where the needle is inserted.

Page 26 of 78 Other Risks  
This study treatment may involve risks to unborn children and therefore patients should not 
become pregnant or father a baby while participating in this study.  Patients shoul d not nurse 
(breastfeed) while on this study.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative 
pregnancy test before taking part in this study.   
Women must be of non -childbearing potential due to surgical sterilization ( i.e., at least 6 weeks 
following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal ligation) 
confirmed by medical history or menopause; or must agree to use 2 methods of effective and 
highly reliable methods of contraception at the same time (i.e., tubal sterilization, partner’s 
vasectomy, intra -uterine device (IUD), male latex condom with or without spermicide, 
diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or vaginal sponge that contains 
spermicide ) during study treatment (includin g during temporary breaks from treatment), and for 
at least 180 days after stopping carotuximab  and at least 180 days after stopping nivolumab  
treatment.   
Men must agree to use 2 effective and highly reliable methods of contraception at the same time 
(i.e., vasectomy, male latex condom with or without spermicide, partner’s tubal sterilization, 
partner’s use of an IUD, partner’s use of diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with 
spermicide, or vaginal sponge that contains spermicide)  during study treatment  (including 
temporary breaks from treatment), and for at least 180 days after stopping carotuximab and at 
least 180 days after stopping nivolumab .  The long-term risk of infertility is unknown.  Ovarian 
failure has been observed with other antiangiogenic a gents.  
2.6.2.  Potential Benefits  
Carotuximab  is an investigational product, and its efficacy has not been established.  Nivolumab 
is approved for the treatment of appropriately selected patients who progress following treatment 
with chemotherapy.  It is possible  that the administration of carotuximab  and nivolumab may 
result in clinical benefit (i.e., tumor response or prolonged stable disease)  beyond that of 
treatment with nivolumab alone . 
2.7. Justification of the Dose, Schedule , and Route of Administration  
The dose , schedule , and route of administration  of carotuximab  (8 mg/kg IV weekly or  10 mg/kg 
weekly  for 4 doses followed by 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was  selected based on safety, 
pharmacokinetics , and evidence of activity in the Phase 1 study of carotuximab  for patients with 
solid tumors (Study 105ST101 ) and in Phase 1b studies  of carotuximab with VEGF inhibitors .  
Dose reduction i s possible for treatment of adverse events, including anem ia.   
Carotuximab has not previously been dosed with a PD -1 inhibitor, but has not been associated 
with immune -mediated toxicity that is characteristic of nivolumab or other PD -1 inhibitors.  
Therefore,  a carotuximab  starting dose of 8 mg/kg weekly, which is 20% lower than the single -
agent carotuximab MTD identified in the Phase 1 single -agent study and Phase 1b stud ies with 
bevacizumab, pazopanib , and axitinib was selected.  In addition , a 6 mg/kg  dose level (Dose

TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 27 of 78 Level  -1) has also been included and will be used should 8 mg/kg of carotuximab  in combination 
with nivolumab exceed the MTD.    
Nivolumab (Opdivo®) is an a human monoclonal PD -1 antibody that is approved by the FDA for 
a number of indications, including the treatment of metastatic NSCLC that has progressed 
following on or after platinum -based chemotherapy.  This p rotocol is designed to administer 
nivolumab at the dose, schedule, and route of administration and to the target patient population  
per the nivolumab package insert, which for NSCLC is 240 mg IV every 2 weeks.   
2.8. Study Conduct  
The 105LC102  clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ), and the applicable regulatory requirements.

4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
4.1.1.  Overview  
This is a multi -center, open -label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation , Phase 1b  study of 
carotuximab  in combination with standard dose nivolumab in patients with  NSCLC  that has 
progressed on or after platinum -based  chemotherapy  or PD -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibition, as a 
single agent or with chemotherapy .  The purpose of the carotuximab  dose escalation portion is to 
determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
carotuximab when give n in combination with nivolumab .  A standard “3+3” dose -escalation 
design will be employed, followed by expa nsion  cohort s to further assess the safety , tolerability , 
and preliminary efficacy  of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP 2D) of carotuximab  with 
nivolu mab. 
All patients must sign and date a consent form prior to undertaking any study -related procedures.  
Prospective patients will be screened to determine if they qualify for the study within 28 days of 
enrollment.  Patients will receive nivolumab at 240 mg IV very 2 weeks starting on Cycle 1 Day 
1 (C1D1) and will receive carotuximab starting on C1D1 at 6, 8, or 10 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses 
and then 15 mg/kg very 2 weeks thereafter according to the dosing schedule in Table 3 (see 
carotuximab Administration Section  6.1.6  and Nivolumab Administration Section  6.2.6 ).  
Intermediate carotuximab  doses (below the MTD established during the trial) may be explored 
based upon clinical, pharmacokinetic ( PK), and/or biomarker data.  
Patients are eligible for continued therapy with nivolumab and carotuximab until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdra wal of consent, or other reasons.  Patients will be 
scanned every 8 weeks to determine disease status .  Adverse events will be graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE ) Version 4.0 3.

without Grade 3 immune -related toxicity.  
 
Three patients will be initially enrolled and treated at each dose level.  If none of these 3 patients 
experiences a DLT during the initial 28 days of combination therapy  period, dose escalation  will 
proceed  following review of safety data with Principal Investigators at all sites.   If 1 of 3 patients 
experiences DLT, the dose level will be expanded to 6 patients.  The MTD will have been 
exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experience DLT at a given dose level where at least 6 patients 
have been evaluated  (includi ng the expa nsion  cohort s).  DLT will have occurred when a patient 
has 1 or more toxicity listed in Table  4 that is at least possibly related to nivoluma b or 
carotuximab  during the first 28  days of combination therapy .   
 
Upon determination of the MTD , up to 24 additional patients will be enrolled (up to 12 in each 
cohort) into Expansion Cohort s 1 and 2.  The study will be terminated for grade  ≥3 infusion 
related reactions occurring in ≥33% of 6 or more patients in the expan sion cohort s. 
Patients who exit the study for reasons other than D LT prior to completion of the 28-day DLT 
evaluation period will be re placed to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort.  
Patients who experience DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose of carotuximab  or 
nivolumab due to documented toxicity during the DLT evaluation period will be considered 
evaluable for d ose escalation purposes.  A given carotuximab  dose level may be reenrolled at an 
intermediate dose level upon agreement of study Investigators.

Page 38 of 78 14. 12-Lead ECG:  Single tracing 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening and at the time point s indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (pre -dose).  
If the pa tient develops an arrhythmia, the ECG should be repeated on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.  For a QTc >500 ms, the ECG should be 
evaluated by a cardiologist at the site for confirmation.  Additional ECGs may be performed on study as clinically indicated.   
15. Concomitant Medications and Treatments:  Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study 
treatment and up to 28 days following the last dose of study treatment.  Required carotuximab  premedications should be  recorded on carotuximab 
premedications CRF.  
16. Adverse Events: All serious adverse events and those non -serious events assessed by the Investigator as suspected reactions (i.e., at least possibly 
related) to a TRACON investigational medicinal product must be  followed, even after the patient’s withdrawal from study, until the event is either 
resolved, improved to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline or better, stable without anticipated future change, or the patient is lost to follow -up, or, in the 
case of a s uspected adverse reaction, later determined to be not related to the TRACON investigational medicinal product.   
17. Anti -product  antibody  (APA) : 5 mL blood sample will be collected to assess anti-product  antibody  at the time point s indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments  and stored at approximately -70°C to be analysed by a central laboratory.  Samples will be batch shipped as indicated in the laboratory

Page 44 of 78 6. TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
6.1. Description of Carotuximab Study Drug  
Carotuximab is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody 
directed against human endoglin  (CD105 ) found on the surface of proliferating endothelial 
cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).   
6.1.1.  Carotuximab Composition  
Carotuximab is an IgG1, kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light - and heavy -chain 
variable region sequences and human constant region sequences.  Carotuximab  has an 
approximate molecular weight of 148 kilo-Dalton ( kDa).  
6.1.2.  Carotuximab Dose Le vels 
Each patient will be dosed with 6 (Dose Level -1), 8 (Dose Level 1) or 10 mg/kg (Dose Level 
2), 4 once -weekly doses and then  15 mg/kg every 2 weeks , as shown in Table  6.  The 
maximum weight that should be used for the purpose of dose calculation is 85 kg for women 
and 100 kg for men.  Thus, the maximum dose that should be given to a woman at the 
10 mg/kg dos e is 850 mg and at the 15  mg/kg dose is 1 ,275 mg, and the maximum dose that 
should be given to a man at the 10  mg/kg dose is 1 ,000 mg and at the 15 mg/kg dose is 
1,500  mg.  Carotuximab is distributed according to lean body mass rather than overall body 
weight.  Patients who are overweight would be at risk for high serum levels of carotuximab if 
the doses were not capped  as specified above .  Eighty -five kg for women and 100 kg for men 
represent accepted maximum lean body masses for the two genders.  
For Dose Levels -1, 1, 2, and  expan sion cohort s, the first weekly carotuximab  dose will be 
given on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) following the initial dose of nivolumab on C1D1 .  The 
carotuximab  premed ications will be administered immediately after th e nivolumab infusion is 
complete and all nivolumab infusion reactions have resolved.  The initial carotuximab  dose 
will be split into 2 doses whereby 3 mg/kg will be administered on C1D1 and the balance will 
be administered at C1D4 .  The entire weekly dose of carotuximab  (6, 8 or 10 mg/kg) is then 
given on C1D8, C1D15, and C1D22 , and then 15 mg/kg of carot uximab  is given every 2 
weeks beginning with C2D1 .  Each cycle will be 28 days in dur ation.

6.1.3.  Carotuximab  Packaging and Labeling  
Carotuximab  will be supplied at 25 mg/mL in 20 mM L -Histidine/L -Histidine 
Monohydrochloride,  240 mM T rehalose, 0.01% Polysorbate 20 f ormulation (25 mg 
carotuximab  in one or more of the following present ations.  
200 mg Carotuximab /8 mL single -use vial  
400 mg Carotuximab /16 mL single -use vial  
6.1.4.  Carotuximab  Storage and Shipping  
Carotuximab must be stored upright between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protected from 
light.  
6.1.5.  Carotuximab Preparation  
Carotuximab will be prepared in the pharmacy and diluted into normal saline using 
appropriate aseptic technique.  Carotuximab  must be administered using an in -line 0.2 micron 
filter.  No incompatibilities between carotuximab and polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin bags 
have been observed.  Multiple vials will be required for a single dose.  The following 
formulae should be used to calculate the volume of carotuximab  to be added to normal saline:  
Patient weight (kg , up to a maximu m 85 kg for women and 100 kg men ) × dose level 
(mg/kg) divided by carotuximab  concentration (mg/mL) = volume of carotuximab  (mL) 
to be administered.  
The volume of carotuximab that is to be administered can be rounded up or down to the 
nearest 1.0 mL; in th e case of an increment of 0.5 mL the volume should be rounded up.   The 
maximum weight that should be used for dose calculation in this study is 85 kg for 
women and 100 kg for men ( Note:  there is not a weight restriction for enrollment 
purposes).   If the p atient’s weight changes by > 10% during the study, the dose of 
carotuximab will be recalculated.  At that time a new baseline weight will be established such 
that subsequent weight changes by >10% from the new baseline weight would require further 
recalcul ation of the carotuximab dose.  The calculated volume of carotuximab will be diluted 
with normal saline.  Appropriate judgment should be exercised in withdrawing an adequate 
amount of saline necessary to permit injection of the appropriate volume of antibo dy into a 
normal saline bag in accordance with the dose needed.  The final carotuximab  concentration 
must be between 0.6 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL.   
The prepared carotuximab  must be gently inverted several times in order to ensure a 
homogeneous solution.  The di luted infusion solution of carotuximab  should be used within 8 
hours of preparation if stored at room temperature, or within 24 hours of dilution if stored at 
2° to 8°C (36º to 46ºF).  The expiration time should be labeled on the bag.  If the diluted 
infus ion solution of carotuximab cannot be infused within 8 hours of preparation (i.e. , the 
prepared infusion is at room temperature for more than 8 hours), a second bag will be

Page 46 of 78 prepared that contains the balance of the planned dose that was not already deliver ed.  The 
prepared solution should not be frozen.  
6.1.6.  Carotuximab Administration  
Patients should be encouraged to drink abundant fluid (e.g., two 8 ounce glasses of water or 
juice) prior to the first treatment.  Intravenous hydration prior to and during therapy  is left to 
the discretion of the Investigator, but should be considered for patients that may be volume 
depleted.  
The following carotuximab premedications should be administered , to be completed within 
30 minutes to 2 hours prior to the start of each carotuximab infusion:   
• Acetaminophen 650 mg PO x 1 
• Methylprednisolone 100 mg IV will be given prior to the C1D1  and C1D4 
infusions.  In addition, methylprednisolone will be given in the case of a 
carotuximab dosing delay of ≥ 10 days between any 2 scheduled weekly doses or 
in the case of a delay of ≥ 17 days between any 2 scheduled every 2 week doses, 
or if the patient develops an infusion reaction ≥ Grade 2 during the immediate 
prior infusion.  
• Cetirizine 10 mg IV or PO x 1 (or similar oral or IV antihistamine) : Cetirizine (or 
similar oral or IV antihistimine) may be discontinued starting with C3D1 , in the 
absence of infusion reactions with the prior dose.  
• Anti-emetic treatment, while not required, may be given prior to the initial dose 
and subseque nt doses to reduce the frequency of nausea and vomiting that may be 
observed during TRC105 infusions.  
Carotuximab infusions will begin 2 hours to 30 minutes following the completion of the 
carotuximab  premedication, including the methylprednisolone infusio n.  
Carotuximab  will be administered IV utilizing an infusion pump.  Carotuximab has been 
demonstrated to be compatible with polyethylene lined, non -DEHP infusion sets and 
polyvinyl chloride, non -DEHP infusion sets.  Carotuximab is required to be administe red 
with a 0.2 micron downstream filter.  The attachment of the infusion pump administration set 
to the IV bag and transport of the carotuximab  study drug to the patient will be performed as 
per standard study site procedures.   
Following the appropriate premedication regimen, the first weekly carotuximab  dose will be 
split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered (on cycle 1 day 1) over 4 hours (+/ - 15 
minutes) and the balance (e.g., 5 mg/kg for Dose Level 1) is administere d on cycle 1 day 4 
over 2 hours (+/ - 15 minutes).  Do not increase the infusion rate above 25 mg/min.  
Thereafter, the full (e.g., 8 mg/kg for Dose Level 1) carotuximab dose will be administered 
IV over 1 hour (+/ - 15 minutes ).  Patients must complete at l east one 4 hour infusion without 
the development of any infusion reactions, in order to reduce the subsequent carotuximab 
infusion to 2 hours (+/ - 15 minutes) and complete a 2 hour infusion without the development 
of any infusion reactions in order to redu ce subsequent carotuximab  infusions to 1 hour (+/ - 
15 minutes).  See Table 7 for ideal dosing schemas.  Patients with infusion reactions of any 
kind sho uld be managed appropriately (see Section  6.1.8 ) and are not permitted to reduce the 
duration of the next planned infusion.

carotuximab -related AEs (including anemia) that have resolve d to Grade 1 or that patient’s 
baseline  or better , as specified in Table  8.  The protocol -specified withdrawal criteria include 
the following dosing delays:  
• Any carotuximab  dose delay > 2 days during the 28 day DLT evaluation period 
(i.e., Cycle  1). 
• Dose delay such that the patient receives neither study drug for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks ).

Page 48 of 78 who require anticoagulation will have their carotuximab therapy interrupted.  Carotuximab  
therapy may resume once the following criteria are met:   
• The patient is on a stable dose of heparin or low molecular weight heparin.  
• The patient has a platelet count > 100,000 /μL. 
• The patient has not had a hemorrhagic event of Grade 2 or higher while on study.  
• The patient does not have a pathological condition that carries a high risk of 
bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels).  
• The patient is benefiting from carotuximab  therapy (no evidence of disease 
progression).  
Patients who cannot tolerate nivolumab or carotuximab therapy and who demonstrate a 
respons e of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) with the 
combination and are thought to benefit from continued single -agent therapy may continue on 
study on carotuximab  or nivolumab alone per Section  5.3 of the protocol.  
Carotuximab  (and nivoluma b) should be held for 2 weeks prior and for 2 weeks following 
major surgical procedures.  However, r esumption of study treatment can be shorter (but no 
less than 7 days) or longer than 2 weeks based on clinical judgment of adequate wound 
healing and recovery from the procedure.  For minor procedures  (e.g., thoracentesis, 
paracentesis, port placement, lap aroscopy, thorascopy, tube thoracostomy, bronchoscopy, 
endoscopic ultrasonographic procedures, mediastinoscopy, skin biopsies, incisional biopsies, 
imaging -guided biopsy for diagnostic purposes, and routine dental procedures ), carotuximab 
(and nivoluma b) should be held for at least 1 week prior and for at least 1 week after (or until 
adequate healing).  
CAROTUXIMAB PREMEDICATIONS AND S PLIT DOSING FOR CAROTUXIMAB 
DOSING DELAY :  If a patient misses a scheduled weekly carotuximab dose and dosing is 
resumed ≥ 10 days after the last carotuximab dose or if a patient misses a scheduled every 2 
week dose and dosing is resumed ≥ 17 days after the last carotuximab dose, carotuximab 
premedication s (including methylprednisolone) and carotux imab are to be administered as 
described in Table  4.  Split dosing (2 carotuximab administrations 4 days apart) is not 
required.   However, it is recomm ended that if the patient experienced a severe headache 
with a previous infusion,  the first carotuximab dose upon resumption should be given in 2 
administ rations  4 days apart as was done for the initial dose .  
The schedule of assessment (Table  5) should be followed with regard to visits, labs, and 
any other required assessments even if carotuximab dosing is delayed . 
6.1.8.  Management of Carotu ximab  Infusion Reactions  
The management of infusion -related reactions is summarized in Table  9.  If a patient 
experiences a Grade 2 or higher adverse re action during infusion, the infusion should be 
interrupted and the patient treated accordingly.  Antipyretic, antihistamine, antiemetic, anti -
inflammatory, and/or other symptomatic medications including epinephrine may be 
administered as indicated.  For Gr ade 2 and certain Grade 3 infusion -related reactions, the 
infusion may be restarted at half of the previous rate and when the infusion reaction has 
resolved, and then increased per patient tolerance to the baseline rate and a maximum of 25 
mg/min.  For Gra de 4 infusion reactions, the infusion should not be restarted and the patient 
should discontinue study drug treatment.  Infusion reactions will be recorded as AEs in the

Page 52 of 78 7. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
7.1. Radiologic  Tumor Assessment  
The primary efficacy assessment will be best overall response by iRECIST  as defined in  
Table  10 and Seymour et al [18].  iRECIST introduces the criterion of unconfirmed 
progressive disease (iUPD) to prevent the discontinuation of study treatment for cases of 
pseudoprogression.  If the criteria for iUPD have never been met, principles should follow 
RECIST 1.1.  However, if th e criteria for iUPD have been met, the next timepoint response 
could be:  
• iUPD: no change noted in any category of lesion  
• iSD, iPR, or iCR.  Here, iUPD (followed by iCPD) should occur again  
• iCPD, if the category in which iUPD was met at the last timepoint response shows 
a further increase in tumor burden as evidenced (as applicable) by a > 5 mm 
increase in sum of measures of target or new target lesions, further increase in 
non-target or new non-target lesions, or an increase in the number of new lesions.  
Investigators will make treatment decisions based on these assessments.  All lesions will be 
classified as target or non -target lesions at the Screening visit.  Each lesion designation will 
be maintained through the course of the study.  
The same method and technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported 
lesion at Screening, during the study treatment period, and at the End of Study visit.   
Imaging -based evaluation over clinical examination is the required technique when both 
could be used to assess the antitumor effect of the treatment.  Clinical Oncology review of all 
tumor measurements is desired.  
Whenever possible, clinical evaluation of superficial lesions should not  be used as the sole 
form of measurement.  However, when necessary, color photograph with metric caliber is 
acceptable.  Tumor evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by ultrasound 
may not substitute for CT or MRI scans.  
Radiological tumo r assessments will be performed at Screening, as outlined in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table  5), and whenever disease progression is suspected.  Ano ther tumor 
assessment will be performed at the End of Study visit if an assessment has not been 
performed within the prior 8 weeks.  All patient files and radiological images must be 
available for CRF source verification.

Page 55 of 78 8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be characterized in terms of the incidence, timing, severity graded by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ), 
Version  4.03), seriousness, and drug-relatedness of adverse events (AEs) and labo ratory 
abnormalities.  In addition, physical examination, vital signs, and ECOG performance status 
will be serially monitored.  Laboratory safety analyses will be based on the local laboratory 
data, and will include hematology  (including iron studies at ba seline) , serum chemistry 
(including liver and kidney function , and TSH ), urinalysis, serum or urine pregnancy testing, 
and coagulation profile  (baseline only) .  Serum will also be assessed for immunogenicity to 
carotuximab  (including anti-product antibody  titers).  In addition, single tracing 12-lead 
ECGs will be performed at the time point s indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  5).  QT, PR and  QRS  interval s and heart rate  will be captured.  ECG s will also be 
collected as clinically indicated throughout the study.   
8.1.1.  Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory tests should be recorded as adverse events.  To 
meet the definition of clinically significant, the test result generally requires a change in 
medical management (e.g. , new medication, unplanned treatment, additional tests , etc.).  
8.1.1.1.  Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation, and Pregnancy Test  
Assessments will be performed at the time  points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  5) and analyzed at local laboratories.  Investigators may have additional blood tests 
performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, or for following AEs,  as 
clinically indicated.  
• Hematology: Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential and platelet count .  
Baseline i ron studies including serum iron, ferritin , and total iron binding capacity . 
• Coagulation:  Prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) . 
• Serum Chemistry: Total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT) , aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, 
chloride, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, magnesium, thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH), and glucose . 
• Pregnancy Test: Serum or urine  pregnancy tests will be performed locally on all 
female patients of childbearing potential.  Patients must be surgically sterile (i.e. , ≥ 6 
weeks following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or 
tubal ligation ) or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception 
during the study and for ≥ 180 days  following last dose of study drug ( carotuximab or 
nivolumab, which occurs later) .  The definition of effective contraception is provided  
in Section  2.6.1  of this protocol.  
8.1.1.2.  Urinalysis  
Urinalysis (without microscopic analysis, unless indicated) will be performed at time  points 
indicated in the Sched ule of Assessments ( Table  5) and analyzed by local laboratories.

TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 56 of 78 Microscopic analysis , urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR) , and 24 -hour urine collection for 
protein  should be performed as clinically indicated.  
8.1.2.  Physical Examination  
A physical examination including, but not limited to, general appearance, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, neck, heart, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, sk in, lymph nodes, 
neurological genitourinary (as appropriate), and rectal (as appropriate) will be assessed at 
time points  indicated within the Schedule of Assessments (Table  5).  The physical 
examination will include examination of known and suspected sites of disease.   
8.1.3.  Vital Signs  
Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate , and weight will be assessed at time  
points indicated within the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  5).  Height will be assessed only 
at the Screening visit.  Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate will also 
be assessed during carotuximab  infusions as described in Section  4.1.2.2  and the footnotes of 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  5).  
8.1.4.  Performance Status  
The ECOG scale will be used to assess performance status at Screening  and at time points 
indicated within the Schedule of  Assessments (Table  5).   
8.1.5.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A single  tracing  12-lead tracing will be used for all ECGs.  It is preferable that the machine 
used h as a capacity to calculate standard intervals automatically.   ECG will be performed at 
the time point s indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  5) and as clinically indicated 
throughout the study.  
8.2. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to study drug 
(carotuximab and nivolumab) will be reported as described below.  
8.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient who is administered a drug or 
biologic (medicinal product); the event may or may not have a causal relationship with the 
medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to the follow ing: 
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs including:  
 Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study drug 
treatment    
 Signs and symptoms resulting from drug overdose, abuse, misuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, dependency, interaction , or toxicity    
 All treatment -emergent possibly related and unrelated illnesses, including the 
wors ening of a preexisting illness  
 Injury or accidents - Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused 
the injury or accident ( e.g., hip fracture from a fal l secondary to dizziness), the 
  105LC102 Amendment #2  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol   05Apr2018  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 57 of 78 medical condition (dizziness) and a medical problem caused by  the accident 
(hip fracture from a fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs.   
 Symptoms or signs resulting from exposure in utero  
• Abnormalities in physiological t esting or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond order ing a repeat confirmatory 
test) 
• Laboratory abnormalities that meet any of the following criteria  (Note:  Merely 
repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the below conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an AE.) 
 Test result that is associated with accompanying symptoms  
 Test result that requires add itional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention  
 Test result that leads to a change in study drug (carotuximab or nivolumab) 
dosing other than  protocol -stipulated dose adjustments or discontinuation from 
the trial, significant additional concomi tant drug treatment, or other therapy  
 Test result that is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or TRACON  
8.2.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as a serious  /ae 
(SAE) : 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening ( i.e., at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of 
drug dependence or drug abuse.  
Serious also includes any other AE that the Investigator or sponsor judges to be serious, or 
which is defined as serious by the Health Regulatory Authority ( HRA ) in the country in 
which the event occurred.   
Progression of the malignancy under study (inclu ding signs and symptoms of progression) 
should be reported as an SAE  if it meets criteria for serious  including h ospitalizations due to 
signs and symptoms of disease progression.   
  105LC102 Amendment #2  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol   05Apr2018  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 58 of 78 The onset date of an SAE is defined as the date on which the event initiall y met serious 
criteria (e.g., the date of admission to a hospital).  The end date is the date on which the event 
no longer met serious criteria (e.g., the date the patient was discharged from a hospital).  
8.2.2.1.  Hospitalization  
AEs associated with in -patient hospitalization, or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, 
are considered serious.  Any initial admission, even if the duration is less than 24 hours , is 
considered serious.  In addition, any transfer within the hospital t o an acute/intensive care 
unit is considered serious (e.g., transfer from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor or 
transfer from a medical floor to a coronary care unit).  However, the following 
“hospitalizations ” should not  per se constitute a  serious  AE:  
• Rehabilitation facility admission  
• Hospice facility admission  
• Respite care  
• Skilled nursing facility admission  
• Nursing home admission  
• Emergency room visit , including observation unit visit  
• Outpatient s ame day surgery /procedure  
• Hospitalization or prolonga tion of hospitalization in the absence of precipitating 
clinical adverse events as follows:  
 Admission for treatment of preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition  
 Social admission  
 Administrative admission (e.g. , for yearly physical exam)  
 Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial  
 Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event 
(e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)  
 Preplanned treatments or surg ical procedures  that are not related to an SAE  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, 
should not be reported as AEs.  The medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the d efinition of an AE (e.g., acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE 
and the appendectomy should be recorded as a concomitant treatment).  
8.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
8.3.1.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Invest igator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs reported by the study 
patient using concise medical terminology.  In addition, each study patient will be questioned 
about AEs at each clinic visit following initiation of treatment.  The question a sked will be,  or 
words to the effect,  “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”  
  105LC102 Amendment #2  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol   05Apr2018  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 59 of 78 8.3.2.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Safety information for each patient will be collected from the date of informed consent.  AEs 
occurring prior to the initi ation of the study treatment with nivolumab and/or carotuximab  
study drug will be considered " baseline -emergent adverse events ,” will be recorded on 
corresponding CRFS , and will not be retained for patients who fail screening .  The AE 
reporting period for this study begins when the patient has received even a portion of the first 
dose of nivolumab  or carotuximab  study  drug and ends 28 days after the last dose of  the latest 
study treatment (i.e. , nivolumab or carotuximab  study  drug) is administered.  
All AEs that occur in study patients during the AE reporting period specified in the protocol 
must be reported to TRACON, whether or not the event is considered study treatment -related .  
In addition, any known untoward event that occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the 
Investigator assesses as related to either investigational medication/product should also be 
reported as an AE. 
8.3.3.  Reporting Requirements  
Each AE is to be classified by the Investigator as SERIOUS or NONSERIOUS.  This 
classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  
If an SAE occurs, reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any AE that meets any one of the criteria for an 
SAE immediately upon learning of the event.  Any subsequent revisions that are made to 
information pertaining to serious suspected adverse drug ( carotuximab  or niv olumab) 
reactions ( e.g., change in grade , etc.), including a change in attribution to study drug from 
“not related” to “suspected adverse drug reaction” should also be communicated to TRACON 
immediately.  This notification should be made to:

TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 60 of 78 Following notification, the Investigator will report the SAE via the AE CRF via the da ta 
management system.  The initial AE CRF is to be updated with more detailed AE information 
within 5 calendar days of the event  onset . 
In the rare event that the Investigator is not immediately aware of an SAE ( e.g., if the study 
patient seeks urgent medi cal attention elsewhere), the Investigator is to notify the Sponsor 
immediately upon learning of it  and document his/her first awareness.  
All serious adverse events and those non -serious events assessed by the Investigator as 
suspected reactions (i.e., at least possibly related) to a TRACON investigational medicinal 
product must be followed, even after the patient’s withdrawal from study, until the event is 
either resolved, improved to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline or better, stable without 
anticipat ed future change, or the patient is lost to follow -up, or, in the case of a suspected 
adverse reaction, later determined to be not related to the TRACON investigational medicinal 
product.   
SAEs that are unexpected and associated with use of the study medi cation will be reported to 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all participating clinical sites by TRACON 
via MedWatch forms.  For SAEs which are fatal or life -threatening, unexpected, and 
associated with use of the study drug ( carotuximab  or niv olumab) , a 7-Day Alert Report will 
be submitted to the FDA within 7 calendar days of receipt of the SAE information.  For all 
other SAES that are unexpected and associated with use of the study drug ( carotuximab  or 
nivolumab), a written report will be made  no more than 15 calendar days from the date 
TRACON learns of the event.  Participating clinical sites will be notified of these events in 
parallel  with FDA notification . 
All AEs, including SAEs, are to be reported on the AE CRFs.  
8.3.4.  Recording Adverse Events  in the Case Report Forms  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AES  and all AEs reported by the study 
patient.  In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.  All AEs that meet the 
criteria specified in Section 8.2.1  are to be recorded on patient source documents and on the 
CRFs.  AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs.  
8.3.5.  Gradi ng of Adverse Event Severity  
To report AEs on the CRFs, the Investigator will use the severity grading as described in NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4.0 3).  Every effort should be made by the Investigator to assess the AE 
according to CTCAE criteria.  If the Investig ator is unable to assess severity because the term 
is not described in NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0 3), then severity of MILD, MODERATE, 
SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING, or FATAL may be used to describe the maximum 
intensity of the AE, as guided by Table  11.  Note that the selection of the most appropriate 
verbatim term for AEs is not restricted to only those toxicities represented in NCI CTCAE.  
For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
Table  11: Adverse Event Severity Grading  
Grade  Non-CTCAE Severity  Definition  
1 Mild  Does not interfere with patient’s usual function  
2 Moderate  Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function  
3 Severe  Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function

TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 61 of 78 Grade  Non-CTCAE Severity  Definition  
4 Life-Threatening  Results in immediate risk of patient’s death  
5 Fatal  Results in patient’s death  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe AE is not 
necessarily a serious AE.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly 
with patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unl ess it met one of the 
criteria for serious events.   
8.3.6.  Relationship to Study Drug (Carotux imab  and Nivolumab ) 
In this study, there are 2 study drugs; the investigational drug carotuximab  is given in 
combination with the approved drug nivolumab .  The relationship of each AE  to each study 
drug will be made independently for each of the 2 study drugs and should be guided in part 
by the known safety profile of each drug, including the carotuximab IB and the nivolumab 
package insert.  The relatednes s should be classified by the Investigator using the following 
guidelines:  
• Suspected Adverse Reaction: There is a reasonable possibility that study drug caused 
the AE (i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between study drug  and 
the AE). 
• Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with study 
drug.  
AEs related to study drug are considered Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR s). 
8.3.7.  Expectedness  
All AEs and ADRs  are considered “unexpected” if not listed in the TRC150 IB f or 
carotuximab or the package insert for nivolumab, as applicable,  and not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed  in this study .  For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity)  if the IB 
referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism 
and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB listed 
only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected," as used  in this definition, also refers to AEs 
or suspected ADRs  that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular  drug under investigation.  
8.3.8.  Exposure in Utero  
If any study patient (or partner of a study patient) becomes or is found to be pregnant during 
the study or within 90 days of discontinuing the investigational medication/product, the 
Investigator must report th e information to TRACON, or designee via the Pregnancy 
Notification Report Form  within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy .  This must be done 
irrespective of whether an AE has occurred.  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery.   
The Investigator will follow the pregnant patient (or partner of a study patient) until 
completion of the pregnancy or until pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then 
notify TRACON, or its designee, of the outcome within 5 days or  as specified below.  The 
  105LC102 Amendment #2  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol   05Apr2018  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Proprietary and Conf idential  
Page 62 of 78 Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial report.  The reason(s) 
for an induced abortion must be specified.  
The Investigator should follow procedures for reporting an SAE if pregnancy outcome meets 
criteria for an SAE ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus]).  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
and the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form should be completed (i.e., no minimum follow -up 
period of a presumably normal infant must pass before a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form 
can be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual 
inspection unl ess pre -abortion laboratory findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occ ur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the 
Investigator assesses as possibly related to the in utero  exposure to the study drug  
should also be reported.  
8.3.9.  Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
All AEs should be followed until resolved, improved to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline 
severity or better, or the patient’s participation in the study is completed , whichever occurs 
first.  All serious adverse events a nd those non -serious events assessed by the Investigator as 
suspected reactions (i.e., at least possibly related) to a carotuximab  must be followed, even 
after the patient’s withdrawal from study, until the event is either resolved, improved to the 
patient ’s pre -treatment baseline or better, stable without anticipated future change, or the 
patient is lost to follow -up, or, in the case of a suspected adverse reaction, later determined to 
be not related to the TRACON investigational medicinal product.  Any in crease  or decrease 
in AE grade should be recorded as a new adverse event.  All AEs  should also be documented 
on the AE CRF.  
8.4. Safety Monitoring  
The TRACON clinical team will monitor the study through periodic teleconferences with the 
Principal Investigators  to share experiences and ensure communication.  Safety of 
carotuximab  clinical trials  is monitored by an Independent Safety Advisory Committee and 
the TRACON Safety Monitoring Committee that each meet at least quarterly.  These 
committees  will monitor saf ety throughout this  study and all studies of carotuximab  via the 
following activities:  
• Surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines  
• Routine monitoring of non -serious AES  as they are recorded in the CRFs   
Carotuximab t oxicity information that m ay affect the treatment of patients on this study will 
be promptly communicated in writing to all participating carotuximab  clinical sites , as well as 
institutions participating in this clinical trial.

10.1. Statistical Design/Sample Size  
The number of patients to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the obse rved safety 
profile, which will determine the number of patients per dose level and the number of dose 
escalations.  It is anticipated that approximately  18 to 30 patients will be enrolled  in the 
study . 
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose  for each underlying true DLT rate is 
shown in Table  12.  For example, at a dose level with a toxicity  rate of 5%  of patients , there 
is a greater than 95% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a dose level with a true 
toxicity rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is < 5%.  
Table  12: Probability of Escalation to the Next Dose for Each True Underlying DLT 
Rate at a Dose Level  
True Underlying DLT Rate  5% 10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  
Probability of Escalating Dose  0.97 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.01 0.001  
The probability of failing to observe DLT in a sample size of 3 or 6 patients given various 
true underlying toxicity rates in shown in Table  13.  For example, with 6 patients, the 
probability of failing to observe toxicity occurring at least 40% of the time is less than 5%.   
The enrollment of 15 patients at a given dose level will reduce the probability of failing to 
observe toxicity occurring at  least 30% of the time to < 5%.

10.1.1.  Definition of Analyzed Study Populations  
The following study populations will be considered when reporting study results:  
• The study population for safety includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 
1 dose of either study drug ( carotuximab  and nivolumab) .   
• The study population for PK includes also patients with adequate data for PK 
carotuxim ab or nivolumab .   
• The study population for efficacy will include all safety population patients who 
have baseline and follow -up tumor measurements as required for assessment by 
iRECIST . 
Patients who experience DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose  of carotuximab or 
nivolumab  due to documented toxicity in Cycle 1 will be considered evaluable for dose

Page 65 of 78 Only those patients who are deemed ineligible  (e.g., do not satisfy eligibility criteria)  or who 
receive no study drug (i.e., no carotuximab  or nivolumab ) will be eliminated from the 
analysis.  Ineligible patients who receive therapy will not be included in the assessment of 
efficacy endpoints, but their data will be included in the assessment of all AE reporting.  
10.2. Data Analysis  
Descriptive statistics (such as means, medians, standard deviations , and ranges for continuous 
data and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient characteristics, 
treatment administration/compliance, im munogenicity , efficacy, phar macokinetic parameters , 
protein biomarkers, and archival tumor tissue.  Data will also be displayed graphically, where 
appropriate.  
10.2.1.  Analysis of Primary Objective  
Dose -limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) will be summarized by category (hematologic and non -
hematolog ic) and by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) Preferred 
Term (PT) and System Organ Class (SOC) .  
All AEs with an onset after initiation of treatment will be considered as treatment -emergent 
AEs.  A preexisting condition that worsens after study drug treatment  will also be considered 
as a treatment -emergent AE.  All AEs will be coded by MedDRA  SOC  and PT.  
The number and percentage of patients with the following types of treatment -emergent AEs 
will be summarized: all AEs, all SAEs, AEs rela ted to study drug ((carotuximab ) and 
nivolumab) , AEs resulting in study drug discontinuation, and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities.  Non-treatment -emergent serious AEs will be presented separately  from 
treatment -emergent AEs .  Deaths will be  reported with demographic information.  
10.2.2.  Analysis of Pharmacokinetics   
Trough  (pre-dose) serum carotuximab  and nivolumab concentrations will be measured using 
validated ELISA methods.  The carotuximab  pharmacokinetic data may be assessed for 
potential corre lations with response, PFS, survival, AEs, and baseline characteristics using 
descriptive statistics and models as appropriate.  
10.2.3.  Objective Response  
The best response (CR, PR, SD , or PD according to iRECIST ) for each patient with 
measurable disease who recei ved at least 1 dose of study drug will be listed  in Expan sion 
Cohort 1 and Expan sion Cohort 2 .  SD will be defined as lack of tumor progression lasting 
for 3 cycles or longer.  At least 3 of 12 evaluable patient s must demonstrate a response by 
iRECIST (PR a nd CR) in Cohort 1  (PD-1 naïve patients) to jus tify further development of the 
combination of TRC105 and nivolumab in this patient population.   Given  a desir ed 30% 
response rate,  the expectation of at least 3 response s is 75 % using the binomial distribution.  
At least 1 of 12 evaluable patient s must demonstrate a response by iRECIST (PR and CR) in 
Cohort 2 (PD -1 relapsed patients) to justify further development of the combination of 
TRC105 and nivolumab in this patient population.  Given a desired  15% response rate, the 
expectation of at least 1 response is 86% using the binomial distribution.

Angiogenic protein biomarker data for each patient who received at least one dose of study 
drug will be listed.  
10.2.5.  Analysis of Im munogenicity  
Carotuximab  anti-product antibody  (APA) concentrations will be measured using validated 
ELISA methods at the time points  specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  5).  APA  
concentrations will be evaluated in the context of pharmacokinetic parameters and AE 
profiles.  
10.2.6.  Analysis of Tumor Biopsies  
CD8+ T-cells, T regulatory cells, and MDSCs will be quantified for each patient who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug and will be listed.   
10.2.7.  Analysis of Archival Tumor Tissue  
CD105 and PD -1/PD -L1 expression will be quantified for each patient who received at leas t 
1 dose of study drug and will be listed.   Expression will be determined by 
immunohistochemistry ( IHC).  Other markers that may relate to efficacy or toxicity of 
carotuximab  may also be explored.

Page 67 of 78 11. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOUR CE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
All data entered on CRFs/ electronic CRFs ( eCRFs ) must be verifiable within the patients’ 
source documents (written or electronic record).  The Investigator /institution guarantees 
TRACON representatives and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to the original 
source records for the duration of the agreed study record retention period.  Printouts of 
source records that are electronically obtained and stored will not be acceptable for 
audit/inspection unless provided as certified exact copies and the data remains as meaningful 
and useful as in its original electronic state.  
Legally protected patient identification and other personal health information must be 
securely stored with limited access by the participating institutions.  Unless secure provisions 
are establish ed by the institution to allow TRACON (or designee) to perform remote 
monitoring of electronic source records, TRACON (or designee) will review source 
records/data on site and will not remove any such protected health information.

Monitoring visits to clinical investigat ional  sites will be made by TRACON or its 
representatives periodically during the trial to ensure that GCPs and all aspects of the 
protocol are being followed.   
The trial site will also be subject to po ssible inspection by the institutional review board 
(IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) or other appropriate regulatory authority.  The 
trial site is also subject to quality assurance audits performed by TRACON or its 
representatives.  
It is importa nt that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits,  audits, and inspections and that sufficient attention, time, and support is 
devoted to the process.  
TRACON and its representatives will be governed by applicable regulations, GCP standards, 
and internal standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) for the conduct of monitoring visits and 
quality assurance ( QA) audits.

Page 69 of 78 13. ETHICS  
13.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have approval of the study protocol, protocol 
amendments, informed consent forms, advertisements from the IRB/IEC , and any other 
patient -distributed materials  before potent ial patients are consented for participation on the 
trial.  All correspondence and other evidence of appropriate and timely communications with 
the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator/site files.  Copies of all IRB/IEC approvals 
should also be f orwarded to TRACON.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC an d TRACON in writing within 5 
business days after the implementation.  
13.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, applicable local regulatory 
requirements and laws, and the International Council on Harmonization  (ICH) Guideline on 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) , which supports the application of ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (see ICH E6, § 2.1).  
13.3. Written Informed Consent  
The informed consent form language must be agreed up on by TRACON and the IRB/IEC 
and must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal 
requirements.  The informed consent information must not be changed without prior approval 
by TRACON and the IRB/IEC.  The informed consent form u sed in this trial, and any 
changes made during the course of the study , must be approved by both the IRB/IEC and 
TRACON, or designee, before use.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each patient full and adequate verbal and 
written inform ation regarding the objective and procedures of the trial and the possible risks 
involved.  This information must be provided to the patient prior to undertaking any protocol -
specified procedure.  Patients must be informed about their right to withdraw fro m the trial at 
any time.  Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all patients are 
appropriately informed before obtaining their signed and dated consent .  Signature s from the 
Investigator conducting the informed consent discuss ion should also be obtained , prior to 
undertaking any trial -related procedure.  Consent by a legally authorized representative is not 
permitted.  Should an impartial witness be needed , ICH E6 requirements for impartial 
witnesses will apply.  
The Investigat or will retain the original of each patient’s signed consent form in the 
Investigator/site files.  
13.4. Patient Compensation  
Patients will not be compensated for participation in this study ; this will be outlined in the 
patient informed consent form.

Page 70 of 78 14. DATA HANDLI NG AND RECORDKEEPING  
14.1. Inspection of Records  
CRFs /eCRFs  are required and should be completed for each patient who receives treatment 
with pazopanib or carotuximab .  Screen failure CRF’s will not be collected.  Nevertheless, 
records of potential patients identified and screened shall be retained  on site screening logs .  
The completed original CRFs/eCRFs are the sole property of TRACON and should not be 
made availabl e in any form to third parties without written permission from TRACON 
(except for authorized representatives of the HRA and in accordance with Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act  [HIPAA ] regulations).  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to ensure completion and to review and  approve all CRF 
data.  The investigator will sign off on his/her data per patient.  These signatures serve to 
attest that the Investigator has reviewed and approved the information contained on the CRFs  
and that the information is complete, accurate, and true.  At all times, the Investigator has 
final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory 
data entered on the CRFs.    
The use of electronic CRFs (eCRFs) to capture study  data using automated computerized data 
capture systems does not change the principles and requirements for collecting study data.  
The Investigator still retains final personal responsibility for eCRF data and any associated 
data pertaining to it (e.g. , metadata including any record of change to the originally recorded 
data).  The Investigator’s signed approval of the eCRF data serves to attest that the electronic 
data and all of its associated metadata (including changes) has been reviewed and accepted as  
complete, accurate, and true for each patient in the study.  
14.2. Retention of Records  
To allow for appropriate evaluations and/or audits by regulatory authorities or TRACON, the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating p atients 
(sufficient information to link records, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, source documents, and detailed records of 
treatment disposition.  The Investigator should retain these records acco rding to local 
regulations or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.   
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, then 
TRACON should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to an 
acceptable designee, such as another Investigator, another institution.  The Investigator must 
inform TRACON of any such transfer of responsibilities and properly identify the person or 
institution assuming the responsibility.  The respon sible investigator/institution must obtain 
TRACON’s written permission before disposing of any records.

Page 71 of 78 15. DEFINITION OF END OF  TRIAL  
15.1. End of Trial in all Participating Countries  
End of trial in all participating countries is defined as the time at which all patients enrolled 
in the study have completed the treatment follow -up period . 
15.2. End of Trial in a Member State  
End of trial in a Member State  of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the trial as stated in the 
regulatory application (e.g. , the Clinical Trials Agreement [CTA ]) and ethics application in 
the Membe r State.  Poor recruitment is not a reason for premature termination but is 
considered a normal conclusion to the trial in that Member State.  
15.3. TRACON Discontinuation Criteria  
Premature termination of this trial may occur because of a regulatory authority d ecision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of TRACON.  In 
addition, TRACON retains the right to discontinue development of carotuximab  at any time.  
TRACON reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to incl usion of the intended number 
of patients, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative 
reasons.  If a trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, TRACON will promptly notify 
the Investigator.  After notification, the Investigator must contact all participating patients 
within a 28 -day time period.  As directed by TRACON, all trial materials must be collected 
and all CRF data must be completed to the greatest extent possible.

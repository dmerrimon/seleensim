Scheduled Awakenings for the Treatment of Nocturnal Enuresis  
  
Benjamin Whittam, M.D   
 
 
You and your child (if you are the parent or legal guardian of a patient)  are invited to participate in a research 
study called Scheduled Awakenings for the Treatment of Nocturnal Enuresis. You r child was selected as a 
possible subject because they are between the age of 5 and 17 years old and have nocturnal enuresis  (nighttime 
bed-wetting) .  
 Please read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to have your child be a part of  the 
study.  
 The study is being conducted by Dr. Benjamin Whittam, M.D., a pediatric urologist at Riley Hospital for Children. It is funded by  the Riley Children’s Foundation.   
 STUDY PURPOSE  
 
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of scheduled awakenings to potentially reduce the 
frequency of bed-wetting. A device created by Lully called the Sleep Guardian  will be used to create these 
scheduled awakening . The device was initially developed for use in night terrors. During use, s ome users reported 
improvement in bed-wetting when using this device.  
 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY  
 
If you agree to participate, your child  will be one of 40 subjects who will be participating in this research.  
 
PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY  
 If you agree to be in the study, the st udy will move forward as follows : 
 The study will be 16 weeks long.    The first 4 weeks of the study will be the I nitial Phase. During the initial 
Phase, we will collect baseline information about your child’s nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting ). The next 12 weeks 
will be the Therapeutic Phase.   
After you enroll in this study, your child will be  assigned to one of two treatment arms (groups) for the 
Therapeutic Phase. . In the first group, the treatment for your child’s nocturnal enuresis will be behavioral 
modifications and the Lully device for six weeks follo wed by behavioral modifications only for a second six 
weeks.  In the second group, the treatment will  be behavior modifications only for the first six weeks followed by  
behavior modifications and the Lully device for the second six weeks.  
 
During the initial and therapeutic phases of this study, you will be asked to enter responses daily into a Lully 
Study app. You will set up the app with the assist of the study team . The app will send a prompt  each morning. to 
answer the questions : Did your child have a bed wetting episode last night? What time was it?  
 
In a free text box you will be asked to add additional information to describe how wet your child was using the 
following 1-5 scale: 1 - wet underwear; 2 -wet underwear and damp pajamas; 3 -soaked underwear, pajamas; 4 -
soaked pajamas, damp mattress; 5 - soaked mattress

v2/20/201 7 2  You will  also be asked to complete two surveys at four time points throughout this study .  
 
Initial Phase to establish baseline  (4 wks)  
1. You will complete a QOL survey, the KIDSCREEN 27 before starting the initial 4 week phase.  
2. You will use a Malem Enuresis alarm daily during the first 2 weeks  of baseline data collection. This 
alarm will be loaned to you for use during this study.  
3. You will complete responses to the daily questions prompted by the app, as described above.  
4. You will be asked to complete the KIDSCREEN 27 and the Vancouver questionnaire at completion  of the 
initial phase before starting therapeutic phase. 
  
 Therapeutic  phase   
1. You will complete the study phases in the order determined by your assigned treatment arm (group) .  
2. You will complete responses to the daily questions prompted by the app as you did in the Initial Phase.  
3. You will be asked to complete the KIDSCREEN 27 and the Vancouver questionnaire at the end of the first six  weeks and again after completing the second six weeks of this phase.  
 To use the Sleep Guardian, parents will need to own an iOS  (Apple manufactured ) device. You will be asked to 
download the Lully app from the Apple App Store. You will receive verbal and written instructions for the device 
set up and device use.   
 
RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY  
 While on the study, the risks  are: 
 There are no physical risks known with either treatment option for this study. The safety of the Sleep Guardian  
has been extensively tested by the developer.  Safety points are outlined on the product website at https://lullysleep.zendesk.com/hc/en -us. The  Sleep Guardian cannot  overheat. The Sleep Guardian has two 
features to prevent overheating. First, there's a heat sensor that turns the Sleep Guardian off if the temperature rises. Second, the Sleep Guardian shuts off after 3 minutes of use. The waves generated from the Sleep Guardian will not hurt a child. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate to your phone. BLE is roughly 1,200 times weaker than the mobile phone radio waves present in your home today.  
 There is also a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality (privacy) concerning private health information that is 
associated with this research.  Efforts will be made to keep your/your child’s personal information confidential.  
 BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY  
Participation in this study will benefit the understanding of effective treatment options available to children with nocturnal enuresis.  There is the potential direct benefit of nocturnal enuresis management with both treatment 
options.

Précis  
 
Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life -threatening blood disease that can be successfully treated with 
immunosuppressive drug regimens or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, 20 -40% of patients are 
ineligible for transplant due to lack of an appr opriate donor, age, or comorbidities. Immunosuppression can be 
more broadly utilized, but about 1/3 of patients do not respond to a single course of horse ATG and cyclosporine 
and have persistent severe cytopenias.  Among patients who do respond to immunos uppression, responses may 
be partial, with persistent thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. About 30% of responding patients either 
relapse or are dependent on continued cyclosporine administration. Patients with refractory severe cytopenias are 
at risk of dying from infection or bleeding, and they require regular platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions, 
which are expensive and inconvenient, Patients with refractory SAA are also at risk for progression to other 
hematologic disorders, includi ng m yelodysplasia and leukemia.  
 
Thrombopoietin (TPO) was first identified as the principal protein regulating platelet production, and it stimulates 
the proliferation of megakaryocytes and release of platelets.  TPO was later shown to stimulate proliferation of 
more primitive bone marrow stem and progenitor cells in vitro and in animal models, suggesting it could have an 
impact of production of red and white blo od cells as well as platelets.  
 
The 2nd generation oral small molecule TPO -agonist eltrombopag (Prom acta®) has been shown to increase 
platelets in healthy subjects and in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura 
(ITP) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infection. Eltrombopag has been well -tolerated in clinical trials, and unlike 
recombinant TPO, it does not induce autoantibodies.  Eltrombopag received FDA accelerated approval on 
November 20, 2008 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenic purpura who have had an insufficient r esponse to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or 
splenectomy. In November 2012, FDA approval was received for hepatitis C associated thrombocytopenia.  
 
We conducted a pilot dose finding study in patients with severe aplastic anemia who had refractory 
thromb ocytopenia following standard immunosuppressive therapy. Patients began at a dose of 50 mg/day and 
escalated every two weeks to a maximum dose of 150 mg/day.  We reported that 11 of 25 patients (44%) achieved 
hematological response in at least one lineage following 12 weeks of dose -escalating eltrombopag therapy, with 
minimal toxicity. Responding patients as assessed at 12 weeks were invited to continue on drug in an extension 
phase. With a median follow -up of 27 months on drug, 7 eventually became tri -lineage responders. Nine became 
transfusion -independent for platelets (median increase in platelet count 34,000/µl), six had improved hemoglobin 
levels (median increase of 3.8g/dL), including three previously dependent on red cell transfusions achieving 
transf usion -independence, and eight exhibiting increased neutrophil counts (median increase 590 cells/µL). Serial 
bone marrow biopsies demonstrated normalization of tri -lineage hematopoiesis in responders, without increased 
fibrosis.  
 
In the previous study, resp onse assessment occurred at 12 weeks, and patients not fulfilling response criteria at 
that time had the drug discontinued. Several patients began to have detectable changes in transfusion requirements 
or blood counts by 12 weeks, but did not fulfill respo nse criteria by that time point and therefore had to discontinue 
eltrombopag. Other patients who barely met response criteria at 12 weeks showed very marked further 
improvements in blood counts in all lineages during the extension phase, in some cases not reaching maximal 
responses until one year after initiating eltrombopag. We hypothesize that a larger fraction of patients may respond 
if eltrombopag is continued for longer than 12 weeks.  
 
We, therefore propose a follow -up Phase 2 study giving eltrombopag treatment for 24 weeks prior to definitive 
response assessment, and initiating study medication at a fixed dose of 150 mg/day (75 mg /day for individuals of 
East Asian ethnicity), given lack of toxicity at that dose in the prior study, and no evidence for response in any 
patient during dose escalation prior to reaching this dose. Responses will be assessed in all three lineages. Subjects

marrow function in SAA patients with persistent severe cytopenias refractory to treatment wi th

response, and the impact of treatment and treatment response on quality of life.

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) 1 Objectives  
 
The primary objective  is to assess the efficacy of 6 months of eltrombopag administration in improving bone 
marrow function in SAA patients with persistent severe cytopenias refractory to treatment wi th 
immunosuppressive treatment.  
 
Secondary objectives  include assessment of relapse or clonal evolution, pre -treatment characteristics predicting 
response, and the impact of treatment and treatment response on quality of life.  
2 Background and Scientific Justification  
 
2.1 Pathophysiology of Aplastic Anemia  
 
Aplastic anemia is a serious hematologic disease characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow .  
Although the exact etiology of aplastic anemia is not known, clinical experiences and laboratory data suggest that 
the primary mechanism  leading to development of bone marrow failure is immune -mediated destruction of 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.1 Specific populations of effector T -cells are elevated and localized to 
the bone marrow in aplastic anemia, includin g activated cytotoxic T -cells expressing HLA -DR, the IL -2 receptor, 
and IFN -. 2-4The effects exerted by cytotoxic T -lymphocytes are mediated in part due to Fas ligand -induced 
apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells; IFN -γ, in addition to its intrinsic inhibitory activity on hematopoietic 
progenitor and stem cells, can induce over -expression of Fas on target cells.5 High resolution VB CDR3 analysis 
in patients with aplastic anemia shows significantly increased nonrandom skewing of the VB -chain families of 
the T cell receptor, suggestive of disease specific clonal expansion.6 Immune -mediated marrow destruction with 
many similarities to the pathophysiology of human aplastic anemia can be modeled in the mouse.7 
 
Despite its often acute presentation, aplastic anemia is now recognized as a chronic di sease with frequent flares 
of the immune process and the need for long -term immunosuppression. There is evidence that depletion of 
primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is profound, demonstrating that immune attack against the most 
primitive st em cells is paramount.8 Even with recovery of blood counts following successful immunosuppressive 
therapy, a significant quantitative stem cell defect persists, suggesting either ongoing immune destruction or 
persistent depletion o f stem cells even in the absence of an active immune process.9 
 
2.2 Clinical consequences of aplastic anemia  
 
Symptoms derive from low blood counts. Anemia leads to fatigue, weakness, lassi tude, headaches, and in older 
patients dyspnea and chest pain, and these manifestations are most commonly responsible for the clinical 
presentation. Thrombocytopenia produces mucosal bleeding:  petechiae of the skin and mucous membranes, 
epistaxis, and gum  bleeding are frequent and early complaints.  Bleeding can be brisk in the presence of 
accompanying physical lesions, as in gastritis and fungal infection of the lungs.  The most feared complication of 
thrombocytopenia is intracranial hemorrhage. Bacterial  and fungal infections in the setting of neutropenia are a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality, and most often the cause of death in refractory or untreated aplastic 
anemia.  
 
2.3 Management of SAA refractory to immunosuppression  
 
Up to 40% of patients will not respond to an initial course of immunosuppression with ATG and cyclosporine 
(CSA). A significant number of these can be salvaged by a second course with rabbit ATG/CSA. Our group has 
shown alemtuzimab  monotherapy to have equi valent efficacy in this setting and this may be desirable option in 
elderly patients who experienced toxicity with CSA10. In younger patients who have not responded to

13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) immunosuppression an unrelated donor stem cell transplant is the best long -term option. Those who do not have 
a high resolution genetic match should be considered for alternative donor regimens especially in the setting of 
severe neutropenia.  
 
The majority of patients achieve a hematological response with one or more courses of immunosuppres sion. 
However, a significant minority of SAA patients have persistent severe cytopenias, and in these patients a 
deficiency in stem cell numbers may explain failure to reconstitute adequate hematopoiesis despite adequate 
immunosup pression. These patients r epresent an unmet medical need with few options beyond supportive care 
with red cell and platelet transfusion available. Using a TPO -R agonist like eltrombopag to treat these patients is 
an alternative approach that has shown promise in a recent study from  our group38. 
 
2.4 Thrombopoietin and Hematopoiesis  
 
Thrombopoietin (TPO) was purified, identified and cloned by independent research groups in academia and 
industry in the mid1990s, based on its activity as the primary factor stimulating maturation of meg akaryocytes 
and platelet release, and its binding to the receptor c -mpl. TPO is a glycoprotein class 1 hematopoietic cytokine, 
produced primarily in the liver.   
 
A number of lines of evidence support a pleiotropic role for TPO in hematopoiesis, beyond fun ction as the primary 
endogenous factor controlling platelet production.  The c -mpl receptor is expressed and functional on primitive 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.11 Animals and patients with ge netic defects in either TPO or c -mpl have 
significant reduction in HSC numbers and activity, along with profound defects in platelet production.12,13In vitro  
expansion of functional an d phenotypic HSCs can be stimulated by TPO, either alone or in combination with 
other cytokines.14 
 
The control of TPO levels and TPO production in complex, and involves sensing of c -mpl receptor occup ancy, 
with levels generally inversely proportional to megakaryocyte mass.  In early studies performed in our Branch, 
we demonstrated that TPO levels were extremely high in SAA and surprisingly low to normal in chronic ITP, 
comparing patients with these two  conditions with equivalent platelet counts.15More recent studies also confirm 
TPO levels to be high in SAA and moderately elevated in myelodysplastic syndromes compared to normal 
controls.16 
 
A slightly modified form of recombinant TPO, termed megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF), 
was in clinical development by Amgen in the late 1990s. It clearly stimulated platelet production in vivo in heal thy 
control individuals and in chemotherapy patients, but its development came to a halt when several normal 
volunteers receiving MDGF prior to donating platelets developed neutralizing antibodies, which reacted not only 
to MDGF but also to endogenous TPO,  causing profound persistent thrombocytopenia.  
 
2.5 Eltrombopag  
 
Eltrombopag (SB -497115 -GR, Promacta®), the bis -monoethanolamine salt form, is an orally bioavailable, small 
molecule 2nd generation thrombopoietin receptor (TPO -R) agonist,  developed for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia by scientists at GlaxoSmithKline.17Studies conducted in vitro have shown that eltrombopag is 
an effective agonist binding to mpl, the TPO -R, to stimulate thrombopoiesis.   It binds mpl at a position distinct 
from the ligand binding site, within the juxtamembrane  domain of the receptor, and thus does not compete with 
TPO for binding to its receptor.18The differences in binding to the receptor may theoretically result in activation 
of different signaling pathways from native thrombopoietin, however, to date, data i ndicates similar impact on 
megakaryocytes and stem cells to thrombopoietin.19 
 
In vivo , eltrombopag increased platelet number in the chimpanzee (the only non -human species which is 
pharmacologica lly responsive to eltrombopag).19 These findings, coupled with supporting clinical efficacy data 
 
Page 9 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) in humans, suggested that eltrombopag is an orally active TPO -R agonist that functions in a similar manner to 
endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO).  Initial clinica l trials were carried out in normal volunteers, and then in 
patients with chronic ITP, based on their inappropriately low or low -normal levels of endogenous 
thrombopoietin.15  The initial phase I/II and randomized, controlled phase 3 registration trials in  chronic ITP were 
very encouraging, with little toxicity and much higher responses in comparison with placebo20-22, which led to its 
approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 20, 2008  in patients with chronic ITP who 
have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy.   Eltrombopag is the first 
oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved for adult patients with chronic ITP. Recent approval was 
granted for Hepatitis C associated thrombocytopenia.  
 
Longer follow -up in the EXTEND trial suggests that eltrombopag remains well tolerated (EXTEND Trial, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). On December 6, 2011 it was  announced that the FDA agreed to modify eltrombopag’s Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Services designed to assure safe use of the novel agent, and removed the requirement 
for healthcare professionals and institutions to enroll in the Promacta Care Program (Promacta® Package Insert, 
2011). Continued monitoring of adv erse events for eltrombopag will be monitored via post -marketing 
surveillance programs and ongoing clinical trials, rather than a formal prescriber enrollment program.  
 
2.5.1  Eltrombopag for refractory SAA  
Reasoning that eltrombopag  stimulated primitive hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors and as there was a 
clear deficit in HSC number and function in SAA, in 2009 we initiated a single -arm dose escalation phase I/II 
trial for SAA patients with refractory thrombocytopenia38. For p rotocol entry, all patients had to have severe 
thrombocytopenia following at least one prior regimen of immunosuppressive therapy for an original diagnosis 
of SAA. The primary endpoints were safety and clinically significant hematologic response. The study  design 
and response criteria are shown in Supplemental Figure 1  (Appendix B). 
 
At last analysis, 26 patients were enrolled in the protocol, of whom 25 received study drug. As shown in Table 1, 
this patient population had very prolonged and serious cytopenias before study entry. All were platelet 
transfusion -dependent, and most also r equired frequent red blood cell transfusions, and were severely neutropenic 
and thus susceptible to life -threatening infections. All had failed at least one prior cycle of high dose 
immunosuppression which was administered more than six months prior to stu dy entry, with the majority failing 
two and some as many as four prior cycles of immunosuppression.  The median time since last 
immunosuppression was 14 months, with a range of up to 117 months, excluding any chance that responses could 
be attributed to pr ior immunosuppressive therapy.

In all but one patient (in whom drug was discontinued at 125 mg/day due to possible cataracts , as described

severe adverse events (SAE), and all grade 2 and higher adverse events (AE) that were possibly, probably, or 
definitely attributed  to eltrombopag treatment are listed in Table 2.  There was one SAE that was possibly related 
to eltrombopag treatment: a patient with a history of diabetic gastroparesis was hospitalized for recurrent 
abdominal pain while taking eltrombopag.  There were n o grade 4 or 5 AEs.  One patient developed acute hepatitis 
B infection with a grade 3 elevation of his hepatic transaminases to greater than 6X the upper limit of normal 
while on study, so the drug was discontinued; however, the transaminase elevation was almost certainly related 
to acute infection with hepatitis B. He was taken off study, and with recovery from hepatitis B infection, serum 
transaminase values returned to baseline.

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) increase bone marrow reticulin deposition, although long -term follow up of patients in the ITP EXTEND study 
has not revealed any significantly increased reticulin in 113 patient marrows performed after up to 4.5 years on 
drug.23  We performed bone marrow biopsie s with reticulin staining at baseline and after three months of 
eltrombopag treatment to assess for fibrosis.  Patients on the extended access protocol underwent bone marrow 
biopsies with reticulin staining every six mo nths.  Reticulin deposition was grade d by a single hematopathologist 
in a blinded manner on a scale of 0 -4 according to standard guidelines.  Two patients refused to have the 12 -week 
response assessment bone marrow performed.  Among 23 patients assessed, there was no significant increase in 
reticulin staining either at three months, or on serial biopsies in patients on prolonged eltrombopag treatment 
(Supplemental Fig. 4  in Appendix B).  
 
There was initial concern that eltrombopag use could be associated with cataracts, based on preclinical an imal 
toxicology studies, and initial trials in patients with ITP incorporated screening for cataract formation, as did our 
prior study in patients with SAA. We performed ophthalmologic examinations to assess for cataracts at baseline, 
after three months on  eltrombopag, and every six months in patients on the extended access protocol. One patient 
was found to have possible new grade 2cataract prompting discontinuation of eltrombopag, but this finding was 
not confirmed on a second examination performed 2 mont hs later, or on subsequent serial eye examinations.  No 
other patients had new cataract formation or worsening of existing cataracts after treatment with eltrombopag.  
The concern over cataract formation has been mitigated by lack of evidence for any relat ionship to eltrombopag 
in the completed and ongoing eltrombopag randomized controlled trials, and prospective monitoring for cataract 
formation has not been required by the FDA for subsequent studies.  
 
Among 25 evaluable SAA patients , 11 (44%) achieved pr otocol -defined hematologic response after 12 weeks of 
eltrombopag treatment  (Supplemental Fig. 2, in Appendix B). Patients reaching a response at 12 weeks and 
maintaining it to 16 weeks were continued on an extension phase, and continued to receive eltromb opag 150 mg 
per day. All patients were platelet transfusion -dependent at the time of enrollment, and nine patients achieved 
platelet transfusion independence after eltrombopag treatment, with patients on the extension phase continuing to 
show a gradual inc rease in platelet counts over time (Supplemental Fig. 3A  in Appendix B).  Two patients 
achieved a hemoglobin response by 12 weeks, and 4 additional patients had improved hemoglobin levels on the 
extension phase (Supplemental Fig. 3B  in Appendix B), with a median hemoglobin increase of 3.6 g/dL (range 
1.5-8.2 g/dL).  Four patients who were previously dependent on packed red blood cell transfusions achieved 
transfusion independence and two were able to be phlebotomized to treat transfusional iron overload.  S even 
neutropenic patients had increased neutrophil counts after eltrombopag treatment (median increase 590K 
cells/ µL), including 4 patients who were severely neutropenic at baseline (Supplemental Fig. 3C  in Appendix B). 
It is notable that patients who reac hed response criteria and thus were continued on the drug continued to improve 
over time, suggest that some non -responders potentially could have achieved clinical improvement had the drug 
been given for more than 12 weeks.  
 
The patient with an unconfirmed finding of cataracts at 12 weeks achieved a platelet response, and he has 
maintained platelet transfusion independence for 19 months despite discontinuing eltrombopag.  This patient also 
improved his hemoglobin by 3g/dL, whi ch enabled him to undergo therapeutic phlebotomy to treat his 
transfusional iron overload. The events in this patient suggest that continued eltrombopag might not be required 
to maintain HSC recovery.  
 
Of the 11 responders, 7 were enrolled in the extensio n study.  With a median follow up of 33 months 4 patients 
had sufficiently robust counts ( platelets >50,000/ µL, Hb> 10 g/dL  in the absence of transfusions, and neutrophils 
> 1,000 for more than 8 weeks)  to allow discontinuation of drug. All have maintained their counts off eltrombopag 
to date, with time off drug between of 4 -6 months. Two patients remain on drug at full dose h aving not attained 
counts adequate to taper drug. One patient with a partial response became progressively cytopenic after 12 months 
on drug and went off study after cytogenetic and morphologic evidence of evolution to MDS was seen on bone 
marrow examinati on.

PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) Marrow biopsies were performed at study entry, at the 12 -week response assessment, and for responders at one 
year after study entry. Supplemental Figure 4 shows pre -treatment and one -year biopsies. There is striking 
normalization of cellularity in thr ee of four responders. There was no increase in reticulin on 12 -week biopsies in 
any patient, and no increase in fibrosis in follow -up marrows at 6 or 12 months in responders re maining on the 
extension phase.  
 
Of the 14 non -responders, two patients died of  disease progression, from complications of severe cytopenias.  
Two nonresponding patients showed morphologic changes and cytogenetic abnormalities (monosomy 7) 
consistent with progression to myelodysplasia; one patient ultimately died, and the other under went allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation. In addition , one non -responder in the unpublished cohort has subsequently developed 
trisomy 21. One other subject who was a non -responder in an independent ongoing study of eltrombopag for 
moderate aplastic anemia  study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was then eligible for the SAA study utilizing eltrombopag and 
ATG/CSA.  Three months after study entry she developed monosomy 7 with complex cytogenetics.  
 
In our cohort of over 400 patients with SAA followed long -term, approximately 15% progress to clonal disease 
including MDS and acute leukemia. Our experience also suggests that patients with long -standing severe 
refractory disease and who lack of a robust response to initial immunosuppression, as were enrolled on our 
protocol, are t he most likely to progress.  
 
Clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome is a serious complication of aplastic anemia. R ates are in the range 
of 10 -15% over 10 years 24. Such patients may go on to develop worsening of their disease or acute myeloid 
leuke mia. There is a theoretical concern that TPO -R agonists, being growth factors, may increase the risk for 
clonal evolution although across the clinical trials in ITP (n =493) no difference in the incidence of malignancies 
or haematological malignancies was demonstrated between placebo and eltrombopag treated patients. This is 
consistent with  recent basic research experiments, in which no malignant cell proliferation has been demonstrated 
upon co -incubation of eltrombopag with MDS cell lines, multiple leukemi c cell lines and solid tumor cell lines 
(colon, prostate, ovary and lung).  A randomized, double -blind, controlled trial of romiplostim, an alternative TPO 
analog, in patients with MDS, was recently stopped early due to DSMB concerns regarding a potentiall y higher 
rate of progression from MDS to AML in the romiplostim arm. However, longer -term follow -up and complete 
analysis of the patients enrolled in this trial was reported at the 2012 American Society of Hematology meeting, 
and now shown no greater risk of progression to AML in the romiplostim versus the control group.  Patients with 
low, intermediate and high risk MDS and thrombocytopenia are being studied in a number of trials of eltrombopag, 
and monitoring to date does not indicate concerns regarding a n unexpected rate of progression to AML.  
Refractory AML patients are being treated with eltrombopag as a single agent, and at least one patient with a poor 
prognosis cytogenetic abnormality (monosomy 7) has gone into a complete remission now for over nine  months 
on treatment with the drug 25. 
 
We cannot be certain that eltrombopag treatment does not contribute to progression to clonal marrow disorders, 
but as detailed above, results to date of treatment of MDS and even AML with eltrombopag or the alternati ve TPO 
mimetic romiplostin do not suggest that these drugs increase the risk of progression to more advanced disease 
even in patients that already have developed MDS or AML.  
 
2.5.2 Rationale for dose selection  
Eltrombopag  150 mg once daily has been selected as the starting dose for this study because this regimen has 
been safe and effective in increasing platelet counts in our recently -completed non -randomized, off label, phase 
II study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of eltrombopag as a si ngle agent in patients with refractory SAA.  Twenty -five ( 25) 
patients (age range 18 -77 years) received 50 mg daily of eltrombopag with dose escalation every two weeks to a 
maximum dose of 150 mg daily. Patients were successfully escalated to the 150 mg da ily dose without dose -
limiting toxicities. Hematologic responses were only observed while patients were receiving the 150 mg daily 
dosing. While it is possible that patients would have responded to lower doses of drug had the dose not been 
 
Page 13 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) escalated every two weeks, the lack of toxicity at the 150 mg/day dose in the prior study supports our rationale 
for utilizing this dose throughout the current trial, unless dose modifications based on toxicity or response criteria 
are required.  A starting dose of 75 mg once daily in East Asian and South East Asian patients will be used.  
Modified dosing for subjects of East Asian and South East Asian heritage (self -reported) has been implemented 
for the following reasons.  In healthy Japanese subjects, plasma eltrombopag  AUC (0-) was approximately 80% 
higher when compared to non -Japanese healthy subjects who were predominantly Caucasian.  Similarly, in 
patients with ITP, plasma eltrombopag exposure was approximately 70% higher in East Asian and South East 
Asian subjects a s compared to non –East Asian subjects who were predominantly Caucasian as higher drug 
exposure in East Asian and South East Asian subjects has been observed.  
 
There is preliminary safety data with doses over 150 mg/day. In healthy subjects, a clear dose an d exposure 
response was seen for eltrombopag doses of 10  mg to 200  mg once daily for 5 days, with geometric mean AUC 
(0-) values of 302  g/mL for the 200  mg once daily regimen 25. Eltrombopag  was well tolerated in healthy 
subjects at all dose levels. In a recently completed open label study for patients with soft tissue sarcomas 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), eltrombopag doses of up to 150 mg have been given in conjunction with chemotherapy, without 
significa nt side effects.  In several ongoing trials of eltrombopag in myelodysplasia, patients have been escalated 
to doses of 300 mg/day without dose -limiting adverse events26. 
 
The most extensive data on dosing and long -term side effects has been obtained in pat ients with chronic ITP. An 
initial randomized phase 2 trial, followed by two randomized phase 3 trials all showed efficacy for eltrombopag 
compared to placebo for increasing the platelet count utilizing doses of up to 75 mg per day.20-22 In ITP subjects, 
there was a dose response for eltrombopag 30  mg to 75  mg once daily, with geometric mean AUC (0-) values of 
169 g/mL for the 75  mg once daily regimen.  There was no significant difference between the safe ty profile of 
ITP subjects receiving 30, 50 or 75  mg of eltrombopag. A recent update of the EXTEND study reported on 302 
patients followed up to 5.5 years on eltrombopag therapy for chronic ITP, with a median exposure of 121 weeks 
and median dosing of 51.4  mg/day. Forty -three ( 43) patients (14%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events, 
including headaches, thromboembolic events, or hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities. An independent central 
pathology review of bone marrow biopsies did not reveal signi ficant increase in reticulin deposition.  
 
Thrombocytosis is a theoretical risk of eltrombopag treatment when high dosages are administered. However, 
thrombocytosis has not been observed in the 25 patients with refractory SAA who were treated with 150 mg p er 
day. Thrombocytosis has been observed in healthy volunteers as well as in subjects with ITP, and there was a 
suggestion of a higher risk of thrombosis in patients on eltrombopag compared to placebo in the phase III 
randomized trials for chronic ITP.22  However, patients with ITP, in contrast to patients with SAA, have hyper -
reactive platelets and an increased endogenous risk of thrombosis. In an extensive analysis of ITP patients treated 
long-term with rom iplostim, an alternative TPO mimetic, there was no evidence for increased thrombotic events 
in the romiplostim -treated patients compared to controls.27 In a meta -analysis of randomized trials using e ither 
eltrombopag or romiplostim, there was a numerically but non -statistically significant trend to increase the 
occurrence of thromboembolisms compared to controls.28 In the current trial, based o n concern regarding 
thrombosis, dose reductions of eltrombopag will be made if the platelet count reaches 200,000 per L or greater.  
 
2.5.3  Rationale for pediatric dose selection  
For pediatric subjects, there is a predicted higher weight -adjusted drug clea rance than older children and adults 
based upon studies of several drugs approved for use in children, such as anticonvulsants, proton pump inhibitors, 
theophylline, and HIV protease inhibitors, have routinely demonstrated that young children have higher w eight -
adjusted drug clearance than older children and adults [Lamictal Package Insert, 2007;Trileptal Package Insert, 
2007; Keppra Package Insert, 2008; Prilosec Package Insert, 2008; Kaletra Package Insert, 2007; Viracept 
Package Insert, 2007; Grygiel, 19 83]. In the ongoing open -label phase of PETIT, a phase II pediatric chronic ITP 
study, subjects between 1 and 5 years received 1.2 – 2.5 mg/kg eltrombopag once daily, while subjects between 
6 and 17 years of age received and average daily dose of 58.5 mg d aily ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The maximum dose 
 
Page 14 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) used in the PETIT trial among all age groups is 75 mg daily dose. Cohort 3 (ages 1 to 5 years) was opened for 
patient recruitment on 01 June 2011 and the initial group of 5 subjects has been enrolled. Preliminary data h ave 
been evaluated for an initial group of 5 subjects aged 1 to <6 years enrolled in Cohort 3 of PETIT.  These subjects 
initiated dosing with 0.7 mg/kg once daily and increased to at least 1.4 mg/kg once daily by the Week 12 visit.  
Preliminary PK data col lected for 3 subjects (ages ranging from 2 to 5 years) receiving eltrombopag 1.1 to 
1.2 mg/kg once daily at Week 6 suggest that this regimen delivers plasma eltrombopag exposure similar to a 37.5 
to 50 mg once daily regimen in adults.  No new pediatric spe cific safety signal has been identified thus far.  The 
available platelet count, safety, and PK data available for subjects enrolled in the PETIT trial support a starting 
dose of 2.5 mg/kg once daily for non -Asian subjects aged 2 -5 years.  
 
2.6 Rationale fo r Permitting Dose Interruption  
 
The effect of dose interruption is unknown in the aplastic anemia population.  Thirty -one percent (34 ITP subjects) 
on the long -term extension study (EXTEND Trial, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) had an interruption to eltrombopag dosing at 
some point in the study.  Of the s ubjects requiring a dose interruption, 7 had a dose interruption lasting 1 to 7 days 
and 27 had a dose interruption lasting greater than 7 days.  Platelet counts decreased back to baseline within 1 -2 
weeks, although not associated with any bleeding complic ations. However, the underlying pathophysiology of 
thrombocytopenia in ITP is very different from SAA, and eltrombopag is being utilized in that disorder to 
overproduce platelets in the bone marrow to compensate for increased antibody -mediated platelet des truction. In 
SAA we postulate an effect on HSCs in the bone marrow, and a much more prolonged effect from eltrombopag; 
therefore, our prediction would be that short or even longer term dose interruptions will not result in any sudden 
changes in blood count s. We would anticipate some patients on the current trial will be hospitalized for other 
disease -related issues such as fever and neutropenia and may require suspension  of the study drug temporarily.  
 
One patient in our recent trial of eltrombopag for refr actory SAA had drug discontinued before the three month 
time point, despite meeting criteria for response, because of possible cataracts noted on eye examination (later 
deemed to have been a normal lens examination on repeat testing).  His response continu ed, now for over 18 
months, with improvements in all three hematopoietic lineages despite no further eltrombopag treatment, 
suggesting that the effect of eltrombopag on HSC number or function is long -lasting and prolonged therapy may 
not be required in SAA .  The majority of patients on the extension phase of the prior SAA trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
have now been tapered completely off eltrombopag, based on meeting blood count criteria for tapering and then 
discontinuing the drug.  None have relapsed and required r e-initiation of eltrombopag.  
 
2.7 Rationale for extended access to study medication  
 
Eltrombopag is safe and relatively non -toxic with prolonged use. The EXTEND study (TRA105325), an open 
label dose modification extension study evaluating the safety and ef ficacy of extended therapy of eltrombopag in 
ITP subjects, has been designed to assess long -term effects of eltrombopag therapy. At the most recent analysis, 
the median average daily dose was 51.4 mg. The median duration of exposure to eltrombopag was 121 weeks 
(range 0.3 -285 weeks), with 253, 217, 176, 59 and 10 subjects treated for at least 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60 months, 
respectively.  Eltrombopag was well -tolerated, and both bleeding and clinically -significant bleeding decreased 
from baseline at all timep oints. AEs and SAEs occurred in 91% and 29% of patients respectively. The most 
frequent AEs were headache (27%), nasopharyngitis (24%) and upper respiratory tract infection (22%).  6% had 
thromboembolic events, including DVT, strokes, or myocardial infarct ions. Hepatobiliary abnormalities were seen 
in 12%, and most resolved while on treatment or after discontinuation. There was no significant increase in 
marrow reticulin in bone marrow biopsies obtained from 113 patients at time points up to 4.5 years on dr ug. ITP 
patients have return of their platelet counts to baseline within 1 -2 weeks of discontinuation of drug.  
 
We will continue treatment beyond the primary endpoint at 24 weeks in the current study, in patients responding 
to the drug until they reach bl ood count normalization sufficient for tapering as detailed below. Toxicity and 
efficacy data will continue to be collected during that time to help identify the secondary endpoints of duration of 
 
Page 15 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) response, progression to clonal hematopoiesis, and toxiciti es with extended duration of therapy.  
 
We hypothesize, based on interim results in patients on the extension phase of the prior trial that once 
hematopoietic stem and primitive progenitor cells are normalized in number by exposure to eltrombopag, this 
increase in number may be able to maintain more normal hematopoiesis without continued exposure to drug, or 
with exposure to lower doses of drug. We have written parameters to taper and discontinue eltrombopag in the 
extension studies targeting the lowest dos e or duration able to sustain blood counts in a safe and non -symptomatic 
range.  
 
In the first 25 patients treated, responses only began to be observed at the 3 month time point, and with continued 
exposure to drug, blood counts of all lineages improved tow ards the normal range gradually over time periods up 
to 31 months to date. Bone marrow cellularity began to normalize by 9 -15 months.  Maximal response was not 
reached at 6 months, therefore patients in the current trial may continue to improve their blood  counts during the 
extension phase of the study.  
 
2.8 Rationale for tapering eltrombopag during the extension protocol  
 
As discussed above, clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome is a serious complication of aplastic anemia, 
and given the theoretical concern that chronic stimulation with a growth factor might accelerate progression, the 
lowest dose and shortest exposu re able to improve cytopenias into a safe range would be th e goal for eltrombopag 
therapy.  
 
In our prior study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , we have been able to taper 4 of 7 responding patients on the extension study 
completely off eltrombopag, and 2 remain on the 150mg  dose. None have relapsed during the taper or after drug 
discontinuation. The only responding patient on the extension trial who lost response was the patient that 
developed clonal hematopoiesis, a new deletion 13q, and evidence for MDS on his bone marrow biopsy.  
 
In the analysis of the first 25 patients, two non -responding patients who failed to achieve a hematologic response 
developed clonal evolution to monosomy 7 and MDS after completing three months on the study; one died after 
progression to acute my eloid leukemia, and a second patient had HSCT.   Despite this incidence of progression 
being within our historical expected rate of evolution to clonal disease in patients with refractory SAA, we feel it 
is prudent to maintain responding patients in the ex tension study on the lowest dose of eltrombopag that will 
maintain stable improved blood counts. It is possible that once the drug expands hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells in vivo, further treatment with eltrombopag will not be required to maintain transfusion 
independence in these patients.  A single patient had drug stopped due to the erroneous diagnosis of a new cataract 
at week 9 of treatment; this patient continued to show a remarkable multi -lineage response, and maintains a platelet 
count in a safe range and a hemoglobin level high enough to permit therapeutic phlebotomy to address 
transfusional iron overload. The schedule for taper of drug is detailed in section 5.2.  
 
2.9 Scientific and clinical justification of the protocol  
 
There is no standa rd and clearly effective treatment available for SAA patients who are refractory to treatment 
with standard immunosuppressive therapy and are not eligible for HSCT.  Patients with persistent cytopenias are 
maintained on regular red cell and/or platelet tra nsfusions, and they are at risk of bleeding and serious 
infections. Eltrombopag may be an alternative approach in these patients as demonstrated by our phase II dose -
escalation study38. Eleven of 25 patients (44%) with refractory severe aplastic anemia ach ieved hematological 
response in at least one lineage following 12 weeks of dose escalation treatment, with minimal toxicity. Until 
drug was tapered, the median follow -up was 27 months on drug, with 7 responding patients continuing on drug 
in the extension phase of the protocol, and had continued normalization of blood counts and marrow cellularity.  
At most recent follow -up with a median of 27 months, 6 of 7 were transfusion -independent for platelets and red 
blood cells and had neutrophil counts of greater than 0.75k/µ L.  In these patients serial bone marrow biopsies 
 
Page 16 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) demonstrated near normalization of tri -lineage hematopoiesis and marrow cellularity, without increased fibrosis. 
One res ponding subject evolved to MDS.  
 
Data from this study has been informative  both in determining optimal dosing and the length of treatment required 
for hematological responses in patients with SAA refractory to ATG/CSA. All patients required and tolerated 
escalation to the highest planned dose of 150 mg. There was no increase in toxicity associated with higher doses. 
Several patients began to have detectable changes in transfusion requirements or marrow function by 12 weeks, 
but they had not achieved the protocol -defined response criteria by that time point and therefore had to di scontinue 
treatment. In retrospect, we hypothesize that additional patients may have attained a response if eltrombopag 
treatment had been extended for greater than 3 months. Responding patients who remained on drug during the 
extension study continued to show remarkable progressive improvement in their blood counts, including in 
lineages other than the platelet lineage.  We have tapered responding patients who have reached satisfactory blood 
count thresholds (platelets greater than 50,0 00; hemoglobin great er than 10g /dL, and neutrophils greater than 
1000/µL) off treatment, and of the 4 patients now completel y off drug, none have relapsed.  
 
Our hypothesis in the proposed study is that using a fixed dose of 150 mg/day and extending out the response 
assessment  to 6 months will increase the rate of response in this refractory group of patients with few treatment 
options. All patients would commence eltrombopag at a dose of 150mg per day (75mg in those of East and 
Southeast Asian ancestry due to lower drug cleara nce in this population).  The primary endpoint would be 
hematological response rate at 6 months. We believe these modifications would increase response rates 
appreciably and provide an alternative treatment option in this very di fficult to treat patient gr oup. 
 
The improvement in production of not only platelets but also neutrophils and red cells in some responding patients 
was encouraging and suggests that eltrombopag may be a treatment with significant potential benefit for patients 
with aplastic anemia.  We hy pothesize that the drug expanded the number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells, replenishing a marrow compartment depleted by prior immune attack, and allowing normalization of 
hematopoiesis. It suggests that immune attack in patients may not be on going, and that poor blood count recovery 
after immunosuppressive therapy may result from HSC depletion that is not endogenously corrected.  The 
proposed treatment schedule will potentially capture a greater number of responders. The slow cycling of HSCs 
may require more prolonged treatment with the drug in order to allow sufficient repopula tion of the marrow 
compartment.  
 
Patients with refractory SAA are at risk of progression to clonal marrow dysfunction, including MDS and 
leukemia.  Continued proliferati ve stress and inflammatory attack on a very limited number of remaining 
hematopoietic stem cells may predispose to clonal transformation due to telomere attrition, and oncogenic escape 
mutations . There is concern that chronic hyperstimulation with hematopo ietic cytokines could accelerate or 
promote clonal transformation. A retrospective Japanese study of 167 children showed that while those with severe 
aplastic anemia treated with G -CSF and immunosuppression evolved to MDS/AML, there were no evolutions in 
those children treated with immunosuppression alone29).  Another retrospective study by the European Group for 
Blood and Marrow Transplantation in 2006 showed a significantly higher hazard ratio of developing MDS/AML 
with the use of G -CSF in patients treate d with immunosuppression for severe aplastic anemia30.  However large 
prospective multi -institutional studies did not support this increased risk31,32. Eltrombopag is being investigated 
as therapy for both MDS and for acute myeloid leukemia, based on exper imental laboratory data suggesting that 
normal HSCs are stimulated relative to leukemic cells by this drug33.  Multiple ongoing trials have shown efficacy 
in improving platelet counts in some patients with MDS, and to date no evidence for an increased rate  of 
progression to AML.  One patient with monosomy 7AML has entered a complete and sustained remission of her 
leukemia with eltrombopag monotherapy25.  In our initial SAA trial, two non -responding patients developed new 
clonal abnormalities consistent with  progression to MDS (monosomy 7) following the 12 weeks of eltrombopag 
therapy.  One additional responding patient aged 68, who had the least robust improvement in counts of those on 
the extension study, developed new deletion 13 and dysplastic features an d came off drug.  These observations 
require longer follow -up and additional patients with SAA to be treated on a clinical protocol with careful follow -

PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) up in order to establish whether there may be increased risk of progression to clonal hematopoiesis in S AA patients 
treated with eltrombopag.  
 
Eltrombopag is available in 90 countries worldwide, and following the publication of our initial results, many 
patients apparently are being treated with the drug outside of clinical trials.  It is highly desirable to  rigorously 
establish the risk and benefit profile for this promising treatment in a formal research protocol setting.  
3 Study Design  
The study is designed as a non -randomized, Phase II, dose modification study of the oral TPO -R agonist 
eltrombopag in refractory severe aplastic anemia. The primary endpoint is measured at 24 weeks  (+/- 10 days) . 
Subjects who cannot tolerate the medication or fail to respond by 24 weeks  (+/- 10 days) will be taken off study 
drug. Drug dose during extended a ccess will be at the lowest dosage that maintains a stable platelet count until 
they meet off study criteria or the study is closed.

5. Treatment Plan  
 
5.1 Administration of study drug (eltrombopag)  
 
Note:  Currently sachets are not available, and the manufacturer is working on a new 
formulation.   However, information regarding the use of sachets for children 2 -5 years of age or older 
children unable to take pills is  no longer applicable, because the study di d not enroll any subjects that 
required use of the sachets.  
Subjects will initiate eltrombopag  at a starting daily dose as detailed below, according to age and ethnicity. 
Subjects above 12 years of age will receive the adult dose of 150 mg. Those between 6 and 11 will start at 75 mg, 
and children between 2 and 5 years of age will be started at 2.5 mg/kg (Table 3). To adjust for the higher expected 
exposure in children of East Asian and South East Asian ancestry, the starting dose for East Asian and South East 
Asian subjects between 12 and 17 years of age will be 75 mg once daily.  For East Asian and  South East Asian 
subjects between 6 and 11 years of age, the starting dose will be 37.5 mg once daily, and for children between 2 
and 5, the starting dose will be 1.25 mg/kg (Table 3). Each sachet contains eltrombopag  olamine equivalent to 20 
mg of eltrom bopag per gram of powder.  If a child’s dose is based on body weight and needs a dose of 23 mg, 
then dose only single sachet that provides 20 mg dose.  However, if the child needs a dose of 24 mg or greater, 
then the suggestion is to start using the second  sachet. This is mainly suggested to prevent the wastage of medicine 
by opening a second sachet to mee t the additional 1 -3 mg dose.  Dosing 20 mg where a patient needs 23 mg 
should not have a significant impact on PD response.

5.2 Dose adjustments of eltrombopag (See section 2.5)  
 
The daily dose of eltrombopag  will be decreased according to the following rules:  
 
 
Page 19 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) Platelet Count  Dose Adjustment or Response  
>200,000/µL (untransfused) at any time on study  Decrease dosage by 25mg every 2 weeks  
(+/- 3 days)  to lowest dosage that maintains 
platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL. In children 
under 12, the dose will be decreased by 
12.5 mg.  
>400,000/µL (untransfused) at any time on study  Discontinue eltrombopag fo r one week  (+/- 
3 days) , if platelets fall to <200,000/µL; 
restart at dosage decreased by 25 mg/day 
(or 12.5 mg in children under 12).  
 
5.3 Dose adjustments in extension protocol  
 
Once blood count recovery occurs such that  platelets >50,000/ µL and Hb> 10 g/dL  in the absence of 
transfusions, and neutrophils > 1,000 for more than 8 weeks, eltrombopag will be discontinued . If platelets drop 
to <30,000/ µL, Hb to <9g/dL, or ANC to <500/ µL then eltrombopag  can be re-initiated back to the most recent 
dose.  
 
Additiona lly, eltrombopag may be stopped if patients continue to meet criteria for response, but fail to show 
further clinically -significant improvement in their counts over a period of 6 months (stable disease). If after 
discontinuation of eltrombopag, any lineage  falls back below original study inclusion criteria values or if the 
patient again requires transfusions, eltrombopag will be reinstituted at the previously -effective dose.  
 
5.4 Dose delays, modifications or discontinuation for non -hematologic side effects  
 
5.4.1  Infection:  
Subjects who experience an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics will not have eltrombopag discontinued. 
If the subject experiences infection severe enough to require vasopressors or intubation, the drug will be withheld 
until the patient is stable.  
 
5.4.2  Liver function abnormalities:  
In the event of an increase in the ALT level to > 6 times the ULN, patients will return to clinic or have blood tests 
drawn by their home physician every 3 -4 days. If the ALT remains > 6 times the ULN on a second blood test, 
eltrombopag will be discontinue d until ALT is < 5 times the ULN.  Eltrombopag will be restarted at a dose level 
25 mg/day lower than the prior dose. If the toxicity appeared on a dose of 25 mg/day, eltrombopag will be 
discontinued permanently. If liver test abnormalities return to an AL T of > 6 times ULN on this reduced dose, 
eltrombopag will be permanently discontinued.  
 
5.5 Dose delays, modifications or discontinuation for hematologic side effects  
 
5.5.1  Thrombosis/Embolism:  
Subjects who experience a deep venous thrombosis or a pulmonary embolus, transient ischemic attack or stroke, 
or a myocardial infarction at any time while on eltrombopag will discontinue drug and go off study.  Patients with 
platelet counts of >50,000/ µL at the time of thrombosis will be treated with enoxaparin or another appropriate 
anticoagulant as clinically indicated until the platelet count drops below 20,000/ µL with discontinuation of 
eltrombopag. They will be treated for the thrombotic event as other wise clinically -indicated.  
 
5.5.2  Peripheral blood smear shows new morphological abnormalities:  
The presence of persistent morphologic abnormalities (red cell teardrop forms  or immature blasts ) or the 
development of significant sudden  worsening of cytopeni as while on study will require discontinuation of

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) eltrombopag and performance of a bone marrow examination to assess for development of abnormal fibrosis or 
progression to MDS or AML.  
 
5.6 Extended access to study drug  
Subjects who demonstrate response by protocol criteria at 24 weeks  (+/- 10 days)  may be consented for entry into 
the extended access cohort of the protocol .  Per dosing criteria given in section 5.3, patients may remain in the 
extended access cohort as long as they maintain a response . While on extended access, participants may have drug 
tapered , stopped, and/or re -started  as per section 5.3.  
 
5.7 Permitted supportive care  
• Transfusion supportive care (e.g., blood and platelets) as clinically indicated.  
• Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G -CSF, GM -CSF, or erythropoietin) as clinically indicated. 
Romiplostim (N -Plate) or IL -11 (Neumega) should not be administered.  
• Estrogens or combination oral contraceptives as indicated for uterine bleeding.  
• Prophylactic antibiotics and antivirals as clinically  indicated.  
 
5.8 Concurrent medications : 
 
Cyclosporine/magnesium:   Subjects who are on cyclosporine therapy at enrollment may remain on chronic 
cyclosporine therapy targeting a stable cyclosporine level as long as eltrombopag is administered 4 hours post a ny 
p.o. magnesium given to counteract mag nesium -wasting on cyclosporine.  
 
Rosuvastatin:  In vitro  studies demonstrated that eltrombopag  is not a substrate for the organic anion transporter 
polypeptide, OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter in vitro and as evidenced by increased plasma 
rosuvastatin levels when eltrombopag and rosuvastatin were co -administered in a clinical drug interaction study. 
When co -administered with eltrombopag, a reduced dose of rosuvastatin should be considered and careful 
monitoring should be undertaken. In clinical trials with eltrombopag, a dose reduction of rosuvastatin by 50% was 
recommended for co -administration of rosuvastatin and eltrombopag. Concomitant administration of eltrombopag 
and other OATP1B1 substrates should be undertaken with caution.  
 
Inhibitors of cytochrome p450:  In vitro  studies demonstrate that CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 are involved in the 
oxidative metabolism of eltrombopag. Trimethoprim, gemfibrozil, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine and other moderate 
or strong inhibitors of CYPs may therefore theoretically result enhanced activity of eltrombopag, however these 
interactions have not yet been established in clinical studies. Subjects on cyclosporine requiring prophylaxis 
against PCP should be given inhaled pentamidine instead of TMP/SULF.  NIH SAA patients are routinely placed 
on pent amidine instead of TMP/SULF for PCP prophylaxis to avoid potential marrow -suppressive effects of 
TMP/SULF anyway.  Other CYP inhibitors can be used concomitantly but with careful attention to possible 
increased elt rombopag activity and toxicity.  
 
Other med ications:  Subjects may continue on any of the medications that they were prescribed prior to study 
enrollment for co -morbid conditions, and standard anti -infectious prophylaxis medications including pentamidine, 
valacyclovir, and voriconazole  
 
5.9 Instruct ions to patients  
 
Timing in relation to food:  Subjects will be advised to take eltrombopag on an empty stomach (1 hour before 
or 2 hours after a meal).  
 
Timing in relation to antacids:  Because co -administration of eltrombopag with antacids decreased plasma  
AUC of eltrombopag by 70%, patients will be advised to take eltrombopag at least 4 hours apart from antacids

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) and other products containing polyvalent cations (i.e. aluminum, calcium, magnesium, iron, selenium and zinc) 
such as mineral supplements and dair y products.  
 
Vigorous activities:  Vigorous activities are to be avoided, as mild trauma could result in bleeding.  
 
6. Clinical Monitoring  
Samples will be ordered and tracked through CRIS.  Should a CRIS screen not be available, the NIH form 2803 -
1 will be completed and will accompany the specimen and be filed in the medical record.  
 
HRQL surveys will be offered to adult subjects who read English or Spanish.  The surveys will be mailed  to the 
subject if they are not required to return to the NIH CC for study evaluations. Any survey time -point that is missed 
due to the subject’s clinical status (e.g. critically ill) will be reported at time of continuing review.  
 
Lab tests not done in NI H will be faxed to the Research Nurse. The PI will review outside test results and they 
will be filed in as scanned versions in CRIS, and as hard copies  in the research charts. Case report forms will be 
used to record all lab data. All charts will be store d in a secure room.  
 
For the evaluation timeframes that describe the timing of tests/procedures below in the term of month(s), a 
month is defined as 30 days.  
 
Clinical Studies evaluating iron content:  Eltrombopag is structurally similar to clinically avai lable iron -
chelators and has been recently shown to reduce intracellular iron levels (Roth et al., July 12, 2012; Blood: 120 
(2). In an in vitro cell culture assay eltrombopag achieved higher iron removal rates (42.9%) when compared to 
known iron chelators  such as Desferrioxamine (22.7%), Deferiprone (19.3%) and Deferasirox (34.9%) 
(Vlachodimitropoulou Koumoutsea et al. ASH 2024). Aplastic anemia patients require frequent blood 
transfusions resulting in chronic iron overload.   In order to study eltrombopag ’s iron chelation and excretion 
capacities in a clinical relevant setting, we will collect urine samples before, during and after eltrombopag 
treatment  in selected patients. For example,  we will need to exclude patients currently on chelation therapy  from 
this pilot study . Furthermore, some of our non -local patients  may not stay long enough at the clinical center to 
complete a full 24 hour collection of urine. Serum iron panels (ferritin, transferrin, % saturation) will also be 
monitored  in the select ed subjects.  
 
6.1 Pre-study evaluation  
Pre-study evaluations to determine eligibility and b aseline status  may be performed under an IRB approved 
protocol (for instance the screening protocol 97 -H-0041, or studies such as bone marrows performed as follow -
up on another NHLBI treatment trial) or as part of this protocol. Patients will be evaluated at the NIH within 12 
weeks prior to signing consent. This evaluation includes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetics 
to determine eligibility, and the se results take up to two weeks to be reported. If a patient is not local, the labs 
listed below required to be performed within 7 days of signing consent can be performed by their home 
physician’s outside lab, and if they confirm continued eligibility, te lephone consent can be obtained. All time  
frames listed below in section6.1are relative to the day consent  is signed  for this protocol.  The source of the pre-
study and eligibility  data will be appropriately documented.  The pre -study evaluations will inclu de the 
following :

6.4 Off study assessment  
Patients with refractory aplastic anemia who fail to respond to eltrombopag after 6 months  (+/- 10 days)  of therapy 
or who are taken off treatment prior to the 6 months evaluation for any of the other reasons listed in section 8.6  
will likely choose  to pursue other treatments, including unrelated donor or cord blood transplantation, repeated 
cycles of immunosuppression, or experimental therapies. In our experience on the prior SAA eltrombopag  09-H-
0154  study, patients were not willing to return to the NIH for the specified  one month or six month evaluation and 
repeat bone marrow examination, unless they were being offered an additional  treatment protocol at the NIH.  
 
We will offer patients a follow -up evaluation at the NIH 6 months following being tak en off  eltrombopag  
treatment either  due to lack of response  or for the other reasons listed in section 8.6 , but this visit will not be 
required.  If they do not return to the NIH, we will contact their primary hematologist for information on their 
current hematologic status 6 months following their final dose of eltrombopag , and then take them off study.   
 
If patients do return to the NIH at 6 months (+/ - 30 days ) for the off study assessment , the following may be 
performed , and then the patient will be tak en off study:  
 
• History  and physical examination  
• CBC with differential  
• Acute care (Na, K, Cl, CO2, Creatinine, Glucose, and Urea Nitrogen), Mineral (Phosphorus, 
Magnesium, Albumin, and Calcium), Hepatic (Alk Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, and Dire ct 
Bilirubin), and Other (Total Protein, CK, Uric Acid, and LD H) panel  
• Reticulocyte count   
• Peripheral blood smear  
• Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood to quantitate GPI -negative cells

7. Ancillary Laboratory Research Studies  
 
Collection of samples  
 
Intended use:  During this study, 60 cc of blood (3 ml/kg not to exceed 60 ml of blood for pediatric subjects) at 
baseline and at landmark visits at 3, 6 and annually thereafter, and 5 cc of bone marrow aspirate ( at the baseline, 
3 month, 6 month, and 12 month  visits , and then at the annual visits thereafter) will be obtained for the following 
correlative laboratory research studies.  Baseline samples may be obtained under 04 -H-0012.  Additionally,  in 
selected patients  we will collect urine for 24 hours at each of the landmark visits.   These studies are not used in 
assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken as descriptive or exploratory ancillary studies. Some or all may 
be performed on each subject, and they may be correlated with response.  
 
• T cell recep tor V -beta profile in the marrow and peripheral blood  
• Extended peripheral blood flow cytometric  phenotyping for cell surface or intracellular proteins  
• Evaluation for the presence of abnormalities of the telomere repair complex including telomere length 
and genetic testing of genes associated with the telomere repair complex  
• Evaluation for the presence of abnormalities of genes associated with hematopoiesis, via genetic testing 
or gene expression analysis  
• Serum cytokine, chemokines and soluble receptor leve ls 
• Serum (or plasma) and cells for viral analyses  
• Hematopoietic progenitor colony, long term -culture -initiating cell, and immunodeficient mouse 
engraftment assays for primitive cell content and function  
• Pharmacokinetic studies of eltrombopag kinetics perfo rmed at PI’s discretion  
• 24 hour urine to investigate the influence of eltrombopag on iron metabolism and renal excretion.  
• In the event there is any extra sample, these will be stored with the subject’s permission for other 
exploratory laboratory research studies reviewed and approved by the IRB and listed in Appendix A. 
 
Storage:  Research samples will be stored coded in the secure laboratory of  Neal Young, MD .  
 
Tracking:  Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS Research Screens.  Should a CRIS  screen not 
be available, the NIH form 2803 -1 will be completed and will accompany the specimen and be filed in the medical 
record.  Specimens will be entered in the NHLBI Biospecimen Inventory System (BSI). Samples will not be sent 
outside the NIH without  IRB notification and an executed MTA.  
 
End of study procedures:  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific 
value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed.  
 
Loss or destruction of samples:  Should we become aware that a ma jor breech in our plan for tracking and 
storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
 
8. Biostatistical Considerations  
8.1 Objectives  
 
The primary objective  is to assess the efficacy of 6 months of eltrombopag  administration in improving bone 
marrow function in SAA patients with persistent severe cytopenias refractory to treatment with 
immunosuppressive treatment.  
 
Secondary objectives  include assessment of relapse or clonal evolution, pre -treatment characteri stics predicting 
response, and the impact of treatment and treatment response on quality of life.

8.2 Endpoints  
The primary endpoint  will be the proportion of drug responders as defined by changes in the platelet count and/or 
platelet transfusion requirem ents, hemoglobin levels, number of red blood cell transfusions, or neutrophil counts 
as measured by International Working Group criteria and the toxicity profile as measured using the CTCAE 
criteria. The primary endpoint will be assessed at six months. Pla telet treatment response is defined as platelet 
count increases to 20,000/µL above baseline at six months, or stable platelet counts with transfusion independence 
for a minimum of 8 consecutive weeks prior to response assessment.  Erythroid response for su bjects with a 
pretreatment hemoglobin of less than 9 g/dL will be defined as an increase in hemoglobin by > 1.5g/dL or a 
reduction in the units of PRBC transfusions by at least 50% during the eight consecutive weeks prior to response 
assessment  - compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 weeks.  Neutrophil response 
will be defined in those with a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <0.5 x 109/L as at least a 100% 
increase in ANC, or an ANC increase >0.5 x 109/L. 
 
Transfusion Units:   Single donor apheresis platelets have become the primary source of platelets in the US. 
Therefore, one transfused, single donor platelet apheresis product is considered 1 unit for protocol purposes. In 
the rare case that a patient recei ved pooled platelet products, each completed platelet transfusion (1 bag) 
independent of donor units pooled, will be counted as 1 unit transfused.  
 
Secondary endpoints  will include hematological responses at 3 months (a) hematological response at 3 and 12 
months and yearly thereafter; (b) relapse (c) clonal evolution to PNH, clonal chromosomal population in bone 
marrow, myelodysplasia by morphology, or acute leukemia; (d) survival and (e) health -related quality of life.  
 
8.3 Sample size  
In this cohort study  we are omitting the dose escalation and employing instead a fixed dose of 150mg. We are 
also extending the response assessment to 24 weeks. Based on our preliminary data, we expect the 24 -week 
response rate at this dose level to be at least 44%, and we hy pothesize that these modifications will improve 
outcomes. Thus, for this cohort, we would test the null hypothesis H0: p0=44% versus the alternative H1: p1≠44% 
at a two -sided significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Our goal is to detect a p1 -p0=20%  difference 
between the response rate. Using a two -sided binomial test 34we need a total sample size of N=49 to achieve the 
required power and significance level. The actual significance level achieved by this test is 0.0429, which requires 
that the popula tion response rate under the null hypothesis is 44%. Since this is a two -sided test, the null 
hypothesis H0 will be rejected if the number of patients who respond to the treatment is ≤14 or ≥29. Numerical 
calculation is calculated using the NCSS/PASS stati stical software package (Hintze, J. (2006), NCSS, PASS, and 
GESS. NCSS. Kaysville, Utah., www.ncss.com ). 
 
Subjects who are consented but do not start study drug may be replaced. In order to account for the potential need  
to replace a subject that signed consent, but did not start drug, up to 60 subjects may be consented.  
 
Subjects who have taken drug, but withdraw or are withdrawn from the study (e.g., toxicity, no response, or other 
reasons) before the 6 -month evaluation  will be assessed as intention to treat.  
 
8.4 Statistical methods  
The change of quality of life measure from baseline will be examined by the t -test or the Wilcoxon rank -sum test. 
The planned analyses will include descriptive statistics on the proportions of responses (i.e. % subjects with 
treatment response) and the tim e to response. The response probabilities will be estimated using the sample 
proportions and their inferences including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing will be evaluated using 
Binomial distributions.  
 
The time to responses and the progression -free survival will be analyzed using appropriate tools in survival 
analysis, such as cumulative incidence estimate, Kaplan -Meier curves, and Cox regression with age, gender and 
 
Page 27 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) ethnicity as covariates, which take consideration of both death without the eve nt of interest as a complete risk and 
random censoring due to loss of follow -up. The Kaplan -Meier estimates and Cox regression will be used to 
evaluate the treatment effects on the overall survival. Graphical tools will be used to display the appropriate 
estimates (i.e. estimated proportions, the cumulative incidence curves, Kaplan -Meier curves) and their 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Exploratory subgroup analysis will be use to compare the possible 
different response rates among male, female and different age categories.  
 
8.5 Stopping rules  
The study will be monitored to ensure that the occurrence of a specified set of treatment related serious adverse 
events (TRSAEs) that occur during the treatment period does not substantiall y exceed an anticipa ted rate.  The 
following specified TRSAEs determined to be probably or definitely related to eltrombopag will be considered 
for early stopping of the study:  
 
1. Death  
2. Any Grade IV toxicity excluding readily reversible metabolic or laboratory abnormalities  
3. Grade IV thrombosis/embolism  
 
We anticipate the rate of these specified TRSAEs within the 24 -week study period to be 20% or less. Following 
Geller et al. 35, our stopping rule is determined by a Bayesian approach. The stopping boundary for  an experiment 
is reached if the Bayesian posterior probability that the true probability of developing one or more of the specified 
TRSAE’s exceeds this benchmark rate of 20% is at least 90%. We take our prior distribution to be a beta 
distribution with p arameters (α, β) = (1.2, 4.8). The parameter are chosen so that the mean α / (α + β) = 0.2 as the 
expected proportion of specified TRSAE’s and the sum α + β = 6 as the “worth” we place on our prior clinical 
opinion. This indicates that the relative weight we place on our prior opinion is 6/41=15% of the weight we will 
place on the results of the new study.  Hence when we make decisions about stopping the study, the data from the 
study will dominate over the prior opinion.  Since we have seen in the past tha t the first few subjects to be accrued 
are possibly sicker than the rest of the subjects in the sample, we will start safety monitoring when 3 or more 
subjects have developed a TRSAE.  The following table summarizes the threshold numbers for stopping the s tudy.  
Number of  subjects 
in the experiment  Stop if the number of subjects who have 
developed any of the specified TRSAE’s 
reaches:  
≤ 5 3 
≤ 8 4 
≤ 12 5 
≤ 16 6 
≤ 20 7 
≤ 24 8 
≤ 28 9 
≤ 32 10 
≤36 11 
≤41 12 
≤ 45 13 
≤ 49 14 
 
We investigated the performance of the above stopping rule by simulation. In each run, we generated a study with 
49 independent Bernoulli trials, each had a probability p for having TRSAE and q=1 -p for not having TRSAE 
and compared the TRSAE outcomes with the  above stopping boundary to determine whether the study was 
stopped.  We repeated the simulation 100,000 times and computed the proportion of stopped studies (i.e. “number 
of stopped studies”/100,000) which were stopped using the above stopping rule.  The following table summarizes 
the proportions of stopped studies under a number of scenarios for p:  
 
Page 28 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC)  
Probability of TRSAE = p  0.10 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.40 
Proportion of Stopped Studies  1.6%  24.4%  50.7 %  76.7%  98.1%  
Average number of subjects  48.4  41.5  34.2  25.7  13.6 
Average number TRSAEs  4.8  8.3  8.5 7.7 5.5 
 
These results suggest that our stopping rule has a low probability of stopping a study when the proportion of 
specified TRSAE is below the benchmark value of 20%, and the probability of stopping a study is high when the 
true proportion of TRSAE exceeds this benchmark value. Based on these results, we believe that our Bayesian 
stopping rule has satisfactory statistical properties.  
 
8.6 Off study criteria  
Per subject choice:  Subjects may withdraw from study at their request.  The risks of withdrawing will be 
discussed, as will alternative treatment options.  Those subjects who choose to withdraw while taking eltrombopag 
will be strongly encouraged to conti nue to have labs monitored until he/she initiates alternative therapy.  
 
Per principal investigator decision: Should any of the following events occur during the study period, or in the 
extension treatment arm in responders, eltrombopag will be discontinued . The subject will be followed until 
resolution of the event.  For study purposes labs relevant to the adverse event  will be monitored for 30 days after 
discontinuation of eltrombopag. We will offer patients a follow -up evaluation at the NIH  6 months follo wing 
being taken off eltrombopag treatment either due to lack of response  or because they met other criteria for coming 
off study, but this visit will not be required.  If they do not return to the NIH, we will contact their primary 
hematologist for inform ation on their current hematologic status 6 months following their final dose of 
eltrombopag, and then take them off study. If a patient  initiates an alternative disease directed therapy at any time, 
the subject’s participation on this study will be consid ered complete and the subject will go off study.  
 
• Intolerance of eltrombopag not resolved by dose reduction  
• Life threatening acute hypersensitivity reaction  
• Thrombosis/embolism (DVT, PE, stroke or TIA, myocardial infarction) other than central line 
thrombo sis 
• Persistent hepatotoxicity as defined in section 5.3.2  
• New or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s) as defined in section 5.4.2  
• No treatment response by week 24  (+/- 7 days) . 
• Any Grade IV toxicity considered related to the study medicat ion excluding readily reversible metabolic 
or laboratory abnormalities or hematologic toxicities  
• Significant progression of disease or a concomitant condition that would make the subject ineligible for 
further protocol participation  
• Pregnancy or unwillingn ess to use acceptable forms of contraception  
• Initiation of non -protocol therapy for aplastic anemia  
• Evidence of clonal evolution to MDS defined as abnormal cytogenetics identified from bone marrow 
aspirate  
• Subject non -compliance  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Study co mpletion  
 
Once off study subjects will be referred back to the referring physician or consented to the Hematology Branch 
evaluation and treatment protocol (94 -H-0010) for consideration for standard therapy or evaluation for 
eligibility for another Branch p rotocol, depending on the best interest of the subject.

9.1 Safety monitoring  
 
Principal Investigator:  Accrual, efficacy and safety data will be monitored by the Principal Investigator, 
Cynthia E. Dunbar  
 
IRB:  Accrual and safety data will be monitored and reviewed annually by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
Prior to implementation of this study, the protocol and the proposed patient consent and assent forms will be 
reviewed and approved by the properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB) operating according to Title 
45 CFR 46.  This committee will also approve all amendments to the protocol o r informed consent, and conduct 
continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to ac crual or follow up of subjects.  
 
NHLBI Hematology DSMB : The NHLBI Hematology Data Safety and Monitoring Board will review the 
protocol at 6 to 12 month intervals  and the interval will be determined by DSMB .  A progress report will be 
forwarded to the DSMB at these times and their recommendations will be expeditiously implemented. The DSMB 
may recommend early termination of the study for considerations of safety and  efficacy.  
 
Monitoring : As per ICH -GCP 5.18 and 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be adequately monitored 
by the study sponsor.  The monitoring of this study will be conducted by an independent contract organization  
working under an agreem ent with NHLBI to monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate 
regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of 
signed informed consent form (ICF) and documentation of the  ICF process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify 
the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare 
abstracted information with individual subjects’ records and source documents (subject’s c harts, laboratory 
analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original subject 
information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance with the protocol. The monitors also will 
inspect the clinic al site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research 
Protections -OHRP) and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the 
investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and 
monitoring visit.  
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms and pertinent hospital or 
clinical records readily available for inspection by the local IRB, the site monitors, and the NHLBI staff for 
confirmation of the study data.

9.2 Event Characterization and Reporting  
Events include adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), protocol deviations (PD), unanticipated 
problems (UP), and non -compliance.  
 
The principal investigator will review all events (AEs, protocol deviations, UPs, SAEs) to determine the 
seriousness, expectedness, and reportability of the event.  As required and/or needed, the principal investigator 
will review the events with the Sponsor to make the final determination of seriousness and reportability.  
 
9.2.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (e .g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):   A serious adverse event that:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  
• results in in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity;  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Suspected adverse re action:  Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal re lationship between the drug and the adverse event. A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Serious event:  An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if it requires 
immediate corrective action by a PI and/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or rights of subjects.  
 
Unexpected adverse reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if 
an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the  
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events 
or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
 
Page 31 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC)  
Unanticipated Problem (UP):   Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
1. unexpected  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and  
b. the characteristics of the sub ject population being studied; and  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event:   An unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition 
of an adverse event, but which may, in the opinion of the investigator, involves risk to the subject, affect others 
in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  For example, report occurrences of 
breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted -for study drug.  
 
Protocol Deviation (PD):   Any change, divergence, or de parture from the IRB approved research protocol.  
 
Eltrombopag dose may be interrupted when clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator. These 
interruptions will not be reported as deviations; however, when the interruption is a consequence t o a serious 
adverse event, the interruption will be included in the SAE NIH Problem Report.  
 
Interruptions such as delays in request for medication refills or medication errors by subjects, unless they result 
in a serious adverse event or impact the integ rity of the research data, will not be reported as deviations to the 
IRB, but will be recorded in the medical record.  
 
Non-compliance:  The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory 
requirements for the protection of human research. Noncompliance may be further characterized as:  
 
1. Serious non -compliance: Non -compliance that:  
a. Increases risks,  or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP.  
d. Invalidates the study data.  
 
2. Continuing non -compliance: Non -compliance that is recurring. An example may be a pattern of non-
compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non -compliance will continue. Continuing 
noncompliance could also include a failure to respond to IRB requests to resolve previous allegations of non -
compliance.  
 
3. Minor (non -serious ) non -compliance: Non -compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.  
 
9.2.2  Adverse events  Management:  
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal non-hematologic  findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be recorded and followed until satisfactory resolution.  AEs will be attributed 
(unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely) to study medication and/or disease and graded by severi ty 
utilizing CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the criteria can be down -loaded from the CTEP home page at   
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
 
Non-hematologic a bnormal laboratory findings used to evaluate the safety of this protocol regimen will inclu de 
any change from laboratory assessments done prior to first dose of study medication that result in a progression 
 
Page 32 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) to a grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicity  or are characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
• If any abnormal  laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will provide details 
about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome . 
 
In view of the underlying illness,  refractory severe aplastic anemia, all patients will enter the study with 
abnormally low blood counts that would meet criteria as grade 3 or more commonly grade 4 toxicity, and 
requiring frequent platelet and/or red cell transfusions, and thus AEs regarding hematologic lab values including 
thrombocytopenia or platelet -transfusion dependence, anemia or red cell transfusion dependence, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, or leukopenia will not be evaluable. Thus we will collect hematologic laboratory values in the 
subject’s source documents, but will not re cord or report these as adverse events.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values recorded in the database will be recorded at the highest grade and resolved in the 
database when the value is a grade 2 or lower.  
 
Hypertension CTCAE v4 Grade 1 is not an applicable category for this study and therefore only hypertension 
greater than grade 2, that require medical intervention, will be documented . 
 
Unscheduled laboratory results or patient reports that have been sen t in addition to the pro tocol required ones 
will be reviewed for AE’s and if not qualifying for an AE Grade 3 or 4 will be recorded in CRIS but not in the 
studies database. Grade 3 or 4 AE qualifying information will be reported in the database.  
 
For all subjects enrolled in this  protocol, the current laboratory AE collection and reporting procedures are and 
have been used for all subjects.  
 
Thirty days after the last dose of study drug, adverse event collecting and reporting will be limited to serious 
adverse  events considered possibly, probably, or def initely related to study drug.  
 
Grading of Adverse Events:  
 
 
1  
Mild  Symptom barely noticeable to subject; does not influence performance or 
functioning.  Prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom 
but may be given because of personality of subject.  
 
2  
Moderate  Symptom of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities influenced; subject is able to continue in 
study; treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 
3  
Severe  Symptom causes severe discomfort.  May be of such severity that subject 
cannot continue.  Severity may cause cessation of treatment with test drug; 
treatment for symptom may be given and/or subject hospitalized.  
 
4  
Life-threatening  Symptom(s) place the patient at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
serious form, might have caused death.  
 
 
Attribution of Adverse Events:  
 
 
Page 33 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) Criteria for Determining Category of Relationship of Clinical Adverse Events to Treatment  
 
1  
Not related  This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes 
(disease, environment,  etc.).  
 
2  
Unlikely  
(must have 
two)  In general, this category can be considered applicable to those adverse events 
which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are 
judged to be unrelated to the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered 
unlikely if or when:  
1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the test drug.  
2. It could readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes o f therapy administered 
to the subject.  
3. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
4. It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
 
3  
Possibly  
(must have 
two)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the test drug 
administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An 
adverse event may be co nsidered possibly related if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug.  
2. It could not readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the subject.  
3. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
4  
Probably  
(must have 
three)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of 
certainty to be related to the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered 
probably related if or  when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy admini stered to the subject.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are 
important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists (e.g., 
bone marrow depres sion, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia).  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
5  
Definitely  
(must have 
all) This category applies to those adverse events which, the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to test drug.  An adverse event may be assigned an 
attribution of definitely related if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose with re -
exposure to drug.  (Note:  this is not to be construed as requiring 
re-exposure of the subject, however, a category of definitely related can 
 
Page 34 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) only be used when a recurrence is observed.)  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  Management  
Serious adverse events will be attributed as definitely (clearly related to the research), probably (likely related to 
the research), possibly (may be related to the research), unlikely (doubtfully related to the research) and 
unrelated (clearly not related to the research).  
 
Treatment related SAEs (TRSAEs) are those attributed as definitely, probably, or possibly related that will be 
monitored and considered for early stopping of the study according to statistically determined criteria.  These 
include death and any grade IV toxicity con sidered to be probably or definitely  related to study medication.  
 
Hospitalizations for administrative issues (to receive a transfusion) or upgrading to ICU for routine monitoring 
will not be reported as an SAE.  
 
9.2.4 Reporting events  
All events will be r eported to Principal Investigator of this study .

Reports of serious adverse events that are unexpected and thought to be related (possible, probably or definite ly 
attribution) to the experimental drug will also be forwarded no later than seve n days in the case of death or life -
threatening serious adverse events or within fifteen days after the occurrence of all other forms of serious adverse 
events to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). All SAEs will be included in the DSMB reports for 
review by the DSMB  at the time of scheduled DSMB meetings (DSMB meetings held 2 time s a calendar year and 
DSMB determines the frequency of protocol review per DSMB minutes) .  
 
9.2.4.4  Sponsor and FDA Event Reporting  
IND # : 104,877  
IND Representative : Cynthia E. Dunbar, MD, HB, NHLBI  
The PI will report SAEs to the Sponsor according to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.64(b) and as agreed upon 
with the sponsor. The Sponsor (or designee) will determine the reportability of the event to the FDA and IND 
safety report will be submitted to the FDA as required  as either a IND Safety Report or Annual report . 
IND Annual Report  
A summary of all SAEs, non -serious AEs, and other events will be recorded and submitted to the Sponsor and 
FDA in annual progress reports (21 CFR 312.64(b)).  Annual progress reports will be submitted within 60 days 
after the anniversary date of the IND.  
IND Safety Reports to the FDA (Refer to 21 CFR 312.32)  
The sponsor must notify the FDA in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from  clinical trials or any 
other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the 
information qualifies for reporting.  The sponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -
threatening s uspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  
15-day reporting  
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The  sponsor must 
report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event, such as:

9.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Novartis : 
All unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related SAEs occurring during the study or within 30 days of 
the last administration of eltrombopag will be reported to Novartis  within 24 hours of the research team learning 
of the event.  A copy of the SAE report will be forwarded as soon as possible, but no later than seven (7) days in 
the case of death or life -threatening serious adverse events or within fifteen (15) days after the  occurrence of all 
other forms of serious adverse events.  If the SAE is unexpected and determined possibly, probably or definitely 
related to study drug the SAE report  will be forwarded to Novartis .  Follow -up reports regarding the subject’s 
subsequent co urse will be submitted until the SAE has resolved or until the subject’s condition stabilizes (in the 
case of persistent impairment) or the subject dies.  The SAE report will contain a full written summary detailing 
relevant aspects of the adverse events i n question.  Where applicable, information from relevant hospital case 
records and autopsy reports will be included.  The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at 
the time of the initial report as described in ‘Assessment of Causality ’. 
 
9.4 Reporting of pregnancy  
Subjects who become pregnant during the study should discontinue the study immediately.  The investigator, or 
his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any subject who becomes pregnant while participating in 
this study.  The investigator, or his/her designee, will submit pregnancy information to Novartis  within two weeks 
of learning of a subject’s pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
Novartis .  Generally, follow -up wi ll be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination 
of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded and reported to Novartis  as an AE or SAE.A spontaneous 
abortion is always considered to be a n SAE and will be reported to Novartis .  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as 
a result of a post -study pregnancy and is considered reasonably related to the investigational product by the 
investigator, will be reported to Novartis .  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information 
in former study participants, he/she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) 9.5 Data management  
Data collection and distribution:   The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in-house 
password protected electronic system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness.  The principal 
investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist with the data 
management efforts.  All h uman subjects personally identifiable information (PII ), eligibility  and consent 
verification will be  recorded.  Primary data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure 
network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply wit h NIH security standards.  Primary and final 
analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject 
participant . 
 
Novartis  will receive quarterly accrual and toxicity information as detailed in the CTA.  In order to maintain 
patient confidentiality, all communications relating to the study will identify participants by assigned subject study 
numbers.  No personally identifiab le information will be sent to Novartis .  In accordance with local and federal 
regulations, the Investigator will allow Novartis  personnel or their designee, access to all pertinent medical records 
in order to verify the data gathered and to aud it the data  collection process.  
 
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may also request access to all study records, including source 
documentation for inspection  
 
End of study procedures:   Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected databa se until it is 
no longer of scientific value.  
 
Loss or destruction of data:   Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect subject 
confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
 
Data will not be distributed out side NIH without IRB notification and an executed MTA or CTA.  
 
Publication policy:  Given the research mandate of the NIH, patient data including the results of testing and 
responses to treatment will be entered into an NIH -authorized and controlled researc h database. Any future 
research use will occur only after appropriate human subject protection institutional approval such as prospective 
NIH IRB review and approval or an exemption from the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research  Protection  
(OHSR P). 
10 Huma n Subject Protection  
10.1 Rationale for subject selection  
The study will be open to all subjects who satisfy the inclusion criteria and provide an informed consent to the 
protocol. No subjects will be excluded from participation based  on gender, race or et hnicity.  
 
Epidemiologic studies suggest that an estimated 2 -4 cases/million population of aplastic anemia will be diagnosed 
each year. The study will be open to all subjects who satisfy the inclusion criteria and provide an informed consent 
to the protocol . No subjects will be excluded from participation based on gender , race or ethnicity.  
 
This study will be open to all patients who fit the inclusion criteria and provide informed consent to protocol 
participation.  Epidemiologic studies suggest that the ge nder will be approximately evenly split between male and 
females, and that 90% of the patients will be Caucasian.  However,  previous experience at our institution suggests 
that distribution will be:  
 
by gender:  60% males and 40% females;  
by race/ethnicity:  approximately 55% White, 15% Black, 6% Asian and 24% Hispanic;  
 
Page 38 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) by age:  will range between 2 and 82 (median age of 30) and roughly 20% of patients will be under the 
age of 18.  
 
For subjects of Asian ethnicity:   Plasma eltrombopag area under the curve was approximately 70% higher in 
East and South East Asian (ethnicity self -reported) subjects as compared to non -Asian subjects who were 
predominantly Caucasian. Therefore , subjects of Asian heritage will be included  but they will be initiated at a 
lower dose and monitored closely as described in the treatment plan.  
 
For subjects with renal impairment:   The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied in adult patients 
with renal impairment. Following administrat ion of a single 50 mg dose, there was a trend for reduced plasma 
eltrombopag exposure in patients with renal impairment, but there was substantial variability and significant 
overlap in exposures between patients with renal impairment and healthy volunteer s.  Therefore , patients with 
impaired renal function will be included and given the protocol -defined dosages, but participation will be 
monitored closely.  
 
For subjects with hepatic impairment:   Pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied in adult pat ients 
with hepatic impairment. Following the administration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0 -∞ of eltrombopag was 
increased by 41% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and by 80% to 90% in subjects with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment compared wi th healthy volunteers. Therefore , patients with minimally impaired hepatic 
function will be included but participation will be monitored closely. Patients with baseline moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment will be excluded from the study.  
 
Recruitment eff orts:  The study will be listed on the clinicaltrials.gov, Clinical Center research studies, the 
Aplastic Anemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome International Foundation, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute patient recruitment websites.  If recruitmen t goals are not met, a recruitment plan will be developed by 
the Clinical Center Office of Patient Recruitment. Hematologists and oncologists throughout the country will be 
informed about the protocol by letter.  Because many aplastic anemia patients may r espond to initial 
immunosuppressive treatment with a response that is sufficient to prevent serious infections, but have persistent 
thrombocytopenia, we will also be able to rapidly recruit study patients who have completed other trials for 
aplastic anemia  therapy within the  Branch.  
 
Reimbursement for protocol participation, travel, food, and lodging  will be consistent with  
NHLBI DIR Travel and Lodging Compensation of Clinical Research Subjects policy or  
institutional guidelines .   
 
Competition between Branch protocols:   There are no competing Branch protocols for this patient population.   
The ability to offer patients who fail to have an optimal response to initial intensive immunosuppression protocols 
another option will be a very positive add ition to our aplastic anemia program.  
 
10.2 Participation of pediatric patients  
Aplastic anemia with severe thrombocytopenia is seen in children, and 15% of all severe aplastic anemia patients 
referred  to the NIH for protocol participation are <18. In the combination immunosuppression with Eltrombopag 
study (12 -H-0150), headed by Dr.  Danielle Townsley, pediatric patients are included and we propose enrolling 
patients 2 and older with an identical dosing schedule.  
 
10.3 Risks and Discomforts:

Boxed warnings related to Promacta® (eltrombopag):  
Potential Serious Adverse Effects:

WARNING: RISK FOR HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC 
HEPATITIS C  
RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY  
 
See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may 
increase the risk of hepatic decompensation.  
 
PROMACTA may increase the risk of severe and potentially life -threatening hepatotoxicity. 
Monitor hepatic function and discontinue dosing as recommended.  
 
Warnings and Precautions : 
 
Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C  
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may increase the 
risk of hepatic decompensation. In two contro lled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and 
thrombocytopenia, ascites and encephalopathy occurred more frequently on the arm receiving treatment with 
PROMACTA plus antivirals (7%) than the placebo plus antivirals arm (4%). Patients with l ow albumin levels 
(less than 3.5 g/dL) or Model for End -Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score greater than or equal to 10 at baseline 
had a greater risk for hepatic decompensation on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals. 
Discontinue PROMACT A if antiviral therapy is discontinued.  
 
Hepatotoxicity  
PROMACTA may increase the risk of severe and potentially life -threatening hepatotoxicity. Measure serum ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of PROMACTA, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustmen t phase, and 
monthly following establishment of a stable dose. PROMACTA inhibits UDP -glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT)1A1 and organic anion -transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which may lead to indirect 
hyperbilirubinemia. If bilirubin is elevated, perform fra ctionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat 
testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are confirmed, monitor serum liver tests weekly until resolved or 
stabilized. Discontinue PROMACTA if ALT levels increase to greater than or equal to 3 x ULN in patients with 
normal liver function or greater than or equal to 3 x baseline (or greater than 5 x ULN, whichever is the lower) in 
patients with pre -treatment elevations in transaminases and are:  
• progressively increasing, or  
• persistent for gre ater than or equal to 4 weeks, or  
• accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or  
• accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation.  
 
If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with PROMACTA is considered to outweigh the risk for 
hepatotoxicity, then consider cautiously reintroducing PROMACTA and measure serum liver tests weekly during 
the dose adjustment phase. Hepatotoxicity may reoccur if PROMACTA is reinitiated. If liver test abnormalities 
persist, worsen, or recur, then permanently discontinue PROMACTA.  
 
Isolated cases of severe liver injury were identified in clinical trials. The elevation of liver laboratory values 
occurred approximately three months after initiation of PROMACTA. In all cas es, the event resolved following 
PROMACTA discontinuation.  
 
Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications  
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with PROMACTA. 
Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications include d both venous and arterial events and were observed 
at low and at normal platelet counts.  
 
Page 40 of 65 
13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC)  
Consider the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolism when administering PROMACTA to patients 
with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V L eiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid 
syndrome, chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use 
PROMACTA in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve a nd 
maintain target platelet counts.  
 
In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, 3% (31/955) treated 
with PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic event compared with 1% (5/484) on placebo. The majority of events 
were of the portal venous system (1% in patients treated with PROMACTA versus less than 1% for placebo).  
 
In a controlled trial in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia not related to ITP undergoing 
elective invasive procedures (N = 292),  the risk of thrombotic events was increased in patients treated with 75 mg 
of PROMACTA once daily. Seven thrombotic complications (six patients) were reported in the group that 
received PROMACTA and three thrombotic complications were reported in the plac ebo group (two patients). All 
of the thrombotic complications reported in the group that received PROMACTA were portal vein thrombosis 
(PVT). Symptoms of PVT included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Five of the six patients in the 
group tha t received PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment 
with PROMACTA and at a platelet count above 200 x 109/L. The risk of portal venous thrombosis was increased 
in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver dis ease treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily for 2 
weeks in preparation for invasive procedures.  
 
Cataracts  
In the three controlled clinical trials in adults with chronic ITP, cataracts developed or worsened in 15 (7%) 
patients who received 50 mg of PROM ACTA daily and 8 (7%) placebo -group patients. In the extension trial, 
cataracts developed or worsened in 11% of patients who underwent ocular examination prior to therapy with 
PROMACTA. In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatit is C and thrombocytopenia, 
cataracts developed or worsened in 8% of patients treated with PROMACTA and 5% of patients treated with 
placebo.  
 
Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents. Perform a baseline ocular examination 
prior to administration of PROMACTA and, during therapy with PROMACTA, regularly monitor patients for 
signs and symptoms of cataracts.  
 
Clinical Experience:  
For full information on clinical experience with eltrombopag in for the treatment of all approved indic ations, see 
PACKAGE INSERT.  
 
Severe Aplastic Anemia:  In the single -arm, open -label trial, 43 patients with severe aplastic anemia received 
PROMACTA. Eleven patients (26%) were treated for greater than 6 months and 7 patients (16%) were treated for 
greater than 1 year. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were nausea, fatigue,  
cough, diarrhea, and headache.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category C  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of eltrombopag use in pregnancy. In animal reproduction and 
developmental t oxicity studies, there was evidence of embryo lethality and reduced fetal weights at maternally 
toxic doses. PROMACTA should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.  
 
In an early embryonic development study, female rats received oral eltrombopag at doses of 10, 20, or 60 
mg/kg/day (0.8, 2, and 6 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 
75 mg/day and 0.3, 1, and 3 times, respectively, the human cli nical exposure based on AUC in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Increased pre - and post -implantation loss and reduced fetal weight were 
observed at the highest dose which also caused maternal toxicity.  
 
Eltrombopag  was administered orally to pregnant rats at 10, 20, or 60 mg/kg/day (0.8, 2, and 6 times, respectively, 
the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 mg/day and 0.3, 1, and 3 times, respectively, 
the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Decreased fetal 
weights (6% to 7%) and a slight increase in the presence of cervical ribs were observed at the highest dose which 
also caused maternal toxicity. However, no evidence of major structur al malformations was observed.  
 
Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral eltrombopag doses of 30, 80, or 150 mg/kg/day (0.04, 0.3, and 0.5 times, 
respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 mg/day and 0.02, 0.1, and 0.3  
times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). 
No evidence of fetotoxicity, embryo lethality, or teratogenicity was observed.  
 
In a pre - and post -natal developmental toxicity study in pre gnant rats (F0), no adverse effects on maternal 
reproductive function or on the development of the offspring (F1) were observed at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (2 
times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with ITP at 75 mg/day and similar to t he human 
clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with chronic hepatitis C at 100 mg/day). Eltrombopag was detected 
in the plasma of offspring (F1). The plasma concentrations in pups increased with dose following administration

Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether eltrombopag is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk 
and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from PROMACTA, a decision should 
be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue PROMACTA taking into account the importance of 
PROMACTA to the mother.  
 
Pediatric Use  
The safety and efficacy of PROMACTA in pediatric patients 1 year and older with chronic ITP were evaluated in 
two double -blind, plac ebo-controlled trials. The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been evaluated in 168 
pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP dosed once daily. The safety and efficacy of PROMACTA in pediatric 
patients younger than 1 year with ITP have not yet been es tablished.  
 
The safety and efficacy of PROMACTA in pediatric patients with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic 
hepatitis C and severe aplastic anemia have not been established.  
 
Severe cutaneous reaction  
There is a risk that subject may develop a seve re cutaneous reaction that may require hospitalization and 
discontinuation of eltrombopag.

PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) Very common: Leukocytosis**, white blood cell count increased  
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Very common: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain  
General disorders and administrative conditions  
Very common: Fatigue, pyrexia  
Hepatobiliary disorders  
Uncommon: Drug -induced liver injury  
Investigations  
Rare: Serum discoloration***  
Nervous systems disorders  
Very common: Dizziness, Headache  
Respiratory, thoracic and mediast inal disorders  
Very common: Cough  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
Common: Skin discoloration  
Vascular disorders  
Very common: Hematoma  
** Leukocytosis and white blood cell count increased occur individually with a frequency of common, however the terms were 
grouped as they represent the same medical concept, giving a revised frequency of very common.  
*** Serum discoloration has been reported in investigator sponsored studies in MDS/AML, and can lead to analytical 
interference with some colorimetric analytical methods  
 
10.3.2 Related to pregnancy and nursing mothers:  
 
The effects of eltrombopag  on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because it is unknown 
whether eltrombopag is teratogenic, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception 
prior to (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstin ence) and for the duration of study participation.  If a 
woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while on study, the research team must be informed 
immediately.  Study drug will be discontinued and the pregnancy followed and outcome reported.  
 
10.3.3  Related to bone marrow aspirate and biopsy:   No major risks are involved with bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy. However, a small risk of infections, pain, bleeding, and hematoma formation at the site of the 
aspiration exists with the procedure.  
 
10.3. 4 Related to blood draws:  No major risks are involved with blood draws. Minor complications including 
bleeding, pain, and hematoma formation at the site of blood draws.  Infections may rarely occur.  
 
10.3.5 Related to HRQL : The only anticipated adverse con sequences associated with the HRQL  will be the 
time required for the participants to complete the questionnaire.  
 
10.4 Risks in Relation to Benefit  
 
10.4.1  For adult subjects:  
The benefits to the patients could be improvement of thrombocytopenia (increased platelet count) and/or reduction 
or even abolition of platelet transfusion requirements, resulting in improved quality of life and also decreased 
morbidity and mortality from transfusion -associated viral agents, and/or a suscept ibility to infections.  Potentially, 
treatment with other more toxic therapies could also be avoided or postponed.  
 
Therefore, this research involves greater than minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 CFR 
46.102).

10.4.2  For chi ldren:  
The inclusion of children satisfies the criteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46, Subpart D: 46.405 
as follows:  
 
 (a) the risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects: We are offering pediatric subjects, with a probabl y 
lethal hematological disease, an alternative to symptomatic therapy.  
 
(b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by 
available alternative approaches. The benefits to the patients cou ld be reduction or even abolition of transfusion 
requirements and/or improvement of low peripheral blood counts, resulting in improved quality of life and also 
decreased morbidity and mortality from transfusion -associated viral agents, iron overload, and/o r a susceptibility 
to infections.  Potentially, treatment with other more toxic therapies could also be avoided or postponed.  
 
(c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their parents or 
guardians, as set forth in 46.408.  
 
Therefore, participation of pediatric subjects on this protocol involves greater than minimal risk but presents the 
prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects (45 CFR 46.405).  
 
10.5 Informed Consent Processes and Procedures  
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their 
attendant risks and discomforts and benefits, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the 
patient during the initial clinic evaluation. The PI, Dr. Dunbar or an associate investigator on this protocol with 
an “*” beside their name on the cover page  will lead this discussion and obtain the informed consent. The consent 
form will be signed in the presence of the investigat or and a witness prior to commencement of the treatment plan. 
The treatment plan and risks will be discussed again and in detail during their hospital visit for t reatment.  
 
If it is anticipated that a potential research participant previously enrolled in t he screening protocol may not be 
able to be physically present at the NIH at the time of consent into this protocol, we will use the following 
telephone consent process:  
• Ideally, a copy of the consent document will be provided at the time of screening so in the event the 
subject is found eligible, there is sufficient time to make an informed decision or come up with questions 
to bring up during the telephone consent process.  
• Informed consent will be obtained by Dr. Dunbar or any associated inv estigators indicated by * on page 
1. If not already done, a copy of the consent document will be sent to the potential subject via telefax or 
e-mail or the U.S. Postal Service, if ‘fax & e -mail options are not available.  
• Either the PI or the potential sub ject may initiate the call for discussion of the study after a reasonable 
amount of time is given to participants to review the consent document prior to telephone consent.  A 
conference call is recommended and both parties will properly identify themselve s and the purpose of the 
telephone call followed by a thorough explanation of the protocol by the investigator with ample time for 
questions related to participation.  
• The potential subject will be instructed to sign and date the consent document along wit h the signature of 
an adult witness during the conference call.  
• The original signed informed consent document may be faxed back (301 -594-1290 ) or e -mailed to the PI 
followed by delivery of the original signed document via the US Postal Service or FedEx to Cynthia E. 
Dunbar , Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Building 10, Room CRC 4-5132 , Rockville Pike, Bethesda, 
MD, 20892.  
• The telephone informed consent process will be documented in the progress note by the investigator 
obtaining consent and a copy of the not e and the original fully signed consent document will be filed in

13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) the subject’s medical records with a copy provided to the subject.  
 
If at any time during participation in the protocol new information becomes available relating to risks, adverse 
events, o r toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to each enrolled or prospective patient.  
Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the informed consent amended to reflect relevant 
information.  
 
If the subject is a min or, the parent who signs the consent for the minor must be a legally authorized parent  or 
guardian.  Where deemed appropriate by the clinician, and the child's parent or guardian, the child will also be 
included in all discussions about the trial and a minor's assent will be obtained.   The parent or guardian will sign 
on the designated lin e on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child had given assent. If the minor 
subject is a female of childbearing age, she will be informed about pregnancy testing and will be told that if her 
pregnancy test is positive, we will counsel her  and help her tell her parents or we will tell her parents. Is she does 
not agree she will be advised not to sign the assent.  
 
When a pediatric subject reaches age 18, continued participation will require re -consenting of the now adult 
with the standard pr otocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed consent has been obtained . 
Should sample or data analysis continue following completion of active participation and the subject has 
reached 18 years of age, we will attempt to contact the subject  using the last known contact information to 
obtain consent for continued use of data or samples collected  during their prior visit. Given the length of time 
that may have transpired for some of the subjects since their last visit for this study, we reques t waiver of 
informed consent for those individuals who after good faith efforts, we are unable to contact.  
 
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d), each of which must be addressed in 
relation to the protocol:  
 
(1) The research inv olves no more than minimal risk to the subjects  
a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves  no additional risks to subjects.  
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects  
a.   Samples and data will be kept  in secure locations in the laboratory of Dr. Young. 
Retention of samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects.  
(3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration  
a. Considering the length of time between a minor’s enrollment and their age of majority, it is 
possible that more than a few subjects may be lost to follow up.  A significant reduction in 
the number of samples analyzed could impact the quality of the researc h.  
(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.  
a. We only plan to request a waiver of reconsent for those subjects who have been lost to 
follow -up. 
 
If at any time during participation in the  protocol, new information becomes available relating to risks, adverse 
events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to each enrolled or prospective patient.  
Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the i nformed consent amended to reflect relevant 
information.  
 
Non-English -speaking research participants:  We anticipate enrolling non -English speaking research participants 
into this study.  The IRB approved full consent document will be translated into the s ubject's native language in 
accordance with the Clinical MAS Policy M77 -2.  If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant 
for which there is no translated extant IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator and or those 
author ized to obtain informed consent will use a short form oral consent process as described in MAS Policy M77 -
2, 45CFR46.117(b)(2) and 21CFR50.27(b)(a).  The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant

13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) IRB approved consent document.  
 
We requ est prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form for up to a maximum of 5 participants per 
language and we will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the use of the Short 
Form.  Should we reach the threshold of 5  per language , we will notify the IRB of the need for an additional use 
of the Short Form and that we will have that consent document translated into the given inherent language.  
10.6 Conflict of Interest  
The Principal Investigator assured that each associate i nvestigator listed on the protocol title page received a copy 
of the NIH’s Guide to preventing conflict of interest.  Investigators added subsequent to the initial circulation 
were provided a copy of the document when they were added. Copies of the Conflic t of Interest Statement were 
forwarded to FDA and to the NHLBI Clinical Director.  
 
10.7 FWA Coverage Agreement  
Dr. Winkler is currently working at Agios Pharmaceutical and will be analyzing identifiable data as a  Non-NIH, 
Non-Enrolling  Engaged  Investigator in this protocol.   Dr. Winkler’s role in the research will be limited to data 
analysis. An FWA coverage agreement to cover this activity has been  executed by Dr. Winkler and Dr. Young .  
11 Pharmaceuticals  
 
11.1 Eltrombopag (Promacta®):  
will be supplied by Novartis   
 
Chemical Name: The chemical name for eltrombopag  olamine is 3' -{(2Z) -2-[1-(3,4-dimethylphenyl) -3-
methyl -5-oxo-1,5-dihydro -4H-pyrazol -4-ylidene]hydrazino} -2'-hydroxy -3-biphenylcarboxylic acid - 2-
aminoethanol (1:2).  
 
Molecula r formula :   C25H22N4O4.2(C2H7NO).  
 
Molecular weight  is 564.65 for eltrombopag  olamine and 442.5 for eltrombopag free acid.  
 
Chemical and structural formula:  
 
Physical form:  red/brown solid.  
 
Solubility:  Eltrombopag  olamine is practically insoluble in aqueous buffer across a pH range of 1 to 
7.4, and is sparingly soluble in water.  
 
Supply:  The drug Novartis  is providing for this study may be either investigational or commercial 
material , based on their supply .  The tablets are available as 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 mg tablets.   
• Tablets:   White, round, film -coated tablets without debossing are provided, containing 
eltrombopag olamine equivalent to 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg of eltrombopag free acid.

13-H-0133  
PI: Cynthia E. Dunbar, M.D.  
Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) Placebos to ma tch the active tablets are available. Tablets are packaged in white HDPE bottles 
with white plastic, induction -seal, child -resistant caps.  
 
Green, oval, film -coated tablets debossed with ‘SLC’ on one side are provided, containing 
eltrombopag olamine equiva lent to 200 mg or 300 mg of eltrombopag free acid. A placebo to 
match the active tablets is available. Tablets are packaged in white HDPE bottles with white 
plastic, induction -seal, child -resistant caps. Desiccant may be included.  
 
Commercial image actives  (12.5 mg - white, 25 mg - orange or white, 50 mg blue or brown, 75 
mg – pink, 200 mg – brown and 300 mg - blue) which are equivalent to the clinical forms with 
the exception of the film coated color may also be provided for clinical use. These forms are al so 
packed in white HDPE bottles with white plastic, induction -seal, child -resistant caps. Desiccant 
may be included. Additionally, the commercial image tablets may be provided in aluminum foil 
blister packages.  
 
• Powder for Oral Suspension  (Sachets) : 
 
Note : Currently sachets are not available, and the manufacturer is working on a new 
formulation.   However, information regarding the use of sachets for children 2 -5 years of 
age or older children unable to take pills is no longer applicable, because the study did not 
enroll any subjects that required use of the sachets.  
 
The powder for oral suspension is a reddish brown to yellow powder in a sachet. Two PfOS 
strengths are available, containing eltrombopag olamine equivalent to 20 mg and 25 mg of 
eltrombopag fre e acid. Both strengths have identical powder blend composition and  contains 
eltrombopag  olamine equivalent to 20 mg of eltrombopag free acid per gram of powder. The 
difference in dosage strength is achieved by controlling the powder fill weight to 1.0 and 1.25 
gram for PfOS 20 mg and PfOS 25 mg, respectively.  
 
The entire content of the sachet is added to a specified amount of water to produce a suspension 
equivalent to 2 mg of eltrombopag per mL.  Doses for children between the ages 2 to 5 (2.5mg/kg 
non-East/South Asian participants, and 1.25mg/kg East/South Asia n participants) will be 
provided in the form of sachets.  If a child’s dose is based on body weight and needs a dose of 23 
mg, then dose only single sachet that provides 20 mg dose. However, if the child needs a dose of 
24 mg or greater, then the suggestio n is to start using the second sachet. This is mainly suggested 
to prevent the wastage of medicine by opening a second sachet to meet the additional 1 -3 mg 
dose.   Dosing 20 mg where a patient needs 23 mg should not have a significant impact on PD 
response . Enough sachets will provided for a few days of overage in case a patient is delayed 
returning to clinic.  
 
Stability:   Store , both tablets and powder,  at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15º to 30°C (59º to 
86°F) [ see USP Controlled Room Temperature ].

Date: 7/25/2018  (Amendment CC) APPENDIX D  PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES  
 
Collection of samples for PK Assessments  
 
Subjects will have PK assessments at the landmark 3 -month study visit.  Subject must have received once daily 
eltrombopag for at least 7 days prior to this  visit (i.e., be at PK steady -state with no recent dose interruptions).  If 
a subject is not currently receiving eltrombopag at the time of this visit (because of a dose interruption) or 
eltrombopag has been reinitiated after a dose interruption within the  7 days prior to this visit, PK assessments 
will be deferred until the landmark 6 -month study visit.  The eltrombopag dosing history for the 2 weeks prior to 
the PK visit will be recorded (any dose interruptions, actual dose administered).  
 
Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis will be collected in K2EDTA -containing tubes.  One sample will be 
collected at each of the following times: within 30 min prior to eltrombopag dosing (pre -dose sample), and at 2, 
4, 6, and 8 h after eltrombopag dosing. An optional sample will be collected 24 h post -dose, prior to 
administration of eltrombopag the next day.   
 
Record the date, time, and amount (in mg) of the dose administered after the pre -dose PK sample.  Collect each 
whole blood PK sample as close as po ssible to the planned time relative to dosing.  Record the actual date and 
time that each sample was collected.  
 
If a cannula is used, the cannula will be inserted into an arm vein within sufficient time prior to dosing, will be 
kept patent with normal sal ine and will be removed after the last blood sample is collected or earlier if the 
subject requests.  In order to avoid artificial dilution of the PK sample by the saline, 0.5 -1mL of whole blood 
will be collected and discarded before each PK sample is coll ected.  
 
7.7.1  PK Sample Processing and Storage  
 
Each PK samples will be gently mixed by inversion 8 to 10 times (do not shake).  Place the samples on ice 
immediately after collection.  Within 1 hour of sample collection, the samples will be centrifuged in  a 
refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) centrifuge at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes.  The resulting plasma will be transferred into 
a properly -labeled polypropylene tube.  Immediately, place the plasma samples upright in a -20°C freezer and 
retain the samples in the freeze r until they are shipped for analysis.  
 
7.7.2 Shipping Instructions  
 
Samples should be shipped only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday,  not less often than every 2 months.  
Samples must be shipped on dry ice via overnight courier to:

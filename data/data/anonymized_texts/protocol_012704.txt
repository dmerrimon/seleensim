Version 2.0 Incorporating S ubstantial Amendment 1Study Population:
Male and female adult subjects with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia on stable 
doses of risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, paliperidone or 
lurasidone for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and 2 months for depot medications.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/Randomized:
Approximately 420 subjects are planned to be screened for 210 subjects randomized to receive either 
1 of 2 doses of ASP4345 or placebo in a 3:2:2 ratio (approximately 90 placebo subjects and 
60subjects each per active study arm). 
Study Design Overview:
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm oral dose study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of ASP4345 in subjects with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia on 
stable doses of risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, 
paliperidone or lurasidone for at least 4 weeks prior to screening for oral medications and 2 months 
for depot medications .  The study will consist of the following pe riods:
Screening period (up to 28 days)
Double -blind treatment period (12 weeks/84 days)
Follow -up period (14 days post last dose)
Up to 210 subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 arms.  Study groups will consist of approximately 
90placebo subjects and 60 su bjects each per active study arm randomized in 3:2:2 ratio to receive 
1of 2 doses of ASP4345 or matching placebo daily (QD) for 12 weeks. Study treatment assignments 
will be according to the following table:
Group Dose Regimen Number
A 50 mg, QD 60
B 150 mg, QD 60
C Placebo, QD 90
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, study site personnel will check that 
potential subjects have not already been pre -screened, initiated or completed screening ,or have been 
randomized into this study or another clinical trial using an independent subject participation 
database .
After completing the screening procedures, subjects will be evaluated for randomization eligibility. 
After randomization on day 1, subje cts will receive oral doses of ASP4345 or matching placebo QD 
for 12 weeks. All subjects will be administered the first dose of blinded study drug at the site 
following randomization and provided with mobile applications that provide supplemental cognitive
training and record treatment compliance.  Subjects will return to the clinic weekly for safety, 
efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic procedures at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84.  
Subjects will continue their antipsychotic treatment fo r the entire study and will be followed for 
14days after their last dose of study drug.  
Subjects terminating early from the study will be encouraged to complete scheduled visits . All 
subjects are allowed to stop study drug, but continue in the study thr ough day 84according to the 
current visit schedule unless the participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact 
with him/her or persons previously authorized by the participant provide this information
Pharmacokinetic trough samples will be collected prior to dosing at days 7, 14 or 21, 42 and 84.  
Additional samples will be collected at approximately 2 hours and 4 hours post dose on day 42.

Version 2.0 Incorporating S ubstantial Amendment 1Statistical Methods:
Sample Size :
A total sample size of 210 subjects will be randomized in 3:2:2 ratio ( approximately 90 placebo and 
60 subjects each per active study arm) into 1 of 2 doses of ASP4345 or matching placebo. The sample 
sizewill provide approximately 82% power for the pairwise comparisons to placebo to detect an 
effect size of at least 0.43, assuming a 1 -sided 5% significance level, with statistical significan ce 
achieved at an effect size of approximately 0.28 .  Note that the decision criteria to proceed will be 
based on effect sizes rather than statistical significance.  The number of subjects planned for this 
clinical study are considered sufficient to achiev e the clinical study objectives.
Efficacy :
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) and Intent -
to-Treat (ITT) set. The interpretation of results from statistical tests will be based on the FAS. The 
ITT will be used to assess the robustness of the results from the statistical tests based on the FAS. 
Analysis of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be done on the FAS.
A 2-sided significance level of 0.10, unless otherwise specified, will be us ed for all statistical tests on 
efficacy endpoints without multiplicity adjustment.
Based on the estimand, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Mixed Models Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) approach, with the corresponding score at baseline used as the co variate. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using either a MMRM or Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), 
depending on the schedule of events, with the corresponding scores at baseline used as a covariate.  A 
2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference in least squares (LS) mean changes 
between ASP4345 and placebo will be provided.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and selected secondary/exploratory endpoints 
will be performed based on duration since the first ps ychotic break, smoking status, subject age, 
biotype and background antipsychotics. 
Pharmacokinetics :
Population pharmacokinetic model will be developed based on ASP4345 plasma concentration data 
obtained from subjects who have at least 1 pharmacokinetic s ample. Population pharmacokinetics 
and/or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analyses will be performed by modeling and simulation 
scientist. All details of the population pharmacokinetic analysis will be described in a separate 
analysis plan and a separate population pharmacokinetic modeling report will be written.
Pharmacogenetics :
The pharmacogenetic parameters, mentioned under exploratory endpoints, will be analyzed using 
either an MMRM or ANCOVA model, as used for the analysis of the primary and some of the 
secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints.
Safety :
To characterize the safety profile, descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, vital signs (body 
temperature, pulse rate and sitting or supine blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology and biochemistry [including serum prolactin]), routine 12 -lead ECG recordings, 
C-SSRS, indices of metabolic syndrome, movement disorder, for each ASP4345 treatment and pooled 
placebo, where applicable.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 11 INTRODUCTION
Protocol 4345 -CL-0015 is a proof -of-concept study  to examine the effects of ASP4345 in 
subjects with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia on stable doses of risperidone, 
quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, paliperidone or lurasidone .
1.1 Back ground
Schizophrenia is a chronically  debilitating s yndrome that affects approximately 1% of the 
global populat ion and is accompanied by  extraordinary  high medical and economic burden 
[Awad & Voruganti, 2008].  The 3 primary  clinical sy mptom domains of schizophrenia 
include positive sy mptoms (delusions andhallucinations), negative s ymptoms (apath y, 
blunted affect, anhedonia, avolition, alogia, social and emotional withdrawal) and a wide 
range of cognitive sy mptoms, in addition to a general disorganization of thinking and 
behavior [Tandon et al, 2009]. Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia ( CIAS) 
includ es significant deficits (approximately  1 standard deviation [ SD]below performance of 
healthy  control subjects) in attention/vigilance, processing speed, working memory , 
reasoning, problem solving, verbal memory , visual memory  and social cognition that are
present both in patients on antipsy chotics ,as well as drug -naïve patients [Fatouros -Bergman 
et al, 2014; Schaefer et al, 2013]. These impairments have been shown to be associated with 
several key  functional outcomes [Shamsi e t al, 2011; Green et al, 2000 ].
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter play ing a key  role in the central nervous s ystem (CNS) 
[Sny der et al, 1970].  The phy siological actions of dopamine are mediated by  dopamine
receptors, which belong to the G protein -coupled receptor superfamily . On the bas is of their 
structural, pharmacological and biochemical properties, dopamine receptors are classified 
into either the D 1-class ( dopamine receptor t ype 1 [D 1]and dopamine receptor ty pe 5 
receptors) or the D 2-class ( dopamine receptor t ype2, dopamine recept or type3 and dopamine
receptor ty pe 4 receptors). Among them, D 1receptors are expressed at a high level of densit y 
in the dopamine rich area of the forebrain and play a crucial role in a variet y of cognitive 
functions [Zhang et al, 2009]. I t is reported that abnormal neurotransmission, especiall y the 
dopamine and glutamate (Glu) s ystem, play s a critical role in the pathoph ysiology  of 
schizophrenia. One of the therapeutic targets for CI AS is the activation of D 1receptors 
[Tamminga, 2006; Goldman -Rakic et al, 2004].  The hy peractivity  of dopamine in 
subcortical structures is thought to be associated with positive sy mptoms; whereas, D 1
receptor h ypoactivit y in the frontal cortical area has been suggested to be associated with 
negative s ymptoms and impaired c ognitive function [Laruelle, 2014]. Indeed, D 1receptors in 
the frontal cortex are reported to be involved in working memory  expression [Arnsten et al, 
1994].  These findings indicate that the stimulation of the D 1receptor is a promising target 
for improv ing CIAS; however, no D 1receptor agonist has been identified as a drug candidate 
for CIAS because of their powerful hy potensive effect [Blanchet et al, 1998; Duncker et al, 
1997].
Increased activation of D 1receptors remains a compelling mechanism of acti on to treat 
CIAS, as identified b y a consensus of academic and industry  experts during the Measurement 
and Treatment Research to I mprove Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative [Buchanan et al, 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol 4345 -CL-0015

17 Aug 2018 Astellas Page 29of 109
Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 12007; Tamminga , 2006].  However, this mechanism has not been ade quately  tested in the 
clinic due to limitations of available D 1receptor agonists. Positive allosteric modulators 
(PAMs) are an alternative option for stimulating receptor function.  They  positively  modulate 
the effect of the agonist, which binds to the or thosteric site, without directly  stimulating the 
receptor [May  et al, 2004] and are therefore expected to exert agonist -like activity  with a 
lower incidence of undesirable side effects.  ASP4345 is an orally  available, small -molecule 
and selective D 1receptor PAM discovered b y Astellas Pharma Inc.  ASP4345 is expected to 
effectivel y ameliorate CIAS without side effects such as h ypotension.
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data
The PAM effect of ASP4345 on the human D 1receptor was investigated using in vitro 
studies.  I n a cy clic adenosine monophosphate assay  using human D 1receptor -expressing 
cells, ASP4345 enhanced the potency  of dopamine in a concentration -related manner. In a
binding study , dopamine hydrochloride concentration -relatedl y inhibited binding o f 
[3H]SCH23390, a D1receptor antagonist radioligand, to D 1receptors.  ASP4345 (10 μmol/L) 
positively  modulated the dopamine -induced inhibitory  activity . This result suggests that 
ASP4345 enhances the binding activit y of orthosteric D 1receptor ligands. ASP4345 at a 
concentration of 10 μmol/L  had no appreciable affinity  (less than 50% inhibition 
displacement of specific binding) to the D1receptor orthosteric site or 53 other receptors, ion 
channels and transporters.
At an in vivo level, t he potentiating effect of ASP4345 on c -fos expression stimulated by  a D1
agonist at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was assessed in neonatally  1-(1-phen ylcyclohexy l) 
piperidine (PCP) -treated mice. Oral treatment with 1 mg/kg ASP4345 enhanced the c -fos 
expression in ( ±)-SKF38393 hy drochloride (1 mg/kg) -treated mice.
It is widel y accepted that cognitive deficits, including cognitive inflexibility  are a core feature 
of schizophrenia.  Cognitive flexibility  may  be assessed in rodents using the attentional 
set-shifting tas k (ASST).  The effect on extradimensional (ED) shift deficits using the ASST 
was evaluated in subchronic PCP -treated rats.  ASP4345 significantl y ameliorated ED shift 
deficits at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. 
The effect of ASP4345 on the release of neurotrans mitters at the mPFC was assessed in 
subchronic PCP -treated rats using an in vivo microdialy sis technique. Treatment of ASP4345 
increased the γ -aminobuty ric acid level at 1 and 30 mg/kg doses and dopamine efflux at the 
1 mg/kg dose.  Oral treatment of ASP4 345 did not affect glutamate efflux at any  dose.
In summary , results of both the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that ASP4345 is an orally  
active D 1receptor PAM and a promising candidate for use in treating CIAS.
The preclinical toxicology studies a re reviewed in detail in the ASP4345 I nvestigator’s 
Brochure.  ASP4345 is considered a PAM with important findings noted below, including 
1rat death associated with renal toxicity  at the highest dose in a toxicological study  and 
while the reversibility  ofthe renal toxicity  was noted in survival animals.  In dogs, vomiting, 
salivation, blood pH/electroly te changes were observed but the histological changes in the 
kidney  observed during the 1 -week study  were not replicated in the 4 -week or 13 -week

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1studies. Overall, the available toxicology  data indicate that the target organs are the liver, 
kidney s, adrenal glands, ovary , gastrointestinal (vomiting and salivation) and possible 
embry o-fetal toxicity .
Safety , tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics of ASP4345 have been evaluated in healthy  male 
and female subjects in a single ascending oral dose escalation study  (SAD; 4345 -CL-0001 )
and further, in male and female subjects with schizophrenia in a multiple ascending oral dose 
escalation s tudy (MAD; 4345 -CL-0002 ) in p hase 1 .  The mean exposure limit (AUC 24no 
greater than 14597 h•ng/mL ) for the SAD and MAD studies were based on the no -observed -
adverse -effect -levels (NOAELs) from the preclinical toxicology  studies.  A total of 
92subjects were treated with ASP4345 up to 900 mg single doses and 150 mg repeated doses 
during the phase 1 studies of 4345 -CL-0001 and 4345 -CL-0002.
ASP4345 was well -tolerated in the SAD study , consistent with the failure to identify  a 
maximum tolerated dose and an y clinicall y significant a dverse reactions with single doses up 
to 900 mg (Study  4345 -CL-0001).  There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs) or 
study  discontinuations, and there were relativel y few treatment -emergent or dose -related 
adverse events (AEs).  Furthermore, there were not any  apparent dose -related effect on the 
incidence of total or an y specific AEs, laboratory  results, electrocardiograms (ECGs) or vital 
signs.
ASP4345 was well -tolerated in the MAD study , also consistent with the failure to identify  a 
maximum tole rated dose with multiple doses up to 150 mg/day  over 14 days.  In the MAD 
study (4345 -CL-0002), mean stead y-state conditions were reached by approximately  day 5 of 
dosing across ASP4345 treatment groups, although 1 to 2 patients in each treatment group 
hadmore variability  due to the length of time it took for these patients to reach stead y-state. 
Mean stead y-state AUC taudid not exceed the mean exposure limit (AUC 24, day14 no greater 
than 14597 h•ng/mL) for any  ASP4345 treatment group, including the 150 mg ASP4345 
treatment group. However, median stead y-state AUC tauexceeded the exposure limit for the 
150 mg treatment group.
The mean t½ ranged from 11.1 to 26.8 hours, with the highest mean value observed in the 
50mg ASP4345 treatment group. Rac (AUC) was s imilar across ASP4345 treatment groups 
and was approximately  1-to 2-fold at stead y-state. There was no dose -dependency  observed 
for rate of absorption (t max), lag time (t lag) or half -life (t ½). There was no evidence of time 
variant pharmacokinetics (e.g., auto-induction or -inhibition).
Based on the results of the slope estimates for the dose range tested (3 to 150 mg ASP4345), 
both C max and AUC taufailed to achieve dose proportionality  at stead y-state due to an 
unknown pharmacokinetic variable. The amount of ASP4345 excreted in urine was small 
with < 1% of the dose excreted unchanged.
Phamacod ynamic effects of ASP4345 were also explored in the MAD trial by appl ying 
cognitive testing as well as EEG testing. The f ollowing tests were selected to cover a broad
spectrum of cognitive domains thought to be modulated by  dopamine to assess for an y subtle 
changes in cognition as part of the specific CogState panel for schizophrenia: Detection

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1Tasks (ps ychomotor function and information processing), Identification Tas k (visual 
attention) and One Back Task (attention and working memory ).
While the study  was not powered to see significant differences (including the 90% confidence 
interval [ CI]), the direction and magnitude of effect sizes for cognitive testing suggests t hat 
treatment with ASP4345 was associated with a benefit of ps ychomotor function, information 
processing and visual attention. For all doses of ASP4345, performance on the Detection Task 
wasnumerically  superior to baseline and placebo on day  14with effec t sizes ranging from 
0.577 to 0.993 . Once treatment “stopped ”these positive effects remained although they  were 
reduced in magnitude. For all doses of ASP4345, performance on the Identification Task was 
numericall y superior to placebo on day 14. There was no trend as compared to placebo for the 
One Back Task.
Neuroph ysiological E EGtesting in this study  included the Auditory  Steady -state Response 
(ASSR), Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P300 assessments (P3a -FZ, P3b -CZ, P3b -PZ) that 
were performed over a 2-hour period. Regarding the EEG results, ASSR show ed a positive 
response as compared to placebo on day  14 for the 150 mg treatment group, while MMN 
shows trends for benefits over placebo across treatment groups, except the 50 mg ASP4345 
treatment group.
There were no patient deaths, study  drug -related SAEs or TEAEs leading to withdrawal of
treatment. There was 1 SAE of small intestinal obstruction in a patient who received 50 mg 
ASP4345 on day s 19 through 23 that was considered severe in nature. The last d oseday for 
this patient was day  14, 5 day s prior to th e start of the SAE. The SAE was considered b y the 
investigator to be not related to study  drug and attributable to past medical history .
In multiple ascending dose s tudy (4345 -CL-0002), t he more common TEAEs occurring in 
>10% of patients in either the respective placebo group vs the ASP4345 group were 
headache (33.3%, 4/12 vs 25.0%, 9/36), somnolence (8.3%, 1/12 vs 19.4%, 7/36), dizziness 
(16.7%, 2/12 vs 5.6%, 2/36), insomnia (25.0%, 3/12 vs 8.3%, 3/36 ), back pain (none vs 
11.1%, 4/36), abdominal pain (16.7%, 2/12 vs none) and constipation (none vs 13.9%, 5/36). 
Therefore, with respect to TEAEs there was no clear pattern of tolerability  issues for 
ASP4345 compared with placebo in this study  with a limit ed sample size and duration of 
treatment.
Given nonclinical evidence of potential renal toxicity , laboratory  tests directly  assessing renal 
function were evaluated. Cy statin C values were monitored for changes in kidney  function
throughout and after the end-of-treatment ( EoT). In multiple ascending dose s tudy (4345 -CL-
0002), n o patients in an y ASP4345 dose group had changes from baseline to day  14 in 
cystatin C values > 30% compared to baseline.   There were no apparent dose -related effects 
on cy statin C val ues.
There were no clinicall y significant changes in hematology  or other chemistry  laboratory
analytes. This included an absence of patients with a potentially  clinically  significant value
for liver enz ymes or total bilirubin. With respect to vital sign fi ndings, there were no time -or 
dose-dependent changes apparent for pulse rates, sy stolic blood pressure or diastolic blood

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1pressure. The incidence of positive orthostatic challenge test results was low and there was 
no consistent pattern that would indicat e a dose -related effect. There were also no study  drug -
related changes in weight, waist circumference or body  mass index ( BMI ).
During stud y 4345 -CL-0002, f rom a cardiac standpoint, no patient had a clinically  
significantl y abnormal ECG result at baseline or any  postbaseline time point through day 18 
(96 hours after the last dose). No patient had a QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF )
value > 480 msec through day  14 or a > 30 msec change from baseline in QTcF.
No patient showed evidence of suicidal ideation based on C -SSRS results.
In summary , ASP4345 appeared safe and well -tolerated with respect to a 14 -day treatment
duration with daily  doses up to 150 mg.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information from nonclinical and 
clinical studies.
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Given the early  stage of development, there are currentl y no expected AEs for ASP4345.
ASP4345 is considered a PAM with a relativel y tolerable safet y profile but with important 
preclinical to xicology  findings noted below, including 1 rat death associated with renal toxcity  
at the highest dose in a toxicological study  and while the reversibility  of the renal toxicity  was 
noted in survival animals.  I n dogs, vomiting, salivation, blood pH/electr olyte changes were 
observed but the histological changes in the kidney  observed during the 1 -week stud y were not 
replicated in the 4 -week or 13 -week studies.  Overall, the available toxicology  data indicate 
that the target organs are the liver, kidney s, adrenal glands, ovary , gastrointestinal (vomiting 
and salivation) and possible embry o-fetal toxicity .
ASP4345 may  be associated with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) based on the 
clinical studies. The following were key  clinical observations: headac he,somnolence, 
dizziness, insomnia, back pain, abdominal pain ,and constipation. 
A maximum tolerated dose was not identified in either the SAD study  (4345 -CL-0001) or the 
MAD study  in subjects with schizophrenia (4345 -CL-0002) using dosing up to 900 mg s ingle 
doses and 150 mg daily  doses that did not exceed the mean exposure limit (AUC 24no greater 
than 14597 h•ng/mL) that was based on the NOAEL  from the preclinical toxicology  studies.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 11.4 Risk Benefit Assessment
No clinical efficacy  studies have been conducted to date with ASP 4345 forthe treatment of
cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia ( CIAS).  Therefore, the actual benefit of 
ASP4345 in the treatment of CIASis unknown. There are no known risks unambiguousl y
identified with this mechanism of action, as ASP 4345 is a first -in-class compound for the 
proposed indication .Based on the safety profile from the phase 1 clinical studies and 
especiall y with subjects w ith schizophrenia , proceeding to phase 2 trials appear to be justified 
from a risk benefit assessment. 
An overview of the risk benefit of ASP 4345 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , 
including monitoring and mitigation steps taken to maintain safe ty of the subjects while on 
study treatment. Routine risk minimization procedures are planned in this study along with 
weekl y visits, including laboratory  assessments, so that increases in cy statin C suggesting renal 
toxicity  can be detected if a longer du ration of treatment is related to the risks. Due to the 
known effects of the antipsy chotic therapies used in this study  and a potential interaction with 
ASP4345, prolactin will also be monitored. Other risks are monitorable and reversible (liver 
toxicity  by LFTs; adrenal gland vacuolation b y adrenocorticotropic hormone).  Additional 
potential risks are reversible (vomiting and salivation) , therefore, no additional safet y 
monitoring is required. Other potential risks such as changes in blood pH/blood chlor ide were 
likely  due to the salt load for the administered dose and are unlikel y to be of relevance for 
human studies associated with lower drug exposures. Changes in blood pH/blood chloride 
were not observed during phase 1 studies.   Therefore, only  chlorid e will be monitored in this 
study  but for general monitoring of renal function as described above.

2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm oral dose study  to evaluate the 
safet y and efficacy of ASP4345 in subjects with cognitive impairment associated with 
schizophreni a on stable doses of risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, 
aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, paliperidone or lurasidone for at least 4 weeks prior to screening 
for oral medications and 2 months for depot medications .  The study  will consist of the 
following periods:
●Screening period (up to 28 day s)
●Double -blind treatment period (12 weeks/84 day s)
●Follow -up period (14 day s post last dose)
Approximately  420 subjects are planned to be screened with u p to 210 subjects enrolled in 
1of 3 arms.  Study  grou ps will consist of approximately  90 placebo subjects and 60 subjects 
each per active study  arm randomized in 3:2:2 ratio to receive 1 of 2 doses of ASP4345 or 
matching placebo daily  (QD) for 12 weeks. Study treatment assignments will be according to 
the fo llowing table:
Group Dose Regimen Number
A 50 mg, QD 60
B 150 mg, QD 60
C Placebo, QD 90
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, stud y site personnel will 
check that potential subjects have not alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed 
screening or have been randomized into this study , or another clinical trial, using an 
independent subject participation database.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1After completing the screening procedures, subjects will be evaluated for randomization 
eligibility . After randomization on day 1, subjects will receive oral doses of ASP4345 or 
matching placebo QD for 12 weeks. All subjects will be administered the first dose of blinded 
study  drug at the site following randomization and provided with mobile applications that 
provide supplemental cognitive training and record treatment compliance.  Subjects will return 
to the clinic weekl y for safet y, efficacy , and/or pharmacokinetic procedures at day s 7, 14, 21, 
28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84.  Subjects will contin ue their antipsy chotic treatment for 
the entire stud y and will be followed for 14 day s after their last dose of study  drug. 
Subjects terminating early  from the study  treatment will be encouraged to complete scheduled 
visits.   All subjects are allowed to s top study  drug, but continue in the study through day  84 
according to the current visit schedule unless the participant specificall y withdraws consent for 
any further contact with him/her or persons previously  authorized by  the participant provide 
this inf ormation.
Pharmacokinetic trough samples will be collected prior to dosing at day s 7, 14 or 21, 42 and 
84.  Additional samples will be collected at approximately  2 hours and 4 hours post dose on 
day 42.
To determine changes in cognition with the MCCB inst rument, cognitive testing will be 
performed at each screening visit, on day s 1 (prior to first dose), 42, and 84.  All MCCB 
assessments following randomization should be performed within a 2 -hour window of the 
baseline test . In order to avoid an acute impa ct of nic otine and caffeine on cognitive testing, 
smoking and intake of coffee will not be allowed approximately  30minutes before the MCCB
assessment.
Study  day 84/EoT visit completes the treatment period for the subject. Subjects will return to 
the clini c for a follow -up visit on day  98 to complete the final assessments.  I ndividual subject 
discontinuation of study  drug treatment or study  is addressed in Section 6Discontinuation. 
Once the subject has completed or discontinued the study , no further treatment with ASP4345 
for cognitive impairment is planned to be offered.  
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
Astellas is proposing to conduct this PoC trial with separate 50 and 150 mg AS P4345 dose 
groups. This decision is based on the pharmacokinetic data and positive results for the 
apriori chosen electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked response and improvements in cognition 
(based on a specific CogState panel for schizophrenia) that were ob tained for the ASP4345 
50and 150 mg dose groups as compared with placebo in 4345 -CL-0002. An additional 
reason is not having observed safety  or adverse events of concern in the of the multiple 
ascending oral dose study (4345 -CL-0002). Further reasoning behind these dose choices 
follows.
ASP4345 is a D 1receptor PAM and it is standard to evaluate 2 doses for a PAM or agonist, 
especiall y for a target where there is nonclinical data for both nonhuman primates and rodents 
suggesting potential inverted U do se (exposure) -response relationships. Both doses are within 
the presumptive nonclinical efficacious exposure range and evidence has been observed for

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1doses ranging from 3 to 150 mg. The 50 mg dose is the next highest dose to the 150 mg dose 
and data from the 50 mg dose will be valuable if safet y data with the 150 mg dose are found 
to be inadequate.
Since the mean half -life of ASP4345 is approximately  10to 20 h and patients achieved 
steady -state in the ongoing study  by day 14, the pharmacokinetic parame ters in a 12 -week 
study  are expected to be similar to the pharmacokinetic parameters observed on day 14 in 
Study  4345 -CL-0002.
The ability  of ASP4345 to improve cognitive impairment in subjects with schizophrenia will 
be assessed at doses of 50 mg and 150 mg QD over a period of 12 weeks.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 14.4.4 Breaking the Treatment Code for Emergency 
The treatment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT in the event of a 
medical emergency  requiring knowledge of the treatment assigned to the subject.  The time, 
date, subject number and reason for obtaining an y of these codes, and th erefore breaking the 
blind, must be documented in the study  file.  The treatment code must onl y be requested b y 
the investigator or other persons designated as sub -investigators.  No subjects or other stud y 
personnel will be made aware of the treatment giv en to an y subject unless a medical 
emergency  necessitates such disclosure.  
Unblinding of the stud y drug should onl y be considered for subject safet y or when critical 
therapeutic decisions are contingent upon knowing the blinded study  drug assignment.  An y 
unblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the Sponsor and must 
include an explanation of why  the study  drug was unblinded.  If possible, the Sponsor should 
be contacted prior to unblinding of the stud y drug.
4.4.5 Breaking the Tre atment Code by the Sponsor
The sponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a SUSAR, in order to 
determine if the individual case or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory reporting . 
Individual Emergency  Codes will be provided to the limited staff who are responsible to 
break the codes for all SUSAR cases for reporting purposes .
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
Subjects will be randomized in a 3:2:2 ratio to a treatment arm (placebo to active) according 
to the randomization schedules t hrough IRT. Allsubjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will 
be randomized. The site person al will dispense the treatment according to the I RT s ystem’s 
assignment . Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are contained in the 
study  procedur es manual.
If a subject is assigned a randomization number, but does not receive study  drug, the 
randomization number will not be used again.  The randomization schedules that determine 
subject treatment will be computer -generated b y IRT before the beginning of the study .  
Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are contained in the study -specific 
IRT manual.
All subject numbers will be assigned using the IRT starting at screening. All subjects will 
have a unique, 10 -digit subject numbe r.  The first 5 digits of this number will be the 
investigator’s site number.  The second 5 digits will be represent the subject’s accession 
number.  This will be the number that identifies a subject during the course of the study .

5.1 Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other 
Medication(s)
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
Subjects randomized to either of the ASP4345 groups will receive ASP4345 50 mg 
(1capsule of 50 mg and 2 capsules of placebo) or ASP4345 150 mg (3 capsules of 50 mg and 
no placebo) QD for the duration of 12 weeks. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will 
receive placebo to match ASP4345 (3 capsules) QD for the duration of 12 weeks. 
ASP4345 capsules will be administered orally  as a single da ily dose on days 2 through 84, in 
the morning with or without food (the first dose on day  1 will be taken at the study  site). The 
subject will also dose at the study  site on the following 4 visits: day s 7, 14 or21, 42 and 
84/EoT.
Doses should be taken in the morning with or without food. Ifa subject forgets a dose, the 
dose should be taken as soon as they  remember but prior to bedtime that day . The next day 's 
dose should still be taken as planned. Two doses should not be taken in the same day .
At randomization and weekly  thereafter, subjects will receive the assigned treatment 
sufficient for a period of 1week with a 2 -day window (including morning dose on the day  of 
the next visit). 
Pharmacokinetic sample swill be taken pre-dose on day  7, 14 or 21, 42 and 84; post -dose at 
approximately  2 and 4 hours on day  42 (Week 6).  There are no fasting requirements for the 
pharmacokinetic samples but date and time of the dose taken prior to collecting the 
pharmacokinetic sample will be captured in the el ectronic case report form (eCRF ).
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
The doses of 50 and 150 mg QD of ASP 4345 were tested in the phase 1 multiple dose study . 
These doses were well tolerated and no maximum tolerated dose was determined. Stop ping 
criteria are presented in Section 6.1Discontin uation of Individual Subject(s) . Study  
4345 -CL-0015 is a fixed dose, proof -of-concept study . In order to adequately  evaluate the 
hypothesis, it is important to assess efficacy  and safet y across a common dose, therefore, 
dose increases and decreases are not allowed . 
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and NonMedication 
Therapy )
Medications taken fo r treatment of schizophrenia during the 12 months prior to screening and 
other medication taken 28 day s prior to the screening visit and up to the first dose of study  
medication (treatment period) will be documented in the appropriate case report form as p rior 
schizophrenia medications or other prior medication, respectivel y.Subject s taking prohibited 
medications who are willing to discontinue these medications , as clinicall y indicated and
based upon the investigator’s recommendation, may washout over a pe riod of 5 half -lives on 
a schedule determined b y the investigator in consultation with the study  medical monitor .

5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study  drug.  
Investigator or designee should ensure that study  subje cts meet this goal throughout the stud y 
period.  Compliance will be verified b y the accounting of stud y drug at each monthly  visit 
after day 1. When study  drug is administered at the research facility , it will be administered 
under the supervision of study personnel.
Compliance of the study  drug will be monitored by  the accounting of unused medication 
returned b y the subject at visits. Additionally , study  drug compliance will also be 
documented b y the use of aclinicall y-validated artificial intelligence te chnology  application.
Subjects who are less than 85% compliant and more than 100% compliant with the dosage 
regimen for greater than 2 consecutive visit periods during the stud y should be counseled 
regarding steps to improve compliance. Subject use of th e cognitive training application 
should also be assessed as outlined in Section 5.7.5 at the same time as compliance with 
study  drug treatment.
Treatment complianc e should be monitored closely  and deviation in compliance should be 
reported to the sponsor.
5.1.5 Restrictions During the Study 
Subjects are requested not to eat grapefruit and/or drink grapefruit juice (see exclusion 
criterion 11).  Subject smoking is not re stricted.
5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics including Smoking History
Date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity , height, weight, and BMI will be recorded at screening .

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.2.2 Medical and Psychiatric History
A detailed medical history  for each subject will be obtained at screening ,including a history  
of prior head trauma and treatment . A detailed psychiatric history will also be obtained at 
screening, including all treatments and therapies used. All relevant past and present 
conditions, as well as prior surgical proced ures will be recorded .  
5.2.3 Duplicate Subject Database Check
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, stud y site personnel will 
check that potential subjects have not alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed 
screening, or have been randomized into this study  or another clinical trial using an 
independent subject participation database.  Independent subject participation databases seek 
to reduce duplicate enrollment by  identify ing duplicates before they  randomize into the study , 
and this measure is consistent with exclusion requirement of not participating in another 
interventional clinical trial during the conduct of the study  (inclusion criterion 15).  I n order 
to complete this check and per the informed consent, study  personnel will request that the 
subject present a valid picture ide ntification (e.g., driver’s license, passport, state issued ID 
card, etc.) and stud y personnel may be required to provide certain authorized information that 
could potentially  be used to identify  study  subjects identifiers (e.g., date of birth, initials, e tc.) 
so that the match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not identified 
as a duplicate subject (e.g., certainl y, possible, probably), will be enrolled into the study . 
Appropriate docu mentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility  according to these criteria will 
be reflective in the subject’s source documents.
5.2.4 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease 
The diagnosis ofschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder must be confirmed by  the 
investigator and documented in the subject’s medical notes as meeting the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition criteria and the criteria from the Mini -
International Neurops ychiatric Interview version 7.02 at screening .Duration of 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, date of the first psy chotic break and associated 
symptoms ( agitation, delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder) and date of the most 
recent ps ychotic break and associated s ymptoms ( agitation, delusions, hallucinations, and 
thought disorder) will be recorded in the eCRF . 
The subject’s medical notes at screening must also confirm no ps ychiatric hospitalization 
within the last 4 months, no sy mptom -related changes in ps ychotropic medications (as 
defined in the concomitant medications section), core positive sy mptoms no worse than 
moderate in severity , and no evidence of a current severe major depressive episode. The 
subject must also have a stable living situation documented in th e medical notes at screening .

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.2.5 Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The M.I.N.I. International Neurops ychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 7.02) is a short, structured 
diagnostic interview administered by  trained personnel . The instrument captures the maj or 
Axis I  psychiatric disorders in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
edition (DSM -V)and ICD -10, and has demonstrated equivalent reliabilit y, validity , and 
decreased interview time when compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V
diagnoses (SCID -P). Each module begins with screening questions that are answered yes or 
no. A negative response in the screening algorithm advances the interview to the next 
module, whereas a positive response will prompt additional questions t hat ask patients to 
characterize behavior with “y es” or “no” responses . Some questions contain a recall period 
(e.g., “Past Two Weeks ,”“Past Episode” and “Current Episode”) . After completion of the 
additional questions, the clinician indicates whether or not the diagnostic criteria have been 
met, based on the instrument scoring criteria [Amorim et al, 1998; Sheehan et al, 1998; 
Lecrubier et al, 1997; Sheehan et al, 1997] .
The M.I.N.I .7.02will be completed at screening on paper by trained site personnel, in 
accordance with the structured interview requirements .
5.3 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic sAssessment s
5.3.1 Efficacy Assessments
The principal i nvestigator or qualified delegate will complete the MCCB and UPSA -2-ER 
using a paper cop y of the licensed instrument and the results will be recorded in a central 
database b y the vendor following scoring of the scales. The data will be transferred 
electronically  to the Sponsor. 
For the NSA-16,PANSS , andCGI-S a tablet will be used by  the p rincipal i nvestigator or 
qualified delegate to assess the subject during clinic visits. Site personnel will receive 
training on how to complete the assessments on the tablet.  Data will be automatically  
transmitted to a central database from the tablet .
When possible continuity  of raters should be maintained across scales for each patient. See 
[Appendix 12.6 Clini cal Outcome Assessment Scales ]for information on all COAs used in 
the study .
5.3.1.1 MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery
The MCCB was developed as a standard battery  for clinical trials of cognition -enhancing 
interventions for schizophrenia.  The instrument measu res seven separate but intercorrelated 
cognitive domains: working memory , attention/vigilance, verbal learning and memory , visual 
learning and memory , reasoning/problem solving, speed of processing and social cognition. 
These domains were the consensus of the National I nstitute of Mental Health (NIMH) 
Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRI CS) 
initiative .  The output of this process (test -retest reliability , utility  as a repeated measure,

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1practicalit y/tolerability  from 5clinical sites) was pub lished as the 7-domain MCCB 
[Nuechterlein et al, 2008 ].
The MCCB should be completed by  the principal investigator or qualified delegate twice 
during the 28 -day screening period, and on day s 1, 42 and 84/EoT.  The data will be 
completed on paper b y the principal investigator or qualified delegate.
5.3.1.2 University of San Diego Performance -based Skills Assessment -2 Extended Range
The UPSA -2was d eveloped to assess the functional abilities of the subject with schizophrenia in 
6 domains: household management, communication, financial skills, transportation, 
comprehension/planning and medication management.  The assessment is performed as a role -
play with the rater in which participants are asked to utilize props to demonstrate how well they  
perform every  day activities.  The UPSA -2-ERcontains additional questions to increase the level 
of difficulty  for each subscale .
As part of the MATRICS Coprimary and Translations (MATRI CS-CT) initiative, the Validation 
of Intermediate Measures (VIM) stud y established that the UPSA -2demonstrated good test -
retest reliability ,was not burdensome to patients and was adequate for repeated measurements .  
The VIM stud y also demonstrated that performance -based measures were strongl y correlated to 
cognition interview -based measures.  Based on the available evidence, the MATRI CS-CT 
initiative concluded that the UPSA -2was suitable as a coprimary  measure [Green et al, 2011].   
Additional evidence has demonstrated correlation with the MCCB battery  [Keefe et al, 2011 ].  In 
a study  reported b y Patterson and colleagues [2001], the UPSA -2performance correlated 
significantl y with the severity  of negative s ymptoms and symptoms of co gnitive impairment .  As 
described above, the UPSA -2-ER contains additional questions to increase the level of difficulty  
for each subscale and has been used in previous CIAS trials.
The UPSA -2-ER scoring will be completed by  the principal investigator or qualified delegate 
on paper on day s 1 and 84/EoT.
5.3.1.3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
The PANSS was developed based on patient interviews [Kay  et al, 1987] and has been 
widely  used in schizophrenia trials. The validit y and reliability of the PANSS has bee n 
extensively  studied and established [L indenmay er et al, 1995], including its ability  to assess 
positive and negative s ymptoms in subjects with recent onset of schizophrenia [Emsley et al, 
2003].  The PANSS contains 30 -items rated on 7 -point L ikert scales and is scored to assess 
3subscales:  positive symptoms, negative s ymptoms and psy chopathological sy mptoms.  A 
5-factor structure has also been identified to explore changes in the traditional subscales, and 
also those that may  align with disorganized (or cognitive) factors, as well as excited and 
depression/anxiety  factors [L indenmay er et al, 1995].
Data from the PANSS is enhanced when subjects identify  a person who can serve as an 
informant for its completion.  Although not required for inclusion, sites and subjects are 
highl y encouraged to identify a reliable subject (e.g., family member, social worker or case 
manager) who spends sufficient time with them to be able to provide information to PANSS 
raters and who has interacted with the subject during the past seven day s.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1The informant needs to be able and willing to attend clinic visits or to provide input via 
telephone.  The same informant should be used throughout the stud y whenever possible. The 
informant must be considered to be reliable b y the site. 
The PANSS will be completed by  the principal investigator or qualified delegate on the tablet 
at screening and day s 1, 14, 42 and 84/EoT.
5.3.1.4 Negative Symptom Assessment -16
The NSA -16 [Axelrod et al, 1993] is a semi -structured interview conducted by  the prin cipal 
investigator or qualified delegate to determine the severit y of the subject’s negative 
symptoms in the areas of problems in communication, emotion and/or affect, motivation, and 
sociality . Based on a 7 -point scale (0 -6) for each of the 16 items, a to tal negative s ymptom 
score is calculated b y adding the items; a higher score indicates more severe symptoms. The 
negative s ymptom burden will be further assessed using NSA -16 for patients who have at 
least 1 negative s ymptom of moderate severit y.  While so me overlap between concepts on the 
PANSS negative s ymptom subscale and the NSA -16exist, the NSA -16 assesses additional 
concepts covering verbal skills and activities of daily  living, both of which may  change if 
improved cognition is observed.
The NSA -16 w ill be completed by  the principal investigator or qualified delegate on the 
tablet at screening and days 1, 42 and 84/EoT.
5.3.1.5 Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale
The CGI -S [Schneider et al., 1997] is used to measure severity , treatment response and t he 
efficacy  of treatment in studies of patients with mental disorders.  The CGI -S is a 7 -point 
scale that requires the clinician to rate the severit y of the patients illness. 
The CGI -S will be completed by  the principal investigator or qualified delegate on the tablet 
at day s 1, 42 and 84/EoT.
5.3.2 Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Pharmacokinetic trough samples will be collected at/on 4 visits: prior to dosing at days 7, 14 or 
21, 42 and 84.  Additional samples will be collected at approximately  2 hours and 4 hours post 
dose on day  42. Subjects should be reminded not to dose at home prior to their clinic visit.  
Details on sample collection, processing, labeling, storage, and shipment procedures are 
provided in the laboratory manual. Anal ysis of ASP4345 and any  metabolites (if applicable) 
will be performed using a validated method at a bioanalytical laboratory specified b y the 
Sponsor .

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.4 Safety Assessment
Safety will be assessed through AEs, safety  laboratory  tests (chemistry , hematology  and 
urinaly sis), phy sical exam ination, vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs , metabolic s yndrome assessment 
(weight, waist circumference, cholesterol, trigl ycerides, HDL [the second screening visit and 
day 77]and fasting glucose), HbA1c and the C -SSRS. Unscheduled assessments will be 
performed if clinicall y warranted. The ARCI and Bond Lader instruments did not reveal an y 
effects of ASP4345 during phase 1. Therefore, they are not included in the safet y assessments.  
Phase 1 testing with ASP4345 has not revealed a clinically  significant effect with orthostatic 
vital signs and these measures are not included in this trial.
ASP4345 penetrates the CNS in humans; therefore, a prospective assessment of suicidality  
will be performed using the C -SSRS.
5.4.1 Vital Signs
Vital signs consist of body  temperature, pulse and sitting or supine blood pressure.  Single 
measures of vital signs will be obtained during the screening visit, and at each weekl y visit
through day  84/EoT.  Vital signs should be obtained prior to scheduled blo od draws.
5.4.2 Adverse Events

5.4.9 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The AIMS [Rush, 2000] aids in the earl y detection of tardive d yskinesia ,as well as providing a 
method for on -going surveillance. The AIMS is a checklist and uses a 5-point rating scale for
recording scores for 7 body  areas: face, lips, jaw, tongue, upper extremities, lower extremities 
and trunk. The assessments will be performed by the principal investigator or qualified 
delegate on the tablet at randomization and da y 42 and 84/EoT visits. When possible continuity

5.4.10 Simpson Angus Scale
The SAS [Simpson & Angus, 1970] is a 10- item scale used to rate adverse neurological effects 
of antipsy chotic medications mo re broadl y. It involves direct observation and a brief
neurological examination. Rating requires the investigator to observe the patient’s gait and check 
for tremor, excessive salivation and rigidit y in the arms, shoulder and neck. Each item is rated 
from 0 to 4 and a total score can be obtained. Assessments will be performed by the principal 
investigator or qualified delegate on the tablet at randomization and day  42 and 84/EoT visits.
When possible continuity  of raters should be maintained across scales f or each patient.
5.4.11 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale
The BARS [Barnes, 1989] is a rating scale that is used to assess the severity of drug -induced
akathisia. The assessments will be performed by the principal investigator or qualified delegate

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject , temporall y associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE 
can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated wi th the use of a 
medicinal product .
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  drug treatment. AE coll ection begins after the signing of the informed consent 
and will be collected until 28 day safter the last dose of study  drug.
5.5.1.1 Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result ( e.g., hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinal ysis) or 
other safet y assessment (e.g., ECGs, radiolographic scans, vital signs measurements , phy sical 
examination ), including those that worsen from baseline, which is considered to be clinicall y 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator andnot related to 
underly ing disease ,is to be reported as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event ([S]AE).
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE , 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subjec t’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety  assessment , in the absence of an y of the 
above c riteria , does not const itute an AE.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.
5.5.1.2 Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.3 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions on 
Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI). Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent or with 
abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outline d in [Appendix 12.3 Liver 
Safety  Monitoring and Assessment] ,in the absence of other causes o f liver injury , are 
considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury  (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and are
alway s to be considered important medical events and rep orted per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events] .
5.5.1.3 Disease Progression and Study Endpoints
Under this protocol, the following event(s) wil l not be considered as an (S)AE:
●Pre-planned and elective hospital izations or procedures for diagnostic, therapeutic, or 
surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the course of 
theclinical trial. These procedures arecollected per the eCRFs Completion Guidelines.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.5.2 Definition of Serious A dverse Events
AnAEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AEis considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial dis ruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study) or 
leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization 
is not caused b y an AE). H ospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y 
AE is to be considered as serious .) 
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgm ent should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an AEis 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relati onship to Study Drug
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study  drug and the
occurrence of each (S)AE . The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. The investigator should also use theInvestiga tor’s Brochure (IB) . The 
investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality  assessment for each SAE 
and must document this on the SAE worksheet . The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting r equirements. The investigator may  revise
his/her assessment of causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send 
an SAE follow -up report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated 
causality  assessment.
Following a review of the relevant data, t he causal relationship between the study  drug and 
each (S)AE will be assessed by  answering ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “Do you consider 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol 4345 -CL-0015
-CONFIDENTIAL -
17 Aug 2018 Astellas Page 58of 109
Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there isevidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
thatan (S)AE may  have been caused by  the study drug (rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out ) or if there is evidence to reasonabl y deny a causal relationship:
●Plausible t emporal relationship between exposure to the study  drug and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subjec t actually  receive dthe study  drug? Did the (S)AE occur 
in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug? 
●Plausibil ity; i.e., could the event been caused by  the study  drug? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinical 
and clinical study  data, etc.
●Dechallenge/ Dose reduction/ Rechallenge :
○Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect 
drug? Also consider the impact of treatment for the event when evaluating a 
dechallenge experience. 
○Did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been 
stopped?  
●Laboratory or other test result s; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y drug (e.g., ba sed on values pre -, during 
and post -treatment)
●Available a lternative explanations independent of study  drug exposure ; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc. and strength of the alternative 
explanation
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor . However, it is very  important that 
the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality  for every  event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient information about 
the event to make an informed judgment and in absence of any  indication or evi dence to 
establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to be considered. In such 
instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as 
soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon rece ipt of additional information. 
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities

5.5.6 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized by the investigator . 
If after the protoc ol defined AE collection period [see Section 5.5.1 Definition of Adverse 
Event] , an AEprogresse sto aSAE, or the investigator learns of an y (S) AE including death,
where he/she considers there is reasonable possibility  it is related to the study  drug treatment 
or study  participation, the investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
5.5.7 Special Situations 
Certain Special Situations observed in association with the stu dy drug(s) , such as incorrect 
administration (e.g., wrong dose of study drug, comparator, or background therapy ) are 
collected in the eCRF , as Protocol Deviation per[Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations] or may 
require special reporting, as described below. These Special Situations are not considered 
AEs, but do require to be communicated to Astellas as per the timelines defined below .
If a Special Situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is to be assessed 
separately  from the Special Situation and captured as an AE in the eCRF. If the AE meets the 
definition of a SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events ]and the details of the associated Special Situation are to be included 
in the clinical description on the SAE worksheet .

The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
study  subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events. F or (S)AEs experienced b y a female partner of a male subject, (S)AEs are to be 
reported via the Pregnancy  Reporting Form.
Additional inform ation regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below :
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE
regardless of its relationship with the study  drug.
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
the investigator.
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  visual examination. (S)AEs 
experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the Pregnancy  Reporting Form. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date.

5.7.2 Blood Sample for the Analysi s of Genes Related to Pharmacokinetics ,Efficacy, 
and Safety (Optional)
Knowledge of pol ymorphism sof genes COMT, and dopamine D 1and D 3receptors may  help 
understand and/or explain observed differences in pharmacokinetic profiles, efficacy  and 
safet y of ASP4345. After randomization (see schedule of assessments), a 2mL whole blood 
sample for the anal ysis of these genes will be collected. For detailed sample collection, 
sample labeling and sample shipment procedures refer to the laboratory  manual .
5.7.3 Blood Sample for Future Pharmacogenetic Analysis (Retrospective 
Pharmacogenetic Analysis) (Optional)
A pharmacogenetic ( PGx)research may  be cond ucted in the future to analyze or determine
genes of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity /safety  issues. After 
randomization (see schedule of assessments), a 4 mL sample of whole blood for possible 
retrospective PGx anal ysiswill be collected . Samples will be shipped to a sponsor designated 
banking clinical research organization ( CRO ).
Details on sample collection, labeling, storage and shipment procedures will be provided in a 
separate laboratory  manual .
See [Appendix 12.5, Retrospective PGx Sub -study ] for further details on the banking 
procedures.
5.7.4 Rater Training and Quality Assurance
A centralized rater training and certification program wi ll be used to ensure consistency  with 
the study  conventions for the scales.  Video and/ or a udio monitoring will be conducted to 
review inter -rater and intra -rater reliability .
5.7.5 Cognitive Training for the Subject
During the randomization visit the subject w ill be given access to a mobile application 
designed to provide cognitive training through pre -determined exercises.  The application 
will be uploaded onto the subject’s phone once internet and/or cellular service is confirmed.  
If these capabilities are n ot available on the subject’s phone or they  do not own a phone, a 
hand -held device will be supplied.  
This cognitive training is being used in an attempt to provide a standardized background of 
cognitive engagement for all the subjects.  Multi -center tria ls for this t ype of cognitive 
training have revealed minimal if any  effect of the cognitive training b y itself.  Given that 
ASP4345 is a dopamine D1 receptor PAM, the expectation is that the cognitive training may  
interaction with pharmacological allosteri c modulation of the dopamine D1 receptor.
The subject will be instructed to access the s ystem 4 times per week (each session will have 
12 levels to complete and will take approximately  25-45 minutes ) throughout the study . The 
site will familiarize the subj ect on accessing and using the application.  Compliance will be

should be reminded to continue use of the application during weekl y visits; however, lack of 
compliance with these instructions will not be considered a protocol deviation.  If the subject 
has not been compliant it is recommended that the subject complete cognitive training prior to 
leaving the site.  An interim follow up phone call to remind those s ubjects not compliant with 
training is also recommended prior to the next visit.  Data are automatically  transmitted to a 
central database .  Training task performance will be assessed prior to the start of cognitive 
training and again after the last cognitive training with a standardized task assessment to 
evaluate improvement .
5.7.6 Virtual Monitoring of Study Drug Compliance
Subjects will be trained during the randomization visit on use of the mobile application for 
virtual monitoring of study  drug compli ance.  The application will be uploaded onto the 
subject’s phone once internet and/or cellular service is confirmed.  If these capabilities are 
not available on the subject’s phone or they  do not own a phone, a hand -held device will be 
supplied. The site w ill provide training on use of the application, which includes taking a 
video of themselves dosing the stud y drug.  Subject’s will be counseled that accurate and 
consistent use of the application is an essential part of their participation in the study . Data 
are automatically  transmitted to a central database.
5.8 Total Amount of Blood
Total amount of blood collected per subject for laborator y specimens is approximately  
145.5mL over a 12 -week period.
6 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s) 
A discontinuation from treatment is a subject who enrolled in the study  and for whom study  
treatment is permanently  discontinued for any  reason.  
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treatment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty  or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from study  treatment or to terminate a 
subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the subject 's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing AEor an unresolved laboratory  
result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to 
provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinicall y significant. 
Discontinuation Criteria from Study  Drug Treatment for Individual Subjects :
●Subject develops unacceptable toxicity
●Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by  the investigator to locate the 
subject
●Subject withdraws consent f or further treatment

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 17 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of APGD -US. A 
statistical analy sis plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and f igures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in the SAP will be 
justified in the CSR. 
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of sub jects, mean, 
SD, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and frequency  and 
percentage for categorical endpoints.
7.1 Sample Size
A total sample size of 210 subjects will be randomized in 3:2:2 ratio (approximately  
90placebo and 60 subjects each per active stud y arm) into 1 of 2 doses of ASP4345 or 
matching placebo. The sample size will provide approximately  82% power for the pairwise 
comparisons to placebo to detect an effect size of at least 0.43 in the primary  outcome 
measure , assuming a 1 -sided 5% significance level, with statistical significance achieved at 
an effect size of approximately  0.28.  Note that the decision criteria to proceed with the 
development of the compound will be based on effect sizes rather than statistical 
significance.  The number of subjects planned for this clinical study  are considered sufficient 
to achieve the clinical study  objectives.
7.2 Analysis Set s
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in Classification Specifications and the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock. 
For each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects will be characterized for all 
randomized subjects and by  each anal ysis set.
7.2.1 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
least one dose of stud y drug and have at least one post baseline MCCB measurement. This 
will be the primary  analysis set for efficacy  anal yses.
7.2.2 Intent -to-Treat Set
The Intent -to-Treat analysis set(ITT)will consist of all subjects who are randomized into the 
study . The ITT will be used to assess the robustness of the results of the primary efficacy 
endpoint from the statistical tests based on the FAS. Select demographic and baseline 
characteris tics may  also be summarized for the ITT.
7.2.3 Safety Analysis Set
The Safet y Analysis Set ( SAF)consists of all subjects who took at least 1dose of study  drug, 
and will be used for safety anal yses.
For the statistical summary  of the safet y data, the SAF will b e used.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 17.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
Consistent with the Hy pothetical Strategy  used for the estimand which is to compare patients 
as though they  had continued on the assigned treatment, MMRM w ill use all available on -
treatment data to inform end of treatment mean treatment effect estimates without requiring 
explicit imputation for missing data (i.e., for discontinued subjects). The primary  endpoint of 
change from baseline in MCCB neurocognitive composite score will be analy zed using a 
Mixed Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. The model will contain terms for 
treatment group, pooled site, visit, and treatment by visit, with the MCCB score at baseline 
used as a covariate. Least squares (LS) means (± standard error [SE]) and 2 -sided 90% CI s 
for the LS mean treatment differences between each dose of ASP4345 and placebo will be 
presented for the primary endpoint. There will be no adjustment made for multiple 
comparisons. The primary  analy sis wil l use the FAS.
There will be two h ypotheses tested. H ypothes is 1 is given as follows:
H0A: The LS mean change from baseline at week 12 for Group A (50 mg ASP4345)
and Group C ( placebo )are the same
H1A: The LS mean change from baseline at week 12 for Group A (50 mg ASP4345)
and Group C ( placebo )are not the same
Hypothes is 2 is given as follows:
H0B: The LS mean change from baseline at week 12 for Group B (150 mg ASP4345)
and Group C ( placebo )are the same
H1B: The LS mean change from baseline at wee k 12 for Group B (150 mg ASP4345)
and Group C ( placebo )are not the same
7.4.1.2 Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity  analy ses of the primary  efficacy  endpoint and selected secondary /exploratory  
endpoints will be performed based on duration since the first psy chotic break, smoking status, 
treatment compliance, and sex. Planned sensitivity  anal yses will be desc ribed in detail in the 
statistical analy sis plan. 
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary  efficacy  endpoint of change from baseline to week 12/EoT in the UPSA -2 
Extended Range instrument will be anal yzed using ANCOVA. The model will contain terms 
for treatment group and pooled site, with the corresponding score at baseline used as a 
covariate.  LS means (± SE) and 2 -sided 90% CIs for the LS mean treatment differences 
between each dose of ASP4345 and placebo will be presented for the primary  endpoint . 
There will be no adjustment made for multiple comparisons.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 112.3 Liver Safety Monito ring and Assessment
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes (including at least ALT, AST , alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and 
TBL). Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For 
studies for which a central laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated b y the central 
laboratory regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality  to inform the investigator, study  
monitor and study  team. Subjects should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of 
hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3×ULN or > 2×ULN
Severe > 3×ULN and > 2×ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
●ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks .  
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing 
is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinoph ilia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require addi tional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and la boratory  tests. The site should complete the liver abnormalit y 
case report form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for an y 
study or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing 
should be follo wed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a SAE.  The

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepat ic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptom s 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the(e)CRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease t hatmay lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients ,and may  be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.  The investigator should ensure that the medical hist ory form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recre ational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications, is to be entered inthe (e) CRF .  Information on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agent s.
●Based on the subject ’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) ,
○Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease ,
○Other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bi lirubin .
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document .
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as vi ral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease ,or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may  
be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enro llment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks .
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated) .
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the app earance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 112.5 Retrospective Pharmacogenetics Sub-Study
INTRODUCTION
Pharmacogenetics ( PGx)research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y 
occurring changes in a subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may 
impact what treatment options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx 
by technologies such as genoty ping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association Studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or 
toxicity  may  be better understood. As many  diseases may  be influenced by  1or more gen etic 
variations, PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a 
subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may participate in this PGx sub -
study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y 
blood samples that may  be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide one 4 mL tube of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by  the unique subject num ber 
(first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly  from 
site or via a central laboratory  as directed by  Astellas.
PHARMACOGENETICS ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and/or safety. 
DISPOSAL OF PHARMACOGENETICS SAMPLES/DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database hardlock. If there is no requirement for analy sis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw co nsent at 
any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed. The results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely .

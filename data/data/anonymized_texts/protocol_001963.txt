Title Retrospective chart review study of patients with PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth 
Spectrum (PROS) who have received alpelisib as part of a compassionate use 
program (EPIK-P1)
Version and date Final: 04-May-2020
Name and 
affiliation of main 
author: , Novartis
Rationale and 
backgroundSee Section 4 for additional information.
PROS describes a group of rare syndromes characterized by malformations and tissue 
overgrowth caused by somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene. PROS is characterized 
by a high degree of inter-individual phenotypic heterogeneity attributed to the location and extent of overgrowth and degree of vascular complications.
There is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for PROS; available 
treatment options are represented by de-bulking surgery, amputation, and/or 
endovascular occlusive procedures.
Alpelisib has demonstrated antitumor activity in a variety of cancer cell lines, 
particularly those harboring PIK3CA mutations and in xenograft models with mutated or 
amplified PIK3CA.
Venot et al. (2018) described the effectiveness of alpelisib in improving disease 
symptoms among nineteen patients with PROS receiving treatment under a compassionate use program. In these patients, previously intractable vascular malformations and overgrowths became smaller, congestive heart failure was 
improved, hemihypertrophy was reduced, and scoliosis was attenuated. The treatment 
was not associated with substantial side effects. This series of cases provides the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promising therapeutic option in 
patients with PROS.
Novartis is sponsoring a managed access program (MAP) to allow treatment with 
alpelisib for patients with PROS. As of November 2019, 65 patients with PROS were 
expected to be treated with at least one dose of alpelisib at least 24 weeks prior to the 
planned cut-off date. Given the existing data in this very rare disease setting, Novartis will conduct a retrospective medical chart review to assess changes in clinical and 
functional outcomes as well as safety in patients with PROS treated with alpelisib. 
Research objectivesSee Section 5 for additional information.
Primary objective
1. To describe the efficacy of alpelisib as measured by the proportion of patients with
response (yes/no) at Week 24 (+/- 4 weeks), defined by achieving at least a 20% reduction from index date in the sum of measurable target lesion volume (1 to 3 lesions, via central review of imaging scans), provided that none of the individual target 
lesions have ≥ 20% increase in volume from index date and in absence of progression 
of non-target lesions and without new lesions (see Section 6.3 for additional 
information).
Secondary objectives
1. To assess changes in the sum of measurable target lesion (1 to 3 lesions) volume
over time
2. To assess changes in the sum of all measurable (target and non-target) lesion 
volume over time
3. To assess changes in the sum of all measurable non-target lesion volume over 
timePPD PPD

Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL71 9F12002
4.To assess the d uration of response defined as time from first documented 
response to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to 
any cause.
5.To assess type of medication and non-drug therapies (e.g., concomitant PROS-
related medications, PRO S-related surgeries , duration of treatment /response )over 
time
6.To assess changes in PROS symptoms and complications (e.g., chronic 
bleeding/leaking, pain) over time
7.To assess changes in functional status (e.g., work/school/pre -school attendance, 
mobility )over time
8.Toassess changes in Healthcare Resource Use(HRU; e.g., ER visits, 
hospitalizations )over time
9.To assess changes in clinical assessments such as laboratory evaluation, vital 
signs and physical findings over time
10.To assess the safety and tolerability of alpelisib
Study  design See Section 6.1 for additional information.
This study will be a site -based retrospective non -interventional medical chart review of 
pediatric and adult male and female patients with PROS who initiated alpelisib at least 
24 weeks before the cut-offdate at a MAP site . The study cut -off date is 09-Mar -2020.
Patient -level data will be abstracted from medical charts of all eligible patients at all 
participating sites .The pre-index (pre-baseline) period will be defined as the period 
from up to 24 weeks prior to the index date (baseline) through one day prior to the 
index date .The index date (baseline) is defined as the date of alpelisib initiation. The 
study period is the period from the index date up to the most recent data available at 
the time of thecut-offdate (Figure 6 -1).
Information from pati ents treated with a lpelisib will be used to describe the efficacy and 
safety of alpelisib in patients with PROS.

Data source See Section 6.4 for additional information.
The data for this study will be retrospectively abstracted from medical charts of eligible 
patients with PROS treated at participating clinical sites.
Collected data will be c onverted to conform to CDISC data standards for electronic 
submissions.
Study  size See Section 6.6 for additional information.
This study aims to collect medical chart information on eligible patients with PROS at 
participating sites, including all patients who have been treated with alpelisib. As a 
result, no formal sample size calculation has been performed.

3 Amendments and updates
Amendment 01 (04-May-2020)
Amendment rationale 
No patients have been enrolled and no patients are planned to be enrolled until after this 
amendment is approved and in place.
The changes implemented inthis protocol amendment include thespecification of acut-off date 
(09-Mar-2020) in order to define the sample ofpatients to be enrolled in the study . This 
approach will allow Novartis to minimize the impact of the SARS -CoV -2 (COVID -19) 
pandemic on study  integrity .
The cut -off date definition was changed to avoid missing data due to the COVID -19 pandemic.
In the original protocol, the cut-off date was defined as the date of the start of data entry  (the 
data abstraction date). This amendment changes the cut
-off date for the study  to a fixed date of 
09-Mar- 2020. The assessment of response status is not expected to be impacted as all patient s
initiated alpelisib at least 24 weeks before 09-Mar- 2020. This result sin inclusion criteria 
number 5 being updated.
Following discussion with FDA, the primary  analysis ismodified. In the original protocol, the 
primary  analysis was apply ingimputation of the missing volumetric assessments for target 
lesions at Week 24 (+/- 4 weeks), while inin the current version of the protocol a complete case 
analysis is utilized. 
The complete case analy sis is planned to be performed based on patients without missing  
response as defined in Section 6.8.1 . 
The analy sis using imputed data will be performed as sensitivity  anal ysis(instead of as primary 
analysis).
Duration of response isadded to the second ary objectives asit is considered animpo rtant 
measure for the assessing benefit of the stud y drug .
Analy sis of the secondary  endpoints: for the endpoints related to objective #8, growth and 
development information were added to better characterize clinical assessments in patients who 
were aged <18 years at the time of alpelisib initiation .
The primary  endpoint will alsobe summarized and reported by sex. 
To ensure consistent selection criteria , the target lesion selection will be performed by the 
independent central reviewer instead of the investigator. 
Typographical andgrammatical errors arecorrected, and text has been reworded to add clarit y
where required
.

4 Rationale and background
PROS describes a group of rare syndromes characterized by malfor mations and tissue 
overgrowth caused b y somati c mutations in the PIK3CA gene.
The umbrella term PROS encompasses a group of syndromes with diverse phenoty pes, 
includi ng (but not limited to) CLOVES, MCAP, HHML , FAO , hemimegalencephal y, FIL, KTS , 
and others.
In PROS, individuals’ malformations are seen as overgrowth in several different tissues such 
as skin, vasculature, bone, fat, and brain tissue depending on the specific disease. Some of the 
malformations are congenital malformations of the vasculature causing excessive immature 
vasculature tissue, which may or may not be associated with overgrowth of other tissue. PROS 
is characterized by  a high degree of inter -individual phenoty pic heterogeneity  attributed to the 
location and extent of overgrowth and degr ee of vascular complications. The rate and timing of 
excess growth is also variable, sometimes limited to childhood, while other patients have 
progressive soft tissue overgrowth during adult life. These rare conditions have no approved 
medical treatment and are associated with a number of complications which depend on the 
anatomical site and extent of overgrowth and vascular malformations
. These complications may 
include functional impairment (e.g., impairment in walking or activities of daily  living ), pain, 
recurrent superficia l infections, thromboembolism, bleeding and/or organ dysfunction , all of 
which may be debilitating, and cause early morbidity  and even mortality (Parker et al. 2019 ). 
Current treatment includes surgical de-bulking procedures and amputation, andinterventional 
procedures including sclerotherap y, laser and/or endovascular occlusive procedures. Regrowth 
following surgery  occurs frequentl y and can require repeated surgery . 
Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that was introduced in 2011 as the first pharmacologic treatment 
for complicated vascular anomalies.
Sirolimus treatment has been shown to sequester components of mTORC2, which acts upstream 
on AKT signaling. However, it has not alway s been associated with lesion size reduction and 
has significant side effects, which include immunosuppression 
(Le Cras et. al. 2019 ).
Alpelisib is an oral α-specific class I PI3K inhibitor belonging to the 2-aminothiazole class of 
compounds. I n biochemical assays, alpelisib potently  inhibits the p110α subunit of PI 3K (IC50 
= 4.6 nM) ≥ 50-fold compared to the other class I PI 3K isoforms (e.g. ,p110β I C50 = 1156 nM, 
p110δ IC50 = 290 nM, p110γ IC50 = 250 
nM), and it is inactive against most other kinases
(Fritsch et al. 2014). Alpelisib has demonstrated antitumor activity  in a variet y of cancer cell 
lines, particular lythose harboring PIK3CA mutations and i n xenograft models with mutated or 
amplified PIK3CA (Keegan et al. 2018
).Clinical studies have also demonstrated the antitumor 
Novartis Confidential Page 11
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL71 9F12002
activity  of alpelisib, especiall y in tumors with PIK3CA alterations, with a favorable safety 
profile (Juric et al. 2019 , Hoste et al. 2018 ).
Venot et al. (2018) describe da postnatal 
mouse model of PROS/CL OVES that partiall y 
recapitulates the human disease. The model demonstrated the efficacy  of alpelisib in preventing 
and improving organ dysfunction. The publication also describes how alpelisib was used in a 
compassionate use program to treat 19patients (adult and pediatric) with PROS. This 
publication describes improvement in the disease symptoms in all patients receiving alpelisib 
treatment. Previously intractable vascular 
malformations became smaller, clinical 
complications such as congestive heart failure ,hemihy pertrophy  and scoliosis improved. As 
reported in the publication, the treatment was not associated with substantial adverse effects. 
This series of cases provides the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibitio n as a 
promising therapeutic option in patients with PROS. It should also be noted that the 19 patients 
described in this publication are also intended to be included in this study  through abstraction
of data from medical charts into the study  database.
Novartis is supporting compassionate use requests to allow fortreatment with alpelisib for 
patients with severe and/or life-threatening PROS as part of an overarching MAP . As of 
November 2019, t his program has approved requests for the treatment ofover 100 patients from 
14countries ,of which 65 patients were expected to betreated with at least one dose of alpelisib
at least 24 weeks prior tothe planned cut-off date.Considering the meaningful number of 
patients that are being treated globally  with alpeli sib under compassionate use programs in this 
rare indication, this retrospective chart review will describe clinical and functional outcomes as 
well as safet yin patients with PROS before treatment with alpelisib and at key time-points after 
treatment init
iation .

6 Research methods
6.1 Stud y design
This study  will be a site-based retrospective non-interventional medical chart review of 
pediatric and adult male and female patients with PROS. This study  willabstract longitudinal
information that has been previously  recorded in the medical charts of patients with PROS to 
assess the efficacy andsafety  of alpelisib for the treatme nt of the heterogeneous manifestations 
of PROS .
Patient- level data will be abstracted from medical charts of all eligible patients at all 
participating sites and will be pooled and assessed. Trained personnel at each site will abstract 
medical chart data (see Section 6.4 for additional information) . Informed consent will be 
obtained prior to data abstraction, as appropriate, for eligible patients interested in participating 
in the study .
Patients with PROS who have received at least one dose of alpelisib initiated at least 24 weeks 
before the cut-offdate will be included . The index (baseline) date will be defined as the date of 
alpelisib initiat ion. The pre-index date period will be defined as the period from up to 24weeks 
prior to the index date through one day prior to the index date. The study period will be defined 
as the period from the index date up to the cut -off date ( Figure 6 -1).
The cut -off date (09 -Mar-2020) is selected to minimize the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic 
onthe data integrit y. Eligible patients who initiated alpelisib on or before 23-Sep-2019 will 
have relevant assessments expected to occur on or before 09
-Mar-2020. At that time of the cut-
off, COVID -19 pandemic did not have major consequences on the regular management of the 
patients in the countries participating in the MAP. 
Available information from all clinic visits during the pre-index date period will be abstracted; 
additionally , available prior PROS medications and PROS related surgical/vascular 
interventions will be collected since diagnosis.
Novartis Confidential Page 13
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL71 9F12002
During the study  period , all available data will be collected from index date up to the cut-off 
date. If a patient ha s discontinued treat ment prior to that date ,only data reported up to 30 day s 
after the last date of study  treatment will be abstracted and entered into the database .

Patients included will have received alpelisib through the following Novartis compassionate 
useprogram:
Managed Access Program ( MAP ):The initial 19 patients described by  Venot et al. 
(2018) received alpelisib under specific compassionate use regulations in France .Given 
the increase in compassionate use re quests for the treatment of PROS following the 
publication by  Venot et al. (2018) , Novartis issued a global MAP extending the treatment 
available under this program to additional patients worldwide . It should be noted that the 
MAP is not a company -sponsored clinical study ; rather, it provides common treatment 
guidance for phy sicians across the world requesting individual compassionate use under 
their local legislations with the phy sician ulti mately  remaining the “Sponsor”.
6.2.1 Inclusion criteria
Patients will be included in this study  if they  meet all of the following inclusion criteria:
1. Patient (adult or pediatric) is ≥ 2 years of age *
2. Patient has a physician confirmed /documented diagnosis of PROS*
3. Patient has a documented evidence of a mutation in the PIK3CA gene*
4. Patient’s condition was assessed by the treating physician as severe or life threatening and treatment was 
deemed necessary*
5. Patient has been treated with at least one dose of alpelisib , initiated on or before 23-Sep -2019 (i.e.at least 
24 weeks before the cut-offdate of the 09-Mar-2020 )
6. Patient has medical chart history available during enrollment in the MAP
7. Patient (in case of pediatric patient s assent and/or parent /guardian consent ) consented to participate in the 
study (as required by local ethics regulations)
* Inclusion criteria for MAP enrollment (assessed at the time of alpelisib initiation).
6.2.2 Exclusion criteria
None
6.3 Stud y endpoints and variables
The study  endpoints and variab les listed below will be assessed during the pre-index date period
and during the study  period until the cut-offdate. For reporting purposes, key time-points 
following the index date are defined and summarized in Table 6-
1along with their associated 
time windows .All time points available for each patient up to and including the cut-off date 
will be reported. 
Table 6-
1 Time windows for post -index date key -time point
Key time-points Allowed windows
4 weeks less than 10 weeks 
12 weeks 10 or more, but less than 20 weeks
24 weeks 20 or more, but less than 28 weeks
36 weeks 28 or more, but less than 40 weeks
Novartis Confidential Page 16
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
Key time-points Allowed windows
52 weeks 40 or more, but less than 58 weeks
End of study 4 weeks prior to last observation -min(study treatment 
discontinuation + 30 days, cut -off date)
The last interval, referred to as “end of study ” inTable 6-1, w ill include data available within 
the last 4 weeks prior to study  treatment discontinuation plus 30 days or cut-off date, whichever 
comes first When a patient discontinues treatment data will be reported in the “end of study ” 
time window as well as the one corresponding to the assessment (e.g.,a patient discontinued 
treatment at week 58 data will be reported in the key point 52 weeks interval and in the “end of 
study ”).
The list of variables associated with each endpoint was developed based on a feasibility 
assessment conducted with the participating site with the largest number of patients treated with 
alpelisib (located in France) and four additional sites (located in Spain, Australia, Ireland , and 
the United States of America ). Based on this feasibility  assessment, the variables listed below 
are expected to be available for most patients across most sites. However, due to the 
heterogeneity  of PROS manifestations, as well as variations in the patient follow - up schedule 
across MAP sites, information on certain variables may not be available or relevant to be 
collected for all patients included in this study . An expanded list of variables to be abstracted 
will be included in an annotated case report form .
All relevant and available information on the following endpoints and variables will be 
abstracted. When information isnot recorded/available in the patient medical chart fortheWeek 
24 lesion assessments , the reason for missing information will be documented. Missing data 
will be handled as described in Section 6.9.
In order to capture the heterogeneity  of PROS and support a more complete description of the 
patient experience with PROS, demogra phic including race and ethnicity  which were not 
described previously  for this disease, and clinical characteristics as well as physician narratives, 
imaging scans, 
photographs, and/or videos taken in a clinical setting will al so be abstracted, as 
available.
Patient characteristics will be described as of the index date, using the following information :

6.4 Data source
The data for this study  will be retrospectivel y abstracted from medical charts of eligibl e patients 
with PROS at participating clinical sites and treated with alpelisib . The data will also include 
imaging scans (i.e., MRI, CT scans) ,clinical photographs and/or videos, as available. This data 
should be sent to the contracted vendor (s)as appropriate
. Physician narratives will also be 
generated based on information recorded in the patients’ medical charts and will be entered in 
the eCRF . A detailed training plan will be developed and a ll data abstraction will be conducted 
by trained per sonnel at each participating site using an electronic data capture sy stem (EDC) .
6.5 Central review of imaging scans
The volume of the target and all other measurable non-target lesion(s) will be assessed by a 
central imaging vendor and the details of this review will be captured in the Independent Central 
Review Charter. Allavailable MRI scans, CTscans
, andphotographs will be shared with the 
vendor for assessment .Target lesions for the analysis of study endpoints will be independentl y 
selected by the central imaging review erusing available images from up to 12 weeks prior to 
the index date,prior to any assessment of images from later in the study  period .Central 
reviewers will take into consideration the clinical impact of the lesions .  
6.6 Stud y size/power calculation
This study  aims to collect medical chart information on patients eligible as per inclusion criteria 
with PROS at participating sites who have been treated with alpelisib . As a result, no formal 
sample size calculation has been perfor med. The precision of the estimate for different values 
of the response rate has been evaluated, assessing the widths of the 95% confidence interval 
(Table 6
-2). 
Novartis Confidential Page 20
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
Based on the feasibility  assessment condu cted at each MAP site that hasexpressed interest in 
participating in this study  in November 2019, the number of patients who satisfy  the study 
inclusion criteria will be approximately  65. Assuming that between 15 to 20% of patients ma y
not accept to parti
cipate in the study ,50 patients were considered for the estimation.

6.7 Data management
The data management process will be pre-specified in data management plan (DMP) 
document(s) or equivalent .
DMP document(s) will describe key activities related to data management and will include a 
detailed description of the following steps/procedures:
Systems used to collect, format, anal yze, and report data (e.g., EDC Platform , SDTM 
conversion software, Analy tic software )
EDC (electronic data capture) implementation, users, and s ystemaccess (e.g., the study  
team will
ensure that training is provided to all EDC users as appropriate to each user’s 
role; track ing of the name, role, and affiliation of all EDC users; following a database 
lock, the EDC database will be archived and stored on secure storage) 
Data review and cleaning process (e.g., each submitted eCRF will be reviewed and a list 
of queries resulting from the data review of each eCRF will be routed via the EDC 
platform to the sitepersonnel ).All necessary  edits will be made in the EDC sy stem by site 
personnel and will be automatically  recorded with an audit trail,including the reason for 
change .
Data entry  instructions (CCGs)
Database lock (e.g., following review andverification of the data, the 
eCRF of each 
patient on the EDC sy stem will be locked after investigator signature has been obtained on 
the data entered )
6.8 Data analy sis
All analyses will be performed by Novartis, and/or a designated CRO .SAS version 9.4 or later 
software will be used to perform all data anal yses and to generate tables, figures and listings .
This section outlines the anal yses that will be performed. The full anal yses planned will be pr e-
specified in the statistical anal ysis plan ( SAP).The SAP will be finalized and approved before 
the start of data collection .
The primary  and secondary  analyses for this study  will be descriptive in nature (estimation 
based) , and therefore, no hypothesis testing will be conducted. The data abstracted in this study 
will be summarized as described below. Descriptive analyses will be conducted where 
Novartis Confidential Page 21
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
continuous data will be summarized by  measures that may include the mean, SD, me dian, I QR, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical and binary  data will be presented by frequency count s
and percentages. All descriptive analy ses will be presented along with their 95% CIsas 
appropriate .
Demographic and clinical characteristics, as described i
n Section 6.3, will be listed and 
summarized.
6.8.1 Analysis of the 
primary  endpoint 
The primary  end point will be the proportion of patients with response at Week 24, as assessed 
by a central review of imaging scans. The primary analysis will be performed on all patients in 
the efficacy  population without missing response (complete case a nalysis).
Definition of target lesion
In the medical record ,it is anticipated that target lesions have been already  selected by the 
treating physician based on the clinical/functional impact of such lesions on the patient. The 
clinical /functional impact will be associated with at least one of the following: patient's 
complain ts, clinical sy mptoms, impaired organ function, and/or functional limitations affecting 
patient's every day life.
However, the t arget lesions will be independently selected by the central imaging review er
using pre-index date scans and clinical information regarding symptoms provided by the 
investigator. More details can be found in the Central I maging Site Manual.
In addition to the above , the target lesion may  be:
Anatomically  reproducibly  defined tissue(s) masses, composed of one or several tissue 
types
Accuratel y measurable by imaging technique, MRI or other imaging modality
Identified at index date and ideally  its size would be at least 2 cm in longest diameter at 
the index dat e(for each selected lesion)
Definition of non -target lesion
The non -target lesion consists of all other PROS -related anatomic lesions and may  include the 
following:
all anatomic lesions other than those 
selected as target lesions and may  be measured at 
radiologic assessment (including lesions less than 2cm on MRI )
anatomic lesions, limb/ truncal areas affected b y PROS, organomegal y when they may be 
measured onl y by caliper/ruler (e .g., circumference of changed limb or body  part)
truly non-measurable lesions ( e.g., superficial visual lesions, masses, organomegaly , 
PROS -related enlargement of anatomic area identified by  physical exam that is not 
measurable b y reproducible imaging technique)
Analysis population(s)
The full study population will include all patients that satisfy  the study  inclusion criteria. 
Novartis Confidential Page 22
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
The efficacy population is a subset of the full study  population , which will beused for the 
analysis of the primary  endpoint and include spatients who meet the following crit eria:
Patient had at least one target lesion.
Patient had an imaging scan performed on the index date (or up to 12 weeks prior to the 
index date) for at least one target lesion.
Definition of response
Patients included in the analy sis population for the primary  endpoint will be defined as 
responders if they  meet all of the following criteria :
Patient achieved ≥ 20% reduction from index date ( or up to 12 weeks prior) in the sum of 
target lesion volumes (1 to 3 lesions, via central radiological assessment) by the change 
between the index date and 24 weeks (+/ -4 weeks) following the index date
None of the individual target lesions has ≥ 20% increase from index date toWeek 24 (+/-
4 weeks)
Patient did not permanently  discontinue alpelisib prior to 24 weeks of treatment
Patient did not require surgery  as rescue therapy between index date and 24 weeks of 
treatment 
with alpelisib due to disease deterioration. 
No progression of non -target lesions at Week 24 (+/-4 weeks)
No appearance of new lesion at W eek 24 (+/-4 weeks)
Patients will be considered as having a missing response if volume assessment at 24 weeks (+/ -
4 weeks) following the index date was not performed and: 
Patient did not permanently  discontinue alpelisib prior to 24 weeks of treatment
Patient did not require surgery  as rescue therapy  between index date and 24 weeks of 
treatment with alpelisib due to disease deterioration.  
Patients will be defined as non-responders in all other cases. In particular, patients with MRI 
scan performed at Week 24 (+/-
4 weeks) for which the volumetric measurement of the selected 
target lesions (1 to 3 lesions, via central radiological assessment) cannot be calculated will be 
considered as non -responders.  
Disease progression at any assessment is defined as an increase of an y individual target 
lesions of ≥ 20% in volume from previous assessment, progression of non- target PROS 
lesions or appearance of a new PROS lesion.
Relative to non -target lesions, progression will be assessed for the lesions that are identified at 
index date (or up to 12 weeks prior) with available information at Week24(+/- 4 weeks) and 
new lesions . At W eek24 the central imaging reviewer will make a conclusion if overall level 
of non-target disease burden decreased or increased unequivocall y.
All patients in the efficacy  population without a missing response will be used for the primary 
analysis of the primary  endpoint (complete case analy sis). 
The overall efficacy  will be described by  considering the totality  of evidence provided by  both 
the primary  and secondary  endpoints, as well as physician narratives, clinical photographs 
and/or videos (if available) which will supplement quantitative findin gs and provide a more 
comprehensive assessment of the experience with alpelisib for patient with PROS .

not recovered/not resolved, r ecovered/resolved, recovering/resolving,
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown)
Adverse events will be summarized as:the number (%) of patients experiencing each adverse 
event , (the number (%) of patients experiencing any CTCAE grade 3 or highe r adverse event,
the number (%) of patients with serious adverse events, thenumber (%) of events related to 
treatment ,the number (%) of patients who received a concomitant or an additional treatment

Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
due to adverse event . For adverse events requiring dose interruption, the duration of interruption 
will be reported. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory  activities (MedDRA) 
terminology . The latest available MedDRA version at the time of the anal yses will be used.
The outcome of adverse events will be presented as the number (%) of patients with each 
outcome after an y eve nt (e.g., number [%] of patients that did not recover from any  event) . 
Undesirable medical signs identified by investigational results (such as vital signs, blood and 
urine laboratory , ECG, imaging) will be captured with the most appropriate adverse event term. 
6.9 Handling of missing data
As this is a retrospective non-interven tional study , information may not be systematicall y 
collected, resulting in some missing data. Method sof handling missing data for each of the 
study  variables will be detailed in the SAP.
Imaging scans for all measurable lesions may not be available for a ll patients on the index date. 
In such cases, the most recent imaging scan conducted during the 12 weeks prior to the index 
date will be considered as the imaging scan performed on the index date for these patients. This 
12 
-week window is being utilized based on feasibility  assessment of the likelihood of imagin g 
being availabl e at index date and a reasonable time period in which to review imaging data in 
the pre -index period. 
All data available for each patient and each variable will be collected during the pre-index and 
the study  period ;appropriate key time-points and associated time windows for the stud y period
(Table 6-1)will be used to analy ze the secondary  endpoints given there is no common 
asses sment schedule in clinical practice. The number of patients with missing values will be 
reported.
For the primary analysis,all patients in the efficacy  population without missing response will 
be used 
(complete case analy sis). 
Supportive analy ses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the primary  analysis
using the full efficacy  population .In particular ,a sensitivity  analysis will be performed where
missing volumetric assessments at Week24 will be multiply  imputed based on a missing at 
random (MAR) assumption for patients with missing response . The imputation model will 
include the longitudinal volumetric measurements (i.e. theMRI scans at index date and at Week 
48), the measurement at index date,as well as covariates such as age.  Additional details will 
be provided in the SAP. 
No imputation will be performed for the non -target lesions, only  lesions that have data at index 
date (or up to 12 weeks prior) and at weeks 24 (+/-4 weeks) will be used to define progression. 
6.10 Qualit y control
Quality  control measures will be implemented throughout all steps of the development and 
implementation of the eCRF as well as data coll ection, cleaning, and anal ysis.
While developing the eCRF, data validation checks at the point of data entry  will be 
implemented to prevent “out of range,” “missing,” or other checkable data entry  errors (e.g., 
Novartis Confidential Page 27
Non-Interventional Study Protocol v01 (Clean) BYL719/alpelisib/CBYL719F12002
ensuring that the age of patients meets eligibility criteria and that the dates entered for key 
events are chronologically  accurate) to determine if enter ed data have internal conflicts. These 
consistency  checks will be used as soft warnings (e.g., message snotify ing a potential issue with 
the chronology  of events and to revise the answer) while data abstractors complete the eCRF.
The eCRF will be developed using an EDC platform, which is compliant with Title 21 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 11). The EDC platform is a validated data capture 
software, which features electronic data capture, data change tracking, electronic signatures, 
and audit trail capabilities. The software allows for the creat ion ofdata checks and other features 
to support data quality , such as automated consistency  checks (e.g., consistency  and range 
checks) and “unknown/missing” options for data input. The platform will also allow for post-
hoc manual review of data for outliers and other inconsistencies not flagged in real-time and 
will prompt remote follow -up with investigational staff to review the outliers and 
inconsistencies and confirm/revise their previous entries in the EDC platform . For tracking 
purposes, a query  log and an audit log will be retained tomaintain a log of all queries and 
changes in data duri ng the quality  control process.
Upon receipt of the data, the study  team will make a copy  of the raw data and store it in a 
restricted access folder andconfirm that all expected data and variables are included, check ing
for completeness of all variables. Identif iedoutliers and other data inconsistencies not flagged 
electronically  will be manually  cross -check edwith records for all subjects incoordination with 
the sites to resolve identified data issues. Any necessary  modifications will be recorded in the 
EDC by the site and in the EDC audit logalong with the reason for change .
6.10.1 Data quality management
Novartis Data Management or designated CRO will assure database quality  processes are 
followed including review of the data entered into the eCRFs by investigational staff for 
completeness and accuracy , and in accordance with the data management plan or equivalent .
6.10.2 Data recording and document retention
In all scenarios, the physician must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , 
consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic 
and medical information, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information 
entered in the eCRF must be traceable to these source documents in the patient’s file.
The physician must give Novartis (or designee) access to all relevant source documents to 
confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. No information in source documents about the 
identity  of the patients will be disclosed.
The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6 Section 8) and as required by applicable 
regulations and/or guidelines. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent 
accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents (written and 
electronic) should beretained for a period of not less than twenty  five (25) years from the 
completion of the Clinical Trial unless Sponsor provides written permission to dispose of them 
or, requires their retention for an additional period of time because of applicable laws,
regulations and/or guidelines.

6.10.3 Site monitoring
Formal site monitoring will be performed as described in the Monitoring Plan for this study.
Novartis Trial Monitoring / designated CRO will assure compliance monitoring.
6.11 Data reliability  and relevance to address the research objectives
The variability  amongst PROS patients in symptomatology  and personalized treatment may 
result in difficulty  identify ing an average treatment effect.
Measures to address additional concerns regarding various types of biases (e.g . selection, 
investigator bias) arising from retrospective studies are detailed. All patients satisfy ing the 
inclusion criteria as outlined in Section 6.2 are included in the chart review study . However, 
note that all patients from the MAP who started alpelisib treatment at least 24 weeks ago will 
be contacted to be part of the chart review study  i.e., no pre -selection of MAP patients will be 
made. In addition, the investigator bias for the primar y outcome measure is mitigated by 
instituting an independent panel of radiologists who will review the target and non-target lesions 
based on available imaging scans. Furthermore, data reliabilit y, completeness and consistency 
checks are detailed in Section 6.10 and will be further explained in the DMP.
7 Protection of human subjects
This study  was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the GPP of 
the International Societ y for Pharmacoepidemiology  (ISPE 2016), the STROBE guidelines
(Von Elm et al. 2007 ), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.
Due to the limited number of patients with PROS currentl y receiving alpelisib treatment through 
a Novartis MAP, data abstracted as part of this study  may  be deemed personally  identifiable at 
some or all clinical site s.
Eligible subjects may  only  be included in t he study  after providing (witnessed, where required 
by law or regulation), Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) 
approved informed consent (assent for pediatric patients) unless this is not required per local 
laws and regulations .
If applicable, in cases where the subject's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according 
to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study  to the extent possible given 
his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement by 
personall y signing and dating the written informed consent document.
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (e.g. all of 
the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be 
documented in the subject source documents.
The date when a subject’s I nformed Consent / Assent was actuall y obtained will be captured in 
their eCRFs.
Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate docume nt a proposed informed consent /
assent form that complies with the ICH GCP guidelines and regulatory  requirements and is 
considered appropriate for this study .

Patients may obtain a copy  of their information that has been entered as part of this study  at any 
time. Patient smay also decide to rectify , oppose, delete, or limit this information at any time 
and at no consequence to themselves.
Participating clinical sites will be responsible for identify ing requirements at their institution
(e.g., IRB/IEC application) , collecting informed consent specific to the current study  (as 
necessary ), and submitting required documents to the relevant authorities ( as necessary ).
8 Management and reporting of adverse events/adverse 
reactions
As this is a study  based on secon dary use of data, no individual safet y reports will be made.
Safety  events and other safety-relevant results will be provided down to an individual level in 
datasets in the study  report. Adverse events are collected from the index date through 30 days 
after the last dose of study  treatment until the cut -off date. If any death occurs after the cut -off 
date but within 30 day s after the last dose of alpelisib, this event should still be repo rted.
In studies based on secondary  use of data with a safety-relevant result, reports of adverse 
events/adverse reactions will be summarized in the study  report (i.e., only the overall 
association between an exposure and an outcome will be presented). Relevant findings from the 
study  report can be included in the periodic aggregated regulatory  reports submitted to Health 
Authorities by  Novartis.
9 Plans of disseminating and communicating study  results
Upon study  completion and finalization of the study  report, the results of this non-interventional 
study  may be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicl y accessible database of 
results. Publications will comply  with internal Novartis standards and the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines .In addition, results obtain edfrom 
the current study  are intended for submission as primary  data to 
health authorities worldwide .
No individual investigator may publish on the results of this study without prior approval from 
Novartis .

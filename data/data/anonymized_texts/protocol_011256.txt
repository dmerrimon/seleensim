5 BACKGROUND Protocol #LAl20 14-1 
Page 16 of 44 
Lake wood-Amed ex Inc. has developed a novel class of synthetic broad spectmm 
antimicrobials, tenned bisphosphocins. Bisphosphocins™ function throu gh a n ovel directly 
bactericidal mechanism of action which is not mediat ed through a single receptor /target 
protein. The bis phosphocin ™ mechanism of actio n appears sp ecific for microbial 
mem branes with minimal effect on mamm alian cell membrane s. In addition to posses sing 
activity again st all the ESKA PE2 bacteria strain s, includin g those resistant to antibiotics, 
bisphosphocin s™ are effective against stationary , slow-growing , and bacteria encased in 
biofilm. Bisphosphocin s™ repre sent a new class of antimicrobial s and a potentially 
important new class of therapeu tics needed to ti·eat the increasing number of antibiotic 
resistant bacte rial and fungal infections. 
Nu-3 is a thy midine analogue with butylpho sphate blocking gro ups at both the 3' and 5' 
position s .... . 
Nu-3 exhibits effective in vitro spectrum of 
activity at killin g 70 different sti·ains of bacter ia, includin g all Catego1y A pathogens and in 
vivo infectio ns caused by Francisella tularensis , Helicobacter pylori , and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. 
Diabetic foot infections are one of the m ost common complications for people who s uffer 
from diabete s and a frequent cause of hospita lizationError! Reference source not found .. 
ccording to the American Diabetes Associatio n appro ximately 8.3% of the US population 
suffers from diabetes and in 2006 there were 65,700 non-ti · aumatic amput ations pe rfo1m ed on 
diabetics . In addition, almost ha lf of diabetic patients that have an amputation will develop 
an ulcer on the remainin g limb within 18 months after surge1y. The ti·eatinent of a diabetic 
foot infection is compli cated as it require s both antimicrobial therap y to cure the infection 
and prop er wound care management to heal the ulcer. Curing the infectio n is pa1ti cularly 
challenging since the infection tends to be polymicrobial in nature requiring a broad spec ti11m 
antibiotic , the ulcer is prone to re-infection , and the pathogenic bacteria are increasingly 
beco ming resista nt to most front line therapie s. In additio n, recent studies have estimated that 
appro ximately 60-80% of chroni c infections involve biofilm fonnation which makes the 
bacteria mo re resistant to ti·aditional antibiotic sError! Reference source not found. . proper 
anagement of an infected diabe tic foot ulcer requires an antimicrobial therapy to cure or clear 
the infection to allow proper wound mana gement or th erapy to heal the ulcer and prevent 
relapse. 
6 RATIONALE 
Nu-3 is a thymidine-based therapeu tic compound indicated for the reduction of pathogenic 
bacteria associated with chroni c diabetic foot ulcers. The animal data from both rodent and 
swine models of wound injmy and its anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial activity suggest that 
ti·eatment with Nu-3 may reduce and potentially eliminate pathogenic bacteria in patient s 
2 In recent years , the Infectious Diseases Society of America has highlighted a faction of antibiotic -
resistant bacteria (Enterococcus faecium , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter 
baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) -acronymically dubbed 'the ESKAPE 
pathogens' -capab le of 'escaping' the biocidal actio n of antibiotics and mutually representing new 
paradigms in pathogenesis , transmission and resistance.

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential with chronic diabetic foot ulcers.  The topical route of administration will be the appropriate 
method of delivery for humans.  The low order of toxicity in rodents suggests that Nu-3 has a 
very low risk of toxicity to humans at the proposed doses. The doses selected for evaluation 
are within the FDA guidelines of the recommended safety margin of one tenth of the 
NOAEL.   
 
Prior to determining the efficacy of Nu-3 in patients, safety of Nu-3 related to skin irritation  
was establi
shed in male and female healthy volunteers in a Human Repeat Insult Patch Test. 
Briefly, 20 microliters of positive control (0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate), test product (2% Nu-3 
in 0.85% saline), or negative control (0.9% saline) was randomly applied using occlusive 
patches to either abraded or non-abraded (intact) skin for 20 consecutive days on at least 30 
subjects. A total of 35 subjects completed the study and were scored on all six sites.  There 
was a difference among products for both abraded and intact skin sites. The conclusion from 
the study with regards to irritation was as follows: 
 
Abraded Skin: Positive Control > 2% Nu-3 > Negative Saline control 
 
Intact Skin: Positive Control > 2% Nu-3 = Negative Saline Control 
 
7 OBJECTIVE 
The
 objective of this study is to evaluate Nu-3 for safety, tolerability, and microbiological 
response to bacteria in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcer, but excluding any ulcer 
caused by an underlying DUSS Probing to Bone = “Yes”. 
This study will specifically examine the ability of different doses of Nu-3 to eliminate 
pathogenic
 bacteria in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers. Dose and regimen 
information will be obtained for future clinical studies of Nu-3. 
 
7.1 P
rimary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of a twice daily, 7-day repeat topical doses of Nu-
3 in adult m
ale and female patients with chronically infected diabetic ulcer. 
 
7.2 S
econdary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
 To assess the clinical and microbiological response to bisphosphocin™ Nu-3. 
 To support determination of the appropriate dose range of Nu-3 to be employed in 
future clinical studies. 
 
8 STUDY DESIGN 
8.1
 Overall Study Design 
This study is a Phase 1/2a prospective, multi-center, blinded, randomized (with respect to 
placebo), dose escalation, twice daily for 7 consecutive days study of Nu-3 solution 
admi
nistered topically in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcer.  
 
8.2 Number of Centers 
This study will be conducted at two to four investigative site. 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-1 
Lakewood-Amedex  Page 18  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential  
8.3 Cohorts 
The dose of Nu-3 administered will be escalated in five planned sequential cohorts, with 
10 subjects in each cohort, to be administered Placebo (0.9% saline) or Nu-3 doses of 0.1% 
solution 
of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 1), 1% solution of 
Bispho
sphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 2), 2% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-
3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 3), 5% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) 
(Cohort 
4), 10% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 5)  at twice 
da
ily for 7 consecutive days.  
 
Additional cohorts may be enrolled, if needed, as provided by protocol. 
 
8.4 Placebo Control 
In each Cohort, 8 subjects will be randomized to receive Nu-3, and 2 subjects will be 
randomi
zed to receive Placebo. 
 
8.5 Number of Subjects 
Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled, of which approximately 40 will be exposed to 
Nu-3. Numbe
rs may vary due to replacement of subjects, addition of cohorts as permitted by 
protocol, or
 stopping of study. 
 
8.6 Study Visits  
Subjects will have 5 nominally scheduled study visits:  Screening (Day -7 to -4 hours), Single 
Dose Visi
t (Day 1), Safety Review and Multiple Dose Visit (Day 2), Safety Review Visit 
(Day 9 ±1 day) and Final Visit (Day 15 ± 2 days).  Additional visits for screening procedures 
and/or f
ollow-up (e.g., in follow-up of Adverse Events) may be necessary.  
 
8.7 Study Duration 
From consent and screening through final visit, a subject’s duration of participation may vary 
between approximately 2 and 3 weeks. No individual subject will be randomized more than 
once in this study. 
 
8.8 Dose Selection and Rationale 
While mechanisms of the demonstrated therapeutic effect of Nu-3 in the animal models, and 
of 
the proposed therapeutic effect in humans, are unknown, structural characteristics of Nu-3 
have not suggested homology with any genetically encoded human biological molecule. 
There is no known suggestion of ligand-receptor specificity, and in particular no suggestion 
of immune system effect at the proposed doses. Preclinical studies have not suggested a 
species specificity for any pharmacodynamic effect.  
 
Accordingly, Nu-3 is not regarded as a higher-risk agent, and a conventional method for 
determination of maximum safe starting dose is considered appropriate for this first- in-human 
study. 
 
8.9 First Dose Plan 
The dosing schedule for all cohorts is intended to minimize potential risk to subjects’ safety. 
It is known that the types, severities, time courses and pharmacokinetic correlates of adverse 
effects observed in preclinical studies are not necessarily predictive of experience in human 
subjects, at any dose. This plan further recognizes that major acute toxicities of 
pharmaceuticals in human subjects may on rare occasions not be predicted by preclinical 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-1 
Lakewood-Amedex  Page 19  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential experience, warranting additional caution in administering first doses to humans. As such 
caution has been advised in particular regarding biopharmaceuticals, it is noted that Nu-3 is 
not categorized as a biopharmaceutical. A traditional risk-reduction strategy has been to 
apply large safety factors (divisors of human equivalent doses corresponding to NOAELs in 
appropriate animal toxicology models) in determining the Maximum Safe Starting Dose for 
first-in-human study. A further risk-reduction strategy, adopted here, is to separate first and 
second exposures more widely in time than has been typical study procedures.  
 
Preclinical experience suggests that possible adverse effects after a single dose topical 
exposure to NU-3 would be unlikely. Accordingly, the dose plan is as follows: 
 Qualified patients for all Cohorts are screened from Day -7 to -4 hours. Patients 
unde
rstand (disclosed in informed consent) that their qualification for enrollment is 
not finalized until the time of enrollment. They understand that their order of 
enr
ollment is randomly determined.  
 On Day -7 to -4 hours, baseline procedures are performed (demographics and medical 
history, and limited physical examination per protocol, urine pregnancy test (if 
applicable), baseline laboratory tests (blood chemistries, hematology, coagulation 
profile, and urinalysis), and baseline subject disease assessments).  
 On Day 1, the patients is randomized and dosed to either Nu-3 or Placebo. 

 On the next following day, Day 2, if the Investigator observes no dose-limiting 
tox
icity (Section 8.10.6) in the patient dosed on Day 1, the Investigator will distribute 
the investigational product kit and instructed to apply the product twice daily for one 
(1) week (7 days). 
 If the Investigator observes a suggestion of dose-limiting toxicity, the procedure 
specified in Section 8.10.3 is followed. 
 
8.10 Safety Review 
8.10.1 Safety Review Committee  
Membe
rship of the Safety Review Committee includes the Sponsor’s designated Medical 
Monitor, the Medical Director of the CRO, Medical Director of Lakewood Amedex, and 
other member(s) as deemed appropriate by Sponsor.  
 
8.10.2  Safety Review Procedure  
Decisions regarding dose escalation and/or modification (including option of next cohort 
repeating at same dose, or doses intermediate to or reduced from those planned per protocol) 
are based upon review by the Safety Review Committee of safety data to the date of the 
Safety Review Visit (including data at least through the Day 8 Safety Review Visit) for the 
current cohort and safety data of the preceding cohorts to the date of the Safety Review Visit.  
 Safety Review meeting may be conducted by teleconference.  

 Decisions of the Safety Review Committee must be unanimous among the members 
pa
rticipating in the review and are recorded in meeting minutes.  
 Draft minutes of Safety Review Committee meetings are reviewed by all members 
who 
attended. Proposed changes are reviewed by all members who attended. Final 
draft of minutes is approved by consensus.  
 Individual members’ approvals of final draft minutes are documented to study 
re
gulatory file.  
 Final draft of minutes is placed in study regulatory file and provided to IRB.

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential 8.10.3  Cohort 1 Day 1a Experience  
If a Subject dosed on Day 1 of Cohort 1 experiences any therapeutic adverse event around the 
wound area: 
 Further dosing of Cohort 1 is suspended. 

 The Safety Review Committee meets to consider available safety data. 

 The Safety Review Committee decides and documents rationale for further course of 
a
ction, which may include resumption of study conduct. 
8.10.4 Unblinding for Safety Review  
I
f the Safety Review Committee decides that unblinding of dose randomization is necessary 
for decision regarding continued dosing and/or dose escalation, the unblinding is done in a 
manner that minimizes the extent of unblinding and of its potential effects on assessments of 
adverse events. This action is documented in the minutes of the Safety Review Committee 
meeting. 
8.10.5 Decision Criteria 
8.10.5.1  Stoppi
ng of Dose Administration and/or Escalation 
Further study drug dose administration or escalation will be stopped: 
1. by Sponsor, for any reason at any time; 
2.
 by Principal Investigator or Safety Review Committee, if subjects’ safety is 
c
onsidered to be at unacceptable risk; 
3. by Safety Review Committee, according to these criteria: 

 If 2 or more of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, 
dose escalation is stopped; 
 If 1 of the Nu- 3-treated subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort is 
ex
panded to include 4 additional subjects ( Nu-3:Placebo ratio of 3:1); 
and 
 If 2 or more of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in the expanded cohort (of 
8+4=12 subjects) experience a DLT, dose escalation is stopped;  
 If only 1 of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in the expanded cohort 
experiences a DLT (i.e., no additional subjects experience a DLT 
following cohort expansion), stopping of dose escalation is not 
required. 
8.10.5.2  Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Dose-Limiting Toxicity in an individual subject is defined as any Grade 2 or higher Adverse 
Event (AE) toxicity according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE – See Appendix 16.1) that is considered by the 
Inv
estigator to be at least possibly related to study drug.  
 
8.10.5.3  Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
If dose escalation is stopped according to criteria of 8 .10.4 and the Safety Review Committee 
does not decide to administer a dose lower than the level at which dose escalation was 
stopped and higher than the next lowest tested level, the next lowest tested level will be 
considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).   
 
8.11 Subsequent Cohort Dose Plan 
Anticipated Dose Plan – Upon completion of Safety Review of experience to date, if the 
Safety Review Committee determines that there is no reason to do otherwise, the dose plan 
for the subsequent cohort is: 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-1 
Lakewood-Amedex  Page 21  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential  Randomization and dosing proceed no sooner than 7  days after the last Day 1 dosing 
of the preceding cohort.  
 Dose of study drug administered to subjects in the next cohort is the next higher dose 
a
nticipated by protocol (e.g., 1% Nu-3 solution dose cohort after 0.1% Nu-3 solution 
dose cohort). 
 Ten subjects are randomized such that eight dose with Nu- 3 and two dose with 
Placebo. 
 A single subject is dosed at a given scheduled time. 
 Dosing  of successive subjects are separated in time by an interval that may vary 
be
tween cohorts but must be at least 20 minutes. Safety Review Committee may 
specify this interval.

9.2 Withdrawal of Subjects 
A subject must be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following 
reasons: 
 Whenever the subject decides that it is in his/her best interest to withdraw 

 Whenever the investigator decides that it is in the subject’s best interest to be 
withdra
wn 
 An adverse event or illness which may, in the investigator’s opinion, significantly 
affect the subject or study 
 Non-compliance 
 Sponsor administrative reasons. 
 
W
ithdrawal of consent for follow-up should be accompanied by documentation of the reason 
for withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal 
of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact 
follow-up, e.g., medical records checks. Subjects requesting withdrawal should be informed 
that withdrawal of consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. 
 
Subjects who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible adverse 
events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited 
should be documented.

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential Preferably the subject should withdraw consent in writing and, if the subject or the subject’s 
representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the 
reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. The informed consent for the 
study should note that although a subject is free to leave the study and stop taking study 
medication, the investigators hope the patient will remain for follow up status evaluations. 
 
Data from subjects who withdraw from the study will still be used in the statistical analysis. 
A decision to replace a withdrawn subject will be made on a case- by-case basis after 
discussions between the investigator, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor.  Generally speaking, a 
subject who does not meet the definition of “evaluable” (i.e., received investigational product 
and has returned for the Day 2 follow-up visit) may be replaced. However, all subjects, 
whether withdrawn or not, will be included in ITT population for safety evaluations of Nu-3.

10.4 Study Drug Handling and Storage 
10.4.1 Handling and Storage 
Upon 
arrival of study drug shipping container at the investigative site, it is immediately 
opened by pharmacy personnel in a secure location, and contents are verified to match the 
shipping documentation. 
 
Study drug is stored at the investigative site in a secure location routinely accessible only to 
Pharmaceutical Services personnel, under these environmental conditions: at ambient 
temperature. 
 
10.4.2 Study Drug Accountability 
The
 investigative site maintains records of study drug accountability and reconciliation 
throughout the course of the study. Records show the amount(s) of study drug received from 
Sponsor, administered to subjects, wasted/lost (with description of circumstances), and 
returned to Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee. Only subjects enrolled and randomized in this 
study may receive study drug.

10.5 Randomization 
Subjects are assigned to dosing with Nu-3 or Placebo according to the randomization 
sche
dule prepared prior to study start and provided by Sponsor/CRO.  In the event that an 
expanded or unscheduled cohort is added, Sponsor/CRO will provide the randomization 
schedule for that cohort prior to admission of the cohort to the investigative site. The 
randomization scheme was predetermined and ordered in blocks of five (5). Five study kits 
are provided to each investigational site utilized to maintain the randomization scheme. 
 
10.6 Blinding and Unblinding 
This is a double-blind study. The randomization schedule for each cohort is provided by 
Sponsor/CRO as a sequential list in a sealed envelope. At the investigative site, procedural 
preca
utions are taken to avoid unblinding due to visual inspection of Nu-3 and/or Placebo 
pre
pared for dosing. 
 
Unblinding occurs only in the event of an Adverse Event, or pregnancy of a subject’s partner, 
and only if knowledge of the administered study drug is judged likely to affect the medical 
treatment decisions related to the subject or pregnant partner, or if required for decision-
making by the Safety Review Committee. In the event of unblinding, the Investigator notifies 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of breaking the blind and provides formal, written 
documentation to the Sponsor within 5 working days. This documentation includes the 
identity of the individual(s) who have become aware of randomization assignment(s), the 
date on which the blind was broken, and a description of the event motivating the unblinding. 
The Investigator also records in relevant source documents that blind was broken, reason for 
unblinding, and the date/time of that occurrence.  
 
The Safety Review Committee may request unblinding to assist in Safety Review and 
decisions regarding further conduct of study. To the extent possible while meeting the need 
for appropriate Safety Review, the Investigator and other investigative site personnel are not 
unblinded. The existence of unresolved Adverse Events at the time of unblinding is given 
consideration. If an Investigator is unblinded, that Investigator is not subsequently involved 
in the management or assessment of AEs for Subjects whose dose assignments have been 
unblinded.  
 
10.7 Study Drug Preparation 
Study drug is kept under supervision of pharmacy personnel until delivered to the area 
designated for study drug administration.

Drug to study.  Test Product will be administered to the infected diabetic foot ulcer and 
surrounding intact skin at a dose of 3 drops from a dropper bottle per 1 cm2 of ulcer area.  
 
After
 application of the Test Product is complete, the wound will be left open to air for 5 min 
and then will be dressed as per the following: Owens Gauze will be trimmed to cover the 
entire dimension of the ulcer and overlaid into the ulcer. Gauze dressings (2 x 2 inches) will 
be placed over the Owens Gauze to a depth of 1/4 inch followed by a circumferential wrap of

dressing as to not come in contact with the underlying skin. 
 
10.8.2 Dispositi on of Dose Administration Materials 
Following study drug administration, materials possibly containing remaining visible study 
drug or Placebo solution are placed in a closed container and returned to the Pharmacy for 
storage at ambient temperature until shipped to the Sponsor. 
 
11 Concomitant Medications and Exposures 
 
11.1
 Prior Medications  
All medications and herbal supplements used by a patient within 14 days prior to screening 
are recorded in the medical history.  Dose, frequency, and purpose of use are recorded, as 
best the volunteer can recall.  
 
11.2 Conco
mitant Medications 
The Investigator notifies the Medical Monitor regarding all medications taken by a subject 
during study participation, for treatment of Adverse Events or pre-existing conditions.  
 
12 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS AND CONDUCT OF STUDY 
S
ubjects can be screened up to seven days to 4 hours before treatment. Subjects who have 
been found eligible for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will have the 
study explained in detail. If the subject decides to participate in the study, the subject will be 
given a study specific ICF to sign. Only after the subject undergoes the informed consent 
process and provides a written informed consent, the screening evaluations shall be 
performed. Subjects can be consented at any time once identified by the site study staff as 
potentially eligible. 
If a female of child-bearing potential is found to be pregnant, or is planning to become 
pregnant within one week of administering the study medication, then she is not eligible for 
the study. 
Male or female patients of at least 18 years of age are candidates for this study. If the patient 
may meet entry criteria, the patient will be informed about the study. The investigator should 
also consider the patient’s risk of injury prior to screening. Even after the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are reviewed, if the investigator considers the patient a risk for injury, the 
patient should not be enrolled in the study. 
 
12.1 Informed Consent 
All patients are to give informed consent in accordance with the origins of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and applicable regional regulatory requirements (e.g. 21 CFR Part 50).  
The patient will sign the Informed Consent Form before she/he enters the study, i.e., before 
screening bloods, screening assessments or any other study-related activity. The patient will 
be given sufficient time to consider the study’s implications before deciding whether to 
participate. The format and content of the ICF must be agreed upon by Lakewood Amedex 
and the Institutional Review Board. 
Should there be any amendments to the final protocol; the patient must agree to sign the 
amended ICF indicating that they re-consent to participate in the trial.

Medical Silhouette™ as described in Appendix A  
 
A past medical/surgical history will be recorded for any conditions or treatments that are, in 
the opinion of the investigator, relevant to the current diagnosis.  The previous condition will 
be recorded as a diagnosis rather than a previous symptom. The time of the previous 
diagnosis relative to the current admission will be provided (i.e., “6 months ago”) to the best 
of the patient’s knowledge. If the diagnosis was more than two years ago, then it can be 
recorded as “more than two years ago”. 
 
Prior medications will be recorded. Prior medications include medications that the patient is 
currently taken or has taken within the past fourteen days. 
 
Physical examinations are performed at screening by the investigator or designee.  The 
screening examinations will include general appearance, height, weight, skin, neck, eyes, 
ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, extremities, and 
nervous system. Height is measured in stocking or bare feet, and recorded in centimeters 
(cm). Weight is recorded in kilograms (kg). 
 
Results of these investigations/assessments and baseline measurements obtained from the 
local laboratory will be reviewed by the Investigator prior to the start of the treatment. 
Patients who do not meet study entry criteria will be promptly notified and excluded from 
further participation in the study. Patients who continue to meet entry criteria will be enrolled 
in the study and assigned a patient number by the database. The patient can be randomized at 
any time following the screening.

of-study visit on Day 15. Adverse events will be specifically assessed by observation at Day 
1 following administration of the first dose of investigational product, at Day 2 following the 
sec
ond dose administration, at Day 9 visit and at Day 15 visit. Abnormal and clinically 
significant measurements obtained from the local lab will be used to note adverse events. 
 
Vital sig
ns (blood pressure and heart rate) can be monitored per hospital/site protocol 
following administration of the first dose of investigational product, and at Day 2 following 
the second dose administration. Deviations from normal will be recorded as adverse events.  
 
13 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY

Physical examinations are performed at screening and at the Day 15 End of Study Visit.  The 
ex
aminations will include general appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, 
lungs, abdomen, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, extremities, and nervous system. Height 
is measured in stocking or bare feet, and recorded in inches, at screening. Weight is recorded 
in pounds at screening and Day 15 visit. 
 
13.2 Vital S
igns 
Vital Signs, including one or more of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and 
temperature, are recorded at screening, at Day 1 visit, at Day 2 visit, at Day 9 visit, and at the 
Day 15 F
inal Visit. See Schedule of Events for detail.

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential  
Consistent BP measurement in one arm is preferred to facilitate comparisons of serial BP 
measurements.  However, optimal performance of other procedures (e.g., blood sampling) 
may require changing BP measurement from one arm to the other.  
 
The investigator or designee will perform a thorough physical examination at the start of the 
study and brief physical examination at 15 days post dose administration. Any changes in the 
overall health and well-being of the subject during the study will be reported as an adverse 
event. If the subject is unable to return for the 15 day visit, then the physical exam is not 
mandator
y.  In this case, the subject’s well-being may be assessed by phone. 
An investigator will be in the premises during the investigational product administration and 
on call until the end of the study. 
13.3 Clinical chemistry 
A CMP (biochemistry and hematology) will be performed by the local lab at screening, and 
then repeated at Day 9 and Day 15 after the first dosing. Changes from baseline will be 
assessed as a safety parameter. If a change in a clinical chemistry parameter is observed and 
considered to be clinically significant by the investigator, the observation will be written up 
as an adverse event. 
 
13.4 Adverse events 
Subjects will be monitored for any adverse events throughout the screening and until the end-
of-study visit on day 15. Adverse events will be specifically assessed by observation at D ay 1 
following administration of the first dose of investigational product, at Day 2  following the 
second dose administration, at Day 9 visit  and at Da y 15 visit .  
 
The recording of adverse events is an important aspect of study documentation. It is of utmost 
importance that all staff members at the site involved in the study are familiar with the 
content of this section in order to document all adverse events according to the detailed 
guidelines set out below. During the study where there is safety evaluation, the principal 
investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and 
SAEs. 
 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  Events that are expected as a result of a 
procedure (other than drug administration of investigational product) that the subject 
undergoes should not be listed as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected or 
deemed significant by the Principal Investigator. 
 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the medical staff and sponsor in identifying 
any untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  
1. protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2.
 a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3. re cognition of dose-related test article toxicity; 
4. appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5. improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6. adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.   
 
Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient (or “primary 
operational component” for devices) or vehicle/placebo being tested or used as a reference in 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-1 
Lakewood-Amedex  Page 32  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may be either spontaneously reported or 
elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be completely 
recorded on the within the electronic source document system. If known, the Investigator 
should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual 
symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test 
article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study 
will receive follow-up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE that caused 
permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE 
was considered by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to test 
article
. 
 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any adverse events that may occur during 
the study. At each visit, the investigator will ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about 
any change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit. 
 
The 
severity of each adverse event, as judged by the Investigator, will be graded according to 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.02 (CTCAE). For AEs not listed in the 
CTCAE table, the severity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be 
classified as follows (consistent with CTCAE): 
 
Grade 1 Mild  - asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate - minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. 
Grade 3 Severe  - medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization indicated; disabling;  limiting self-care 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening  - urgent intervention indicated. 
Gr
ade 5 Death  - Death related to AE. 
 
The 
investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to the 
following categories: 
 
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and 
that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage, and reappearance 
of the event on repeated exposure (re-challenge). 
Probable - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and 
that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the test article; 
and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness or other drugs, 
procedures, or other causes. 
Possible - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; but 
may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other 
causes. 
Unlikely  - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-1 
Lakewood-Amedex  Page 33  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other 
drug, procedure, or other causes. 
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. For the purposes of prescription drug labelling, the term adverse reaction means an 
undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its 
pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug
 caused the event.  
 
For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
An event that is a serious adverse event (SAE)  must be recorded on the AE eCRF and 
requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opinion of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 Life-threatening event. 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.   
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
 Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen. A hospitalization planned after the index 
admission, such as a staged PCI procedure, or a planned prolonged hospitalization, 
such as coronary artery bypass surgery related to the index admission, will not be 
considered an SAE.   
 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission.

Lakewood-Amedex  Page 34  of 44  
 
LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential The Medical Monitor, Lead Principal Investigator, or Sponsor may be consulted with any 
questions regarding the definition of “planned”. The Medical Monitor may be consulted 
regarding other questions about SAEs. 
 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to the 
Medical Monitor, Safety Officer or designee to comply with regulatory requirements. All 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by 
telephone to the Medical Monitor, Safety Officer or, in the event that neither is 
available, to the Project Manager listed on the first page of the protocol.  All SAEs 
should be entered in the eCRF as soon as possible. These include those SAEs listed in the 
protocol or Investigator Brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.   
 
All SAE are required to be captured on the study supplied SAE report form. Please contact 
the Safety Officer at   
 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. In the event 
of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Sponsor or 
designee, if available. 
 
As required, the Sponsor or designee will notify participating investigators of all suspected 
adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an 
IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar 
days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the 
criteria listed in Section 312.32(c)(1)(i) to (iv) of the CFRs. These are: 
 Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, 
 Findings from other studies including epidemiological studies, pooled analyses or 
other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the test 
articles, 
 Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans 
exposed to the test articles, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the 
expected human exposure, and 
 Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse 
reactions. 
 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the ICF 
requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting 
any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by the 
investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations. 
 
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as SAEs if they become serious. AEs will be collected 
starting when the subject signs the ICF and ending with the end-of-study visit on Day 15. For 
subje
cts who withdraw from the study, the collection of AEs will end 15 days after the first 
dose 
administration. If any adverse event is present when a subject completes the study or if a

14 ASS ESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
14.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Assessment 
The primary efficacy endpoint is to assess the microbiological response to bisphosphocin™ 
Nu-3 as determined by reduction of pathogenic bacteria following Nu-3 treatment. The 
microbiological assessments from the local lab will be used to measure aerobic and anaerobic 
culture and sensitivity at screening, after a single dose treatment (Day 1), after a second dose 
treatment (Day 2), after twice daily for 7 day treatment, at Day 15.  
 
14.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Assessment 
The primary efficacy endpoint is to assess the clinical response to bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 as 
deter
mined by visual evaluation of the ulcer following Nu-3 treatment.  The measurement of 
this variable will be determined by the DUSS score at screening, after a single dose treatment 
(Day 1), after a second dose treatment (Day 2), after twice daily for 7 day treatment, at Day 
15. 
 
15 P HARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENT 
There are no pharmacokinetic assessments being conducted in this study.  
 
16 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Nu-3. Safety will be assessed by 
monitoring
 clinical laboratory parameters and treatment emergent adverse events. Efficacy 
will be assessed using endpoints of the clinical and microbiological response to Nu-3   
 
Sa
fety data including laboratory evaluations and vital signs assessments are summarized by 
dose group and time point of collection. Descriptive statistics are calculated for quantitative 
safety data, and frequency counts are compiled for classification of qualitative safety data. In 
addition, a mean change from baseline table is provided for vital signs and a shift table 
describing out of normal range shifts is provided for clinical laboratory results. 
 
For all parameters, a comparison will be made of each active treatment group versus placebo 
using the appropriate statistical test. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential two-sided and differences will be considered statistically significant if the associated p-value 
is less than 0.05. All data will be presented in data listings. 
 
A formal statistical analysis plan will be provided in a separate document. The Statistical 
Analysis Plan will contain additional details of the planned analysis along with tables, listings 
and figures that will become part of the Clinical Study Report. The Statistical Analysis Plan 
will be finalized prior to the database lock. 
 
16.1 Justification of Sample Size and Power Analysis 
This is a pilot dose-ranging study.  No sample size calculations were conducted.  
 
16.2 Analysis Populations 
All randomized subject will be accounted for in a listing for subject disposition. All 
randomized subjects will be included in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population. All subjects 
administered any amount of investigational product will be included in the Safety population. 
The per-protocol (PP) population will include all subjects who meet enrollment criteria and 
receive all doses of investigational product as required by the protocol and who have no 
major protocol violations.  Major protocol violations are defined as follows: 
1. Failure to properly obtain consent or subject not consented prior to dosing. 
2. Subject not meeting the entry criteria and enrolled without a written waiver. 
3. Subject randomized in the incorrect treatment arm. 
4. Subject given incorrect dose (overdose/under-dose). 
5. Data not available from the post-dose central laboratory assessment. 
6. Failure to complete the study. 
7. Performing study procedure(s) not described in the approved protocol. 
All safety and efficacy analyses will be performed on all populations.  
 
16.3 Interim Analysis 
A safety review will be conducted after each cohort to confirm proceeding to the next dose 
level.  
 
16.4 Analysis of Baseline Data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, median, standard deviation (SD), 
minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and 
percentages.

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential 16.5 Analysis of Primary Outcome Measu re 
The microbiological response of Nu-3 to eliminate pathogenic bacteria will be determined for 
each group.  Aerobic and anaerobic culture and sensitivity will be assessed at screening, after 
a single dose treatment (Day 1), after a second dose treatment (Day 2), after twice daily for 7 
day treatment, at Day 15. An uncorrected chi-square analysis or a Fisher’s Exact test will be 
used to compare each treatment group to the placebo group. An associated p-value less than 
0.05 will be used to define statistical significance.  An associated p-value less than 0.016 
(0.05 ÷ 5; Bonferroni correction) will be considered highly conclusive.

17 REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES 
17.1
 Subject Information and Informed Consent 
The risks and benefits of participating in the study, including their right to withdraw at any 
time, will be verbally explained to each potential subject prior to entering the study. Prior to 
any screening tests or procedures for the study, the subject must sign and date the IRB/IEC 
approved informed consent form (which also defines the risk and benefits of participating in 
the study).  
 
The investigator shall seek consent only under circumstances that provide the subject 
sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the 
possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that is given to the subject shall 
be in language understandable to the subject. No informed consent may include any 
exculpatory language through which the subject is made to waive or appear to waive any of 
their legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, Lakewood Amedex, the 
institution, or its agents from liability for negligence. The subject, or legal guardian, must be 
able to comprehend the informed consent form and sign prior to subject enrollment. 
 
The study sponsor must agree with the final IRB/IEC-approved consent form prior to 
initiation of the study. The original signed consent forms will be retained by the Investigator 
and a copy provided to each subject.  
 
If any significant new information develops during the conduct of the study which may affect 
the subject’s willingness to continue participation, written consent for continued participation 
in the study must be obtained from each subject.

source documentation SureSource™ Source documents include signed informed consent 
forms, written progress notes, laboratory reports, etc. All source documents and subject 
assessments must be maintained at the investigator site. The site staff will use caution to 
avoid any unblinding through normal reading lab reports, clinical notes, pharmacy reports, 
etc. 
 
Any corrections should be made by a single line drawn through the entry, adding the correct 
information, initialing and dating by the person making the change, and preferably indicating 
why the change was required. 
 
18.2 Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
Case Report Forms will not be utilized for LAI2014-1. All study information will be captured 
directly in the electronic source documentation system SureSource™. The Principal 
Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled at their 
investigational site. All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and 
verified for completeness and accuracy by the investigator.  A copy of each subjects enrolled 
at a specific investigational site will be provided to the Principal Investigator at the 
completion of the study. 
 
19 MONITORING, AUDIT, RETENTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDY

includes accurate documentation of investigational product accountability. 
 
All case report forms (eCRFs) will be kept up to date and the Principal Investigator will be 
responsible for reviewing each subject’s completed eCRFs. These will be reviewed by the 
sponsor/CRO at regular intervals to ensure protocol compliance, compare eCRFs with 
original source documents for accuracy and completeness of data recording, review study 
logs to assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to 
pertinent regulatory requirements. Periodically, the facilities used in the study may be 
reviewed. The review of the subject’s medical records will be performed in a manner that 
subject confidentiality is maintained. 
 
In addition, a study center may be audited in depth for study quality assurance by Lakewood 
Amedex, a CRO or an external auditor on behalf of Lakewood Amed ex, or inspected by a 
national regulatory authority (such as the FDA or its equivalent) with or without prior 
notification, at random or for cause. The audit may include review of all source documents,

source data will be required for inspections/audits, which will be carried out giving due 
consideration to data protection and subject confidentiality. 
 
The Investigator must arrange for retention of study documents according to specific country 
requirements/regulations, after the last approval of a marketing application and until there are 
no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the ICH region or at least two years 
have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product. These documents may be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with Lakewood Amedex. It is Lakewood 
Amedex’s responsibility to inform Investigator/Institution as to when these documents no 
longer need to be retained. Regardless of the above time frame, destruction of study records 
at any time requires confirmation by Lakewood Amedex. Lakewood Amedex shall retain 
ownership of all CRFs, data analyses, and reports that result from this study. 
 
Monitors, auditors and other authorized agents of Lakewood Amedex, the CRO, the IRB/IEC 
approving this research, the FDA, and others (as applicable) will be granted direct access to 
the study subjects’ original medical records for verification of clinical study procedure and 
data, without violating the confidentiality of the subjects, to the extent permitted by the law 
and regulations. Any presentations of the results of the study at meetings or in publications 
will not contain subject names. 
 
 
20 STUDY TERMINATION 
The
 study may be terminated by the investigator or the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, clinical observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to 
continue, he or she may stop the study.  A study termination by the investigator will be 
reported to the sponsor. 
 
In addition, a written statement fully documenting the reasons for this action will be 
submitted to the Sponsor by the Investigator within five working days. 
 
In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate 
notification will be given to the Investigator.

 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  A  Phase I/IIa, Randomized Double Blind , Placebo -Controlled,  
Dose Escalating Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of 
Topically Applied Bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3 on Infe cted Diabetic 
Ulcers of Subjects  With Type I or II Diabetes Mellitus  
Phase:  I/IIa 
Population:  Up to 30 subject s over 18 years of age  suffering from diabetes 
mellitus and a chronic infected diabetic ulcer (s). 
Number of Sites:  2 
Study Duration:  6 months  
Subject Participation Duration:  44 days (includes screening visit, study treatment and all follow -ups 
visits through Day 15 post treatment.  
Description of Agent or 
Intervention:  Bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3 to be applied as a topical solution to the 
ulcer and covered by a bandage.  This study includes three dose 
ascending cohorts.  Within each cohort there are two phases with 
both a single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose arms . The 
three dose levels (cohorts) are  0.1% ( 1mg/ml , anticipated low do se), 
1% ( 10mg/ml , anticipated therapeutic dose, and 2% ( 20mg/ml , 
anticipated high dose).  
Objectives:  Primary:   To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses 
of topically applied bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3, 
 
, to an open infected ulcer.  Assessment of safety will be 
determined by visual evaluation  of the ulcer, vital signs, CBC 
analysis, CMP analysis, and physical exami nation, as well as the 
incidence and severity of emergent adverse events that occur during 
the study participation.  The study will be monitored by the Safety 
Monitoring Committee (SMC).  
Secondary:  To assess the clinical and microbiological response to 
bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3 administered topically to the ulcer, including 
the improvement of wound appearance and elimination of the 
pathogenic bacteria.

Enrollment  Model: Sequential Assignment  
Masking: Double Blind ( Subject , Caregiver, Investigator)  
Primary Purpose:  Safety  
Description of Study Design  Phase I/IIa, three cohort ascending dose with two dosing arms per 
cohort , study in Type I  or II diabetes mellitus subject s with a 
chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score of 
0 to 3 and DFI wound score of 1 to 9 .  The study proposes to use 
the same subject  in SAD Arm 1 and M AD Arm 2 of each cohort  
The stud y is designed to run the cohorts in series with the 
completion of the first cohort before initiating the next dosing level.  
At all study visits the ulcer will be visually examined for any 
changes and photographed using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ 
system  that will calculate area and depth of the ulcer.  
In Arm 1, eligible subjects will be treated with a single application 
of Nu -3 or placebo in 4 to 1 ratio to judge the initial safety of Nu -3 
over a brief one (1) hour  interval and 24 -hr interval  post 
applic ation . Bisphosphocin Nu -3 will be applied topically to the 
chronic infected ulcer, covered with a non -abrasive bandage 
following the initial observation period.  The subject will be 
released with verbal instructions to leave the bandage on the wound 
and re turn for a follow up visit within 24h ± 2h.  At the follow up 
visit, the bandage will be removed, the ulcer visually examined and 
the subject cleared for the MAD Arm 2 based on the 
recommendation of the PI and absence of any SAEs.   
In Arm 2, eligible subj ects which are those who have been 
approved by the PI after the Visit 2 examination will be instructed 
in the proper application of bisphosphocin Nu -3.  The subjects will 
be observed applying the first dose in the clinic to ensure 
compliance. Subjects will  then be given a 7 day supply and sent 
home to continue treatment.  Visit 4 or earlier in the case of any 
adverse events, subjects will return to the clinic for an examination, 
including visual examination of the ulcer, vital signs, adverse 
events, photo d ocumentation, collection of a sample for 
microbiology and concomitant medication use.  A final follow up 
visit will be scheduled +7 days after last dose of study medication  
(Day 15)  for a complete examination as described above.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background Information  
Infectious disease represents a growing threat to world health due to the emergence of new 
viruses and the increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics1,2.  It is now estimated that almost 
one-third of the world population or 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  with between 3 -5% of these cases being multidrug or extremely drug resistant3.  In 
addition, ba cteria have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to become resistant to antibiotics 
much faster than new compounds or sub -classes can be identified.  The NDM -1 resistance gene 
represents  a perfect example  of the ability of bacteria to not only acquire resis tance but broad 
spectrum resistance on a single plasmid that provides resistance against most of the major or 
widely used classes of antibiotics.  This highlights the shortcomings of current and past antibiotic 
research which has relied on derivatives of e xisting classes that all share a common or similar 
core structure making them susceptible to inactivation by a single enzyme.  In addition, 
traditional antibiotics share a related mechanism of action in that they all function through a 
target protein or re ceptor molecule to inhibit a cellular process to kill the bacteria allowing the 
bacteria to rapidly become resistant by acquiring a beneficial mutation in the target molecule4.   
Over the past ten years, the amount of research and development invested by large 
pharmaceutical companies in the discovery of novel antibiotics has steadily declined while 
bacteria have become increasingly resistant to the currently available classes of a ntibiotics.  
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 2 million people 
each year are infected with bacteria resistant to at least one antibiotic which results in around 
23,000 deaths5.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major public 
health  issue resulting in the closing of several public schools for cleaning and demonstrating that 
this i s a problem no longer restricted to hospitals.  No other factor highlights the need for a 
greater effort into the research and development of novel anti -bacterial compounds than the ever 
increasing ability of bacteria to rapidly acquire resistance to curre nt and new derivatives of 
existing antibiotics.  The recent identification of a strain of Streptococcus  resistant to more than 
18 different antibiotics highlights this fact and the obvious need for novel anti -infective 
compounds like Bisphosphocins.   
Lake wood Amedex has discovered a new class of broad spectrum anti microbial , termed 
bisphosphocins™ , formerly  known as  nubiotics, that have been proven effective in vitro  at 
killing 70 different strains of bacteria, including all Category A pathogens and in viv o against the 
difficult to treat infections caused by Francisella tularensis , Helicobacter pylori , and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa .  Bisphosphocins are a new class of synthetic broad spectrum 
antimicrobial that are characterized by a core structure bridging two  phosphate groups attached 
to even chain alkyl or alcohol groups.  The com pounds are activated through an  acidification 
process which is reversible by exposing the compounds to a buffer or base.  The compounds 
were found to be bactericidal and effective in  killing slow growing or stationary bacteria.  
Preclinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these compounds in the treatment of a 
number of serious bacterial infections6,7,8.  In addition, the compounds were initially developed 
as a homeopathic treatment and were found to reduce the severity of several common infection

 associated with acne, diabetic foot infection, and skin infections9.  The compoun ds function 
through a unique mechanism of action, are amendable to multi ple formulations, and routes of 
administrations enabling a clinical development plan distinct from most traditional antibiotics.  
The current clinical development plan entail s developm ent of a topical formulation of 
bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 for a number of topical infections such as diabetic foot infections, chronic 
urinary tract infections, and pulmonary infection s using direct delivery of the compound to the 
site of the infection.  This cl inical approach will demonstrate initial safety in humans  and keep 
delivery  of the antimicrobial  localized to the site of infection and thus decrease the chance of 
bacteria becoming resistant.  This clinical study will also yield important data for planning 
follow on clinical trials, including those involving  Nu-3 for systemic administration to treat 
serious gram negative infections such as complicated urinary tract infections.   
Diabetic foot infections are one of the most common complications for p eople who suffer from 
diabetes and a frequent cause of hospitalization10.  According to the American Diabetes 
Association approximately 8.3% of the US population suffers from diabetes and in 2006 there 
were 65,700 non -traumatic amputations performed on diabetics.  In addition, almost half of 
diabetic patients  that have an amputation will develop an ulcer on the remaining limb within 
18 months after su rgery.  The treatment of a diabetic foot infection is complicated as it requires 
both antimicrobial therapy to cure the infection and proper wound care management to heal the 
ulcer.  Curing the infection is particularly challenging since the infection tend s to be 
polymicrobial in nature requiring a broad spectrum antibiotic, the ulcer is prone to re -infection, 
and the pathogenic bacteria are increasingly becom ing resistant to most front line therapies.  In 
addition, recent studies have estimated that approx imately 60 -80% of chronic infections involve 
biofilm formation which makes the bacteria more resistant to traditional antibiotics11.  Therefore, 
proper management of an infected diabetic foot ulcer require s an antimicrobial therapy to cure or 
clear the infection to allow proper wound management or therapy to heal the ulcer and prevent 
relapse.  
Bisphosphocins™, a new class of broad spectrum antimicrob ials, possess a number of 
characteristics that make these compounds extremely well -suited to the management of diabetic 
foot infections.  First, bisphosphocins™ are rapidly and directly bactericidal functioning through 
a unique mechanism of action providin g the ability to quickly cure an infection.  The compounds 
are fairly low in molecule weight, have a n excellent safety profile, and have shown good 
penetration into wounds.  In addition, there are no known bacterial mechanisms of resistance and 
no resistan t bacteria have been identified to date eliminating a common cause of treatment 
failure7. Finally, bisphosphocins  have been demonstrated highly effective at killing bacteria 
established in biofilms12 which is increasingly become associated with many chronic inf ections.  
The preclinical studies conducted on the bisphosphocin ™ class clearly support their evaluation 
in the proposed Phase I/IIa safety study in diabetic foot infections.

 1.2 Bisphosphocin Nu -3 
1.2.1 General Information  
Bisphosphocins ™ were originally discovered  by  while conducting research in 
the field of antisense technology and attempting to kill bacteria using gene silencing.  The initial 
compounds identified were protonated/acidified oligonucleotides that demonstrated bactericidal 
activity i ndependent of nucleotide sequence.  Further experimentation expanded the class to 
protonated/acidified nucleotides and derivative molecules that exhibit chemical stability, acid pH 
resistance, and nuclease resistance enabling formulations for oral, intrave nous, pulmonary, and 
topical delivery.  The lead compound, designated Nu -3, is a thymidine derivative that would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analog ue class of drugs ( Figure 1).  Experimental data has 
elucidated a non -receptor dependent mechanism of action involving disruption of the bacterial 
cell membrane causing depolarization and rapid cell death.  Bisphosphocins ™ have an extremely 
broad spectrum of activity in vitro  testing against over 70 different bacterial strains carrying 
various antibiotic resistant markers.   There is currently no known mechanism of resistance to the 
bisphosphocin class and because they were synthetically derived there is no natural pool of 
resistant bacteria.  In addition, panelling the compounds against a number of strains with known 
antibiotic resistance or clinical isolates has failed to identify any cross -resistance or resistance 
mechanis ms.   The following preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data is provided as a 
brief summary of the activity of bisphosphocin Nu -3 to support its potential as a treatment for 
diabetic foot infections and this clinical protocol should be read in conju nction with the 
Investigator Brochure on the product.

 1.2.2 Pre-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology  
Specific Pharmacology  
Initial experiments revealed tha t bisphosphocins ™ had an antimicrobial activity distinct from 
any currently existing antibiotic class.  Extensive in vitro and in vivo  experiments have been 
conducted to further define their activity, identify their mechanism of action, and begin to 
establ ish a dose range to allow entry in human clinical trials.  An important factor to consider in 
the review of the following experimental results is that it is now known bisphosphocins ™ do not 
follow the simple inhibitory kinetic model of one compound binding  to one target molecule of 
the current class es of antibiotics but a more complex kinetic model involving the binding of 
multiple molecules to a bacterium resulting in direct bacteria cell death.  For this reason, the 
current hypothesis is bisphosphocin ™ dosing in vivo  will be based on total dose delivered and 
not on maintaining a circulating level above the minimum inhibitory concentration  or at the site 
of infection  to achieve an efficacy outcome  because the molecules rapidly bind and kill bacteria 
as oppo sed to inhibiting growth .  Therefore, the therapeutic effect of bisphosphocins™ can be 
manipulated by not only controlling the dose but frequency and duration of treatment not 
because of the pharmacokinetics of the compound but due to the fact that each do se will result in 
a reduction of bacterial load.  The following experiments are presented to further define, 
distinguish and compare the activity of the bisphosphocin class from traditional antibiotics in 
order to develop a comprehensive clinical plan to en able evaluation in humans.  The majority of 
the experimental data presented in the following sections was performed in the laboratory of 
outside collaborators or researchers who then published their results6,7,8,12 or by independent 
Contract Research Organization following the current guidelines for antimicrobial testing.  Due 
to the unique MOA of the bisphosphocin ™ class some standard assay s were modified to enable 
the evaluation which has been noted in the protocol.  Table  1 and Table  2 summarizes the activity 
of Nu -3 in the standard MIC assay against bacteri al pathogens commonly found in diabetic foot 
infections and against common fungal pathogens.

The following studies were performed by  
 and were designed to evaluate the activity of Nu -3 
against bacteria established in biofilms  which is increasing becoming associated with chronic 
infections12,unpublished.  Biofilm was formed in borosilicate glass tubes by standard methods and 
then treated with  Nu-3 or kept as untreated controls.  As shown in Table  3, Nu-3 was able to 
penetrate the biofilm and kill the bacteria as judge d by the lack of growth in Nu -3 treated tubes.

 Assessment of the rate of kill of Nu -3 in 0.85% normal saline : 
 
Bacteria in the log phase of growth were collected by centrifugation, re -suspended in sterile 
saline (0.85% NaCl) at 1 x 105 CFU /ml. Nu -3 in steri le saline was added to a final concentration 
of 0.2 to 10mg/ml to the bacteria and the bacteria/Nu -3 mixture incubated at room temperature. 
At time points ranging from 5 to 60 minutes, aliquots were removed, diluted and plated onto TS 
agar plates for quant itation of the number of colony forming units ( CFU 's).  After 24 h at 37 °C, 
the number of CFU 's were determined and the Nu -3 concentrations and exposure times resulting 
in 100% kill were determined ( Table  4).

Mouse Suture Wound Infection Model  
Briefly, a 10cm length of suture was threaded onto a needle and soaked for 45 minutes in 
undiluted cultures of S. aureus  cvcc2248 or P. aeruginosa  cvcc 5668 at 35 °C for 8 hours.  The 
needle and sutures were removed, placed on filter paper, and dried at 4 °C until implantation.  A 
1-cm long piece of suture was implanted under the skin in the shaved and washed mid -back of 
anesthetized animal s using knots to secure it in place.  An incision was made between the knots 
on top of the suture line with a scalpel.  T he animals were then divided into groups and treated as 
indicated at 4 h and 8 h post-surgery and then 3 times daily for 3 days with either placebo, Nu -3 or 
ciprofloxacin ointment.  On Day 5 the animals were euthanized and a 1cm2 area surrounding and 
includi ng the wound was harvest for homogenization and CFU counts ( Table  5).  The initial 
inoculum  (i.e. CFU of bacteria in 1 cm length of suture)  was determined by vortexing 1 -cm of 
suture in bacterial growth media and plating serial dilutions to obtain bacteria co unts.

Mouse Superficial Skin  Polymicrobial  Infection Model  
Briefly, mice are pre-treated with cyclophosphamide four day prior to initiating the infection to 
suppress the immune system.  The mice are anesthetized and kept sedated while the fur on the 
back dorsal surface is shaved using electric clippers followed by  ‘wet shaving’ with a disposable 
razor. The skin is then sterilized with a betadine wash followed by alcohol swab and abraded 
with a +50 grit em ery board that results in a smooth, red, shiny appearance with no bleeding.  A 
droplet of the bacterial inoculum  is placed directly on the abraded skin that contains 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa UNT034 -1 (ATCC 27853) 6.35 Log10 CFU/ mouse and S. aureus  
UNT006 -4 (smith) 5.65 Log10 CFU/ mouse.  The infected area is treated with 50 microliters of 
varying concentrations of bi sphosphocin Nu -3, gentamycin, mupirocin , or normal saline twice 
daily for 3 days.  The mice are then euthanized, the area of infected skin excised, and the CFU of 
both bacteria is determined by culture or serial diluted samples of hom ogenized tissue ( Table  6).  
The data shows that the top 5% dose of bisphosphocin Nu -3 results in a 1 log reduction in the 
CFU count of both S. aureus  and P. aeruginosa .

Preclinical Toxicology  
Summary of Preclinical Toxicology Data  
Nu-3 is the first in a new class of broad spectrum antimicrobials, termed bisphosphocins, being 
developed to treat a wide range of serious bacterial infections.  Chemically Nu -3 would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analog class of drugs and the foll owing set of preclinical 
studies was designed based on the preclinical and clinical data collected over the past 50 years on 
this class.  T he nu cleotide analog class  of drugs h ave a good  safety profile even when 
administered long term  at low doses and toxi cities are generally associated with their 
interference of normal DNA/RNA synthesis.   
Nu-3 or 
 is a thymidine analog w ith both 
the 3’ and 5’ sites blocked by butyl phosphate which prevents it from causing early chain 
termination by incorporation by the polymerase unlike most compounds in this class.  Nu-3 is 
activated through an acidification step that results in an acidi c or protonated compound that when 
dissolved in water has a pH between 2 and 2.5.  The compound can be neutralized or unactivated 
by a strong base or buff er such as sodium bicarbonate .  In addition, the molecule was designed to 
minimize the potential for t oxic side effects by utilizing a thymidine core molecule, natural 
phosphate linkages, and even carbon butyl blocking groups, all of which are either found in the 
body and/or feed into natural recycling pathways.  
A summary of the preclinical toxicology stud ies completed with Nu -3 is presented in Table  7.   
The data indicates that Nu -3 is safe and well -tolerated when administered systemically or

 topically and no specific toxicities were identified that would be cause for concern for the 
propo sed Phase I/IIa study in subject s with infected diabetic foot ulcers.  In general, the data 
indicates that Nu -3 functions through a membrane depolarization mechanism of action that is 
highly specific for bacterial cell membranes.

 1.2.3 Clinical Trials of Bisphosphocin Nu -3 
Bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 is a new chemical entity that has not been evaluated under a formal IND 
application in human clinical studies.  The compound was initial developed as a homeopathic 
treatment for a var iety of topical infections as it was considered to fall under the HPUS DNA 
guidelines9.  As a homeopathic treatment, Nu -3 was used topically to treat a variety of infections 
including acne, urethritis, ear infections, diabetic foot infections, and certain fungal infections.  
The information collected from these homeopathic treatments  revealed that N u-3 applied 
topically in solution for up to 14 da ys was able to improve the severity of an infection based 
visual observation.   
1.3 Rationale for Current Study  
The proposed clinical study is designed to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of increasing 
doses of topically applied bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 on a  chronic diabetic foot infection.   In 
addition, the study is designed to collect data on the efficacy of N u-3 as it relates to eradication  
of the infection and wound healing  to enable planning of future trials .  The 3 dosing levels and 
length of treatment were selected based on in vitro , in vivo , and toxicology studies of Nu -3 and 
its unique mechanism of action.  While the current trial is considered a first -in-human trial, the 
design also has taken into consideration data collected from the development of the compound 
initially as a homeopathic treatment where the use as a topical solution was able to reduce the 
severity of several common topical infections.  Recent studies have shown that a high percentage 
of chronic wounds have biofilm associated which interferes  with wound healing.  This trial is 
intended to evaluate the efficacy of an antimicrobial with known activity against biofilm encased 
bacteria to not only eliminate the infection but potential ly improve wound healing.  For this 
reason, bisphosphoci n Nu -3 is being formulated in a normal saline solution so that a clearer 
picture can be gained of its effect on the wound without the interference of an ointment base.  
Bisphosphocins have  been shown to  effectively reduce the severity  of the infection  in preclinical 
animal model testing , but these models have limits as they do not accurately mimic the complex 
environment of a chronic wound infection and in many cases rely on immunosuppression to 
maintain the infection.  This first in human study is designed  to collect both safety and efficacy 
data so that the parameters such as dose, duration and frequency of administration can be refined 
for future more intensive studies.   Based on the data collected from preclinical stud ies, it is 
anticipated that a  therap eutic effect may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10  mg/ml) and 
high dose  (2% w/v, or 20  mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extend ing the treatment course an  
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would 
only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed  the seven (7) day treatment and 
approval was given by the SMC.  The  decision to extend treatment  of individual subjects 
showing a clinical response would then  be made by the principal  investigator . 
Potential Risks  
This clinical trial is a first in human trial so there is a potential risk of an adverse reaction from  
the study drug.  Bisphosphocin Nu -3, however would be considered a nucleotide analog which is 
a class of drugs with a stro ng safety record so the likelihood of this particular risk i s considered 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1

Page  22 
 minimal.  The major distinction  between bisphosphocin Nu -3 and  the nucleotide an alog class are 
that both 3’ and 5’ sites are blocked and a novel acid activation step that is reversed when the 
compounds are exposed to buffers or base.  Therefore, it is anticipated that any reaction would be 
localized since the sodium bicarbonate in the blood would neutralize the compound which is 
supported by inhibitory effect of blood in MIC assays.  In addition to a reaction from  the study 
drug, there is also the possibility that the drug is ineffective and the infection worsens which 
could necessitate more aggressive therapy or treatment.  
Potential Benefits  
The major benefit of the proposed study will  be an improvement in the wound due to the 
elimination  of the pathogenic bacteria that is inhibiting healing.  Bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 is a new 
class of broad spectrum antimicrobial so it is unlikely that the pathogenic bacteria will be outside 
its spectrum of  activity or resistant , which is a major cause of treatment failure in this indication.  
The dose levels have been selected so that two cohorts are likely to  be receiving efficacious dose 
levels of drug with a satisfactory  safety margin so that so me improv ement in wound appearance 
is anticipated in some subject s in these cohorts.  In addition to directly eliminating the 
pathogenic bacteria associated with the chronic ulcer, it is anticipated that a second potential 
benefit would be the elimination of any biofilm encased bacteria that would then make the 
infection more susceptible to tradi tional therapy as a follow up therapy.  Any of these outcomes 
would benefit the subject  as it would reduce the risk of limb loss due to a worsening infection 
and the pain .

 2 OBJECTIVES  
Objective/Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability  of 
Nu-3 when applied topically to a chronically infected diabetic ulcer.  
A secondary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the microbiological activity 
of Nu -3 as measured by clinical wound assessments and presence of pathogenic bacteria.   Based 
on pre clinical da ta, it is anticipated that improvement in the clinical wound assessment may be 
observed in the middle and high dose (1% and 2%) cohorts . 
Statement of Hypothesis:   Nu-3 is a broad spectrum antimicrobial with a unique mechanism of 
action that involves cell membrane depolarization and rapid bacterial cell death.  As an 
antimicrobial it is particularly well suited for de velopme nt as a topical for Diabetic Foot 
Infections  for the following reasons:  
1. These infections tend to be polymicrobial in nature , involve biofilm,  and require an 
antibiotic(s) with  a broad spectrum of activity.  
2. Many of the bacteria in these infected wounds are resistant to one or more classes of 
antibiotics making treatment difficult  
3. The directly bactericidal mode of action of Nu -3 should translate into an immediate 
reduction in the severity of the infections and offers new options in dosing.  
4. Research has shown that many chronic infections are due to the formation of biofilm 
which is inherently resistant to treatment by traditional antibiotics but susceptible  to 
treatment by bisphosphocins such as Nu -3 
 
The proposed clinical trial design is aimed at defining the initial parameters for safety and 
tolerability in an infected wound based on the currently available preclinical data on Nu -3. The 
trial is focused on DFIs of mild to moderate severity and an area of 0.5 to 6 cm2 as a population 
of subjects that will provide the data across a r ange of pathogens and ulcers of varying duration.  
In addition, the middle and high dose (1% and 2% Nu -3) cohorts were selected so that some 
clinical impr ovement in wound assessment be obser ved which will enable better planning of 
following clinical trials.   
Route of Administration: Study medication  will be applied topically directly to the infected 
ulcer  
Dosage:  The study includes a sequential ascending dose protocol with Cohort 1 at 0.1 % w/v or 
1mg/ml, Cohort 2 at 1 % w/v or 10mg/ml, and Cohort 3 at 2% w/v or 2 0mg/ml.  In addition, two 
subjects in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.  The proposed doses  and treatment 
duration  were based on data from in vitro  antimicrobial assays, prec linical animal efficacy 
models, and toxicology studies and were selected to demonstrate safety at a high dose that 
provides a significant therapeutic margin lethal to all tested bacteria and fungi to date while 
proven safe in animal toxicology studies.

 Dosing Regime:   To establish the initial safety and tolerability of Nu -3, a twice daily application 
of the compound was selected for this clinical trial based on preclinical studies on efficacy and 
toxicology.  Subject s will be required to keep a daily log of when treatments are applied and  
contacted  daily by a member of the study team.  
Ulcer Imaging and Area Calculations:   Photographs of the ulcer(s) will be taken at study visits 
using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system which allows capture of a color ima ge and 
computer calculation of ulcer(s) area, depth, and volume with more consistent and greater 
accuracy than traditional methods.  
Randomization: Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to Nu -3 (n=8) or 
matching placebo (n=2) in each cohort.  
Treatment Period:   Day 1 (in clinic): Day 2 (end of SAD/Beginning of MAD) through Day 8   
Follow -Up Period: Day 1 5  
Selection of Study Population:   Type I or  II diabetes mellitus subjects  with a chronic infected 
lower extremity ulcer  defined as havi ng a DUSS score of 0 to 3 and a DFI wound score 1 to 9  as 
this is the most appropriate population to assess the safety of a new drug aimed at treating 
infected wounds.  The proposed inclusion criteria have been selected to define a subject 
population that will have a diverse spectrum of pathogens and range of chronic ulcers to ensure a 
proper assessment of safety and tolerability as well as data to better define follow on clinical 
studies.  The DFI wound score range is intended to select subjects with mild to moderate 
infection  which  have the best potential to respond to the treatment.  A  radiograph of the affected 
area will be performed during the screening period to rule out the possibility that the ulcer is due 
to an underlying osteomyelitis.  Preclinical  studies have demonstrated the safety of Nu -3 on 
mammalian cells, intact and damaged skin,  and when injected intravenously,  therefore exposure 
of healthy subject  to Nu -3 would provide little if any additional safety information.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
Phase I/IIa,  three cohort double -blind ascending dose with two dosing phases per cohort, study in 
diabet es mellitus subjects  with a chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score 
between 0 and 3 and a DFI wound score between 1 and 9 .  The study propose s to use the same 
subject (s) in SAD Phase 1 and M AD Phase 2 of each cohort . 
The study is designed to conduct  the cohorts sequentially with the completion of the first cohort 
before initiating the next dosing level.    
In Phase 1, eligible  subjects  will be treated with a single application of Nu -3 or placebo in  a 4 to 
1 ratio to judge the initial safety of Nu -3 over a brief 15 -30 mi nute interval and 24  hour interval .  
Bisphosphocin Nu -3 will be applied topically to the chronic infected ulcer  (DUSS s core: 1 -3; 
DFI wound score: 1 -9), and the area observed over a 15 -30 minute time period and 
photographed.  If no visible reaction is observed, the ulcer is covered with a bandage.   The 
subject  will be released with verbal instruction s to leave the  nonabras ive, hypoallergenic  
bandage on the wound , avoid getting the bandage wet,  and return for a follow up visit within 
24 ± 2h.  At the follow up visit, the bandage will be removed, the ulcer visually examined , 
photographed  using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ sy stem , and the subject  cleared for the 
MAD Phase  2 based on the recommendation /decision  of the PI and on the absence of any  drug 
related  SAEs.   
In Phase  2, eligible subjects , which are those who have been approved by the PI after the Visit 2 
examination , will be instructed in the proper application of bisphosphocin Nu -3 or placebo .  In 
the clinic, the subjects  will be observed applying the first dose to ensure compliance.  The 
subject  will then be given a 7 -day supply  of study drug , non-abrasive bandages,  a home diary , 
written instructions for care  and hygiene , and sent home to continue treatment.  On Day 9 ± 2h or 
earlier in the case of any adverse events, subjects  will return to the clinic for an examination, 
including visual evaluation  of the ulcer, vit al signs, adverse events, photo documentation  using 
the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system , collection of a sample for microbiological assessment, 
and concomitant medication use.  A final follow up visit will be scheduled for Day 15 for a 
complete examinatio n as described above.   Based on the data collected from preclinical studies, 
it is anticipated that a therapeutic effect may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10  mg/ml) 
and high-dose (2% w/v, or 20  mg/ml) cohorts .

 4 STUDY DRUGS  
4.1 Randomization , Blinding , and Drug Product /Placebo  Packaging and Labeling  
The drug product kits will be labeled as shown in Table 8 to ensure blinding of both the Prin cipal 
Investigator and Subject.  The kits will contain a 0.5 oz dropper bottle containing either 15 ml of 
Bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 or Placebo  packaged in a  cardboard a carton with a foam insert for 
protection.  Both the carton and dropper bottle will be labelled.  
The randomization will consist of two materials that have been allocated within 3 Cohorts.  
 Material 1 : Bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 at 0.1%, 1%, or 2% w/v  
 Material 2:  Matching Placebo  
Within each Cohort, a material blocking ratio of 4:1 has been utilized with three (3) blocks per 
cohort.  All Cohorts utilize a different bottle number range with ranges set at Cohort 1 from 
0101 to 0115, Cohort 2 from 0201-0215, and Cohort 3 from 0301 to 0315.  All cohort s will have 
a different starting Randomization Specification Seed value which will result in a different 
statistical outcome.

4.2 Description and Handling of Bisphosphocin Nu -3 
Nu-3 or 
 is a thym idine analog with both 
the 3’ and 5’ sites blocked by butyl phosphate which prevents it from causing early chain 
termination by incorporation by the polymerase unlike most compounds in this class.  Nu -3 is

 activated through an acidification step that resul ts in an acidic or protonated compound that when 
dissolved in water has a pH between 2 and 2.5.  The antibacterial activity can be neutralized by a 
strong base or buffer.  Prior non -human investigations indicate that  all doses being used in this 
study  are likely to be safe , medical personnel and caregivers should use caution when handling  
the drug  to avoid exposu re of sub -MIC levels through in advertent application to the skin and 
normal skin flora that could potentially lead to resistant strains.   
4.3 Dosage a nd Administration of Bisphosphocin Nu -3 or Placebo  
Bisphosphocin Nu -3 will be dosed at three different concentrations of 0.1% w/v (1mg/ml), 1% 
w/v (10mg/ml), and 2% w/v (20mg/ml) in 0. 85% normal saline.  Placebo will be 0.85% normal 
saline solution.  The drug or placebo  will be administered as a single dose  and then twice daily 
for 7 days.  The drug or placebo  will be administered to the infected diabetic foot ulcer and 
surrounding intact ski n at a dose of 1-3 drop s from a  dropper bottle  per 1 cm2 of ulcer  area. 
4.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Subject s are allowed to continue on any concomitant prescribed medication for medical 
condition s not related to the treatment of the infected diabetic ulcer.  All systemic and topical 
antibiotics must be stoppe d seven (7) days prior to admission to the proposed stud y.

 6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The primary endpoint safety variables will be the incidence of localized swelling surrounding the 
ulcer, development of a rash, joint pain, and any adverse changes in the appearance of the ulcer.   
The S afety Monitoring Committee (S MC) will receive safety reports outlining the number of 
subjects  enrolled in each cohort to date, summary of the safety data Day 0 – 15 for the most 
recent cohort, adverse events, and serious adverse events listed by grade as well as all laboratory 
tests data.  These reports will  present the data blinded  and will be unblinded only if necessary to 
determine the cause of an AE or SAE at the request of the SMC .  In addition, safety data from 
completed cohorts will be summarized in the same manner and included in the report.  All 
information on adverse events will be provided in a table.   
6.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event: According to the ICH E6 guidelines, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a  subject /subjects  in a clinical study regardless of its relationship to the 
administration of the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unintended, unfavorable, or 
unexpected sign, laboratory test, symptom, reaction, or disease temporarily associated with a  
clinical subject /subjects  during the duration of the study.  The occurrence of an AE may come to 
the attention of study personnel at a study visit and during interviews of subject s seeking medical 
care, or upon reviews conducted by study monitors.  During  all visits and interviews after 
administration of the study drug, clinical staff will inquire about any anticipated adverse events 
or symptoms using standardized questions.  The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRFs,  
All AEs whether local or syste mic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” 
should be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The information to be recorded should include a 
description of the event, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of the severity, relationship to the 
study drug (assessment to be conducted only by those with the qualified training and authority to 
make a diagnosis and include the CMO, MD, PA, Nurse Practitioner, DO, DPM in podiatry and 
DDS), and time to resolution or stabilization. All AEs that o ccur during the study regardless of 
their association with the study drug must be documented appropriately and followed to adequate 
resolution.  
Any AE (i.e. a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset date after 
the screening visit up to the last day on study (including follow -up), should be recorded as an AE 
on the appropriate CRF page(s).  
 
 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  36 
 An AE does not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedures) e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads  to the procedure is an adverse event.  
 Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior 
to the scre ening visit, that do not worsen.  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospitalizat ion 
for elective surgery, social  and/or convenience admissions).  
 Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms 
unless the subject is hospitalized for observation . 
Severity of Event: All AEs will be assessed by the in vestigator and recorded on the appropriate 
CRF page, including the date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug or study 
procedures, outcome and action taken with study medication.  The clinician will assess all AEs 
using a protocol d efined grading system as follows.  
Scale  Definition  
Grade 1  No intervention required because the event is mild or asymptomatic.  A clinical or diagnostic 
observation.  
Grade 2  Minimal to moderate intervention and/or localized event that requires non-invasive treatment  
Grade 3  A debilitating or incapacitating condition, severe or medically significant that is not life threatening 
that requires hospitalization or prolonged treatment  
Grade 4  Requiring urgent intervention because the event is life t hreatening  
Grade 5  Death of a subject  due to an adverse event.  
 
Relationship to Study Products:  
6.2.2 Reactogenicity  
Adverse events associated with the study product may include vesicle (blistering) development, 
burning sensation at the ulcer site (may be mask ed by diabetic neuropathy), increase in local 
temperature, and expansion of necrotic tissue surrounding the ulcer.

Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  37 
 6.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows:  
 Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death;  
 Life-threatening situation  (subject is at immediate risk of death);  
 In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement  of an indwelling catheter, u nless associated with other serious 
events);  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Congenital anomaly/ birth  defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug;  
 Other: medically significant  events that may not result in death, be immedi ately life -
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered a n SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the Subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definitio n. 
Examples of such events are:  
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
 Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Clarification of Serious Adve rse Events  
 Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adverse event in itself.  In reports of 
death due to “Disease Progression”, where no other information is provided, the death 
will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease be ing treated with the 
study drug(s).  
 All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported for subjects on study and 
for deaths occurring within 30 days of last study drug dose or within 30 days of last study 
evaluation, whichever is longer.  
 “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the 
time of the event.  Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  
 “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had 
occurred with greater severity.  
 Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs .  If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  38 
  “In-patient hospitalization” means that the subject has been formally admitted to a 
hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  
It does not include p resentation and care within an emergency department.  
 The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE an d not the individual signs/symptoms.    
 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  An AE that is assessed as Grade 
4 (potentially life -threatening) should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the inte nsity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 4.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as described 
above in Section 6.2.3 .  
6.2.4 Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values or 
Abnormal Clinical Findings  
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events 
unless they are associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms. However, laboratory 
abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, etc.) independ ent from the 
underlying medical condition, that require medical or surgical intervention, or lead to study drug 
interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable.  In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessme nts (e.g. electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) 
that are associated with sign and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet 
the definition of an adverse event (or serious adverse event) as described in the protocol.  If the 
laboratory abn ormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis.   
Severity should be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) .  For adverse events associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event 
should be graded based on the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions, which 
may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality.  
6.3 Serious Advent Event Reporting Procedures  
The study sponsor  is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory authorities reports of Serious 
Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs); 
therefore,  the study sponsor or its delegate  must be notified immediately regarding the 
occur rence of any SAE that occurs after the subject consents to participate in the study, including 
SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures performed from screening onwards. The 
procedures for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, ar e as follows:  
 Record the SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form.  
 E-mail or fax the SAE form to the attention of the Drug Safety Manager within 24  hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Contact information  is as follows:  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  39 
  For fatal or life -threatening events, also e -mail or fax copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, 
and other documents when requested and applicable. Transmission of such documents should occur 
with Personal Subject Details de -identified, without losing the traceability of a document to the 
Subject Identifiers.  
 The study sponsor or its delegate  may request additional information from the investigator to  ensure 
the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
The investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant 
medication section o f the subject’s CRF and the event description section of the SAE form.  
Follow -up of adverse events will continue through the last day on study (including the follow -up 
off-study medication period of the study) and/or until the investigator and/or study spo nsor 
determine that the subject’s condition is stable.  The study sponsor or its delegate  may request 
that certain adverse events be followed until resolution.  
6.3.1 Reporting Pregnancy  
The risks of treatment with bisphosphocin during pregnancy has not been eval uated.  
The subject must be instructed to discontinue all study drugs and inform the investigator 
immediately  if she becomes pregnant during the study.  
The investigator should report all pregnancies to Lakewood -Amedex within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  The investigator should counsel the subject regarding the 
possible effects of prior study drug exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of 
the outcome of the pregnancy.   
Any pregnancy  complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE or a n SAE.  
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported as described in 
the adverse and Serious Adverse Events section.  Furt hermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse 
pregnancy outcome post -study must be reported to Lakewood -Amedex.  Lakewood -Amedex

 Additionally, all pregnancies that occur during the study should be reported using the Pregnancy 
Report CRF page.  Monitoring of the subject should c ontinue until the conclusion of the 
pregnancy.  The outcome should be reported to Lakewood -Amedex  using the Pregnancy 
Outcome CRF page(s) .  If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been complete the 
outcome should be reported directly to Lake wood -Amedex.   Pregnancies that occur after the 
subject has discontinued study drugs do not require monitoring.   
6.4 Safety Oversight

 An improvement in the DFI Wound Score will be used to indicate a clinical improvement of the 
wound and a change in the DUSS Score wound be used to indicate the healing of a small 
ulceration.  
Microbiological Response Evaluations:  
This assessment will be conducted on samples collected by the investigato r on Visit 2 , Visit 4, 
Visit 5, and Visit 6. of the study which will be cultured to determine: microbial load and identity 
of the infected pathogens or wound flora.  The microbiological response will be determined by a 
comparison of the results pre - and pos t-treatment.  
SMC Safety Reports:  
Safety reports will be written by the SMC three times during the course of the study.  The first 
will follow the first interim analysis (once the first SAD/MAD Cohort 1 reaches Day 9), the 
second report will follow the seco nd interim analysis (once the second SAD/MAD Cohort 2 
reaches Day 9), and the third report will follow the third interim analysis (once the third 
SAD/MAD Cohort  3 reaches Day 9).  The study reports will be presented to the Principal 
Investigator  at each cl inical site  and Lakewood -Amedex Inc.     
6.4.2 Study Termination  
This study may be terminated at any time by Lakewood -Amedex Inc.  The PI and SMC may 
provide Lakewood -Amedex  with recommendations regarding termination of the trial, however, 
Lakewood -Amedex  ultimately makes the final decision.  Reasons for terminating the study 
include:  
 If a serious or unexpected adverse event occurs and the event is judged to be probably or 
definitively related to exposure to  Nu-3, the study will be immediately suspended by  the 
Principal Investigator pending review of all appropriate safety data.  The event will be 
reported to the SMC, IRB, and Sponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours or notification 
of its occurrence.  No additional subjects  will receive Nu -3 until a joint d ecision is 
reached between the Sponsor, PI, and SMC as to whether further doses can be given or 
the trial is terminated.  Subjects  currently in a  MAD Arm will be contacted to ascertain 
treatment status and if any AE s have occurred.  Absent any findings , subject s in the 
ongoing MAD arms will be allowed to complete treatment.  
 Safety Monitoring Committee  terminates the study based on interim safety review  
 In the event of a clinical hold being placed on the study following a report of a n AE to the 
FDA  
 At the di scretion of Lakewood -Amedex .

 6.4.3 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug  
Subjects will be free to withdraw at any time for any reason, or they may  be withdrawn if 
necessary, to protect their health and safety or the integrity of the study data.   A subject  will be 
removed from participation in the study if any of the following occur:  
 Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other 
medical condition or situation arises such that in the judgment of the PI continued  
participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject  
 A protocol violation/deviation occurs that might compromise the integrity of the data, 
compliance, or subject safety  
 Informed consent is withdrawn  
 Subject  is lost to follow -up 
 
6.4.4 Handling Withdrawals  
If a subject is withdrawn prematurely from the study after receiving Nu -3, the reason for 
withdrawal is to be documented in the source document and in the CRF. If the withdrawal of a 
subject is due to an AE, the subject  will be followe d until resolution/stabilization of the adverse 
event.  
In the case of a subject  prematurely withdrawing from the study, the following procedures and/or 
evaluations will be performed if possible at the time of withdrawal or as soon thereafter as 
possible (i .e. study subject  withdraws at time of visit and consents to the procedures or consents 
to come in for a visit and the procedures)  
 Photo documentation of ulcer site  using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system . 
 Collection of a sample for microbiological assessment  
 Assessment of adverse events  
 
In the event a subject is lost to follow -up, the site staff must make reasonable attempts to contact 
the subject. A minimum of two documented phone calls followed by a certified mailed letter is 
considered reasonabl e. The measures taken to follow up must be documented.  
Administrative w ithdraw als will be replaced in order to achieve the objective of 10 subjects per 
cohort  who receive a complete treatment regime.  Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE/SAE rela ted to the study drug will not be replaced.

 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
Study Hypothesis – Bisphosphocin Nu -3 solution applied topically to a chronic infected diabetic 
ulcer will be safe and well tolerated in subject s suffering from diabete s mellitus.  In addition, the 
Nu-3 MAD Arm subject s may show improvement in the ulcer appearance, reduction in size, and 
improvement in both the DUSS  score and DFI Wound Score . 
The study hypothesis will be judged by the following two study objectives:  
 Prim ary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating single and multiple 
doses of Nu -3, a novel antimicrobial of the bisphosphocin class, topically to an open 
wound/diabetic ulcer  
 Secondary objectives: To assess clinical response of subject s of the ascending multiple 
dose arm of Nu -3 applied topically to an open wound/diabetic ulcer to determine clinical 
and microbiological response.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The number of treated subjects is based on the desire to gain preliminary safety, tolerability and 
efficacy information to support future work, while exposing a minimal number of subjects to the 
study procedures and medication.   Inferential statistical testing is not the primary intent of the 
study, therefore, no formal sample size cal culation was considered.  Ten subjects per Cohort (1, 
2, and 3), for a total not to exceed 30, is considered sufficient to show clinical significance for 
safety and preliminary efficacy analysis.  The sample sizes for this study were set based on the 
trial design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements and not for statistical analysis.  
7.3 Planned Interim Analysis  
There will be an interim analysis to review safety data on each cohort of subject s when all 
members of a cohort complete  Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD Follow Up) .  In addition, an interim analysis 
will be conducted after the first 5 subjects of Cohort 2 and 3 complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD 
Follow Up) .  The interim analysis will be performed by the S afety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) which will be composed of  three  physicians and may include one infectious disease 
specialist, one diabetologist, and one orthopedic surgeon.  The SMC will communicate  by email  
or teleconference on at least 3 occasions during the study and more frequently if necessary.  
No formal statistical interim analys es are planned for this Phase I/IIa study since it is primarily 
focused on evaluating safety and tolerability.  Interim safety data on each cohort will be provided 
to the SMC when all members of a cohort have reached Day 3.  The SMC will decide if the 
study can proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote).  The SMC will also determine if the 
study may proceed after receiving a report about a study related Grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  44 
 (majority vote) .  The Chairman of the SMC will share their findings and recommendations with 
Lakewood Amedex  and Principal Investigators .  
7.3.1 Safety Review  
Subject s will be monitored closely for the occurrence of study related adverse events during their 
24-hr admission in the SAD Arm and for up to 7 days following their last Nu -3 treatment in the 
study.  If any grade 3 or 4 adverse events occur and the event is judged to be probably or 
definitely related to having received the Nu -3, the study will be immediately suspended by the 
Principal Investi gator pending review of all safety data.  Adverse event s determined to be related 
to the study drug will be reported to the SMC , Lakewood -Amedex, and second PI  within 
24 hours of notification of its occurrence.  No additional subject s will receive Nu -3 dep ending on 
the joint decision of the SMC, Principal Investigator, and Lakewood Amedex Project 
Coordinator and CMO as to whether further doses can be given or the entire study should be 
terminated.  In addition, the SMC will review all interim safety data pr ior to the next cohort 
beginning treatment.  At each review, the SMC will determine whether the study may proceed to 
the next dose cohort (majority vote).  
7.4 Statistical Analysis Overview  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a minimum 
of three dose levels of Nu -3 relative to placebo.  Data summaries will be presented in order to 
assess the safety of Nu -3 and each Nu -3 dose group will be compared with placebo to determine 
the presence or absence of a tre atment effect.  Evaluation across all dose levels of Nu -3 will be 
conducted to determine if there is evidence of a dose response to any treatment effect noted.   All 
subjects treated with placebo from all cohorts will be combined for any analysis.  Evaluat ions 
will also be conducted within each subject over time to assess the rate of change (if any) in study 
outcome measures over the full course of the study treatment and follow -up periods.  Inferential 
statistical testing is not the primary inte rest of thi s study.  
All subjects receiving any amount of study treatment will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy.  An “intent to treat”  approach will be followed in all data summaries, using all 
available data in the summaries and analysis  for an as sessment of safety and tolerability while an 
“as treated” approach will be used for microbiological and clinical wound assessment data 
summaries and reports .  
All descriptive summaries and analyses will be presented in tabular and/or graphical form from 
all subjects as appropriate.  These summaries and analysis will be described in detail in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be produced prior to breaking the study blind.  All 
statistical summaries and analysis will be conducted using SAS®.

 8 RESPONSIBILITIES  
8.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
8.1.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South  
Africa), International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the study subject. For studies conducted under a United St ates IND, the investigator 
will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21  CFR  312, 
subpart  D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21  CFR, part  50, 1998, and 21  CFR, 
part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  
Since th is is a “covered” clinical trial, the investigator will ensure that 21  CFR, Part  54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to th is part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an 
effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This 
requires that investigato rs and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Lakewood -Amed ex or proprietary interests in the drug being 
studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and an y 
sub-investigator. The investigator and sub -investigator agree to notify Lakewood -Ame dex of any 
change reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. 
Study completion is defined as the date that the last subject has completed the protocol defined 
activities.  
This study is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21  CFR, part  320, 1993, 
“Retention of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”  
8.1.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Et hics Committee (IEC) 
Approval  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the subject (such as 
advertisements, subject information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by the investigator  to an IRB  in compliance with FDA regul ations for 
IRBs (21CFR Part 56) . Approval from the IRB must be obtained before  starting the study and 
must  be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol 
version, protocol date,  documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted 
the approval.  
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB  approval must also be submitted to 
the IRB  for approval before implementation.

Page  46 
 8.1.3 Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and 
potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures. The 
investigator must utilize an IRB  approved consent form for documenting written informed 
consent. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject or the 
subject’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent .  The information in 
the informed consent must comply with 21CFR Part 50, Subpart B.  The element s of the 
informed consent must be consistent with the requirements of 21CFR Part 50.25.  
8.1.4 Confidentiality  
The investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject initials, date of birth, and an 
identification code (i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample 
submitted to the Sponsor, IRB, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the 
trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from  Lakewood -Amedex , including but not 
limited to the Investigator Brochure, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational new drug, and any 
other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of  Lakewood -Amedex  during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is  not to be disclosed to any third party 
(except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) 
without prior written consent from Lakewood -Amedex . The investigator further agrees to take 
all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to 
any third party or otherwise into the public domain.  
8.1.5 Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the stud y 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classified into at least the following two categories: (1)  investigator’s study file, and 
(2) subject clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study fil e will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, IRB 
and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
The required  source data are listed in the Source Data verification Plan, and should include 
sequential notes containing at least the following information for each subject:  
 subject identification (name, date of birth, gender);  
 documentation that subject meets eligibility criteria, i.e., history, physical examination, 
and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria);  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  47 
  participation in trial (including trial number);  
 trial discussed and date of informed consent;  
 dates of all visits;  
 docu mentation that protocol specific procedures were performed;  
 results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol;  
 start and end date (including dose regimen) of trial medication (preferably drug 
dispensing and return should be documented as well);  
 record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and 
preferably including causality and intensity);  
 concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant; dose changes 
should be motivated);  
 date of trial complet ion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable.  
 
All clinical study documents must be retained by the investigator until at least 2  years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., United States, Europe, or Japan) 
and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no 
application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2  years after the 
investigation is discontinued and regulatory authoritie s have been notified. Investigators may be 
required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local 
regulations, or by an agreement with Lakewood -Amedex . The investigator must notify 
Lakewood -Amedex  before destroying any clinical study records.  
Should the investigator wish to assign the subject  records to another party or move them to 
another location, Lakewood -Amedex should  be notified in advance.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and  Lakewood -
Amedex  to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed 
to the investigator in case of a regulat ory audit. When source documents are required for the 
continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site.  
8.1.6 Case Report Forms  
For each subject enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal investi gator or 
sub-investigator (as appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also 
applies to records for those subjects who fail to complete the study (even during a pre -
randomization screening period if a CRF was initiated). If a  subject withdraws from the study, 
the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome.

Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  48 
 8.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investi gator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, placebos, and comparators. This 
includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantit y and condition), 
subject dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will 
document quantities received from  the study sponsor  and quantities dispensed to subjects, 
including kit number, date dispensed, subject identifi er number, subject initials, and the initials 
of the person dispensing the medication.  
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that  it complies with 
Lakewood -Amedex  requirements. Drug may be returned on an ongoing basis during the study , if 
appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, 
the study site will ship any remaining investi gational product  (to include empty containers)  to 
for dispos al.   
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the 
study monitor over the course of the study.  
8.1.8 Inspections  
The investigator under stand s that source documents for this trial must  be made available to 
appropriately qualified personnel from Lakewood -Amedex  or its representatives, to IRBs  or to 
regulatory authority or health authority ins pectors. 
8.1.9 Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol.  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), or Manual of Procedures requirements.  The noncompliance maybe either on the part of 
the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff.  As a res ult of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
 Compliance with Protocol sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
 Nonco mpliance sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2  
 
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations 
within 5 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 5 working days of the 
scheduled protocol -required activity.  All significant deviations must be promptly reported to 

Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1

Lakewood -Amedex as specified below  copying the CRA assigned to your site : 
 Via the web -based PD forms submission  
 FAX submission (1 ): utilizing the Protocol Deviation form and the 
email/fax transmittal form, or  
 E-mail submission ( ) utilizing the Protocol Deviation 
form and the email/fax transmittal form.  
 
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in the study subject  source documents.  A 
completed copy of the LAI Protocol Deviation form must be maintained in the regulatory file, as 
well as in the subject ’s source document.  Significant p rotocol d eviations must be sent to the 
local IRB/EC per their guidelines.  The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and 
adhering to their IRB/EC requirements.  
8.2 Sponsor Responsibilities  
8.2.1 Protocol Modifications  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to  reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may be 
made only by Lakewood -Amedex . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB  in 
accordance with local requirements. Approval must be obtained before changes can be 
implemented.  
8.2.2 Study Report and Publ ications  
A clinical study report will be prepared  by Protocol Coordinator  and provided to the regulatory 
agency(ies).  Lakewood -Amedex  will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the 
ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH  E3). Note that an 
abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases.  
Lakewood -Amedex Inc . will have the sole decision on whether or not to publish the results of 
this research.  The Company encourages its scientists and collaborators to publ ished the results 
of any research sponsored by the Company but only after a review of the data by the Company to 
ensure that any discoveries or trade secrets are properly protected by issued, pending, or newly 
filed patents or patents applications.   
The I nternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted 
a trials registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all clinical 
trials  except Phase I studies  be registered in a public trials regis try such as ClinicalTrials.gov, 
which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine.  Other biomedical journals are 
considering adopting similar policies.  Lakewood -Amedex, Inc . will be responsible for 
registering the clinical trial with an acceptable r egistry.  Any clinical trial starting enrollment 
after 01 July 2005 must be registered on or before subject  enrollment.  

Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  50 
 The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human 
subject  to intervention or comparison groups  to study the cause -and-effect relationship between 
medical intervention and a health outcome.  Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study 
pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (e .g. Phase I trials) would be exempt from this policy.  
8.3 Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities  
8.3.1 Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (ICH  GCP) guidelines, the study monitor must 
have direct access to the investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded 
in the CRFs for consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the 
data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to any subject records needed to 
verify the entries on the CRFs. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure 
that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
8.3.2 Access to Inf ormation for Auditing or Inspections  
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of Lakewood -Amedex may conduct inspections or 
audits of the clinical study. If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory 
authority the investigator agrees  to notify the Lakewood -Amedex  medical monitor immediately. 
The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or Lakewood -
Amedex access to records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or 
audit.  
8.3.3 Study Discontinuation  
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate 
regulatory authority(ies), and IRB/IECs. In terminating the study, Lakewood -Amedex  and the 
investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ 
interests.

6. All images will be uploaded to the SilhouetteConnect Database on the tablet.  
 
Calculating the Ulcer Area, Volume, and Depth  
 
1. Select the Ulcer image to be used for assessment on the tablet.  
2. Enlarge the image so  the perimeter of the ulcer is easily visible  
3. Outline the perimeter of the ulcer by either clicking around the perimeter so that the 
entire ulcer is surrounded by dots or tracing the perimeter of the ulcer with a pointer or 
finger.   
4. Clicking on the circul ar target to initiate calculation of the area, volume, and depth of the 
ulcer by the SilhouetteConnect software.  
5. Click on the Notes(?) button to enter comments on the ulcer margins, appearance, and 
surrounding skin  
6. Click Generate pdf report and Save to Sto re it to the database.

Endpoint: Safety and Tolerability 
Enrollment  Model: Sequential Assignment  
Masking: Double Blind ( Subject, Caregiver, Investigator) 
Primary Purpose:  Safety  
Description of Study Design Phase I/IIa, three cohort ascending dose with two dosing arms per 
cohort, study in Type I  or II diabetes mellitus subject s with a 
chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score of 0 
to 3 and DFI wound score of 1 to 9.  The study proposes to use the same subject in SA D Arm 1 and M AD Arm 2 of each cohort  
The study is designed to run the cohorts in series with the 
completion of the first cohort before initiating the next dosing level.  
Prior to initiating treatment of the infected diabetic ulcer, subject 
will be evaluated for ski n sensitivity to Nu -3 by applying 1 drop to 
the forearm and monitoring the site for a ny acute reaction over a 
10-15 minute interval for any sign of reddening, swelling, and/or 
irritation.   In addition, at all study visits the ulcer will be visually 
examine d for any changes and photographed using the Aranz 
Medical Silhouette™ system that will calculate area and depth of 
the ulcer.  
In Arm 1, eligible subjects will be treated with a single application 
of Nu -3 or placebo in 4 to 1 ratio to judge the initial saf ety of Nu -3 
over a brief 15-30 minute interval and 24- hr interval. 
Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 will be applied topically to the chronic 
infected ulcer, covered with a non -abrasive bandage following the 
initial observation period.  The subject will be released with verbal 
instructions to leave the bandage on the wound and return for a 
follow up visit within 24h ± 2h.  At the follow up visit, the bandage 
will be removed, the ulcer visually examined and the subject 
cleared for the MAD Arm 2 based on the recommendation of the PI

In Arm 2, eligible subjects which are those who have been 
approved by the PI after the Visit 2 examination will be instructed in the proper application of bisphosphocin Nu-3.  The subjects will be observed applying the 
first dose in the clinic to ensure 
compliance. Subjects will then be given a 7 day supply and sent 
home to continue treatment.  Visit 4 or earlier in the case of any adverse events, subjects will return to the clinic for an examination, including visual ex

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background Information 
Infectious disease represents a growing threat to world health due to the emergence of new viruses and the increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotic s
1,2.  It is now estimated that almost 
one-third of the world population or 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis  with between 3- 5% of these cases being multidrug or extremely drug resistant3.  In 
addition, bacteria have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to become resistant to antibiotics much faster than new compounds or sub- classes can be identified.  The NDM- 1 resistance gene 
represents a perfect example of the ability of bacteria to not o nly acquire resistance but broad 
spectrum resistance on a single plasmid that provides resistance against most of the major or widely used classes of antibiotics.  This highlights the shortcomings of current and past antibiotic research which has relied on  derivatives of existing classes that all share a common or similar 
core structure making them susceptible to inactivation by a single enzyme.  In addition, traditional antibiotics share a related mechanism of action in that they all function through a target protein or receptor molecule to inhibit a cellular process to kill the bacteria allowing the 
bacteria to rapidly become resistant by acquiring a beneficial mutation in the target molecule
4.   
Over the past ten years, the amount of research and development invested by large pharmaceutical companies in the discovery of novel antibiotics has steadily declined while bacteria have become increasingly resistant to the currently available classes of antibiotics.  According to the Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention, approximately 2 million people 
each year are infected with bacteria resistant to at least one antibiotic which results in around 
23,000 deaths
5.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major public 
health  issue resulting in the closing of several public schools for cleaning and demonstrating that 
this is a problem no longer restricted to hospitals.  No other factor highlights the need for a greater effort into the research and development of novel anti -bacterial compounds than the ever 
increasing ability of bacteria to rapidly acquire resistance to current and new derivatives of existing antibiotics.  The recent identification of a strain of Streptococcus  resistant to more than 
18 different antibiotics highlights this fact and the obvious need for novel anti -infective 
compounds like Bisphosphocins.   
Lakewood Amedex has discovered a new class of broad spectrum anti microbial, termed 
bisphosphocins™, formerly  known as  nubiotics, that have been proven effective in vitro  at 
killing 70 different strains of bacteria, including all Category A pathogens and in vivo  against the 
difficult to treat infections caused by Francisella tularensis, Helicobacter pylori , and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Bisphosphocins are a new class of synthetic broad spectrum 
antimicrobial that are characterized by a core structure bridging two phosphate groups attached to even chain alkyl or alcohol groups.  The com pounds are activated through an acidification 
process which is reversible by exposi ng the compounds to a buffer or base.  The compounds 
were found to be bactericidal and effective in killing slow growing or stationary bacteria.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these compounds in the treatment of a

 number of ser ious bacterial infection s6,7,8.  In addition, the compounds were initially developed 
as a homeopathic treatment and were found to reduce the severity of several common infection 
associated  with acne, diabetic foot infection, and skin infections9.  The compounds function 
through a unique mechanism of action, are amendable to multi ple formulations, and routes of 
administrations enabling a clinical development plan distinct from most tradition al antibiotics.  
The current clinical development plan entail s development of a topical formulation of 
bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 for a number of topical infections such as diabetic foot infections, chronic 
urinary tract infections, and pulmonary infections using direct delivery of the compound to the 
site of the infection.  This clinical approach will demonstrate initial safety in humans  and keep 
delivery  of the antimicrobial  localized to the site of infection and thus decrease the chance of 
bacteria becoming resistant.  This clinical study will also yield important data for planning follow on clinical trials, including those involving Nu-3 for systemic administration to treat 
serious gram negative infections such as complicated urinary tract infections.   
Diabeti c foot infections are one of the most common complications for people who suffer from 
diabetes and a frequent cause of hospitalization
10.  According to the American Diabetes 
Association approximately 8.3% of the US population suffers from diabetes and in 2006 there were 65,700 non- traumatic amputations performed on diabetics.  In addition, almost half of 
diabetic patients  that have an amputation will develop an ulcer on the remaining limb within 
18 months after surgery.  The treatment of a diabetic foot infection is complicated as it requires 
both antimicrobial therapy to cure the infection and proper wound care management to heal the ulcer.  Curing the infection is particularly challenging since the infection tends to be 
polymicrobial in nature requiring a broad spectrum antibiotic, the ulcer is prone to re -infection, 
and the pathogenic bacteria are increasingly becom ing resistant to most front line therapies.  In 
addition, recent studies have estimated that approximately 60- 80% of chronic infections involve  
biofilm formation which makes the bacteria more resistant to traditional antibiotics
11.  Therefore, 
proper management of an infected diabetic foot  ulcer require s an antimicrobial therapy to cure or 
clear the infection to allow proper wound management or therapy to heal the ulcer and prevent relapse.  
Bisphosphocins™, a new class of broad spectrum antimicrobials, possess a number of characteristics that make these compounds extremely well -suited to the management of diabetic 
foot infections.  First, bisphosphocins™ are rapidly and directly bactericidal functioning through a unique mechanism of action providing the ability to quickly cure an infection.  The compounds 
are fairly low in molecule weight, have a n excellent safety profile, and have shown good 
penetration into wounds.  In addition, there are no known bacterial mechanisms of resistance and no resistant bacteria have been identified to date eliminating a common cause of treatment failure
7. Finally, bisphosphocins have been demonstrated highly effective at killing bacteria 
established in biofilms12 which is increasingly become associated with many chronic infections.  
The preclinical studies conducted on the bisphosphocin™ class clearly support their evaluation 
in the proposed Phase I/IIa safety study in diabetic foot infections.

1.2.1 General Information Origina l -310ct2014 
Bisphosphocins™ were originally discov ered by- while conduc ting research in 
the field of antisense technology and attemp ting t~m g gene silencing. The initial 
compounds identified were protonated/ac idified oligonucleotides that demonstrated bactericidal 
activity independent of nucleotide sequence. Fmiher experimentation expanded the class to 
proto nated/ac idified nucleot ides and derivative molecules that exhibit che mical stabili ty, acid pH 
resistance, and n uclease resistan ce enabling fonnul ations for oral, intravenous, pulmonaiy, and 
topical delive1y. The lead compound, designated Nu-3, is a thymi dine derivative that would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analogue class of mugs (Figure 1). Experimental data has 
elucidated a non-receptor dependent m echanism of action involving dis rnption of the bacterial 
cell membran e causing depolarization and rapid cell death. Bisphosphocins™ h ave an extremely 
broad spectrum of activity in vitro testing against over 70 different bacterial sti·ains canying 
various antibiotic resi stant mai·kers. There is c mTently no know n mechanism of resistan ce to the 
bisphosphocin class and because they were synthetically derived there is no na tural pool of 
resistant bacte ria. In addition, panelling the compounds against a number of strains with known 
antibi otic resistance or clinical isolates has failed to identify any cross -resistan ce or resistance 
mechanism s. The following preclinical phan naco logical and toxico logy data is provided as a 
brief smnm aiy of the activity of bi sphosphocin Nu-3 to support its potential as a ti·eatinent for 
diabetic foot infections and t his clinical protoco l sho uld be read in conjunction with the

 1.2.2 Pre-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology 
Specific Pharmacology 
Initial experiments revealed tha t bisphosphocins ™ had an antimicrobial activity distinct from 
any currently existing antibiotic class.  Extensive in vitro and i n vivo  experiments have been 
conducted to further define their activity, identify their mechanism of action, and begin to 
establ ish a dose range to allow entry in human clinical trials.  An important factor to consider in 
the review of the following experimental results is that it is now known bisphosphocins ™ do not 
follow the simple inhibitory kinetic model of one compound binding to one target molecule of 
the current classes  of antibiotics but a more complex kinetic model involving the binding of 
multiple molecules to a bacterium resulting in direct bacteria cell death.  For this reason, the current hypothesis is bisphosphocin ™ dosing in vivo  will be based on total dose delivered and 
not on maintaining a circulating level above the minimum inhibitory concentration or at the site 
of infection to achieve an efficacy outcome because the molecules rapidly bind and kill bacteria 
as opposed to inhibiting growth.  Therefore, the therapeutic effect of bisphosphocins™ can be manipulated by not only controlling the dose but frequency and duration of treatment not because of the phar macokinetics of the compound but due to the fact that each dose will result in 
a reduction of bacterial load.  The following experiments are presented to further define, 
distinguish and compare the activity of the bisphosphocin class from traditional antibi otics in 
order to develop a comprehensive clinical plan to enable evaluation in humans.  The majority of the experimental data presented in the following sections was performed in the laboratory of outside collaborators or researchers who then published th eir results
6,7,8,12 or by independent 
Contract Research Organization following the current guidelines for antimicrobial testing.  Due 
to the unique MOA of the bisphosphocin™ class some standard assay s were modified to enable 
the evaluation which has been noted in the protocol. Table  1 and Table  2 summarizes the activity 
of Nu -3 in the standard MIC assay against bacteri al pathogens commonly found in diabetic foot 
infections and against common fungal pathogens.

Evaluation of Nu- 3 Activity against Bacteria Established in Biofilm  
The following studies were performed by  
 and were designed to evaluate the activity of Nu -3 
against bacteria established in biofilms which is increasing becoming associated with chronic 
infections12,unpublished.  Biofilm was formed in borosilicate glass tubes by standard methods and 
then treated with  Nu-3 or kept as untreated controls.  As shown in Table  3, Nu-3 was able to 
penetrate the biofilm and kill the bacteria as judge d by the lack of growth in Nu- 3 treated tubes.

 Assessment of the rate of kill of Nu -3 in 0.85% normal saline: 
 Bacteria in the log phase of growth were collected by centrifugation, re -suspended in sterile 
saline (0.85% NaCl) at 1 x 10
5 CFU /ml. Nu -3 in sterile saline was added to a final concentration 
of 0.2 to 10mg/ml to the bacteria and the bacteria/Nu- 3 mixture incubated at room temperature. 
At time points ranging from 5 to 60 minutes, aliquots were removed, diluted and plated onto TS agar plates for quantitation of the number of colony forming units ( CFU's).  After 24 h at 37°C, 
the number of CFU 's were determined and the Nu -3 concentrations and exposure times resulting 
in 100% kill were determined ( Table  4).

Briefly, a 10cm length of suture was threaded onto a needle and soaked for 45 minutes in undiluted cultures of S. aureus  cvcc2248 or P. aeruginosa cvcc 5668 at 35°C for 8 hours.  The 
needle and sutures were removed, placed on filter paper, and dried at 4°C until implantation.  A 
1-cm long piece of suture was implanted under the skin in the shaved and washed mid- back of 
anesthetized animal s using knots to secure it in place.  An incision was made between the knots 
on top of the suture line with a scalpel.  The animals were then divided into groups and treated as indicated at 4 h and 8h post-surgery and then 3 times daily for 3 days with either placebo, Nu-3 or 
ciprofloxacin ointment.  On Day 5 the animals were euthanized and a 1cm
2 area surrounding and 
including the wound was harvest for homogenization and CFU counts (Table  5).  The initial 
inoculum (i.e. CFU of bacteria in 1 cm  length of suture)  was determined by vortexing 1- cm of 
suture in bacterial growth media and plating serial dilutions to obtain bacteria counts.

Mouse Superficial Skin Polymicrobial Infection Model  
Briefly, mice are pre-treated with cyclophosphamide four day prior to initiating the infection to 
suppress the immune system.  The mice are anesthetized and kept sedated while the fur on the 
back dorsal surface is shaved using electric clippers followed by ‘wet shaving’ with a disposable 
razor. The skin is then sterilized with a betadine wash followed by alcohol swab and abraded 
with a +50 grit em ery board that results in a smooth, red, shiny appearance with no bleeding.  A 
droplet of the bacterial inoculum is placed directly on the abraded skin that contains Pseudomonas aeruginosa UNT034 -1 (ATCC 27853) 6.35 Log10 CFU/ mouse and S. aureus  
UNT006 -4 (smith) 5.65 Log10 CFU/ mouse.  The infected area is treated with 50 microliters of 
varying concentrations of bisphosphocin Nu-3, gentamycin, mupirocin, or normal saline twice 
daily for 3 days.  The mice are then euthanized, the area of infected skin excised, and the CFU of both bacteria is determined by culture or serial diluted samples of hom ogenized tissue (Table  6).  
The data shows that the top 5% dose of bisphosphocin Nu- 3 results in a 1 log reduction in the 
CFU count of both S. aureus  and P. aeruginosa.

Preclin ical Toxicology 
Summar y of Preclinical Toxicolo gy Data 
Nu-3 is the first in a new class of broad spect nnn antimicrob ials, te1med bisphosphocins, being 
developed to treat a wide range of serious bacter ial infections. Chemica lly Nu-3 would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analog class of drngs and the following set of preclinical 
studies was designed based on the pr eclinical and clinical data collected over the past 50 years on 
this class. The nucleot ide analog class of mugs have a good safety profi le even when 
adinin istered long te1m at low doses and toxic ities are genera lly associated with their 
interference of n01ma l DNA/RNA synthesis. 
is a thymidine analog with both 
t e 3' an 5' sites oc e y uty p osp ate w ic prevents it from causing early ch ain 
te1 mination by incorporation by the polymerase unlike most compounds in this class. Nu-3 is 
activated through an acidification step that results in an acidic or proto nated compound that when 
dissolved in wate r has a pH betwee n 2 and 2.5. The compo und can be neutralized or unactivated 
by a strong base or buffe r such as sodimn bicarbonate. In addition , the molecule was designed to 
minimize the potential for toxic side effects by utilizing a th ymid ine core molec ule, natmal 
phosp hate linkages , and even carbon butyl block ing groups, all of which are eithe r found in the 
body and/or feed into natmal recycling pathways. 
A Sllllllllaty of the preclinical toxicology studies completed with Nu-3 is pr esented in Table 7. 
The data indicates that Nu-3 is safe and well-tolerated when adinin istered syste mically or

 topically and no specific toxicities were identified that would be cause for concern for the 
proposed Phase I/IIa study in subject s with infected diabetic foot ulcers.  In general, the data 
indicates that Nu -3 functions through a membrane depol arization mechanism of action that is 
highly specific for bacterial cell membranes.

 1.2.3 Clinical Trials of Bisphosphocin Nu-3 
Bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 is a new chemical entity that has not been evaluated under a formal IND 
application in human clinical studies.  The compound was initial developed as a homeopathic 
treatment for a variety of topical infectio ns as it was considered to fall under the HPUS DNA 
guidelines9.  As a homeopathic treatment, Nu -3 was used topically to treat a variety of infections 
including acne, urethritis, ear infections, diabetic foot infections, and certain fungal infections.  The information collected from these homeopathic treatments  revealed that N u-3 applied 
topically in solution for up to 14 days was able to improve the severity of an infection based 
visual observation.   
1.3 Rationale for Current Study  
The proposed clinical study is designed to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of increasing 
doses of topically applied bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 on a chronic diabetic foot infection.  In 
addition, the study is designed to collect data on the efficacy of N u-3 as it relates to eradication  
of the infection and wound healing to enable planning of future trials .  The 3 dosing levels and 
length of treatment were selected based on in vitro , in vivo , and toxicology studies of Nu-3 and 
its unique mechanism of action.  While the current trial is considered a first -in-human trial, the 
design also has taken into consideration data collected from the development of the compound initially as a homeopathic treatment where the use as a topical solution was able to reduce the severity of several commo n topical infections.  Recent studies have shown that a high percentage 
of chronic wounds have biofilm associated which interferes  with wound healing.  This trial is 
intended to evaluate the efficacy of an antimicrobial with known activity against biofilm encased 
bacteria to not only eliminate the infection but potential ly improve wound healing.  For this 
reason, bisphosphocin Nu- 3 is being formulated in a normal saline solution so that a clearer 
picture can be gained of its effect on the wound without the interference of an ointment base.  
Bisphosphocins have  been shown to  effectively reduce the severity  of the infection  in preclinical 
animal model testing , but these models have limits as they do not accurately mimic the complex 
environment of a chronic wound infection and in many cases rely on immunosuppression to maintain the infection.  This first in human study is designed to collect both safety and efficacy data so that the parameters such as dose, duration and frequency of administration can be refined  
for future more intensive studies.  Based on the data collected from preclinical studies, it is 
anticipated that a  therapeutic effect may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10 mg/ml) and 
high dose  (2% w/v, or 20 mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extending the treatment course an  
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed the seven (7) day treatment and 
approval was given by the SMC.  The  decision to extend treatment  of individual subjects 
showing a clinical response would then be made by the principal investigator. 
Potential Risks  
This clinical trial is a first in human trial so there is a potential risk of an adverse reaction from 
the study drug.  Bisphosphocin Nu- 3, however would be considered a nucleotide analog which is 
a class of drugs with a strong safety record so the likelihood of this particular risk i s considered

 minimal.  The major distinction  between bisphosphocin Nu- 3 and the nucleotide an alog class are 
that both 3’ and 5’ sites are blocked and a novel acid activation step that is reversed when the 
compounds are exposed to buffers or base.  Therefore, it is anticipated that any reaction would be localized since the sodiu m bicarbonate in the blood would neutralize the compound which is 
supported by inhibitory effect of blood in MIC assays.  In addition to a reaction from the study 
drug, there is also the possibility that the drug is ineffective and the infection worsens which could necessitate more aggressive therapy or treatment.  
Potential Benefits  
The major benefit of the proposed study will be an improvement in the wound due to the 
elimination  of the pathogenic bacteria that is inhibiting healing.  Bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 is a new 
class of broad spectrum antimicrobial so it is unlikely that the pathogenic bacteria will be outside its spectrum of activity or resistant, which is a major cause of treatment failure in this indication.  
The dose levels have been selected so that two cohorts are likely to  be receiving efficacious dose 
levels of drug with a satisfactory  safety margin so that some  improvement in wound appearance 
is anticipated in some subject s in these cohorts.  In addition to directly eliminating the 
pathogenic bacteria associated with the chronic ulcer, it is anticipated that a second potential benefit would be the elimination of any biofilm encased bacteria that would then make the infection more susceptible to traditional therapy as a follow up therapy.  Any of these outcomes would benefit the subject as it would reduce the risk of limb loss due to a worsening infection 
and the pain.

 2 OBJECTIVES  
Objective/Pu rpose: The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability  of 
Nu-3 when applied topically to a chronically infected diabetic ulcer. 
A secondary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the microbiological activity of Nu -3 as measured by clinical wound assessments and presence of pathogenic bacteria.   Based 
on pre clinical data, it is anticipated that improvement in the clinical wound assessment may be 
observed in the middle and high dose (1% and 2%) cohorts that may j ustify extending the 
treatment for an additional 7 days. 
Statement of Hypothesis:  Nu-3 is a broad spectrum antimicrobial with a unique mechanism of 
action that involves cell membrane depolarization and rapid bacterial cell death.  As an 
antimicrobial it is particularly well suited for development as a topical for Diabetic Foot Infections for the following reasons: 
1. These infections tend to be polymicrobial in nature , involve biofilm,  and require an 
antibiotic(s) with  a broad spectrum of activity.  
2. Many of the bacteria in these infected wounds are resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics making treatment difficult  
3. The directly bactericidal mode of action of Nu -3 should translate into an immediate 
reduction in the severity of the infections and offers new options in dosing. 
4. Research has shown that many chronic infections are due to the formation of biofilm which is inherently resistant to treatment by traditional antibiotics but susceptible to 
treatment by bisphosphocins such as Nu-3 
 
The proposed clinica l trial design is aimed at defining the initial parameters for safety and 
tolerability in an infected wound based on the currently available preclinical data on Nu-3. The 
trial is focused on DFIs of mild to moderate severity and an area of 0.5 to 6 cm
2 as a population 
of subjects that will provide the data across a r ange of pathogens and ulcers of varying duration.  
In addition, the middle and high dose (1% and 2% Nu- 3) cohorts were selected so that some 
clinical improvement in wound assessment be obser ved which will enable better planning of 
following clinical trials.   
Route of Administration: Study medication will be applied topically directly to the infected 
ulcer  
Dosage:  The study includes a sequential ascending dose protocol with Cohort 1 at 0.1% w/v or 
1mg/ml, Cohort 2 at 1% w/v or 10mg/ml, and Cohort 3 at 2% w/v or 20mg/ml.  In addition, two 
subjects in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.  The proposed doses  and treatment 
duration were based on data from in vitro  antimicrobial assays, preclinical animal efficacy 
models, and toxicology studies and were selected to demonstrate safety at a high dose that provides a significant therapeutic margin lethal to all tested bacteria and fungi to date while proven safe in animal toxicology studies.

Page 25 
 Dosing Regime:   To establish the initial safety and tolerability of Nu -3, a twice daily application 
of the compound was selected for this clinical trial based on preclinical studies on efficacy and 
toxicology.  Subject s will be required to keep a daily log of when treatments are applied and  
contacted  daily by a member of the study team. 
Ulcer Imaging and Area Calculations:   Photographs of the ulcer(s) will be taken at study visits 
using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system which allows capture of a color image and 
computer calculation of ulcer(s) area, depth, and volume with more consistent and greater 
accuracy than traditional methods.  
Randomization: Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to Nu -3 (n=8) or 
matching placebo (n=2) in each cohort. 
Treatment Period:   Day 1 (in clinic): Day 2 (end of SAD/Beginning of MAD) through Day 8 or 
Day 15 (Cohort 2 and 3) Follow- Up Period:  Day 1 5 or Day 22 (Cohort 2 and 3) 
Selection of Study Population:   Type I or II diabetes mellitus subjects with a chronic infected 
lower extremity ulcer defined as having a DUSS score of 0 to 3 and a DFI wound score 1 to 9 as 
this is the most appropriate population to assess the safety of a new drug aimed at treating 
infected wou nds.  The proposed inclusion criteria have been selected to define a subject 
population that will have a diverse spectrum of pathogens and range of chronic ulcers to ensure a proper assessment of safety and tolerability as well as data to better define follow on clinical studies.  The DFI wound score range is intended to select subjects with mild to moderate infection  which  have the best potential to respond to the treatment.  A  radiograph of the affected 
area will be performed during the screening period to rule out the possibility that the ulcer is due to an underlying osteomyelitis.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated the safety of Nu -3 on 
mammalian cells, intact and damage d skin, and when injected intravenously, therefore exposure 
of healthy subject to Nu -3 would provide little if any additional safety information.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
Phase I/IIa, three cohort double- blind ascending dose with two dosing phases per cohort, study in 
diabet es mellitus subjects with a chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score 
between 0 and 3 and a DFI wound score between 1 and 9.  The study proposes to use the same 
subject(s) in SAD Phase 1 and MA D Phase 2 of each cohort 
The study is designed to conduct the cohorts sequentially with the completion of the first cohort 
before initiating the next dosing level.   Prior to initiating treatment of the ulcer, subject s will be 
administered a skin sensitivity test by applying a single  drop of Nu-3 or placebo  to the forearm 
and visually monitoring the area for 10-15 minutes for any acute reaction such as reddening, 
swelling, or irritation.  If the skin sensitivity test is negative the subject is cleared to begin Arm 1 
of the treatment.  
A subject who has cleared the skin sensitivity test will have a microbiological sample taken from the infected diabetic ulcer(s) prior to initiating treatment.  In Phase 1, eligible  subjects will be 
treated with a single application of Nu -3 or placebo in a 4 to 1 ratio to judge the initial safety of 
Nu-3 over a brief 15- 30 mi nute interval and 24 hour interval .  Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 will be 
applied topically to the chronic infected ulcer  (DUSS score: 1 -3; DFI wound score: 1-9), and the 
area observed over a 15 -30 minute time period and photographed.  If no visible reaction is 
observed, the ulcer is covered with a bandage.  The subject will be released with verbal 
instruction s to leave the  nonabrasive, hypoallergenic  bandage on the wound, avoid getting the 
bandage wet,  and return for a follow up visit within 24 ± 2h.  At the follow up visit, the bandage 
will be removed, the ulcer visually examined , photographed using the Aranz Medical 
Silhouette™ system , and the subject  cleared for the MA D Phase 2 based on the 
recommendation/decision  of the PI and on the absence of any  drug related SAEs.   
In Phase 2, eligible subjects, which are those who have been approved by the PI after the Visit 2 
examination, will be instructed in the proper application of bisphosphocin Nu-3 or placebo.  In 
the clinic, the subjects  will be observed applying the first dose to ensure compliance.  The 
subject will then be given a 7-day supply of study drug, non-abrasive bandages, a home diary , 
written instructions for care and hygiene, and sen t home to continue treatment.  On Day  9 ± 2h or 
earlier in the case of any adverse events, subjects will return to the clinic for an examination, 
including visual evaluation  of the ulcer, vital signs, adverse events, photo documentation using 
the Aranz  Medical Silhouette ™ system , collection of a sample for microbiological assessment, 
and concomitant medication use.  A final follow up visit will be scheduled for Day 15 for a 
complete examination as described above.   Based on the data collected from precl inical studies, 
it is anticipated that a therapeutic effect may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10mg/ml) and high- dose (2% w/v, or 20mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extending the treatment course an 
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed the seven (7) day treatment and approval was given by the SMC.  The decision to extend treatment of individual subjects showing a clinical response would then be made by the principal investigator.

 dissolved in water has a pH between 2 and 2.5.  The antibacterial activity can be neutralized by a 
strong base or buffer.  Prior non- human investigations indicate that  all doses being used in this 
study are likely to be safe, medical personnel and caregivers should use caution when handling 
the drug to avoi d exposure of sub- MIC levels through inadvertent application to the skin and 
normal skin flora that could potentially lead to resistant strains.   
4.3 Dosage and Administration of Bisphosphocin Nu-3 or Placebo  
Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 will be dosed at three different concentrations of 0.1% w/v (1mg/ml), 1% 
w/v (10mg/ml), and 2% w/v (20mg/ml) in 0.85% normal saline.  Placebo will be 0.85% normal 
saline solution.  The drug or placebo  will be administered as a single dose and then twice daily 
for 7 days.  The drug or placebo will be administered to the infected diabetic foot ulcer and 
surrounding intact ski n at a dose of 1 -3 drops from a  dropper bottle  per 1 cm2 of ulcer area. 
4.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are allowed to continue on any concomitant prescribed medication for medical 
conditions not related to the treatment of the infected diabetic ulcer.  All systemic and topical 
antibiotics must be stopped seven ( 7) days prior to admission to the proposed study.

 6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY M ANAGEMENT 
6.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The primary endpoint safety variables will be the incidence of localized swelling surrounding the ulcer, development of a rash, joint pain, and any adverse changes in the appearance of the ulcer.   
The Safety Mo nitoring Committee (S MC) will receive safety reports outlining the number of 
subjects enrolled in each cohort to date, summary of the safety data Day 0 – 15 for the most 
recent cohort, adverse events, and serious adverse events listed by grade as well as a ll laboratory 
tests data.  These reports will present the data blinded  and will be unblinded only if necessary to 
determine the cause of an AE or SAE at the request of the SMC .  In addition, safety data from 
completed cohorts will be summarized in the same  manner and included in the report.  All 
information on adverse events will be provided in a table.   
6.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event: According to the ICH E6 guidelines, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject /subjects in a clinical study regardless of its relationship to the 
administration of the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unintended, unfavorable, or 
unexpected sign, laboratory test, symptom, react ion, or disease temporarily associated with a 
clinical subject /subjects during the duration of the study.  The occurrence of an AE may come to 
the attention of study personnel at a study visit and during interviews of subject s seeking medical 
care, or upon reviews conducted by study monitors.  During all visits and interviews after 
administration of the study drug, clinical staff will inquire about any anticipated adverse events or symptoms using standardized questions.  The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRFs,  
All AEs whether local or systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” should be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The information to be recorded should include a description of the event, time of onset, clinicia n’s assessment of the severity, relationship to the 
study drug (assessment to be conducted only by those with the qualified training and authority to make a diagnosis and include the CMO, MD, PA, Nurse Practitioner, DO, DPM in podiatry and DDS), and time t o resolution or stabilization. All AEs that occur during the study regardless of 
their association with the study drug must be documented appropriately and followed to adequate resolution.  
Any AE (i.e. a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset date after 
the screening visit up to the last day on study (including follow -up), should be recorded as an AE 
on the appropriate CRF page(s). 
  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014  
 
 
Page 38 
 An AE does not include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures) e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior 
to the scre ening visit, that do not worsen. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospitalization 
for elective surgery, social  and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject is hospitalized for observation . 
• Events related to the underlying condition under study should not be reported as adver se 
events unless they are co nsidered to be study related. 
Severity of Event: All AEs will be assessed by the investigator and recorded on the appropriate 
CRF page, including the date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug or study procedures, outcome and action taken with study medication.  The clinician will assess all AEs 
using a protocol defined grading system as follows. 
Scale  Definition  
Grade 1  No intervention required because the event is mild or asymptomatic.  A clinical or diagnostic 
observation.  
Grade 2  Minimal to moderate intervention and/or localized event that requires non -invasive treatment  
Grade 3  A debilitating or incapacitating conditio n, severe or medically significant that is not life threatening 
that requires hospitalization or prolonged treatment 
Grade 4  Requiring urgent intervention because the event is life threatening  
Grade 5  Death of a subject  due to an adverse event.  
 
Relationship to Study Products:  
6.2.2 Reactogenicity  
Adverse events associated with the study product may include vesicle ( blistering ) development, 
burning sensation at the ulcer site (may be masked by diabetic neuropathy), increase in local 
temperature, and exp ansion of necrotic tissue surrounding the ulcer.

 6.2.3 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows:  
• Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening situation  (subject is at immediate risk of death); 
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement  of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious 
events);  
• Persistent or signific ant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth  defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug; 
• Other: medically significant  events that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the Subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Clarification of Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adve rse event in itself.  In reports of 
death due to “Disease Progression”, where no other information is provided, the death 
will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the study drug(s). 
• All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported for subjects on study and 
for deaths occurring within 30 days of last study drug dose or within 30 days of last study evaluation, whichever is longer.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the 
time of the event.  Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. 
• “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs.  If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014  
 
 
Page 40 
 • “In-patient hospitalization” means that the subject has been formally admitted to a 
hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department. 
• The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.     
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  An AE that is assessed as Grade 
4 (potentially life -threatening) should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 4.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre- defined outcomes as described 
above in Section 6.2.3.  
6.2.4 Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values or 
Abnormal Clinical Findings  
Laboratory abnormalities a re usually not recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events 
unless they are associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, etc.) independent from the underlying me dical condition, that require medical or surgical intervention, or lead to study drug 
interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable.  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiogra m, X -rays, vital signs) 
that are associated with sign and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an adverse event (or serious adverse event) as described in the protocol.  If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis.   
Severity should be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) .  For adverse events associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event 
should be graded based on the  clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions, which 
may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 
6.3 Serious Advent Event Reporting Procedures  
The study sponsor  is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory  authorities reports of Serious 
Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs); 
therefore,  the study sponsor or its delegate  must be notified immediately regarding the 
occurrence of any SAE that occurs after the subject consents to participate in the study, including SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures performed from screening onwards. The 
procedures for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, are as follows: 
• Record the SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form. 
• E-mail or fax the SAE form to the attention of the Drug Safety Manager within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Contact information is as follows: 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 
Protocol #LAI2014 - l

Lakewood -Amedex 
Inc. Drug Safety 
Manager 
Medical Monitor: Original -310ct2014 
• For fatal or life-thre atening event s, also e-mail or fax copies of hospital case repo1i s, autopsy 
repo1i s, and other documents when reque sted and applicable. Tran smission of su ch 
documents should occur with Per sonal Subject Details de -identified, without losing the 
traceability of a document to the Subject Identifier s. 
• The study sponsor or its delegate may reque st additional info1mati on from the investigator to 
ensure the timely completi on of accurate safety reports. 
The investigator must take all therapeuti c measures necessaiy for resolution of the SAE . Any 
medi cations necessa 1 y for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant 
medi cation section of the subject's CRF and the event description section of the SAE fo1m. 
Follow-up of adve rse events will continue through the last day on study (inclu ding the follow-up 
off-study medication period of the study) and/or until the investigato r and/or study spon sor 
dete1mine that the subject's condition is stable. The study sponsor or its delegate may request 
that ce1iain adverse events be followed until resolution. 
6.3.1 Reporting Pregnancy 
The risks of treatment with bisphosphocin during pregnancy has not been evaluated. 
The subject must be instmcted to disco ntinue all study diugs and info1m the investigator 
immediately if she becomes pregnant durin g the study. 
The investigator should repo1i all pregnancies to Lakewoo d-Amedex within 24 hours of 
beco ming aware of the pregnancy. The investigato r sho uld counsel the subject regarding the 
possible effects of prior study diug exposure on the fetus and the need to info1m the study site of 
the outcome of the pregnancy . 
Any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medi cal reasons will be 
recorded as an AE or an SAE .

Page 42 
 A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported as described in 
the adverse and Serious Adverse Events section.  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse 
pregnancy outcome post-study must be reported to Lakewood-Amedex. 
Additionally, all pregnancies that occur during the study should be reported using the Pregnancy 
Report CRF page.  Monitoring of the subject should continue until the conclusion of the 
pregnancy.  The outcome should be reported to Lakewood- Amedex  using the Pregnancy 
Outcome CRF page(s) .  If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been complete the 
outcome should be reported directly to Lakewood-Amedex.  Pregnancies that occur after the 
subject has discontinued study drugs do not require monitoring.  
6.4 Safety Oversight 
6.4.1 Independent Safety Monitor  Committee  
Clinical Response Evaluations:  
The clinical outcome will be based on the P rinciple Investigator ’s judgment as to the 
improvement of the wound status from Visit 1  to Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD) and Visits 5 and 6 .  The 
PI will score the ulcer(s) using both the DUSS and DFI Wound Scoring S ystems.

An improvement in the DFI Wound Score will be used to indicate a clinical improvement of the 
wound and a change in the DUSS Score wound be used to indicate the healing of a small ulceration. 
Microbiological Response Evaluations:  
This assessment will be conducted on samples collected by the investigator on Visit 2 , Visit 4, 
Visit 5, and Visit 6.of the study which will be cultured to determine: microbial load and identity 
of the infected pathogens or wound flora.  The microbiological response will be determined by a comparison of the results pre- and post- treatment.  
SMC Safety Reports:  
Safety reports will be written by the SMC three times during the course of the study.  The first will follow the first interim analysis (once the first SAD/MAD cohort 1 reaches Day 9), the 
second report will follow the second interim analysis (once the second SAD/MAD cohort 2 reaches Day 9), and the third report will follow the third interim analysis (once  the third 
SAD/MAD cohort 3 reaches Day 9).  The study reports will be presented to the Principal 
Investigator at each clinical site and Lakewood-Amedex Inc.    
6.4.2 Study Termination  
This study may be terminated at any time by Lakewood- Amedex Inc.  The PI and SMC may 
provide Lakewood- Amedex  with recommendations regarding termination of the trial, however, 
Lakewood- Amedex ultimately makes the final decision.  Reasons for terminating the study 
include: 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014  
 
 
Page 44 
 • If a serious or unexpected adverse event occurs and the event is judged to be probably or definitively related to exposure to Nu-3, the study will be immediately suspended by the 
Principal Investigator pending revie w of all appropriate safety data.  The event will be 
reported to the SMC, IRB, and Sponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours or notification of its occurrence.  No additional subjects will receive Nu -3 until a joint decision is 
reached between the Sponsor, PI, and SMC as to whether further doses can be given or 
the trial is terminated.  Subjects currently in a  MAD Arm will be contacted to ascertain 
treatment status and if any AE s have occurred.  Absent any findings , subject s in the 
ongoing MAD arms will be al lowed to complete treatment.  
• Safety Monitoring Committee terminates the study based on interim safety review  
• In the event of a clinical hold being placed on the study following a report of an AE to the FDA  
• At the discretion of Lakewood- Amedex . 
 
6.4.3 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug  
Subjects will be free to withdraw at any time for any reason , or they may be withdrawn if 
necessary, to protect their health and safety or the integrity of the study data.   A subject  will be 
removed from participation in the study if any of the following occur: 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other 
medical condition or situation arises such that in the judgment of the PI continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject 
• A protocol violation/deviation occurs that might compromise the integrity of the data, 
compliance, or subject safety  
• Informed consent is withdrawn 
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
 
6.4.4 Handling Withdrawals  
If a subject is withdrawn prematurely from the study after receiving Nu -3, the reason for 
withdrawal is to be documented in the source document and in the CRF. If the withdrawal of a 
subject is due to an AE, the subject  will be followed until resolution/stabilization of the adverse 
event. 
In the case of a subject  prematurely withdrawing from the study, the following procedures and/or 
evaluations will be performed if possible at the time of withdrawal or as soon thereafter as 
possible (i .e. study subject withdraws at time of visit and consents to the procedures or consents 
to come in for a visit and the procedures) 
• Photo documentation of ulcer site using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system. 
• Collection of a sample for microbiological assessment  
Bisphosphocin NU -3

Page 45 
 • Assessment of adverse events  
In the event a subject is lost to follow -up, the site staff must make reasonable attempts to contact 
the subject. A minimum of two documented phone calls followed by a certified mailed letter is considered reasonable. The measures taken to follow up must be documented. 
Administrative w ithdraw als will be replaced in order to achieve the objective of 10 subjects per 
cohort who receive a complete treatment regime.  Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE/SAE related to the study drug will not be replaced.

 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
Study Hypothesis – Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 solution applied topically to a chronic infected diabetic 
ulcer will be safe and well tolerated in subjects suffering from diabetes mellitus.  In addition,  the 
Nu-3 MAD Arm subjects may show improvement in the ulcer appearance, reduction in size, and 
improvement in both the DUSS  score and DFI Wound Score. 
The study hypothesis will be judged by the following two study objectives: 
• Primary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating single and multiple 
doses of Nu- 3, a novel antimicrobial of the bisphosphocin class, topically to an open 
wound/diabetic ulcer 
• Secondary objectives: To assess clinical response of subject s of the ascending multiple 
dose arm of Nu -3 applied topically to an open wound/diabetic ulcer to determine clinical 
and microbiological response.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The number of treated subjects is based on the desire to gain preliminary safety,  tolerability and 
efficacy information to support future work, while exposing a minimal number of subjects to the 
study procedures and medication.   Inferential statistical testing is not the primary intent of the study, therefore, no formal sample size calculation was considered.  Ten subjects per Cohort (1, 2, and 3), for a total not to exceed 30, is considered sufficient to show clinical significance for safety and preliminary efficacy analysis.  The sample sizes for this study were set based on the trial design for dose escalation  and safety evaluation requirements and not for statistical analysis.  
7.3 Planned Interim Analysis  
There will be an interim analysis to review safety data on each cohort of subjects when all 
members of a cohort complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD Follow Up) .  In addition, an interim analysis 
will be conducted after the first 5 subjects of Cohort 2 and 3 complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD 
Follow Up).  The interim analysis will be performed by the S afety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) which will be composed of  three  physicians and may include one infectious disease  
specialist, one diabetologist, and one orthopedic surgeon.  The SMC will communicate by email  
or teleconference on at least 3 occasions during the study and more frequently if necessary. 
No formal statistical interim analys es are planned for this Phase I/IIa study since it is primarily 
focused on evaluating safety and tolerability.  Interim safety data on each cohort will be provided 
to the SMC when all members of a cohort have reached Day 3.   The SMC will decide if the 
study can proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote).  The SMC will also determine if the study may proceed after receiving a report about a study related Grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014  
 
 
Page 47 
 (majority vote).  The Chairman of the SM C will share their findings and recommendations with 
Lakewood Amedex and Principal Investigators .  
7.3.1 Safety Review 
Subjects will be monitored closely for the occurrence of study related adverse events during their 
24-hr admission in the SAD Arm and for up to 7 days following their last Nu- 3 treatment in the 
study.  If any grade 3 or 4 adverse events occur and the event is judged to be probably or 
definitely related to having received the Nu -3, the study will be immediately suspended by the 
Principal Investigator pending review of all safety data.  Adverse event s determined to be related 
to the study drug will be reported to the SMC , Lakewood- Amedex, and second PI  within 
24 hours of notification of its occurrence.  No ad ditional subject s will receive Nu -3 depending on 
the joint decision of the SMC, Principal Investigator, and Lakewood Amedex Project Coordinator and CMO as to whether further doses can be given or the entire study should be 
terminated.  In addition, the SMC  will review all interim safety data prior to the next cohort 
beginning treatment.  At each review, the SMC will determine whether the study may proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote). 
7.4 Statistical Analysis Overview  
This study is designed to evalua te the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a minimum 
of three dose levels of Nu- 3 relative to placebo.  Data summaries will be presented in order to 
assess the safety of Nu -3 and each Nu- 3 dose group will be compared with placebo to determine  
the presence or absence of a treatment effect.  Evaluation across all dose levels of Nu -3 will be 
conducted to determine if there is evidence of a dose response to any treatment effect noted.   All 
subjects treated with placebo from all cohorts will be co mbined for any analysis.  Evaluations 
will also be conducted within each subject over time to assess the rate of change (if any) in study outcome measures over the full course of the study treatment and follow -up periods.  Inferential 
statistical testing i s not the primary inte rest of this study. 
All subjects receiving any amount of study treatment will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and efficacy.  An “intent to treat”  approach will be followed in all data summaries, using all 
available data in the summaries and analysis  for an assessment of safety and tolerability while an 
“as treated” approach will be used for microbiological and clinical wound assessment data summaries and reports.  
All descriptive summaries and analyses will be presented in tabu lar and/or graphical form from 
all subjects as appropriate.  These summaries and analysis will be described in detail in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be produced prior to breaking the study blind.  All statistical summaries and analysis w ill be conducted using SAS®.

 8 RESPONSIBILITIES  
8.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
8.1.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South 
Africa), International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the study subject. For studies conducted under a United States IND, the investigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21  CFR 312, 
subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part  50, 1998, and 21 CFR, 
part 56, 1998, are adhered to. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical trial, the investigator will ensure that 21  CFR, Part  54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that investigators and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Lakewood- Amed ex or proprietary interests in the drug being 
studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator. The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify Lakewood- Ame dex of any 
change reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. Study completion is defined as the date that the last subject has completed the protocol defined 
activities.  
This study is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR, part  320, 1993, 
“Retention of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”  
8.1.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) Approval 
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the subject (such as advertisements, subject information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) wi ll be submitted by the investigator to an IRB  in compliance with FDA regulations for 
IRBs (21CFR Part 56) . Approval from the IRB must be obtained before  starting the study and 
must  be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol 
version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB  approval must also be submitted to 
the IRB  for approval before implementation.

 8.1.3 Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures. The 
investigator must utilize an IRB  approved consent form for documenting written informed 
consent. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representati ve and the person obtaining consent.  The information in 
the informed consent must comply with 21CFR Part 50, Subpart B.  The element s of the 
informed consent must be consistent with the requirements of 21CFR Part 50.25. 
8.1.4 Confidentiality  
The investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject initials, date of birth, and an identification code (i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form or biologica l sample 
submitted to the Sponsor, IRB , or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from  Lakewood- Amedex , including but not 
limited to the Investigator Brochure, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational new drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of  Lakewood- Amedex  during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from Lakewood- Amedex . The investigator further agrees to take 
all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 
8.1.5 Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following two categories: (1)  investigator’s study file, and 
(2) subject clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, IRB and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae an d authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
The required source data are listed in the Source Data verification Plan, and should include sequential notes containing at least the following information for each subject:  
• subject identification (name, date of birth, gender); 
• documentation that subject meets eligibility criteria, i.e., history, physical examination, 
and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria);

• results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol;  
• start and end date (including dose regimen) of trial me dication (preferably drug 
dispensing and return should be documented as well); 
• record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and preferably including causality and intensity); 
• concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant; dose changes 
should be motivated); 
• date of trial completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. 
 
All clinical study documents must be retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the 
investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with Lakewood- Amedex . The investigator must notify 
Lakewood- Amedex  before destroying any clinical study records. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the subject  records to another party or move them to 
another location, Lakewood-Amedex should be notified in advance.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and  Lakewood-
Amedex  to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed 
to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 
8.1.6 Case Rep ort Forms 
For each subject enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal investigator or 
sub-investigator (as appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also 
applies to records for those subjects who fail to complete the study (even during a pre -
randomization screening period if a CRF was initiated). If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome.

 8.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, placebos, and comparators. This 
includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from  the study sponsor and quantities dispensed to subjects, 
including kit number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, subject initials, and the initials 
of the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with Lakewood- Amedex  requirements. Drug may be returned on an ongoing basis during the study , if 
appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will ship any remaining investigational product (to include empty containers)  to 
Xcelience Inc. for dispos al.   
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study.  
8.1.8 Inspections  
The investigator understands that source documents for this trial must  be made available to 
appropriately qualified personnel from Lakewood- Amedex  or its representatives, to IRBs  or to 
regulatory authority or health authority ins pectors.  
8.1.9 Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and e valuations described in this protocol.  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or Manual of Procedures requirements.  The noncompliance maybe either on the part of the subject , the investiga tor, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly. 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• Compliance with Protocol sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
• Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 
• Noncompliance sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2 
 
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations 
within 5 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 5 working days of the 
scheduled protocol -required activity.  All significant deviations must be promptly reported to 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014

 Lakewood Amedex Inc . to the attention of  via fax.  Reports can be sent to 
Lakewood - Amedex as specified below  copying the CRA assigned to your site: 
• Via the web -based PD forms submission  
• FAX submission (1 ): utilizing the Protocol Deviation form and the 
email/fax transmittal form, or 
• E-mail submission ( ) utilizing the Protocol Deviation 
form and the email/fax transmittal form.  
 
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in the study subject  source documents.  A 
completed copy of the LAI Protocol Deviation form must be maintained in the regulatory file, as 
well as in the subject ’s source document.  Significant p rotocol deviations must be sent to the 
local IRB/EC per their guidelines.  The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB/EC requirements.  
8.2 Sponsor Responsibilities  
8.2.1 Protocol Modifications  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may be made only by Lakewood- Amedex . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB  in 
accordance with local requirements. Approval must be obtained before c hanges can be 
implemented. 
8.2.2 Study Report and Publications  
A clinical study report will be prepared  by Protocol Coordinator  and provided to the regulatory 
agency(ies).  Lakewood- Amedex  will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the 
ICH Guidel ine for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH  E3). Note that an 
abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases.  
Lakewood- Amedex Inc . will have the sole decision on whether or not to publish the results of 
this research.  The Company enc ourages its scientists and collaborators to published the results 
of any research sponsored by the Company but only after a review of the data by the Company to 
ensure that any discoveries or trade secrets are properly protected by issued, pending, or newl y 
filed patents or patents applications.   
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a trials registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all clinical trials  except Phase I studies  be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, 
which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine.  Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies.  Lakewood- Amedex, Inc . will be responsible for 
registering the clinical trial with an acceptable registry.  Any clinical trial starting enrollment after 01 July 2005 must be registered on or before subject enrollment.

Page 53 
 The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project t hat prospectively assigns human 
subject to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause -and- effect relationship between 
medical intervention and a health outcome.  Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study 
pharmacokinetics or major toxi city (e .g. Phase I trials) would be exempt from this policy. 
8.3 Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities 
8.3.1 Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (ICH  GCP) guidelines, the study monitor must 
have direct access to t he investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded 
in the CRFs for consistency. 
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the complet eness, consistency, and accuracy of the 
data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to any subject records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected i n the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
8.3.2 Access to Information for Auditing or Inspections 
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of Lakewood-Amedex may conduct inspections or 
audits of the clinical study. If the investigator is notified  of an inspection by a regulatory 
authority the investigator agrees to notify the Lakewood- Amedex  medical monitor immediately. 
The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or Lakewood-
Amedex access to records, facilities, an d personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or 
audit. 
8.3.3 Study Discontinuation  
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate regulatory authority(ies), and IRB/IEC s. In terminating the study, Lakewood- Amedex  and the 
investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.

Nivolumab versus Nivolumab in Participants with Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma 
that is Previously Untreated
Study Phase: 3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Population:
The study  populationconsists of adult (18 years of age, or ageof majority) participants with 
unresectable or metastati c melanoma that is previously untreated who have not received prior 
systemic therapy  for thei r disease. Enrollment in this study  was cl osed on 19 -Apr-2018. 
Key Inclusion Criteria:
Histologically confi rmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma, per the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual (8th edition) 
Treatment -naïve participants (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy  for unresectable or 
metastati c melano ma). Note that prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melano ma therapy is permitted 
in the setting of completely  resected disease if it was completed at least 6 months prior to 
rando mizat ion, and all related adverse events (AEs) have either returned to baseline or 
stabilized.
At least one measurable lesio n by co mputed tomography ( CT)or magnetic resonance imager y 
(MRI )per Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tum ors(RECIST) v1.1 criteria
Tumor tissue (biopsy or surgical specimen, where applicable) from an unresectable or 
metastati c site o f disease must be provided for bio marker analyses. In order to be rando mized, 
a participant must be classified as PD-L1 positive (1%tumor cell membrane staining) vs

PD-L1 negat ive(< 1%tumor cell membrane staining)/ PD-L1 indeterminate (tumor cell 
membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining or melanin content). If an 
insufficient amount of tumor tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site i s available prior to 
the start of the screening phase, then a fresh biopsy will be required during the screening p hase
for perform ance o f biomarker analyses.
Parti cipants must have known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation 
testing pe r local institutional standards during the Screening Period and have results of BRAF 
testing available pri or to randomizati on.Participants wi th indeterminate BRAF status or wi th 
BRAF status not documented prior to randomization are not permitted to random izeto a 
treatm ent arm .
Prior radiotherapy  must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatm ent 
administration .
Parti cipants m ust be able to swallow pills intact.
Key Exclusion Criteria:
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
Active brain metastases or leptom eningeal metastases .Parti cipants with brain metastases are 
eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnet ic resonance imagery ( MRI )evidence 
of progressi on for at l east 8 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first 
dose of study  treatm ent administration. 
Uveal or ocular melano ma
Parti cipants wi th a condit ion requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily  prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications wi thin 14 days of  start 
of study  treatm ent.Inhaled or topical steroids , and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily  prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of act ive autoimmune disease.
Parti cipants with a personal or family (ie, in a first-degree relative) history  of cytochrom e b5 
reductase deficiency (previously called methemoglobin reductase deficiency) or other diseases 
that put them at risk of methem oglobinemia . All participants will be screened for 
methemoglo bin levels pri or to randomizat ion.
Parti cipants wi th a history  of glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD )deficiency or other 
congenital or autoimmune hemo lytic disorders. All participants will be screened for G6PD 
levels prior to randomizat ion.
Prior treatment with an ant i-PD-1 (except if given as adjuvant or neoadj uvant therapy  for 
melano ma), anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA -4 antibody  (except if given as adjuvant or 
neoadj uvant therapy  for melano ma), or any other ant ibody  or drug specifically targeting T -cell 
costim ulation or immune checkpo int pathways
Prior treatm ent wi th BMS -986205 or any  other IDO1 inhibitors
Objectives and Endpoints:
As of 19-Apr-2018 enrollment in this study  was closed and only safety assessments will be

analyzed, but no formal analyses are planned. 
Overall Design:
This is a Phase 3, randomized, study  of BMS -986205 in combinat ion with nivolumab versus 
nivolumab monotherapy  in adult and adolescent participants with unresectable or metastatic 
melano mathat is previously  untreated . (This study was originally double blind with respect to 
BMS -986205 but was unblinded wit h Revised Protocol 01.)
A pre-treatm ent tum or sam ple to determine PD -L1 status i s requi red to be submi tted f rom all 
participants prior to randomizat ion. The sample must be obtained within 3 months prior to 
enrollment from a metastatic tumor lesion or from an unresectable primary tumor lesion; the 
tumor sam ple must be taken from a site of disease that has not been previously  irradi ated. In 
addition, no intervening treatm ent may have been administered between the time of
biopsy/surgery  and rando mizat ion.
Parti cipants m ust have a docum ented BRAF status prior to randomization. 
Depending on the treatm ent arm , the parti cipant will  receive BMS- 986205 pl us nivolumab or 
nivolumab monotherapy for up to 104 weeks (approximately 2years) of study treatment . 
Under Revised Protocol  01, BMS -98205 Placebo will not be administered to Arm B 
participants, and invest igators have the option of continuing on nivolumab monotherapy  in 
participants assigned to Arm A (nivolumab + BMS986205) . 
One cycle of treatment is defined as 4 weeks . Treatment will continue until investigator -
assessed disease progressi on per RECIST v1.1 criteria, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent/assent, or completion of 104 weeks of treatm ent, whichever occurs first. Treatment 
beyo nd initial progressi on is permitted if the participant has invest igator -assessed clinical 
benefit, is tolerating study  treatm ent (see Secti ons 8.1.1 and 8.1.3 .2 of the protocol ), and has 
not yet completed 104 weeks of study  treatm ent.
On-study  tumor assessments will follow the schedul e of the l ocal standard of care.

5 STUDY DESIGN
See Secti on 3.1.1 for updates on Study  Desi gn as per Revised Protocol 01. 
5.1 Overall Design
The original  design was a Phase 3, rando mized, double -blind study  of BMS -986205 in 
combinat ion with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy  in adult (18 years of age and ol der, 
or age of majority) participants with unresectable or metastati c melanoma that is previously 
untreat ed.As of 19 -Apr-2018, enrollment in the study  was cl osed (see Sect ion 3.1.1 ).
Parti cipants must have unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, per the 8th edition of the 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual30(See Appendix 7), and m ust n ot 
have received prior systemic therapy  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melano ma. 
Prior adj uvant or neoadj uvant therapy  in part icipants wi th previously  com pletely resected disease 
that has now recurred is permitted if this therapy  was completed at least 6 months prior to 
rando mizat ion. 
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 5.1 -1. 
Figure 5.1 -1: Study Design Schematic
Note: As of Revised Protocol 01, treatment will no longer be blinded ,and participants in Arm B will no longer 
receive BMS -986205 Placebo. Participants in Arm A, have the option to discontinue BMS -986205, and continue 
nivolumab monotherapy, at investigator discretion.
A pre-treatm ent tumor sample to determine PD-L1 status is requi red to be submitted from all 
participants prior to randomizat ion. The sample must be obtained within 3 months prior to 
enrollment from a metastatic tumor lesion or from an unresectable primary  tumor lesion. The 
tumor sample must be taken from a siteof disease which has not been previously irradiated. In

addition, no intervening treatment may have been administered between the time o f biopsy/surger y 
and rando mization. Pre-treatment tumor tissue biopsy specimens in the form of a paraffin -
embedded block or, optimally , at least 20 unstained slides, will be requested; a minimum of 
10slides is requi red. The pre-treatm ent tumor sample must be a core biopsy, punch biopsy, 
excisio nal biopsy , or surgi cal specimen; fine needle aspi ration samples and cy tology samples are 
not acceptabl e. If sufficient ti ssue is not available from  within 3 months pri or to enrollment, then 
a fresh biopsy will be requi red during the screening period. Samples will be submi tted to the 
analyt ical laboratory  for PD-L1 testing. The analy tical laboratory  must provide IRT with 
confirmat ion of the related results prior to randomization. 
Parti cipants must have a docum ented BRAF status prior to randomizat ion. Those participants 
enrolling in this study without documented results must have test ing performed locally and result s 
(wild type or mutant) be available prior to randomizat ion. Participants with indeterminate or 
unknown BRAF status results will not be permitted to randomize to a treatment arm.
During th e treatm ent phase, adult participant s will receive:
Arm A: BMS -986205 100 mg PO QD and Nivo lumab 480 mg IV Q4W for up to 104 weeks 
(approximately 2 years). Under Revised Protocol  01 invest igators have the option of 
continuing participants on nivo lumab mo notherapy .
Arm B: Nivo lumab 480 mg IV Q4W for up to 104 weeks (approximately 2 years) . Under 
Revised Protocol 01 BMS -986205 Placebo should not be administered.
One cycle of treatment is defined as 4 weeks. 
Dose reductions will be not be allowed for nivolumab; dose reductions will be permitted for 
BMS -986205 if the participant is an adult or an adolescent receiving 100mg tablets. See 
Secti on7.4.2 for more inform ation.
Per Revised Protocol  01 tumor assessments shoul d be conducted per the timing of the local 
standard of care. 
Treatment beyo nd initial investigator -assessed Response Evaluat ion Criteria in Solid Tum ors
(RECIST) v1.1-defined progressi on (see Appendix 12) is permi tted if the participant has 
investigator -assessed clinical benefit, is tolerating study  treatm ent, and has not yet completed

For details on prepared drug storage, preparation, and administration, please refer to the 
BMS -986205 IB and/or pharmacy binder. The selection and timing of dose for each participant is 
provi ded in Table 7.1 -1.
7.1.2 Nivolumab Dosing
Parti cipants 18 years of age and older, or age of majorit y, should receive nivolumab at a dose of 
480 m g as a 30 -minute infusio n on Day 1 of each treatm ent cy cle unt il progression, unacc eptable 
toxicity, withdrawal o f consent/assent, or completion of 104 weeks of treatment, whichever occurs 
first. 
Parti cipants shoul d begin study  treatm ent wi thin 3 calendar day s of rando mizat ion
The dose of BMS -986205 (for participants in Arm A that continue receiving BMS -986205) shoul d 
be given before the dose of nivolumab, but specific timing is not required. Parti cipants shoul d 
begin study  treatm ent wi thin 3 calendar days of rando mizat ion.
There will be no dose escal ations or reductions of nivolumab allowed. For Q4W dosing cycles, 
participants may be dosed within a 3 day window. For this dosing cycle, participants may be 
dosed no less than 2 5 day s and no more than 31 days between doses. In extenuating circumstances 
in which the participant cannot make the dosing schedule within the 3-day window, the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee should be contacted.
Prem edicat ion is not recommended for the first dose of nivo lumab.
Parti cipants should be carefully mo nitored for infusio n reactions during nivo lumab administration. 
After the first nivo lumab infusio n, subjects should be monitored per local/inst itutional guidelines.  
If no such guidelines exist, an observat ion per iod of 2 hours after the end of the nivo lumab infusio n 
is sugg ested.
If an acute infusio n react ion is noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.7.5 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discont inued depending on how well the 
participant tol erates the treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed.
Nivo lumab Inject ion, 100 m g/10 mL (10 m g/mL) is to be administered as an IV infusion through 
a 0.2-micron to 1.2-micron pore size, low-protein binding in-line filter at the protocol -specified 
doses. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus inject ion. When the dose is based on 
participant’s weight (ie, mg/kg), nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or 
diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Inject ion, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to protein 
concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. When the dose is fixed (eg, 480 mg flat dose), nivolumab 
inject ion can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exceed a total infusio n volume of 1 60mL. 
Nivo lumab infusio n must be prompt ly followed by a saline flush to clear the line. Instructions for 
dilution and infusio n of nivolumab inject ion will be provided in the pharmacy binder. Care must 
be taken to assure sterilit y of the prepared solut ion as the product does not contain any 
antimicrobial preservat ive or bacteriostatic agent.

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
As of 19 -Apr-2018, enrollment in the study  has been closed. 
All participants will be centrally randomized using an Interacti ve Response Techno logy (IRT). 
Before the study  is initiated, each user will receive log-in information and direct ions on how to 
access the IRT. After the participant’s initial eligibili ty is established and informed consent has 
been obtained, the participant must be enrolled into the study  by calling an IRT to obtain the 
participant number. Every  participant who signs the informed consent form must be assigned a 
participant number in IRT. The invest igator or designee will register the participant for enrollmen t 
by following the enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following informat ion is 
requi red for enrollment:
Date thatinformed consent was ob tained
Year of birth
Gender at birth
Once enro lled in IRT, enro lled participants who have met all eligibilit y criteria will be ready to be 
rando mized through the IRT. The fo llowing information is required for participant randomizat ion:
Parti cipant number 
Year of birth 
PD-L1 status (PD-L1 posit ive vs PD-L1 negat ive/indeterminate) entered by vendor ; PD-L1 
expressio n will be determined using the Dako PD -L1 IHC 28- 8 pharmDx assay.
BRAF V600 m utational status
M Stage at screening (see Appendix 7)
Parti cipants meeting all eligibilit y criteria will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by PD -L1 
statu s, BRAF status, and AJCC M stage as described below:
PD-L1 status
PD-L1 posit ive (1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of 100evaluable tumor 
cells) vs
PD-L1 negat ive (< 1% t umor cell membrane staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor 
cells)/i ndeterminate (tumor cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining 
or melanin content)

The rando mizat ion procedures will be carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum , defined 
by co mbinat ion of PD -L1 status (positive, 1%, negative/indeterminate), BRAF V600 mutational 
status (BRAF mutation posi tive, BRAF wild type), and M Stage (M0/M1any [0], M1any[1]). The 
exact procedures for using the IRT will be detailed in the IRT manual.
7.3 Blinding
Per Revised Protocol 01, the study will be unblinded (see Section 3.1.1).
7.4 Dosage Modification
7.4.1 Nivolumab Dose Modifications
No dose m odificat ions for nivo lumab are permitted.
7.4.2 BMS -986205 Dose Modifications
A dose reduction of BMS -986205 is defined as a change fro m a 100 mg QD tablet to a 50 mg QD 
tablet. 
Doses of BMS -986205 should be reduced for the following AEs attributable to study  therapy  that 
do not otherwise meet criteria for discontinuation:
Grade 3 fat igue, nausea, vo miting, or anemia related to study treat ment
Methemoglobin 15%
Clinically significant elevat ions in methemoglo bin (generally 10%, with a normal hemoglo bin 
level51)with any associ ated Grade 3 AE (hypoxia, dyspnea ,confusio n, etc.) attributable to 
sustained elevat ions of methemoglo bin and not att ributable to another etio logy
QTcF > 500 msec confirmed by at least 1 repeat ECG and at least 60 msec above baseline (See 
Appendix 9)
Dose m odificat ion and interruption of BMS -986205 m ay occur in the setting of lower grade AEs 
and/or be more conservat ive than indicated above based on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator and in consultation with the BMS Medi cal Moni tor/desi gnee. For an AE requiring 
dose modificat ion, BMS -986205 should be delayed to allow improvement of the AE, even if the 
AE does not o therwise meet criteria for dose delay (Section 7.4.3 ).
Re-escalat ion of BMS-986205 will not be permitted once the dose of BMS-986205 h as been 
reduced for a participant.

7.4.3 Dose Delay (BMS -986205 and Nivolumab)
BMS -986205 and nivo lumab administration should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Grade 2 non -skin, drug -related AE, with the exceptio n of fatigue, nausea, vomit ing and anemia
Grade 2 drug -related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin abnormalit ies
Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE
Grade 3 drug -related fat igue, nausea, vo miting, and anemia
Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalit y, with the following except ions: 
Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomat ic amylase or lipase elevati ons do not require dose 
delay
Grade 3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discont inuat ion (see Section8.1.1 )
Any AE, laboratory  abnorm ality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose o f study  medi cation
In addit ion, only BMS -986205 should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Methemoglobin 15%
Clinically significant elevations in methemoglo bin (generally 10% with a normal hemoglo bin 
level51) with any associ ated Grade 3 AE (hypoxia, dyspnea, confusi on, etc.) attributable to 
sustained elevat ions of methemoglo bin and not attributable to another etio logy
QTcF > 500msec confirmed by at least 1 repeat ECG and at least 60 msec above baseline (See 
Appendix 9)
Appendix 14 presents the above criteria in tabular format. 
If nivo lumab dosing is delayed for reasons other than study drug toxicity (eg, administrative issues, 
holidays, etc), BMS -986205 dosing shoul d cont inue uninterrupted.
Parti cipants m ay continue to receive nivo lumab during dose delays of BMS -986205for elevat ions 
of methem oglobin and associ ated events, as well as QTcF prolongat ions.
For participants with methem oglobin elevat ions with associated Grade 3 AEs, if contributi on of 
nivolumab to the associ ated AE cannot be ruled out (eg, a participant with dyspnea in whom 
pneumo nitis has not yet been ruled out), nivolumab dosing shoul d be delayed as well. See 
Secti on7.7.4 for management of m ethem oglobinemia.
If BMS -986205 dosing is delayed, dose reduction may be necessary . See Secti on7.4.2 .
If dosing is resumed after a delay, BMS -986205 may  be resum ed as soon as the criteria to resume 
treatm ent are met (see Secti on7.4.4).Nivo lumab shoul d be resumed as soon as possible after 
criteria to resum e treatm ent are met, but may be resum ed later than BMS -986205 given the 
differences in each drug’s administration.

7.4.4 Criteria to Resume Treatment (BMS -986205 and Nivolumab)
Parti cipants may resum e treatment with study  treatm ents when the drug-related AE(s) resol ve to 
Grade1 or baseline value, with the fo llowing excepti ons:
Parti cipants may  resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fat igue.
Parti cipants who have not experi enced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may  resume treatm ent 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicit y.
For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT and/or Total  Bilirubin abnormalit ies, dosing may 
resum e when laboratory  values return to baseline and management with corticosteroi ds, if 
needed, is complete.
Parti cipants with combined AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meet ing discontinuatio n 
param eters (Secti on8.1.1 ) should have treatment permanent ly discont inued. 
Drug -related pulmo nary toxicity, diarrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatm ent is resumed. Parti cipants with persistent Grade 1 pneumo nitis after completion of a 
steroi d taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and 
approved by  BMS Medical  Moni tor/desi gnee.
Parti cipants with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately  controlled with only physi ologic 
horm one replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee. Adrenal insufficiency requi res discont inuat ion regardl ess of control  with 
horm one repl acement.
For participants who have BMS -986205 held for elevat ions of methemoglobin, dosing may resume 
when the methemo globin levels have decreased to below the inst itutional ULN and any associated 
AEs have resolved to Grade1 or baseline value. Dose modification of BMS-986205 shoul d be

7.4.6 Detection of Methemoglobinemia
BMS -986205 may produce a p -chloroaniline metabo lite. P-chloroaniline has been associated with 
the producti on of methem oglobin. Symptom s of methem oglobinemia are related to the lack of 
oxygen delivery  to tissues and are proporti onal to the fraction of methem oglobin, as described 
below for participants with normal hemoglo bin levels. 
Symptom s associ ated wi th elevat ions of methemo globin are as fo llows:
0% to 10% -Usually asymptomat ic
10% to 20% -Cyanosis without other sym ptoms
20% to 50% -Headache, dyspnea, lightheadedness (possibly syncope), weakness, confusio n, 
palpitations, chest pain
50% to 70% -Coma, seizure s, arrhy thmias ; acidosis
> 70% -Usually death
Note that participants with anemia may experience symptoms at lower methemoglo bin percentages 
than listed above, depending on the degree of anemia. 
Increasing levels of methem oglobin may confound the resul tsof standard pulse oximeters, with 
values of around 85% reported consistent ly as methem oglobin levels increase, regardl ess of the 
true oxy gen saturati on.
When methemoglo binemia is suspected, part of the diagnosti c work -up includes evaluat ion for 
other disorders that can present with a similar clinical picture, including cardiac and pulmo nary 
disease. A fresh peripheral  blood sam ple (either venous or arterial) shoul d be sent for evaluat ion 
of methem oglobin levels; methem oglobin levels may  vary with storage o f blood.  
In this study  methem oglobin testing will be perform ed at screening, at each cycle (for BMS -
986205 treated participants only), and as clinically indicated. For management of 
methemoglo binemia, see Section 7.7.4 .

7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the concl usion of the study , participants who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS -supplied study  treatment for the maximum treatm ent duration specified 
in Section7.1. Study  treatment will be provi ded via an extensi on of the study , a rollover study 
requi ring approval by responsible health authority  and ethics committee, or through another 
mechanism at the discretion o f BMS. See Section 5.4.2 for more informat ion.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied study treatm ent if any of the fo llowing 
occur: a) the study  is terminated due to safet y concerns; b) the devel opment of BMS-986205 is 
terminated for other reasons, including but not limited to lack of efficacy and/or not meet ing the 
study  object ives; c) the participant can obtain medication fro m a government -sponsored or private 
healt h program . In all cases BMS will fo llow local regul ations.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Disc ontinuation from Study Treatment
Parti cipants MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Parti cipant’s request to stop study  treatm ent. Withdrawal  of consent /assent may be requested 
by participants, parents, guardians, or legally acceptabl e representati ves, in accordance with

local regulat ions. The wishes of minor participants to withdraw their assent shoul d also be 
respected. Participants who request to discont inue study treatment will remain in the study and 
must con tinue to be fo llowed for protocol specified fo llow-up procedures. The only except ion 
to thi s is w hen a partici pant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her 
or perso ns previously authorized by the participant to provide this informat ion.
Any clinical AE, laboratory  abnorm ality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinio n of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in the best inter est of the 
participant
Terminat ion of the study  by BMS
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of ei ther a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious di sease) illness
Addit ional protocol -specified reasons for discont inuation (Section 8.1.1 )
Docum ented invest igator -assessed progressi on as defined by RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 12) 
unless participant meets criteria for treatment bey ond progressi on
In the case of pregnancy, the inve stigator m ust immediately notify  the Sponsor or designee o f this 
event. In most cases, the study  treatment will be perm anent ly discont inued in an appropri ate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safet y). Please contact the Sponsor or 
designee wi thin 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. If the invest igator determines a possible 
favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussio n between the 
investigator and the Sponsor or designee must occur.
Refer to the Schedule o f Activit ies for data to be collected at the time o f treatment discont inuat ion 
and fo llow-up and for any  further evaluat ions that can be co mpleted.
All part icipants who discont inue study treatment should comply wit h protocol specified fo llow-up 
procedures as outlined in Secti on2. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a parti cipant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab shoul d be made separately  from the assessment  
made for discont inuat ion of BMS-986205. Although there is overlap among the discont inuat ion 
criteria, if discontinuat ion criteria are met for BMS -986205 but not for nivo lumab, treatment with 
nivolumab may cont inue if BMS -986205 is discontinued. If a participant discont inues nivo lumab, 
they must also discont inue BMS -986205.
If a parti cipant receiving nivolumab/BMS -986205 combinat ion meets cri teria for discont inuat ion 
and invest igator is unable to determine whethe r the event is rel ated to both or one study drug, the 
participant shoul d discont inue both nivolumab and BMS -986205 and be taken off the treatm ent 
phase of the study .
If study  treatm ent is di scontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.

8.1.3 Treatment Beyond Progression 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1.3.2 Criteria Required for Treatment Beyond Progression
Parti cipants will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond init ial RECIST v1.1 -defined PD 
(see Appendix 12), a ssessed by the invest igator, as long as they meet the fo llowing cri teria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance of study  treatm ent
Stabl e performance status
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases) .
Parti cipant provides written informed consent prior to receiving addit ional study treatm ent. All 
other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternat ive treatment options will st ill apply.
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be perform ed within 8 weeks of initialinvestigator -
assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued 
PD. The assessment of clinical benefit shoul d be balanced by  clinical judgment as to whether the 
participant is clinically deteri orating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued study 
treatm ent.
If the invest igator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatm ent, the parti cipant shoul d remain on the tri al and continue to receive monitoring accord ing 
to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2).
For the participants who continue study therapy beyo nd progression, further progression is defined 
as an addit ional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm abso lute increase from t ime 
of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the

diameters of new measurable lesio ns compared to thetime o f initial PD. All study treatm ent shoul d 
be discont inued permanent ly upon documentation of further progression.
New l esions are considered m easurable at the time of init ial progression if the lo ngest di ameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathologic al lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesio n considered non -measurable at the time of init ial progressio n may beco me 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axi s of at least 15 mm). In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusio n of 
new lesions which beco me measurable, these new lesions must dem onstr ate an absol ute increase 
of at least 5 mm.
8.1.4 Post -Study Treatment Study Follow -up
Per Revised Protocol 01, overall survival follow up is not required. 
In this study , overall survival is a key endpo int of the study . Post-study  follow-up is of critical 
import ance and is essential to preserving participant safet y and the integrity of the study . 
Parti cipants who discontinue study  treatm ent must continue to be followed for collect ion of 
outcom e and/or survival follow-up data as requi red and in line with Section2until death or th e 
concl usion of the study .
BMS m ay request that survival data be co llected on all treated/randomized participants outsi de of 
the protocol -defined window (Table 2-3). At the time of this request, each participant will be 
contacted to determine their survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all 
contacts or is lost to fo llow-up.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Parti cipants who request to discont inue study treatment will remain in the study and mu st continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to thi s is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this inf ormation. 
Parti cipants shoul d notify  the investigator of the decisio n to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
The withdrawal  of consent /assent shoul d be explained in detail  in the medical records by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is fro m further treatm ent wi th study  treatm ent only 
or also from study  procedu res and/or post treatment study  follow-up, and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly  available informat ion shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately 
directed in accordance with local law.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may 
retain an d cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent /assent .

8.3 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes fo llow-up wi th persons authorized by  the participant.
Lost to follow -up is defined by  the inabili ty to reach the parti cipant after a minimum of three
docum ented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered m ail letter. All attempts should be docum ented in the participant’s medical records.
If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
If invest igator’s use o f third-party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up por tion of the study 
has been included in the partici pant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary  to complete the follow-up 
porti on of  the study . 
The si te staff  and representative will consul t publicly available sources, such as public healt h 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information.
If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to fo llow-up, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the invest igator should be reported and documented in the part icipant’s medical 
records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on2). 
Protocol  waivers or exempt ions are not allowed.
All immediate safet y concerns must be discusse d with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and requ ired for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria before randomizat ion. The invest igator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confi rm eligibili ty or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized forscreening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the t imeframe defined in the Schedule of Activit ies.
Addit ional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, shoul d be performed as 
clinically indicated or to com ply with local regulati ons. Laboratory  toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluat ions) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all study treatment -related toxicit iesresolve, return to baseline, or are deem ed 
irreversible.

If a participant shows pulmonary -related si gns (hypoxi a, fever) or symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, 
and fever) consistent with possible pulm onary AEs, the participant shoul d be immediately 
evaluated torule out pulmo nary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary  toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS -936558 (Nivolumab) IB. In addit ion, blood methemoglo bin 
levels should be evaluated to rule out methemoglobinemia (see Section 7.4.6 ) and CBC measured 
to rul e out anemia in part icipants wi th dyspnea .
Some of the assessments referred to in this sect ion may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by the treati ng physician. Addit ional testing or 
assessments may be perform ed as clinically  necessary  or wh ere required by institutional or local 
regul ations.
This study  will consist of three phas es: screening, treatment, and fo llow-up.
Screening Phase:
Begins by establishing the parti cipant’s initial eligibili ty and signing of the inform ed consent 
form (ICF).
Treatment Phase:
Begins with the rando mizat ion request to the IRT. The participant is randomly assigned to 
either the BMS -986205 + nivolumab arm or the BMS -986205 Plac ebo + nivolumab arm. (Per 
Revised Protocol 01, BMS -986205 Placebo will not be administered in this study. Participants 
in Arm B, may discont inue BMS -986205 and continue treatm ent with nivolumab 
monotherapy ). 
Ends when the part icipant is discontinued fro m study therapy or completes 104 weeks of study 
therapy . For a com plete list of reasons for treatment discont inuat ion, see Section 8.1.
Follow -Up Phase
Begins when the decisi on to discontinue a participant from study  therapy is made (no further 
treatm ent with study  therapy) or when 104 weeks of study therapy has been completed, and 
ends when follow-up data have been collected for all participant s (Secti on8.1.4 ).

9.2 Adverse Events
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally  authori zed representative). 
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that mee t the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before complet ing the study. 
Immune-mediated adverse event s (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
which were exacerb ated by  the induct ion of autoimmunit y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
Contacts for SAE are reporting specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collect ion of non-serious AE informat ion shoul d begin at initiation of study treatment at the 
time points specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Non -serious AE informat ion should 
also be collected from  the start of a pl acebo lead -in period or other observat ional period intended 
to establish a baseline status for the participants.
Secti on 5.6 in the IBs for BMS -986205 and nivolumab represents the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the 
participant’s written consent/assent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study treatm ent, must be collected, including those though t to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of the last 
dose of study treatment, except in cases where a study participant has sta rted a new anti -neoplastic 
therapy . However, any SAE occurring after the start of a new treatm ent that is suspected to be 
related to study  treatm ent by  the investigator will be reported.

BMS -986205 IDO1 inhibitor
For participants assigned to treatm ent and never treated with study  treatment, SAEs should be 
collected for 30 days fro m the date of rando mizat ion. 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  treatm ent or protocol -specified procedure.
Medical occurre nces that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF sect ion.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendi x 3. 
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study  participants. 
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) sho uld be co llected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of 100 days fo llowing discont inuat ion 
of study  treatm ent. 
Every  adverse event must be assessed by the investigator with regard to whether it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events which are potenti ally immune -mediated, additional informat ion will 
be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, examinat ion, or 
evaluat ion of a  p articipant. (In order to prevent reporting bias, participants shoul d not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs).
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Non-serious AEs should be fo llowed to resolut ion or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interrupti on or discont inuat ion of 
study  treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
 All identified non -serious AEs must be recorded and describe d on the non -serious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the inves tigator i s requi red to proactively fo llow each parti cipant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of special interest (as defined in

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by the invest igator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essent ial sothat legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
An invest igator who receives an invest igator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safet y information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Invest igator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate according to local 
requi rements.
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory  authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR) Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse React ion) is a su bset of SAEs and will b e reported to the appropriate regul atory  authori ties 
and invest igators following local and glo bal guidelines and requirements.
9.2.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AEOSI) have been defined for this protocol  which requi re 
expedited reporting by  the invest igator of these adverse events to BMS. These are:
Hem ophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis (HLH; also known as hist iocytosis haematophagi c)
Drug reaction wit h eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome
These AEOSI, whethe r related or not rel ated to study  drug, m ust be reported to BMS or desi gnee 
within 24 hours of  awareness of the event. These AEOSI are medically important events and are 
therefore considered SAEs. The reporting system for SAEs should be used (see Sect ion 9.2.4 and 
Appendix 3 ).  
As both HLH and DRESS syndrom e may both pose di agnost ic challenges due to varying clinical 
manifestations and signs and symptom s that may overlap with other clinical events.  To assist 
investigators in ident ifying constellat ions of clinical symptoms that may be consistent with one o f 
these diagnoses, standardized scoring criteria are provided in Appendix 15. Formal evaluat ion and 
docum entati onof diagnostic scores based on these system s is not requi red; investigators shoul d 
use their best clinical judgement as informed by these provi ded criteria to de termine if a subject 
has experienced one of these AEOSI.
9.2.6 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  treatm ent, it is subsequent ly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5half-lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS

Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 3.
In most cases, the study  treatment will be perm anent ly discont inued in an appropri ate manner 
(eg,dose tapering if necessary  for participant safet y). Please call the BMS Medi cal 
Moni tor/desi gnee wi thin 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy .
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
inform ation from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this informat ion. Inform ation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
9.2.7 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The fo llowing l aboratory  test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the non -serious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic, as appropri ate. Paper f orms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the el ectronic system is not functioning.
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to have study  treatm ent 
discontinued or delayed/ interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
9.2.8 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All o ccurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Secti on 9.2and Appendix 3 for reporting 
details).
Potent ial drug induced liver injury  is defined as:
1)ALT or AST elevat ion > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2)Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, wit hout init ial findings o f cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),

hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepat itis, preexist ing chroni c or acute 
liver di sease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.9 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, ECG, x-ray 
filming, any  other potenti al safety  assessment required or not requi red by  protocol  shoul d also be 
recorded as a non -serious or seri ous AE, as appropri ate, and r eported ac cordingly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdose s meet ing the regulatory definit ion 
of SAE must be reported as an SAE (se e Section 9.2.4 for reporting details).
In the event of an overdose the invest igator/treating physician should:
1) Contact the Medical Monitor/designee immediately
2)Closely  monitor the participan tfor AEs/SAEs and laboratory  abnorm alities
3)Docum ent the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF.
Decisio ns regarding dose interruptions or modificat ions will be made by the invest igator in 
consultation wit h the Medical Monitor/designee based on the clinical evaluation o f the participant .
9.4 Safety
Planned time points for all safet y assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities. Safety 
assessments include AEs, physical examinat ions, vital signs, performance status, oxygen 
saturation, ECGs, assessment of signs and symptom s, laboratory  tests, and pregnancy tests as 
outlined in the Schedule o f Activities.
9.4.1 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Laboratory  assessments are listed in Table 9.4.1 -1.
Invest igators must document their review of each laborat ory safety  report.
All clinical safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed locally per the Schedule of

10.1 Sample S ize Determination 
Per Revised Protocol 01 this section is not applicable. 
The sample size is calculated in order to compare PFS between participants randomized to receive 
BMS -986205 with nivolumab vs nivolumab monotherapy . The number of events requi red is 
simulated based on resul ts from Study  CA209067; this simulat ion resul ted in a median PFS of 
6.9months for nivolumab monotherapy  and 11.8 months for BMS -986205 with nivolumab 
therapy , incorporating 35% of participants with durable response in the combin ed groups, and a 
non-proporti onal hazard resul ting in an effect ive hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.73.
Based on these assum ptions, the study  requires at least 365 PFS events to ensure approximately 
85% power to detect an HR of 0.73 with an overall typ e I error of 0.05 (two-sided). Approximately 
700 participants will be randomized to the 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. While fo llow-up for the 
primary  PFS endpoint is planned to occur when 365 participants have had a PFS event, the follow-
up for the primary PFS endpo int can also be terminated 9 months after the rando mizat ion of the 
last participant if the 365th event has not occurred (e.g. slow arrival o f events close to but less than 
365 that suggest a higher than expected long-term response rate). Predi ctions for enrollment and 
follow-up are based on an estimat ion of approximately 12 months for enrollment and 7 months of 
follow-up after the end of enro llment. Various patterns of enro llment were assessed fro m unifor m 
enrollment to enrollment of 25% of participants in the first half of enrollment and 75% in the 
second half of enrollment.
Follow-up for the overall  survival  (OS) endpoint is planned to occur when 330participants have 
had an OS event. If the 330th event has not occurred at 24 m onths after rand omizat ion of the last 
participant, then the follow-up time can be terminated 24 months after the rando mizat ion of the 
last participant. A total of 330 OS events woul d provi de approximately  90% power to detect an 
overall HR of approximate 0.70 with a ty pe Ierror of 0.05 (two- sided).
10.2 Populations for Analyses
Per Revised Protocol 01, efficacy analysis will not be conducted (see Section 3.1.1 and the updated 
Schedule of Act ivities in Sect ion 2).

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS : 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, con sidered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study interven tion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervention 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the invest igator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospital).

DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event w hich hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studie s: 
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospi tal departm ent < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol fo r a pl anned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissi on for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgi cal interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)

Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon approp riate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).
Any co mponent of a study endpo int that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study interve ntion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opinio n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm entor if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately wit hin 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs m ust be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
The requi red m ethod for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
The paper SAE Report Form  is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic

METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the fo llowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence o f other bio logical or physio logical causes. In addit ion, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDAN CE FOR FEMALE PARTIC IPANTS OF CHILD BEAR ING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effect ive methods of contraception listed below is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 monthsafter the end of study

Intrauterine device (IUD)
Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to b e evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstine nce must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception m ay be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method.  Due to the potential interaction with study drug(s), these are only considered highly 
effective methods for female partners of male subjects p articipating in this study . Hormonal contraception should 
not be used by female participants of child -bearing potential.
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception *
Male or female condom  with or without spermicide.  Male and female condo ms cannot be 
used simultaneously
Diaphragm  with spermicide
Cervical cap wit h spermicide
Vaginal Sponge with spermicide

APPENDIX 12 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH BMS MODIFICATIONS
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evaluated using Response Evaluat ion Criteria In Solid Tumors versio n 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1)guideline with BMS m odificati ons.1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimensi on (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), or 2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologi cally enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT /MRI scan (scan slice thickness reco mmended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of 
15mm by CT /MRI scan. Only  the short axi s of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter norm ally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by  solid tum or. Nodal  size is norm ally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisit ion may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axi s. For 
example, an abdo minal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis o f 20mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, m easurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
shoul d be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-patho logical and should not be recorded or fo llowed.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including small lesio ns (longest diameter 
<10mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdo mina l 
masses/abdo minal organomegaly  identified by physical exam  that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns. 
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesions, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by  cross secti onal imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesio ns if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of measurabilit y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non -Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum  of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respect ively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum o f two l esions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum o f 
two lung lesio ns can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesio n fro m each). A maximum o f 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target l esionsshoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in additi on shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated m easurem ents. It m ay be the case that, on occasi on, the largest lesio n does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urthe r characteri ze any objective tum or regressi on in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measure ments are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to foll ow). In addi tion, it is possible to record m ultiple non-target l esions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘m ultiple liver m etastases’).

2. RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance o f all target lesio ns. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether targ et or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target l esions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an abso lute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missing or poor quali ty images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficient ly to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes ident ified as target lesions shoul d always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examinati on), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm o n study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if compl ete response criteriaare met, since a norm al 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case report forms or other data collectio n 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesio ns recorded in a separate sectio n 
where, in order to qualify  for CR, ea ch node m ust achieve a short axis < 10 mm . For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesio ns.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study , all lesions (nodal  and non-nodal )recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (eg,2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
beco me so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion o f the radio logist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm . If the lesi on is believed to 
be present and is faint ly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the ref erence diameter. (Note: It is less likely tha t this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually  have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to m easure, a def ault value of  5 mm shoul d be assigned in this circumstance as well). This

defaul t value is derived fro m the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potenti ally non-reproducible, therefore 
provi ding this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To rei terate, however, if the radi ologist i s able to provi de an actual  measure, that shoul d be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance shoul d be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coal esced lesio n’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
This section provides the defini tions of the criteria used to de termine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesio ns. While some non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they nee d 
not be measured and instead shoul d be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target l esions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non- PD: Persistence of one or more non -target l esion(s)
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of exist ing non -target l esions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level o f substant ial worsening in non -target di sease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal  progressi on status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial 
effusio ns and ascites will not be fo llowed as target or non -target l esions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designati on of overall progressi on solely on the basis of change in 
non-target di sease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non -measurable disease
This circumstance arises in so me trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretati on of an increase in non -measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease canno t be easily quant ified (by definit ion:

Clinical Protocol CA017055
BMS -986205 IDO1 inhibitor
if all lesio ns are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall  disease burden based on the change 
in non-measur able disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden represent ing an addit ional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to requi re a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal  progressi on’ is seen, the 
patient shoul d be considered to have had ove rall PD at that point. While it woul d be i deal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substant ial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malign ant lesions denotes di sease progressi on; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identificat ion of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesio ns may be simply 
healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesio ns). This is parti cularl y important when the pat ient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesio n may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesio n, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collect ions (pleural  effusio ns, pericardia l effusi ons, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesio ns and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collect ion is seen on a post -baseline imaging exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collect ion alone shoul d not resul t in an assessment of Progressive Di sease (PD). A 
lesion ident ified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion ident ified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesio n and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of it s small size, continued fo llow-up evaluat ion 
will clarify  if itrepresents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely  a  new 
lesion, then progressi on shoul d be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG -PET 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorpo rate the use of 
FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (parti cularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be ident ified according 
to the following algorithm:
1.Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesio n.
2.No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confi rmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive

FDG -PET at f ollow-up is not confi rmed as a new site of disease on CT, addi tional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that si te (if so, the 
date of  PD will be the date of  the initial abnorm al FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT that i s not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from  the start of the study  treatm ent until 
disease progressi on or the last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmat ionand censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy . The patient’s best overall response
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may  also requi re confi rmatory measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol  specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2 -1provides a 
summar y of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2 -2is to be used.

aNon-CR/no n-PD is preferred over SD for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assig n this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised .
2.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determination of complete or partial response requi res confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
4 weeks (28 days) later. In thi s circumstance, the best ov erall response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3 -1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol  specified 
minimum t ime from the date of first treatment or rando mizat ion date.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol , a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on -study  for a minimum  of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study  of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study).  If the subject is not on -study 
for at least this amount of time, any tumorassessment indicat ing stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is ident ified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum o f target lesio ns 
and the nodes decrease to ‘norm al’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression shoul d it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means tha t pati ents wi th CR m ay not have a total  sum  of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, and 
NE=inevaluable
aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting P R 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest s mall lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR .
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assi gned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor m easurements 
must be confi rmed by consecut ive or subsequent repeat assessments that should be performed no 
less than 28 days after the cri teria for response are first met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may pro vide confirmation o f apreviously ident ified CR even wit h an intervening NE or PR (e.g., 
CR NE CRor CR PR CR). Subsequent documentati on of a PR may provi de confirmati on of a
previously ident ified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (e.g., PRNE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR /CRs for confirmat ion.
Verification of Progression :Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, t hen progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

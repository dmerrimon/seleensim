Research Purpose
You are invited to participate in a research study which is designed to determine whether or not spinal 
anesthesia with the local anesthetic drug, chloroprocaine,  wears of f f
aster than the local anesthetic 
drug, bupivacaine, and results in faster discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit after surgery.
Background:
You are scheduled to undergo cervical cerclage with spinal anesthesia. Over 90% of these procedures 
at CUMC are performed with spinal anesthesia because this allows the w
oman to be awake, to 
breathe on her own, and limits the amount of medication that crosses to the fetus. Because the 
procedure usually lasts approximately 30 minutes, an anesthetic technique with a relatively short 
duration of action and recovery is indicated. Bupivacaine is now the most common local anesthetic 
used for this procedure. Bupivacaine is safe and has been preferred over other medications such as 
lidocaine, because it is associated with a low incidence of a complication from spinal anesthesia 
known as “transient neurologic symptoms” – a condition where pain and cramping in the b uttocks 
and lower extremities can be experienced for several days. Bupivacaine is a long-acting local 
anesthetic agent and therefore has the disadvantage of a prolonged anesthetic recovery that may last a 
few hours. 
Chloroprocaine is a local anesthetic with a fast onset and short duration that may be used for spinal 
anesthesia for ambulatory procedures. Chloroprocaine is currently used at CUMC for spinal 
anesthesia for amb
ulatory surgical patients, especially for lower extremity orthopedic procedures such 
as knee arthroscopy. It is also used at CUMC for pregnant patients like yourself.

In our study, patients undergoing cervical cerclage under spinal anesthesia will be randomized, by a 
process similar to ﬂipping a coin, to receiv
e either chloroprocaine or bupivacaine for their spinal 
anesthesia. We will observe and compare how fast the anesthesia sets in, how comfortable you are 
during your surgery, how long it takes to wear off and how long it takes to be discharged from the 
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit. We will call you the next day to check if you are having any complaints or 
concerns related to the spinal anesthesia you received.
Information on Research
We are doing this research study to compare the onset, action and duration of the local anesthetic 
medications chlorprocaine and b upi
vacaine for spinal anesthesia. You are being asked to take part in 
this study because you are undergoing cervical cerclage with spinal anesthesia. About 50 people are 
expected to be enrolled in this study at CUMC. Off label use of an approved drug chloroprocaine is 
being used in an investigational manner (not for the purpose that it is approved for) in this research 
study. This means that chloroprocaine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for use in nerve blocks, but it has not been approved for epidural or spinal anesthesia. You 
should understand that although chlororprocaine is not approved by the FDA for use in this manner, at 
CUMC and many hospitals around the US, we have a lot of experience using chloroprocaine quite 
safely for both epidural and spinal anesthesia. In fact the use of chloroprocaine at CUMC between 
2010 and 2013 was studied by members of our Department and it was reported that out of 358 cases 
in which chloroprocaine was used for spinal anesthesia, there were no complications noted. Because 
of the safety, low toxicity and fast onset of chloroprocaine, it is also the drug we use most commonly 
for epidural anesthesia for emergency surgeries in pregnant women at CUMC.
Risks
Spinal anesthesia with either relatively low dose bupivacaine or choroprocaine is considered to be 
safe and does not present signiﬁcant additional risk to recei ving routine spinal anesthesia care at 
CUMC.  Both medications are currently used at CUMC for anesthesia for cerclage. T
o the best of our 
knowledge, taking part in this study will not hurt you.
Beneﬁts
You may or may not receive personal (direct) beneﬁt from taking part in this study. The possible 
beneﬁts of taking part in this study is that patients in the chloroprocaine group may ha v
e earlier 
resolution of the anesthesia block and have earlier discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit.
Alternative Procedures
You may choose not to take part in this research study.
Conﬁdentiality
Any information collected during this study that can identify you by name will be kept conﬁdential. 
We will do e
verything we can to keep your data secure, however, complete conﬁdentiality cannot be 
promised. Despite all of our efforts, unanticipated problems, such as a stolen computer may occur,

Research Related Injuries
Taking part in this research study may result in injury or harm to you. In the event of an injury 
resulting from your participation in this study , you should seek appropriate medical care and inform 
the study doctor
. In the event of an emergency you should go to an emergency room. If you are

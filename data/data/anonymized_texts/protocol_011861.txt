CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   4 of 70  Target subject population 
The target population will be outpatient subject s 12 to 70 years of age with asthma and EIB .  
Two subgroups of equal size will be included in the study, 1 subgroup of subjects  currently 
treated with short/rapid- acting β2-adrenoreceptor agonist ( SABA ) prn  alone, and a second  
subgroup on low- to-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy 
(according to Global Initiative for Asthma [ GINA ] guideli nes) and SABA prn .  
Duration of treatment  
The r andomiz ed treatment phase will start after a 1 to 2- week screening period  (Visits 1 and 
2). The double-blind treatment will occur with single dosing of investigational product (IP) at 
Visits 3 and 4, which wil l be approximately 1 week apart. The overall study duration will take 
approximately 3 to 4 weeks. 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
Investigational Product will be BDA MDI  and a matching placebo  MDI , which will be used as 
the compa rator.  The IP will be administered as a single dose as follows: 
• BDA MDI 160/180 μg (given as 2 inhalations of BDA MDI 80/90 μg per puff)  
• Placebo MDI (given as 2 inhalations) 
At Visit 3 /Period 1 and Visit 4 /Period 2, IP will be administered 30 (±5) minutes prior to the 
exercise challenge. During the study, subjects will not be allowed to use any asthma 
medication other than the SABA  prn or ICS  plus SABA  prn that they were using before study 
entry . Subjects will be restricted from SABA within 6 hours before a ny lung function testing 
and/or exercise testing.  Non- asthma medications which are necessary for the subject ’s safety 
and wellbeing , and which do not affect the participation in or results of the study, are allowed  
at the discretion of the investigator . 
 
Statistical methods  
Sample Size  
Prior studies of a similar design have randomized subject s who experience exercise-induced 
symptoms without other generaliz ed asthma symptoms. Other studies have permitted 
enrollment of those subject s experiencing exercise sy mptoms who may or may not be subjects 
with asthma  (Bonini et al 2013). This study will only randomize subject s with asthma who are 
receiving background therapy for asthma (SABA prn alone; low- to-medium dose ICS plus 
SABA  prn). Sub-analyses will be conducted on the primary endpoint for each of these 
subgroups of equal size.

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, 25 Oct 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   5 of 70  Power calculations are based on the properties of the primary endpoint, the maximum 
percentage fall from post -dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV 1 observed up to 60 minutes post-
exercise challenge. A sample size of 30 subjects in each subgroup will provide a 92% 
probability to detect a difference of -9% between BDA MDI versu s placebo MDI, within each 
of the 2 subgroups of interest (SABA prn  alone; low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn), 
assuming 2 -sided, 5% level tests and a within -subject standard deviation of 10%. 
Randomization of 60 subjects in total will provide >99% overall probability to detect a difference of - 9% between BDA MDI v ersus placebo MDI assuming a 2- sided, 5% level test 
and an estimated within -subject standard deviation of 10%. Since all subjects randomized in 
the study will be receiving background therapy for asthma, a more conservative estimate of 
variability and treatment effect has been assumed compared to studies of simi lar design 
(Ostrom et al 2015). 
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV
1 observed up to 
60 minutes post- exercise challenge will be analy zed with a mixed effect  model including 
categorical fixed effect s for treatment , treatment period , treatment  sequence, period- specific 
pre-dose baseline FEV 1 and average pre- dose baseline FEV 1, and a random subject  within 
treatment sequence effect . Post-dose, pre -exercise baseline FEV 1 will be defined as the 30 
minutes post-dose value, ie, 5 minutes before exercise challenge, at each visit for the 
respective treatment . The period- specific pre -dose baseline FEV 1 will be calculated separately 
at Visit 3 and Visit 4 as the pre -dose result, approximately 5 minutes prior to dosing. The 
average pre- dose baseline FEV 1 will be calculated as the mean  of the period -specific pre -dose 
FEV 1 baselines. Estimated treatment differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
provided. 
The primary analysis will be repeated on the s ubgroups on clinical interest (SABA prn alone; 
low-to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn). To control the overall type- I error, a hierarchical 
testing strategy will be adopted. The treatment comparisons of BDA MDI 160/180 versus 
placebo MDI  will be conducted on the subject  populations in the sequence given below: 
1. Overall population (SABA prn only OR low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn 
background therapy) 
2. Subjects  taking SABA prn only for background therapy 
3. Subjects  taking low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn for background therapy 
If a comparison is significant (alpha=0.05, 2- sided), testing will proceed to the next 
comparison. Comparisons will stop if a non- statistically significant result occurs. All 
comparisons are of superiority.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   6 of 70  Secondary/ Other Efficacy An alyses  
The percentage of subjects with a maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise challenge 
of <10% will be tabulated by treatment.  
The odds of having a maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise challenge of < 10% will 
be analy zed using a generali zed linear mixed model with logit link function  to compare the 
treatments . The model will be adjusted for treatment, treatment period , treatment sequence, 
and a random subject within treatment sequence effect . The odds ratio and 95% CI will be 
reported for pairwise treatment comparisons. The odds of having a maximum percentage fall 
in FEV 1 post- exercise challenge of <20% will be separately analyzed in a similar manner.  
Time to recovery at each of Visits 3 and 4 will be derived as the time (minutes) post- exercise 
challenge in which the FEV 1 result returns to  within  10% of the value recorded at the post-
dose, pre -exercise baseline. Only subjects who achieve a percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise 
challenge of >10% will have an event time derived; otherwise their value will be left censored. Subjects who have any rescue medication administered during the post-dose assessments will be censored at the time of receiving rescue medication. Subjects who do not 
recover to within 10% of the post-dose, pre -exercise baseline will be censored at 60 minutes . 
P-values will be calculated using a period -adjusted sign test, based on categorizing subject s 
into period preferences (Senn 1993).  
The percentage fall in FEV
1 post- exercise challenge will be summari zed descriptively by  
treatment group and planned time point within 60 minutes of the serial spirometry assessments 
conducted post- exercise challenge. An analysis of percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise 
challenge will be conducted using methods as per the primary analysis, with an additional adjustment for planned time point in the repeated measures model. The covariance within subject -periods will be unstructured over the time points. 
The post- exercise FEV
1 AUC 0-30 min will be analy zed with a similar mixed effects model as 
described above using methods as per the primary analysis .  
Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined in this study: 
The full analysis set is defined as all subjects who are randomiz ed to treatment  and have at 
least 1 post-dose, pre- exercise baseline and corresponding post- dose FEV 1 measure at Visits 3 
and/or 4. Subjects will be analy zed according to the treatment they were assigned to as per the 
randomiz ation scheme.  
The safety analysis set is defined as all subjects receiving any amount of the I P. Subjects will 
be classified on the basis of treatment they actually received. Occurrences of safety events (ie,

corresponding to the treatment period of which the event occurred. All safety summaries will 
be based on the safety analysis set.  
The all subjects enrolled population will be defined as all subject s who provide informed 
consent. This subject population will be used for descriptive summaries of disposition. 
Ther e are no interim analyses planned for this study. 
Estimands 
The estimand of interest is the Efficacy Estimand, defined as the effect of the randomized 
treatments in all subjects in the absence of intercurrent events which may impact the interpretation of t he treatment effect, such as use of rescue medication following the exercise 
challenge test. This estimand could be considered a while-on- treatment strategy or a 
hypothetical strategy as defined in the draft International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
E9 Addendum.

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, 25 Oct 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   14 of 70  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Backgrou nd  
Bond Avillion 2 Development LP (Sponsor) is developing budesonide/albuterol sulfate 
(PT027, a fixed -dose combination product; hereafter referred to as budesonide and albuterol 
metered -dose inhaler [BDA MDI]) pressurized inhalation suspension product in  adults and 
children ( ≥4 years of age ) with asthma. Please refer to the current  Investigator Brochure  for 
additional information. 
Albuterol is a short/rapid -acting β2 -adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA), inducing airway smooth 
muscle relaxation and reducing or preventing bronchoconstriction. Albuterol is approved in 
many countries in multiple formulations for treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction, and is also known under the generic name of salbutamol. In clinical practice, albuterol is used as reli ever therapy on an as -needed (prn) basis ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA]  
guidelines ).  
Budesonide is a well-established anti- inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent 
glucocorticoid and weak mineralocorticoid activity and is approved worldwide in inhaled formulations for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease both as a 
mono-product and in combination with a long- acting β2-agonist ( LABA ), (ie , formoterol).  
In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents potentiate the 
effects of SABAs in reducing airway smooth muscle tone ( Mendes et al 2008) and can reverse 
adrenergic receptor tolerance and desensitization ( Cooper and Panettieri 2008). Clinically, 
similar functional potentiation with combined ICSs and albuterol has been observed in patients with asthma for functional measures of airway smooth muscle and airway blood flow (Mendes et al 2015 ).  
Combining albuterol with budesonide in the proposed BDA MDI combination product should 
not only provide rapid bronchodilation, but also treat worsening airway inflammation by the 
addition of the budesonide component. Pe r current treatment guidelines ( GINA 2019), 
ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever can be used in patients with asthma. Studies of budesonide and a rapid-acting LABA (formoterol) as reliever therapy have demonst rated 
enhanced protection from severe exacerbations in patients already receiving combination therapy for maintenance without an increase in adverse effects ( O'Byrne et al 2005, Rabe et al 
2006). In addition, budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy or “ Symbicort 
Maintenance And Reliever Therapy ( SMART )” (available commercially as the Symbicort 
Turbuhaler [Symbicort] in the European Union and other markets) significantly reduced 
severe exacerbation risk in pediatric patients ( O'Byrne 2007).  
In some markets, Symbicort is approved for maintenance and reliever therapy. With SMART 
application, patients with asthma use Symbicort as maintenance inhalation medication and

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   15 of 70  also prn  in response to symptoms. The simultaneous administration of budesonide with 
formoterol when symptoms occur ensures that patients with asthma receive both a 
rapid -acting bronchodilator for symptom relief and anti- inflammatory medication to treat their 
persistent airway inflammation.  
The BDA MDI is proposed to be available prn to use in response to symptoms to all patients 
with asthma, regardless of maintenance therapy.  BDA MDI would h ave added effect on 
improvement of lung function and achieving asthma improvement beyond what is seen with 
albuterol and budesonide alone. Current treatment guidelines ( GINA 2019 ) recommend 
addition of low- dose I CS to SABA used as reliever medication as early as in GINA step 1 
asthma (previously treated with SABA prn alone), broadening the range of asthma severity 
grades that would be treated by both ICS and β2-adrenoreceptor agonist. Anti- inflammatory 
and bronchodilation components used prn in a fixed -dose combination are expected to result 
in overall better asthma control and decreased risk of experiencing asthma symptoms than 
bronchodilation alone. 
1.2 Exercise- induced bronchoconstriction  
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes acute airway narrowing that occurs as a 
result of exercise. EIB occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with asthma, but may also 
occur in individuals without an  asthma  diagnosis. The quality of evidence supporting the 
recommendations for the treatment of EIB is variable. Recommendations include using a n 
inhaled  SABA at least 15 minutes  before exercise in all patients with EIB. While f or patients 
who continue to have symptoms of EIB despite the administration of an inhaled S ABA  before 
exercise, strong recommendations were made for a daily ICS, a daily leukotriene receptor 
antagonist, or a mast cell stabilizing agent before exercise ( Parsons et al 2013). Inhaled 
disodium cromog lycate and β 2-agonists administered immediately before an exercise 
challenge test (ECT) also provide good protection ( Molema et al 1989, Richter et al 2002).  
1.3 Rationale f or study design, doses and control groups  
TYREE  is a multicenter , randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, single -dose, 
crossover study in adults and adolescents (12 to 70 years of age) with asthma and EIB . This 
Phase III study is conducted in addition to the AV003- MANDALA exacerbation and AV004-
DENALI lung function studies.  
Asthma patients with EIB , who  use their SABA reliever therapy prophylactically before 
exercise to prevent EIB , may benefit from a fixed -dosed combination (BDA MDI) , taken prior 
to exercise, to prevent asthma symptoms. The TYREE study will assess the  efficacy and 
safety of single -dose BDA MDI as  compared with placebo  MDI  in subjects with asthma and 
EIB. It is important to evaluate whether BDA MDI would prevent or reduce 
bronchoconstriction when used prophylactically.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   16 of 70  Efficacy measures have been selected to demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of BDA MDI  
compared with placebo  MDI : 
1) The maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre- exercise baseline in forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) up to 60 minutes post- exercise challenge  
2) The percentage of subjects with a maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise 
challenge of < 10% 
1.4 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
The study will be c onducted in accordance with International C onference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidelines . Permission from the research ethics committee (EC) will be sought and the 
study will start only after authorization. In the study, s ingle -dose treatment and a comparison 
with placebo is necessary, to show that the presumed protection against EIB  is an  effect of 
active treatment.  
To mitigate any potential risks, all subjects will be closely monitored to ensure subject safety. 
At study visits, subjects will only be discharged from the clinic after satisfactory lun g function 
based on the investigator ’s clinical judgment.  
The study will be conducted in a similar design as previously published studies ( eg, Ostrom et 
al 2015). When considering and assessing all non- clinical and clinical data available for study 
treatments, the Sponsor considers the risk and benefit profile of Study TYREE to be 
acceptable. 
1.5 Study design  
This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, 2-period, single -
dose, crossover study. The study will consist of a screening period (Visit 1 and V isit 2) and 2 
treatment  visits (Visit 3 and V isit 4). A final follow-up visit will be conducted via a telephone 
call (TC) 3 to 5 days after the final in -clinic visit.  
During the study, standardized ECTs will be conducted according to American Thoracic 
Society (ATS) /European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines ( Crapo et al 2000). At each 
visit, standard FEV 1 spirometry assessments will be performed relative to  ECT and dosing, 
(before and after ) as applicable. All spirometry and testing procedures will be in accordance 
with current guidelines. A centralized spirometry data collection system incorporating a 
quality control program will be used to reduce FEV 1 variability between and within subjects , 
and between study sites. 
To be eligible for the treatment phase of the study, subjects with asthma will be required to 
meet spirometry criteria and demonstrate EIB through standardized ECT. If any of the spirometry criteria are not met at Visit 1 ( or Visit 2), subjects can be retested. See 
Section s 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 for specific details  on retesting.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   17 of 70  Visit 1 will include general screening procedures, spirometry, and demonstration of EIB 
through standardized ECT. Those subjects continuing to meet eligibility criteria will enter a 1 to 2-week screening  period  to Visit 2, at which  they will be administered  placebo MDI , 
undergo spirometry testing and confirmation of EIB . At Visit 3 , eligible subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (ie, A /B or B /A), in which single dose s of BDA 
MDI and placebo MDI will be administered in separate treatment periods  (ie, Period 1 and 
Period 2). At  Visit 4 , subjects who received BDA MDI at Visit 3 will receive placebo , while 
those who received  placebo at Visit 3 will receive BDA MDI.  
Safety will be monitored by spontaneously reported adverse events ( AEs)/serious AEs ( SAEs ) 
and physical examination findings. Fur ther, heart rate will be monitored continuously during 
the ECTs and intermittently after ECT until 60 minutes after completion of the exercise 
challenge.

screened  for asthma and EIB , assuming an estimated screen failure rate of 50 % prior to 
randomization.  
Approximately 60 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 70 years of age) will be randomiz ed 
1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (ie , A/B or B/A) as described in Table 1.  
Randomiz ation will be centralized and stratified by age (adults: 18  to 70; adolescents:  12 to 
17) and background ICS therapy (ICS or no ICS). Investigator(s) should keep a record, ie, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered pre-
study screening.  
The i nvestigator(s) will:  
1 Obtain signed informed consent /assent (as applicable)  from the potential subject and/ or 
their guardian/legal representative  before any study -specific procedures are performed.  
2 Enter the subject data into the enroll ment module in Rave Web Based Data Capture 
(WBDC) electronic case report form (eCRF) to enable the allocation of subject identification code (Ecode).  
3 Determine subject eligibility. See Sectio ns 3.1 and  3.2. 
4 Enter the information required to enable the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to initiate randomiz ation and generate the randomi zation code. 
Randomiz ation codes will be assigne d through IWRS strictly sequentially to subjects eligible 
for randomization. If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her 
enroll ment/randomization code cannot be reused. 
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enro lled or randomized

Where a subject does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomiz ed in error, or 
incorre ctly started on treatment, the investigator should inform the medical monitor  
immediately, and a discussion should occur between t he medical monitor  and the investigator 
regarding whether to continue or withdraw the subject in the study. The medical monitor  must 
ensure all decisions are appropriately documented.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   24 of 70  3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups  
A randomization schedule will be generated by a designated statistical representative 
performing statistical support for the study. This schedule will be prepared before the start of 
the treatment phase . The designated statistical representative will follow their established 
standard operating procedures regarding generation, security, and distribution of the 
randomization schedule.  
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a unique subject identification code (Ecode) which 
is automatically generated by the electronic data capture system  (Rave WBDC) based on the 
order of entry. Once it has been determined that a subject meets all eligibility criteria, the 
subject information will be integrated into the IWRS (Randomization and Trial Supply Management) for randomization. 
3.6 Methods for ensurin g blinding  
The study blind is to be maintained until all subjects have completed the treatment phase and 
until after the database has been locked. The study site receives documentation of subject study identification and kit allocation through the IWRS. The randomization code will not be available, with the exception of unblinding procedures described in Section 3.7, to the study 
team, study center  personnel, Sponsor monitors, Sponsor project statisticians, or any other 
personnel employed or affiliated with the Sponsor, as well as investigators and subjects until 
after the database has been locked.  
The 2 different kit types of study IP and placebo  are visually identical, protecting the blind 
through their similarity in appearance.  
3.7 Methods for unblinding  
The treatment blind should not be broken except in medical emergencies and based on the investigator’s clinical judgment, when the appropriate management and welfare of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment allocation. Individual treatment details, for each subject, 
will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IWRS, if needed. If unblinding 
occurs, the investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, but without  revealing the 
treatment assign ment of the unblinded subject. Routines for this will be described in the IWRS 
user manual that will be provided to each center. The IWRS provides unblinding procedures, 
if needed.  
The designated representative retains the right to break the code for SAEs  that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited 
reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned 
analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject 
have been made and documented.

3.8 Restrictions 
During the study, subjects are not allowed to use any asthma medication other than the IP and their background treatment (ie, SABA  prn alone or ICS  with  SABA) that was started before 
screening and continued as part of their asthma treatment (see inclusion criteria). Non- asthma 
medications which are necessary for the subjec t’s wellbeing and which do not affect the 
participation or results of the study are allowed  at the investigator’s discretion . All such 
medication should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
3.9 Criteria for study withdrawal  
At any time, s ubjects may withdraw from the study (ie, study procedures/ visits) at their own 
request  (or their parent/legal representative’s request, as applicable) for any reason, without 
prejudice. Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study upon request of the investigator, or by the Sponsor at any time or for any reason . Some reasons  for study withdrawal  include:  
• An AE or other unacceptable toxicity considered to jeopardiz e the safety of a subject 
participating in the study.  
• Subjects who suffer 1 se vere exacerbation or worsening of asthma that in the 
investigator’s opinion could affect short-term disease course or stability of lung function will be discontinued if the Sponsor and the investigator decide that it is in the best interest of the subject to withdraw from  the study.  
• General or specific change(s) in the subject's condition that render(s) him/her ineligible 
for further participation according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Non-compliance: i n the opinion of the investigator, the subject is non- compliant with the 
requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol (eg, post-enroll ment eligibility violation) .  
• Lost to Follow-up: t he subject is  lost to follow -up and no alternative contact information 
is available (this implies that at least 2 documented attempts have been made to contact 
the subject) . 
• Intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject’s termination from the study, eg, a symptomatic lower respiratory tract infection that puts the subject s at 
potential risk and interferes with the subject’s ability to carry out the required procedures. 
• Pregnancy ; if a female subject becomes pregnant, she will be immediately withdrawn 
from the study. 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the study site must immediately notify 
the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study withdrawal  must be recorded on the 
eCRF. The subject will be asked to complete a premature discontinuation visit (PDV) and the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   26 of 70  follow-up TC. The safety follow-up TC contact will occur 3 to 5 days after the last study visit 
or PDV, as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
In the event that a subject with draws prematurely from the study because of an AE or S AE, 
the AE/SAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or 
stabilizes, or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clinically significant.  
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject may not re -enter the study.  If a subject 
withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrollment/randomization code cannot 
be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
3.9.1 Screen failures  
Screening  failures are subjects who do not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the study, and 
therefore must not be randomiz ed. These subjects should have the reason for study withdrawal 
recorded as “ Screen failure” (the potential subject who does not meet 1 or mo re criteria 
required for participation in a trial, this reason for study withdrawal is only valid for non-
randomiz ed subjects). Subjects who are screen failures will not be rescreened.  
Subjects who fail to meet Visit 1/Visit 2 criteria will be considered f or retest ing. See 
Section  4.1.2 for specific details  on all retesting .  
3.10 Discontinuation of the study  
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the Sponsor , trial subjects are placed at undue 
risk because of clinically sign ificant findings that:  
• meet individual stopping criteria  or are otherwise considered significant  
• are assessed as causally related to study drug  
• are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study 
Regardless of the reason for termination, a ll data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the e CRF . All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests. 
4 STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES  
Table 2 presents study assessments and procedures;  Table 3 and Table 4 presents timed 
spirometry assessments relative to the ECT  (and dosing, as applicable) at Visit 1 through 
Visit 4. Repeat assessments, if needed, will be captured in unscheduled visits. Details on s tudy 
assessments are presented i n Section 5.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   27 of 70  General Considerations  
To ensure standardization, it is recommended that sites review and remind /discuss the 
following with the subject on at least the day before a scheduled visit , as applicable: 
• Site personnel wi ll remind/instruct subjects not to take any prohibited asthma medications 
during the study. Non- asthma medications which are necessary for the subject’s 
wellbeing and which do not affect the participation in or results of the study, are allowed. 
All such medication should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
− At every visit during which lung function testing will be performed, subjects must 
withhold SABA for at least 6 hours prior to start of test day procedures. If subjects 
have taken SABA within 6 hours before the planned lung function test, the test 
should not be carried out and the visit should be rescheduled.    
• Subjects are not allowed to perform physical exercise during the 24 hours prior to the 
visits.  
• Subjects must not ingest/consume xanthine and/or xanthine analogue (caffeine) -
containing foods and beverages for at least 6 hours prior to each study visit and for the 
duration of each study visit. Examples of such products include coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola. Decaffeinated beverages are acceptable.  
• Subjects should avoid having a large meal at least 2 hours prior to a study visit. 
• Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at approximately the same time beginning at Visit 2 for all visits (±2 hours of timing of Visit 1). T herefore, all  subject s 
appointments must be scheduled  with careful attention to the following criteria: 
 
− The first  spirometry a ssessment  each at Visits 2, 3, and 4 should be completed prior 
to 11:00 AM and within ±1 hour of the timing of the first spirometry measurement 
done a t Visit 1.  
− After Visit 1, every attempt should be made to have subsequent ECTs done ±2 hours 
of the timing of the exercise challenge done at Visit 1.  
− Subjects will be required to remain at clinic until completion of all protocol-defined 
assessments. To mi nimize diurnal variance, sites should make every effort to assess 
subjects at the same time throughout the study.

Procedures will be performed according to study assessments and procedures pr esented in 
Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4. At Visit 1 , consenting subjects are assessed to ensure that they 
meet eligibility criteria. Subjects who do not meet the criteria must not be enrolled in the 
study. Subjects meeting all eligibility  criteria will enter a screening period.  
4.1.1 Visit 1 
Standard demographic data and other characteristics will be recorded and will include age and 
year of birth; gender, race, and/or ethnicity according to local regulations; alcohol consumption, and smoking history. 
A standard medical, disease , and surgical history will be obtained with review of the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria with the subject. Other study procedures carried out during this period 
will include physical examination (with  weight, height, and BMI), concomitant medications 
review, seated vital signs  (blood pressure and heart rate), 12- lead ECG, AEs 
assessment/review, serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, blood sampl es 
for hematology and clinical chemistry, and urine samples for urinalysis. See Section s 5.2 and 
5.3 for details on assessments.  
Visit 1 will also include spirometry ( lung function te sting and baseline FEV
1 determination)  
and subject s suitable for the study will perform a maximal exercise test on a treadmill in 
which maximal aerobic capacity is defined. Heart  rate will be monitored continuously during 
the maximal exercise test and hear t rate will be noted when the test is stopped and at specific 
time points as per  Table 3. 
Spirometr y FEV 1 determinations will be made as per  Table 3. To be eligible for the treatment 
phase of the study, subjects will be required to meet the following criteria at Visit 1:  
• Pre-exercise challenge best FEV 1 ≥70% of predicted value 
• EIB as demonstrated by a ≥ 20% decrease from the 5-minute pre- exercise challenge 
absolute FEV 1 
If any of the spirometry criteria are n ot met at Visit 1, subjects can be retested within 2 to 10 
days of the initial visit. Only 1 retest will be permitted for reasons related to technical issues (ie, acceptability) and/or pre -exercise FEV
1 ≥70%  predicted , prior to randomization. The 1  
retest will also be permitted  for a lack of FEV 1 drop (ie, negative EIB outcome) at Visit 1 only 
if the FEV 1 drop is between 15% and <20%. Those subjec ts not meeting criteria will be

At Visit 2, a standardized ECT with s pirometr y FEV 1 determinations will be performed  
according to  Table 4 for continuing eligibility determination. The first spirometry assessment 
will be performed beginning at approximately the same time as the subject’s initial assessment 
at Visit 1 (±1 hour) and before 1 1:00 AM. Subjects will be administered placebo MDI , with 
an ECT conducted 30 (±5) minutes after placebo administration . 
Subjects will be required to meet the following criteria:  
• The pre-dose , pre-exercise challenge best FEV 1 ≥70% of predicted value  
• The pre-dose, pre- exercise challenge best FEV 1 value measured not exceed ing ±20% 
of the pre- exercise challenge best FEV 1 value measured at V isit 1  
• The post-dose , pre- exercise challenge best FEV 1 ≥70% of predicted value  
• EIB as demons trated by a ≥ 20% decrease from the post -dose, pre- exercise challenge 
FEV 1 
• No development of a respiratory tract infection or asthma exacerbation between V isit 1 
and 2. The visit can be rescheduled once within 7 to 10 days for an upper respiratory tract inf ection (eg, common cold) that resolves and does not interfere with the 
subject ’s ability to perform the study procedures. 
If any of the spirometry criteria are not met at V isit 2, subjects can be retested within 2 to 10 
days of the initial visit. Only 1 re test will be permitted for reasons related to technical issues 
(ie, acceptability) and/or pre -exercise FEV

allow for proper preparation of IP, it is recommended that the seal around the study day treatment box is opened with sufficient time  prior to dosing and the instructions for 
administration of IP followed: 
• After IP is primed (see the separate manual for instructions on MDI handling and cleani ng) and ready for use, provide assigned IP to the subject  
• IP will be administered in the clinic  
• Complete post- dose assessments presented in Table 2 and Table 4 (in particular, 
standardized ECT with spirometry FEV

Spirometry calibration will be detailed in a separate spirometry procedures manual.  
The vendor providing central spirometry services will be responsible for assuring that the spirometer used by each site meets ATS/ERS recommendations, and that the study site 
personnel who will be performing the testing are properly certified . Preferably, the same study 
personnel should oversee the ECT procedure throughout the study to reach optimal 
performance and to enhance reproducibility. A centralized spirometry data collection system incorporating a quality control program will be used to reduce FEV
1 variability between and 
within subjects and between study sites.  
Spirometry should be performed  as specified in Table  3 and Table 4. The measurements are to 
be made with the subject seated in an upright position (preferably), or if not comfortable, a 
standing position is also acceptable. The same position should be used for all spirometry 
measures during the entire study. The head must not be tilted during measurements. During 
the breathing maneuv ers, the thorax should be able to move freely; hence tight clothing should 
be loosened.   
The subject should rest for at least 15 minutes prior to the initial test. Multiple maneuvers are 
necessary. For each pre-dose and/or pre- exercise challenge spirometry, a maximum of 8 
maneuv ers can be performed, and the highest value obtained f rom 3 acceptable and 2

assessment at Visit s 2 through 4 is crucial to accurately measure baseline FEV 1 prior to 
exercise testing. The subject and site personnel should be adequately prepared for this 
assessment prior to the exercise test.  
5.1.1.1 Demo nstration of exercise- induced bronchoconstriction  
Subjects  will be required to meet the following criteria at Visit 1  (Section 4.1.1) and Visit 2  
(Section 4.1.2): 
• EIB as demonstrated by a ≥ 20% decrease from the 5-minute pre- exercise challenge 
absolute FEV 1 
5.1.2 Exercise challenge testing 
A standardized maximal exercise test on a treadmill in which maximal aerobic capacity is 
defined will be completed at Visit 1 . At Visits 2  through 4, an ECT, with duration of 6 to 8 
minutes , at approximately 80% to 95% of maximal aerobic capacity will be performed on a 
treadmill as specified in  Table 2, Table 3, and Table  4. The subject s will have a face mask  
during exercise and will breathe dry air.  
Details on exercise testing will be provided in a separate manual. (Measurement procedures should be performed in accordance with the manual.) 
Subjects will also be remin ded that they are not allowed to perform physical exercise during 
the 24 hours prior to the visits. Subjects will be reminded to avoid having a large meal at least 2 hours prior to a study visit, 
and that they must not ingest/consume xanthine and/or xanthi ne analogue (caffeine) -
containing foods and beverages for at least 6 hours prior to each study visit and for the duration of each study visit. Examples of such products include coffee, tea, chocolate, and 
cola. Decaffeinated beverages are acceptable.  
The ECT should be done at approximately the same time (±2 hours of the timing of exercise 
challenge done at Visit 1) at each subsequent visit. Before any procedure is done the subject  
should rest for at least 15 minutes. The subject  needs to be stable before t he test.  
During the maximal exercise challenge, the subject’s heart rate will be monitored continuously. Maximal heart rate should be noted when the test is stopped at Visit 1. After the

ECTs at Visit 2 for eligibility determination and at Visit 3 and Visit 4 (30 [ ±5] minutes after 
IP administration). Heart rate will be monitored continuously during the ECTs until 60 
minutes after ECT completion. See Section 4.1.2 for details on spirometry assessments and 
timing relative to ECTs (and dosing).  
If the subject  has been diagnosed with an intercurrent illness or suffers a severe asthma 
exacerbation before a visit, the subject  will be withdrawn  from the study, depending on the 
reason. See Section 3.9 for details.  The visit can be rescheduled once within 7 to 10 days f or 
an upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold) that resolves and does not interfere 
with the subject ’s ability to perform the study procedures. 
If at any visit an exercise  test and/or the post- exercise lung function tests need to be stopped 
prematurely  (ie, the FEV 1 drops > 40% [which requires treatment with SABA]), or the subject 
has asthma sy mptoms that require treatment with SABA as judged by the investigator , the 
subject ’s visit will be stopped. After an appropriate observation period, if the subject ’s 
condition has stabilized as judged by the investigator, the subject ’s visit will end.  
5.2 Safety assessments 
Safety  assessments include 12 -lead ECG readings  and the collection of AEs. 
5.2.1 Laboratory assessments 
Samples for determination of clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis will be taken at 
the times indicated in  Table  2.  
A serum pregnancy test (β -human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) will be performed at Visit 
1, 4 and PDV; urine β -hCG test will be performed at Visit 3 (for women of childbearing 
potential only). 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinica lly indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis assessments will be performed using a 
centralized laboratory. Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory 
method used and routine pr actice at each site.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   39 of 70  5.2.3 ECG 
Twelve- lead ECGs will be obtain ed using a centralized laboratory. A standardized ECG 
machine should be used and the subject should be examined using the same machine 
throughout the study. 
5.2.3.1 Resting 12- lead ECG  
A resting 12- lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 ( Table 2). T he 12 -lead ECG will be 
obtained using a centralized laboratory after the subject has been resting semi -supine for at 
least 10 minutes.  
The ECG should be recorded with the subject in the same physical position, using a 
standardized ECG machine. The subject should be examined using the same machine throughout the study, where feasible. 
After ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of 
the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist, if appropriate. A paper copy should be filed in the subject’s medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening/baseline is considered to be clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as an AE. For all ECGs, 
details of rhythm, PR, RR, QRS, and QT intervals, as well as an overall evaluation will be 
recorded.  
5.2.4 Heart rate monitoring during exercise challenge testing 
During the exercise challenge at Visit 1, the subject ’s heart rate will be monitored 
continuously for 60 minutes as detailed in Table 3. At Visit 1, Maximal heart rate should be noted when the maximal exercise test is stopped at Visit 1 . 
At Visits 2 through Visit 4 standardized ECTs will be conducted and the subject ’s heart rate 
will be monitored continuously for 60 minut es as detailed in  Table 4.  
5.2.5 Vital signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, while the subject  is 
seated,  as detailed in  Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 .  
Blood pressure m easurements sho uld be taken in the sitting position after at least 10  minutes 
of rest.  
Any clinically significant values in vital signs  should be recorded as an AE if applicable.

concomitant medications are further described in Section s 7.8.2, 7.8.3, and  7.8.4. 
All prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over-the-counter medications 
taken within 3 months before screening will be recorded as previous medications. All 
medications taken after screening and through the follow-up TC  will be  recorded as 
concomitant therapy.   
For restrictions relating to concomitant medications , see Sections 3.1 and 3.2.   
6 SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar 
with the content of this section. 
Serious AEs will be reported as per standard reporting guidance. Associated symptoms of 
asthma are considered as symptoms of disease under study and will not be recorded as AEs 
unless considered an SAE. 
6.1 Definition of adverse events  
An AE  is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom ( eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre- existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
the screening  period, even if no IP has been administered . 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, after the signing of the informed 
consent/assent through to the safety follow-up TC ), that fulfill s 1 or more of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, 25 Oct 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   41 of 70  • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopar dize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix C . 
6.3 Recording of adverse events  
6.3.1 Period for collection of adverse events 
Adverse events (including SAEs) will be collected from the time of signature of informed 
consent /assent  through the safety follow-up TC . 
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last assessment visi t in the study are followed up 
by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the 
eCRF. The Sponsor or a  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department 
representative retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study (after the subject’s follow- up telephone call) and capture 
that information in the eCRF , if judged necessary.  
6.3.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collected  for each AE : 
• AE (verbatim)  
• Dates when the AE started and stopped 
• Maximum severity  
• Seriousness 
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to the IP  
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs, when applicable: 
• Date AE met criteria for SAE 
• Date the investigator became aware of S AE 
• Reason why the AE is considered serious 
• Treatment given for the SAE  
• Date of hospitaliz ation

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   42 of 70  • Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Whether an autopsy is  performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
• Causality assessment to other medication  
• Description of AE 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criter ia in Section 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. 
The severity of the event should be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe.  
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The investigator and the Sponsor will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE , and 
answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?” For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as “ yes”. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix C . 
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subje ct or care provider  or reported in response to the 
open question from the study site staff: “ Have you/ your child had any health problems since 
the previous visit/you (or your child) were last asked?” , or revealed by observation will be 
collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, recording a diagnosi s is preferred 
(when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, t he 
diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, breathlessness, 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, 25 Oct 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   43 of 70  • The sign or symptom is serious 
• The subject discontinues the study because of  the sign or symptom 
• The sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s pre- existing 
asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by the investigator 
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from the Clinical Study Protocol mandated laboratory tests , ECGs,  vital signs  (ie, 
blood pressure and heart  rate) and other assessments will be summarized in the C linical S tudy 
Report. Deterioration from  baseline in these parameters  should therefore only be reported as 
AEs if they fulfill any of the AE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation from the study or 
are considered “clinically significant .” 
The criteria for determining whether the mandated laboratory tests, ECGs, vita l signs, and 
other assessments are clinically significant and should be reported as AEs are generally:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms or signs, and/or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or Sponsor. 
If deterioration  in a laboratory value, ECG, vital sign , or other assessment  is associated with 
clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated parameter  will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the 
reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia  versus low 
hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new  or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE . 
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events  
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally r elated to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF . 
If any SAE occurs dur ing the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel 
should inform the  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department with in 1 day ie, 
immediately  but no later than 24 hours of when he/ she becomes aware of it . 
Should the eCRF system become non-operational, SAEs shall be sent in paper form to:

For fatal or life -threatening SAEs  where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.   
Investigators or other site personnel should inform the Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance Department of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day ie, immediately but  no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
aware of it . 
The Sponsor will also report to all applicable health authorities within 7 days  of awareness 
for a fatal or life -threatening reaction or within 15 days  for a reaction neither fatal no r life -
threatening of any serious unexpected adverse drug reaction related to the drug which 
occurred during the study. 
6.5 Overdose  
For the purpose of this study, an accidental or deliberate intake of blinded treatment of more 
than 2 actuations during Visits 3 and 4 is defined as an overdose and must be reported as such 
as described below.  
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant 
AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose/Medication Error eCRF module. An overdose 
without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose /Medication Error  eCRF 
module. 
The maximum daily dosage of IP should not exceed 2 actuations per visit. If an overdose of IP 
occurs in the course of the study which has an associated SAE , then the investigator or other 
site personnel will inform the  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department 
immediately, or no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department works with the  investigator to 
ensure that all relevant information is provided to the  Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance Department representative.  
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard SAE reporting timelines apply, see 
Section 6.4.

All pregnancies and outcomes of a pregnancy should be reported to the  Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance Department representative except if the pregnancy is discovered 
before the study subject has received any IP. 
6.6.1 Maternal exposure 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, IP should be discontinued 
immediately  and “Pregnancy” recorded as the reason for discontinuation on the eCRF. The 
subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE  unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Ele ctive abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
 The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the s ubject 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel 
will inform the  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department within 1  day; ie, 
immediately  but no later than 24 hours of when he/ she becomes aware of it . Any conception 
occurring from the date of dosing through the safety follow -up TC  should be reported. 
The  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department will work with the investigator 
to ensure that all r elevant information is provided. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
6.6.2 Paternal exposure  
Pregnancy of a subject’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, any conception occurring from the date of dosing through the safety  follow- up TC should be reported to the 
 Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department representative and followed up for 
its outcome.  
6.7 Medication error 
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for the Sponsor’s IP that either causes harm to the subject or has the 
potential to cause harm to the subject.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process- related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject.

• occurred  
• was identified and intercepted before the subject received the drug  
• did not occur, but circumstances were recogni zed that could have led to an er ror 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
• Drug name confusion 
• Preparation error, eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the subject  
• Drug not administered as indicated, eg , wrong route or wrong site of administration  
• Drug not taken as indicated

temperature  
• Wrong subject received the medication (excluding IWRS errors) 
• Wrong drug administered to subjec t (excluding IWRS errors) 
• Subject received the medication in the wrong order (excluding IWRS errors) 
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: 
• Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to 1 of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error  
• Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)  
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.   
All medic ation errors must be recorded in the Overdose/Medication Error eCRF. Any 
associated AEs should also be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE/SAE modules in the eCRF. 
If a medication error occurs dur ing the course of the study which has a n associated SAE , then 
the investigator or other site personnel will inform the  Safety and

8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
8.1 Statistical considerations  
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database lock 
and identification of Clinical Study Pro tocol violators are identified.   
Analyses will be performed by the Sponsor or its representatives. 
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and any subsequent 
amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed before the unblinding of 
the data.  
8.1.1 Estimands 
The estimand of interest is the Efficacy Estimand, defined as the effect of the randomi zed 
treatments in all subjects and in the absence of intercurrent events which may impact the 
interpretation of the treatment effect,  such as use of SABA  medication following the exercise 
challenge test. This estimand could be considered a while-on- treatment strategy or a 
hypothetical strategy as defined in the draft ICH E9 Addendum. 
8.2 Sample size estimate  
Power calculations are based on the properties of the primary endpoint, the maximum percentage fall from post -dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV
1 observed up to 60 minutes post-
exercise challenge. A sample size of 30 subjects in each subgroup will provide a 92% probability to detect a di fference of -9% between BDA MDI versu s placebo MDI, within each 
of the 2 subgroups of interest (SABA prn alone; low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn), 
assuming 2- sided, 5% level tests and a within -subject standard deviation of 10%. 
Randomization of 60 subj ects in total will provide >99% overall probability to detect a

and an estimated within -subject standard deviation of 10%. Since all subject s randomized in 
the study will be receiving background therapy for asthma, a more conservative estimate of 
variability and treatment effect has been assumed compared to studies of similar design 
(Ostrom et al 2015).  
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets  
8.3.1 Full analysis set 
The full analysis set is defined as all subjects who are randomiz ed to treatment and have at 
least 1 baseline and corresponding post- dose FEV 1 measure. Subjects will be analy zed 
according to the treatment they were assigned as per the randomi zation scheme.   
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the full analysis set.  
8.3.2 Safety analysis set 
The safety analysis set is defined as all subjects receiving any amount of the IP. Subjects will 
be classified on the basis of treatment they actually received within each treatment period . 
Occurrences of safety events (ie, AE s and use of concomitant medication) will be summariz ed 
under the actual treatment corresponding to the treatment period of which the event occurred. 
All safety summaries will be based on the safety analysis set.  
8.3.3 All subjects enrolled 
The all subjects enrolled analysis set  will be defined as all subjects who provide informed 
consent. This analysis set  will be used for descriptive summaries of disposition. 
8.4 Violations and deviations  
Important protocol deviations will be listed and summarized by randomized treatment group. A per protocol analysis excluding subjects with significant protocol deviations is not planned. 
All subjects who failed any inclusion/exclusion criteria will be listed along with details of the 
failed criteria. This information will also be summarized in terms of the number and 
percentage of subjects failing any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and will be based on the full analysis set.  
8.5 Outcome measures for analyses  
8.5.1 Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary analysis will include all data obtained before subjects withdraw from the study and will use the full analysis set, in accordance with the E fficacy E stimand ( Section  8.1.1).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   53 of 70  8.5.1.1 Derivation of primary efficacy endpoint  
The fall from post-dose, pre-exercise baseline in FEV 1 will be calculated at each post -exercise 
FEV 1 assessment time  point at Visit 3  and Visit 4. The post -dose, pre- exercise baseline FEV 1 
assessment is expected to occur 30 minutes after administration of IP and 5 minutes prior to 
the exercise challenge. The percentage fall in FEV 1 will be calculated proportional to the post-
dose, pre -exercise FEV 1 value at each visit. The maximum percentage fall available in the 60 -
minute assessment perio d, prior to the use of rescue medication, will be calculated at Visit 3 
and Visit 4.  
8.5.2 Secondary efficacy analysis 
The secondary analysis will include all data obtained before subjects  withdraw from the study  
and will use the full analysis set, in accordanc e with the E fficacy E stimand ( Section  8.1.1).  
8.5.2.1 Derivation of secondary efficacy endpoints 
The fall in FEV 1 will be calculated at Visit 3 and Visit 4 as the difference in the baseline post-
dose, pre -exercise FEV 1 assessment and each post- exercise assessment  at the respective visit, 
as per the serial spirometry timings detailed in  Table  3 and Table 4. The percentage fall will 
be calculated relative to the pre- exercise FEV 1 assessment  at the respective visit. The post-
dose, pre -exercise baseline FEV 1 is defined as per Section 8.5.1.1. 
A binary response variable will be assigned to identify subjects with a maximum percentage 
fall in FEV 1 post- exercise of <10% separately  at Visit 3 and Visit 4: 
• Protected : Maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV 1 up 
to 60 minutes post- exercise challenge <10%  
• Not Protected: Maximum percentage fall from post -dose, pre -exercise baseline in 
FEV 1 up to 60 minutes post- exercise challenge ≥ 10% 
As with the primary efficacy endpoint specified in S ection 8.5.1.1, the maximum percentage 
fall will be calculated based on post -dose FEV 1 measures  prior to use of rescue medication. 
Subjects who have no post- exercise FEV 1 measure prior to rescue medication will have a 
missing responder status at the given visit.  
8.5.3 Exploratory efficacy analysis 
The exploratory analysis will include all data obtained before subjects discontinue the study and wi ll use the full analysis set, in accordance with the E fficacy E stimand ( Section  8.1.1).  
8.5.3.1 Derivation of exploratory efficacy endpoints 
The binary response variable specified in S ection 8.5.2.1 will be replicated to identify subjects 
with a maximum percentage fall in FEV
1 post- exercise of < 20% at each of Visits 3 and 4.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   54 of 70  Time to recovery at each of Visits 3 and 4 will be derived as the time (minutes) post- exercise 
challenge in which the FEV 1 result returns  to within  10% of the value recorded at the post-
dose, pre -exercise baseline. Only subjects who achieve a percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise 
challenge of >10% will have an event time derived ; otherwise their value will be left 
censored . Subjects who have any rescue medication administered during the post -dose 
assessments will be censored at the time of receiving rescue medication. Subjects who do not 
recover to within 10% of the post-dose, pre -exercise baseline will be censored at 60 minutes.  
The fall fr om post-dose, pre-exercise baseline in FEV 1 will be calculated at each of the post -
exercise assessment time  points at Visit 3 and Visit 4. The post-dose, pre -exercise baseline 
FEV 1 assessment is expected to occur 30 minutes after administration of IP and 5 minutes 
prior to the exercise challenge. The percentage fall in FEV 1 will be calculated proportional to 
the post-dose, pre -exercise FEV 1 value at each visit.  
FEV 1 AUC 0-30min will be derived for the changes from the post-dose, pre -exercise baseline 
using t he trapezoidal rule and will be normalized by dividing by the actual time (in minutes) 
from dosing to the last included measurement, scheduled at 30 minutes post- exercise 
challenge at each of Visits 3 and 4 . Only FEV 1 results prior to the use of rescue medication 
will be considered when calculating FEV 1 AUC 0-30min. 
8.6 Methods for statistical analyses  
All tests will be 2-sided and at 5% level of significance unless otherwise stated.  
In addition to the analyses described below, all variables will be summariz ed descriptively 
where appropriate. All descriptive and formal analyses will be described in accordance with 
the E fficacy E stimand.  
8.6.1 Analysis of the primary variable(s) 
The maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV 1 observed up to 
60 minutes post- exercise challenge will be analy zed with a mixed effect model including 
categorical fixed effects for treatment, treatment period , treatment sequence,  period- specific 
pre-dose baseline FEV 1 and average pre- dose baseline FEV 1, and a random subject  within 
treatment sequence effect. Post -dose, pre -exercise baseline FEV 1 will be defined as the post-
dose value measured  5 minutes before exercise challenge, at each visit for the respective 
treatment. The period- specific pre- dose baseline FEV 1 will be  at the respective Visit 3 or Visit 
4 pre-dose result, approximately 5 minutes prior to dosing . The average pre- dose baseline 
FEV 1 will be calculated as the mean  of the period- specific baselines. Estimated treatment 
differences and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) will be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   55 of 70  The corresponding hypotheses for the primary analysis  are as follows:  
H01: Difference between treatment s =0,  
HA1: Difference between treatment s ≠0. 
The primary treatment comparison  of BDA MDI 160/180 versu s placebo MDI  for the  
maximum percentage fall from post -dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV 1 observed up to 60 
minutes post- exercise challenge will be conducted on the full analysis set and include all data 
up to study withdrawal as per the E fficacy Estimand  (Section 8.1.1). Missing results for 
maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 is unlikely (ie, rescue medication prior to the collection of 
the 5 minutes measure) and will be assumed to be missing at random. Sensitivity analyses will 
be conducted to explore the robustness of the primary analysis with respect to this missing data assumption ( Section 8.6.6).  
The primary analysis will be repeated on t he subgroups on clinical interest (SABA prn alone; 
low-to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn). To control the overall type -I error, a hierarchical 
testing strategy will be adopted. The treatment comparisons of BDA MDI 160/180 versus placebo MDI  will be conducted on the subject  populations in the sequence given below:  
1. Overall population (SABA prn only OR low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn 
background therapy) 
2. Subjects  taking SABA prn only for background therapy  
3. Subjects  taking low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn for background therapy 
If a comparison is significant (alpha=0.05, 2- sided), testing will proceed to the next 
comparison. Comparisons will stop if a non- statistically significant result occurs. All 
comparisons are of superiority. 
8.6.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) 
In addition to the analyses described below, all variables will be summarized descriptively where appropriate. All descriptive and formal analyses will be described in accordance with the E fficacy E stimand.  
8.6.2.1 Responder analysis in post- exercise FEV
1 
The odds of being protected against EIB (ie , having a maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 post-
exercise challenge of <10 %) will be analy zed using a generalized linear mixed  model with 
logit link function to compare the treatments. The model will be adjus ted with fixed effects for 
treatment, treatment period  and treatment sequence, and a random subject within treatment 
sequence effect . The odds ratio and 95% CI will be reported for pairwise treatment 
comparisons. The analysis will only include maximum percentage falls in FEV 1 prior to study 
discontinuation. The data considered missing under the primary E fficacy E stimand will be 
assumed to be missing at random in the analysis.

In addition to the analyses described below, all variables will be summarized descriptively 
where appropriate. All descriptive and formal analyses will be described in accordance with the E fficacy E stimand . 
8.6.3.1 Responder analysis in post- exercise FEV
1 (20% threshold) 
The odds of having a maximum percent age fall in FEV 1 post- exercise challenge of < 20% will 
be separately analy zed using a generalized linear mixed  model to compare treatments as 
specified in Section 8.6.2.1.  
8.6.3.2 Time to recovery  
The median time to recovery will be reported descriptively by treatment. P- values will be 
calculated using a period -adjusted sign test, based on categorizing subject s into period 
preferences  (Senn 1993) . Further details will be clarified in the SAP. 
8.6.3.3 Fall in post -exercise FEV 1 at individual time points  
The percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise challenge will be summari zed descriptively by 
treatment group and planned time point within 60 minutes of the serial spirometry assessments 
conducted post- exercise challenge. An  analysis of percentage fall in FEV 1 post- exercise 
challenge will be conducted using methods as per the primary analysis, with an additional 
adjustment for planned time point in the repeated measures model. The covariance within 
subject -periods will be unstructured over the time points. Only FEV 1 results prior to 
administration of rescue therapy (within the study visit) will be included in the analyses, as per the E fficacy E stimand.  
8.6.3.4 Post-exercise FEV
1 AUC 0-30min 
The post- exercise FEV 1 AUC 0-30 min  will be analy zed with a similar mixed effects model as 
described in Section 8.6.1 for the change from post-dose, pre -exercise baseline in the 
maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 without exercise pre- treatment.  Only the FEV 1 AUC 0-30 min 
measurements prior to administration of rescue  SABA therapy will be included in the 
analyses.  
8.6.4 Subgroup analysis 
Two subgroups of equal size will be included in the study, 1 subgroup of subject s on SABA 
prn only and the other subgroup on low-dose ICS maintenance therapy according to GINA 
guidelines. All primary, secondary and exploratory analyses will be repeated on each of these subgroups of interest. Please refer to the testing strategy in  Section  8.6.1 for analyzing the 
prima ry endpoint in these subgroups of interest. 
The assessment of treatment effect will be investigated in other clinically important subgroups and will be defined in more detail in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   67 of 70  APPENDIX C ADDITIONAL SAFETY INFORMATION 
Further guidance on the d efinition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Life-threatening  
“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death. “ Life-threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospitalization  
Out-patient treatment in an emergen cy room is not in itself a n SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrol led in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. 
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of important medical events include but are not limited to: 
• Angio edema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment 
• Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for  allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitaliz ation  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
 
A guide to i nterpreting the causality q uestion  
When making an assessment of causality , consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a “ reasonable possibility”  that an AE may have been caused by the drug.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   68 of 70  • Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? 
• Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
• De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug? 
• No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another cause/ etiology 
such as , the underlying disease, other drugs, and other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? The Sponsor would not normally recommend or support a re -
challenge. 
• Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the drug? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Causality of “related” is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibility”  of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
“reasonable possibility” of a causal relat ionship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed on the basis of the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is highly encouraged for the reporting investigator to express his/her clinical opinion. If (despite all efforts) the causality assessment cannot be made, these SAEs will be considered to be “ related .” 
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated because of  lack of 
effect should be classified as “no reasonable possibility.”

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   69 of 70  APPENDIX D SPIROMETRY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA  
Acceptable Versus Usable Tests  
Acceptable Tests must meet the following c riteria:  
1. Acceptable start of exhalation with brisk upstroke, no hesitation or false start, and back 
extrapolation volume <5% of forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.150 L, whichever is the greater (see example in Figure 1)  
2. No cough during the fir st second  
3. No V alsalva maneuver  
4. No leak  
5. No obstruction of mouthpiece 
6. No extra breaths  
7. Plateau achieved: ie, the volume-time curve shows no change in volume (<0.025 L) for 
≥ 1 second, and the subject has tried to exhale for at least 6 seconds 
 
An acceptable test meets all 7 criteria listed. This is to be considered the “gold standard .” 
Usable spirometry tracings are those that only meet criteria 1 and 2. When this occurs, repeat 
testing up to 8 attempts for pre-dose and 5 attempts for post- dose assessments, i n an effort to 
obtain 3 acceptable spirograms. If only usable tests are obtained, report results based on the 3 best usable trials with observed limitations.

extrapolation through the steepest part of the curve, where flow is peak expiratory flow ( PEF) 
rate, to determine the new “time zero”. Forced vital capacity -4.291 L; extrapolated volume 
(EV) – 0.123 L (2.9% FVC): back extrapolation line through PEF. 
Between -Man oeuver Reproducibility Criteria  
Pre-dose assessments  
After 3 acceptable spirograms have been obtained, apply the following tests: 
• The 2 largest values of FVC must be within 0.150 L of each other  
• The 2 largest values of FEV 1 must be within 0.150 L of each other 
If these criteria are met, the spirometry testing for that time  point may conclude, however, if 
possible, please continue collecting additional spirograms to a maximum of 8 pre-dose and 5 
post-dose attempts. The highest FEV 1 and the highest FVC obtained at each testing time point 
(even if from different reproducible tracings), will be collected. 
If acceptability criteria are not met, continue testing until they are met or the sub ject cannot/ 
should not continue (maximum of 8 attempts).  
Post-dose assessments  
After 2 acceptable spirograms have been obtained, apply the following tests: 
• The 2 largest values of FVC are within 0.150 L of each other and/or 
• The 2 largest values of FEV 1 are within 0.150 L of each other  
If these criteria are met, the spirometry testing for that time  point may conclude. The highest 
FEV 1 and the highest FVC obtained at each testing time point (even if from different 
reproducible tracings), will be collected.  
If acceptability/reproducibility criteria are not met, continue testing until they are met or the 
subject cannot/ should not continue (maximum of 5 attempts).

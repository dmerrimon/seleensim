Study Design: This is a Phase 1/2 open- label, non- randomized, multicenter 
study  consisting of two phases.  A Phase 1, or 
dose-escalation portion, which will evaluate the safet y and 
pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax 
(ABT -199/GDC -0199) administered orally  in combination 
with low -dose cy tarabine (LDC) with the objective of 
defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and generating 
data to support the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in 
treatment -naïve subjects with Acute Myelogenous 
Leukemia (AML) who are ≥60years of age and who are 
not eligible for standard induction therap y due to 
co-morbidity  or other factors.  A subsequent initial Phase 2 
portion will evaluate if the RPTD has sufficient efficacy and 
acceptable toxicity  to warrant further development of the 
combination therap y.  Subsequently, within Phase 2, 
Cohort C will evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) for 
subjects allowed additional supportive medications (strong 
CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.

Protocol Title:   A Phase 1/2 Study of Venetoclax in Combination with Low -Dose Cytarabine in 
Treatment Naïve Subjects with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Who Are ≥ 60 Years of Age and Who 
Are Not Eligible for Standard Anthracycline -Based Induction Therapy
Objective s:  
Prim ary Objectives:
The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to assess the safety profile, characterize 
pharmacokinetics (PK), determine the dose schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax (AB T-199/GDC -0199) in combination with 
LDC in treatment -naïve subjects with AML who are ≥ 65 years of age and who are not eligible for 
standard induction therapy due to co -morbidity or other factors.
The primary objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion of th e study are to evaluate the preliminary 
estimates of efficacy including the overall response rate (ORR) and to characterize the toxicities of 
the combination at the RPTD.
The primary objective of Phase 2 Cohort C is to evaluate the ORR for subjects allowed additional 
supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.
Secondary Objective:
The secondary objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion and Phase 2 Cohort C are to evaluate 
leukemia response (rates of CR, CRi, PR, and MLFS), durat ion of response (DOR) and overall 
survival (OS).
Exploratory Objective:
Additional exploratory objectives of both phases of the study may be evaluated to find biomarkers 
that may serve as surrogates or predictors for clinical outcomes in future studies of venetoclax in 
AML.
Investigators:   Investigator information on file at AbbVie
Study Site s:  Approximately 10 sites globally
Study Population:   Adult subjects ≥ 65 years of age with untreated AML for whom standard induction 
therapy is not appropriate due to age, co -morbidity, or other factors.  Additionally, in Phase 2 Cohort C 
only, subjects aged 60 –64 may be enrolled if they have specified co -morbidities that preclude treatment 
with anthracycline -containing induction chemotherapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Up to 42 subjects w ill be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion.  
Approximately 50 subjects w ill be enrolled in the initial Phase 2 portion.  In addition, approximately 
20subjects w ill be enrolled in Phase 2 Cohort C.

Methodology:
This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study that will evaluate the PK, safety and preliminary 
efficacy of venetoclax combined w ith LDC in treatment -naïve subjects w ith AML ≥65 years old and 
who are not eligible for standard induction therapy due to age, co -morbidity or other factors.  This study 
will consist of two distinct portions or phases.  The first portion of the study is a Phase 1, or 
dose-escalation portion, that will evaluate the safety and PK profile of venetoclax administered with 
LDC with the objectives of defining the MTD and generating data to support a RPTD.  A subsequent 
initial Phase 2 portion w ill evaluate whether the RPTD has sufficient efficacy and acceptable toxicity to 
warrant further development of the combination therapy.  Subsequently, a cohort of subjects, Phase 2 
Cohort C, will be enrolled permitting a broader range of supportive medication (strong CYP3A 
inhibitors) co -administration.  Age entry criteria for these subjects will be ≥ 60 years.
For the Phase 1 portion, a classical 3 + 3 design is utilized to define the MTD of venetoclax in 
combination with a standard LDC regimen.  Subjects are enrolled in cohorts of three.  The first subject 
from the subsequent cohort should not begin their intended dosing regimen until it is declared b y the 
sponsor that no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have occurred during Cycle 1 of the previous dose level.  
For this trial, a DLT is defined as experiencing a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grade 4 or 5 toxicity, unless such eve nts are in the common list of health events due to AML, 
or not recovering platelets to at least 25,000/μL and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to 500/μL within 
14days of the last dose of venetoclax unless such cytopenias are due to residual leukemia effect.  Should 
1 subject experience a DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level (a total of 
6subjects at this dose level).  Should 2 subjects at a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level is 
considered too toxic.  The dose level below  the too toxic dose level may be considered the MTD.  
Additional subjects are then enrolled at the putative MTD to bring the total number enrolled at the MTD 
to 6.  If, during this cohort expansion, a total of 2 subjects at this dose level also exper ience a DLT, this 
level would also be considered too toxic and the method continues thusly until the maximal dose level is 
achieved where 6 subjects can be treated through Cycle 1 and no more than one subject experiences a 
DLT to define the MTD.
Biomarkers (such as cytogenetics, molecular markers, characterization of Bcl -2 and associated proteins 
or ex vivo testing of AML subject samples) that may be predictive of venetoclax will be assessed 
throughout the trial and may be used to enrich for subjects likely to respond to venetoclax.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Bone marrow  biopsies and aspirates must be performed at screening for all subjects.  Cytogenetic and 
molecular profiling must be performed at screening.  In addition, it is recommended that screening bone 
marrow  aspirat ion samples be analyzed by flow cytometry.  Bone marrow  aspirate and biopsy must be 
performed prior to Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, and then every 3 cycles thereafter until 
twoconsecutive samples confirm Complete Remission (CR), again if clinical suspici on of recurrence, 
and at the end -of-study visit for all subjects.
Based on these results, all dosed subjects w ill be assessed based on the International Working Group 
(IWG) criteria for AML (Cheson et al.  J Clin Oncol.  2003) at each post -baseline visit b y the 
investigators.

11
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
CR: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 103/µL, platelets ≥ 105/µL, red cell transfusion independence, 
and bone marrow  with < 5% blasts.
CRi: bone marrow  with < 5% blasts, and peripheral neutrophils of < 103/µL or platelets 
<105/µL.
PR: all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage 
of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow  aspirate.
MLFS: less than 5% blasts in an aspirate and/or bone marrow core sample.  There should be no 
blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease.  The presence of a unique 
phenotype (by flow cytometry) identical to what was found in the pretreatment specimen 
(e.g., CD34, CD7 coexpression) sh ould be viewed as persistence of leukemia.
RD: failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR; only including subjects surviving at least 7 days following 
completion of initial treatment cycle, with evidence of persistent leukemia by blood and/or 
bone marrow  exam ination.
PD: one or more of the following:  ≥ 50% decrement from maximum response levels in 
neutrophils or platelets, a reduction in hemoglobin by at least 2 g/dL, or transfusion 
dependence not due to other toxicities and bone marrow  blast ≥ 5%.
In addition to t he response determination using the above IWG AML response criteria, each subject w ill 
also be evaluated for Hematologic Response (HR) and complete remission with partial hematologic 
recovery (CRh).
CR = complete remission; CRi = CR with incomplete blood c ount recovery; PR = partial remission; 
MLFS =morphologically leukemia free status; RD = resistant disease; PD = progressive disease
Pharm acokinetic:
Venetoclax PK samples will be collected at 8 hours post- dose on the day of the first venetoclax dose 
administration and for each new escalated dose in all subjects enrolled in the study.  Intensive PK 
samples will be collected for venetoclax in Phase 1.  Sparse PK samples will be collected for venetoclax 
in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the stu dy.  For the intensive PK days of venetoclax, values 
for the PK parameters including the maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max
(peak time, T max), the area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from 0 to the time of the 
last measurable concentration (AUC t) and AUC over a 24 -hour dose interval (AUC 0-24) will be 
determined using noncompartmental methods.  Intensive PK samples will be collected for cytarabine in 
the dose escalation phase.  For the intensive PKdays of cytarabine , values for the PKparameters 
including C max, Tmax, half -life (t 1/2), AUC t, AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC∞) and clearance (CL/F) will be 
determined using noncompartmental methods.  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the 
interpretati on of the data.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharm acodynamic and Predictive Biom arker Analysis:
A reduction in leukocytosis or blast counts may be evaluated as a measure of venetoclax -induced 
pharmacodynamic activity.  Exploratory research may als o be conducted to find biomarkers that may 
serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints in future venetoclax studies or that may be predictive of 
venetoclax activity.  Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate samples will be obtained at study 
specified time points.  Biomarker assays may include, but are not limited to, BH3 profiling and ex vivo 
sensitivity testing.  Subject sub -populations (e.g., based on parameters such as cytogenetics, mutation 
profiles or ex vivo venetoclax sensitivities) may be enriched in Phase 2 of the study to increase the 
potential for response to venetoclax.  If necessary, aliquots from PK samples will be utilized for 
biomarker analyses.  Exploratory research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharm acogenetic s:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the disease or the subject's response to 
venetoclax in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety.
Safety:
Adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
laboratory values will be assessed.  Guidelines for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) management are 
provided.  Note:  All subjects will be hospitalized during dose ramp -up and longer as needed, per 
investigator judgment, for bone marr ow recovery or for management of disease complications during the 
escalation from each subjects starting dose through at least 24 hours beyond each subject receiving their 
maximal venetoclax dose level.  Chemistry labs pertinent to TLS (including potassium , calcium, uric 
acid, phosphorus, and creatinine) will be performed at pre -dose, 6, and 12 hours post -dose for the 
firstdose and each escalated dose, and also as deemed necessary to monitor for TLS.  Chemistries will 
also be performed at 24 hours after ad ministration of the highest venetoclax dose level.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Analyses of ORR as defined by CR + CRi + PR, CR rate, CRi rate, CRh rate, CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh 
rate, duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), the exploratory 
analysis of the proportion of all subjects who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, the 
proportion of subjects who are transfusion independent post baseline, and the proportion of subjects who 
undergo subsequent stem cell transplant will be performed for subjects who received study drugs.
Pharm acokinetic:
Plasma concentrations and PK parameter values of venetoclax and cytarabine will be tabulated for each 
subject, visit, and dose regimen, and summary statistics will be computed for each sampling time and 
each parameter.
The dose proportionality of venetoclax and the potential interaction betw een venetoclax and cytarabine 
will be assessed using linear mixed effect model.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performe d for all dosed subjects unless otherwise indicated.  For the study as a 
whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory test results and vital signs will be 
explored for trends and summarized as appropriate.

3.0 Introduction
Venetoclax Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile
Hematologic malignancies are highl y dependent upon the anti -apoptotic protein Bcl -2 for 
survival.  Over -expression of Bcl -2 is associated with tumor initiation, disease 
progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a com pelling target for anti -tumor therapy .  
Venetoclax (ABT- 199/GDC -0199) is a potent, selective and orally  bioavailable small 
molecule inhibitor of Bcl -2 that binds with > 1,000 -fold higher affinity  for Bcl -2 (K i
<0.010 nM) than for Bcl -XL(Ki–48 nm) or Mc l-1 (K i> 444 nM).3  In vitro, venetoclax 
has demonstrated cell killing activit y against patient -deriv ed chronic l ymphocy tic 
leukemia (CLL) cells and a variet y of l ymphoma and leukemia cell lines, including acute 
myelogenous leukemias (AML).3  Venetoclax was especiall y potent against Non- Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl -2 protein due to the t(14;18) 
chromosome translocation, amplification of the Bcl-2gene locus, or aberrant ly activated 
signaling mechanisms.  Venetoclax also demonstrated potent killing of multiple myeloma 
(MM) cell lines and primary  tumor samples bearing the t(11;14) translocation, which tend 
to express high levels of Bcl -2 relative to Mcl -1.
Bcl-2 over -expression has been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML cells 
and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics.  In addition, high levels of 
Bcl-2 were associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with this disease.4,5  The 
Bcl-2/Bcl -XLinhibitor ABT -737 has been shown to kill AML  cells, including leukemic 
stem/progenitor cells, as both a single agent and in combination with cytarabine4or 
azacitidine.5To further define the role of Bcl -2 in this disease, panels of AML cell lines 
and primary  patient samples were cultured in the presence of venetoclax.  Twelve of 
24AML  cell lines tes ted were sensitive to venetoclax, with cell killing I C50values of 
<1.0µM ( Appendix G).  The sensitivity  of primary  AML patient samples was 
compa rable to that observed for primary  CLL samples, with a median I C50= 0.010 µM 
(n= 57) for AML6(Appendix G) versus a median IC 50= 0.003 µM (n =35) for CLL 
(AbbVie R&D/10/1025, AbbVie R&D/12/538).  Venetoclax has also demonstrated killing 
of AML leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and antitumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting

the growth of AML cell lines or AML patient -derived pri mary  cells systemically  
engrafted into immunocompromised mice.6
However, not all AML cell lines, prima ry patient samples, or patients treated with single 
agent venetoclax were found to be sensitive, and there is biologic rationale for combining 
venetoclax with certain chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of AML.  The Mcl -1 
protein can act as a resistance factor for Bcl -2 family  inhibitors7,8including in AML .4  
Therapeutic agents such as the DNA meth yltransferase inhibitor azacitidine,6the DNA 
synthesis inhibitor cy tarabine9and the anthracycline doxorubicin10have shown an ability 
to down- regulate Mcl -1, indicating that they  might combine well with Bcl -2 inhibitors.  I n 
support of this, ABT -737 has demonstrated synergistic killing of AML  cell lines when 
combined with cy tarabine or doxorubicin.4  Combinations of venetoclax and 
chemotherapeutic agents commonly  used in the treatment of AML were tested against a 
panel of 20 AML cell lines.  While most combinations resulted in additive cell killing, 
venetoclax c ombined with cy tarabine or azacitidine showed s ynergistic effects on several 
AML  cell lines (Appendix G).  These data suggest that Bcl -2 inhibition alone may  be 
sufficient for the s ynergistic effects that have been observed between ABT -737 and 
cytarabine or azacitidine, and thus provides a rationale for testing these combinations with 
venetoclax in patients with AML .  In mouse, rat, monkey , and dog, the venetoclax PK 
profile was characterized by  low plasma clearance (CLp = 0.02 to 0.27 L /hr•kg) and low 
volumes of distribution (Vss = 0.3 to 1.1 L /kg).  Half -lives ranged from 2.2 hours in 
monkey  to 12.0 hours in dog.  Formulation -dependent oral bioavail ability  was noted in all 
species.  Studies in both rat and dog have defined the behavior of the amorphous solid 
dispersion (ASD) for both toxicology  and first -in-human evaluation.  Plasma 
concentrations obtained from fed dogs were 30% to 50% higher than th ose obtained from 
fasted animals.
Venetoclax is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, or 
CYP2D6 (I C50>30 μM).  At concentrations of 1, 3, and 10 μM, venetoclax did not 
induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 expression in vitro.  Venetoclax was meta bolized by  
CYP3A4; thus its exposure could be affected when potent inhibitors or inducers of 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)

CYP3A4 are co -administered.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P -gp and BCRP.  Active 
uptake of venetoclax or M27 was not observed in cells overexpressing OATP1B1, 
OAT P1B3 or OCT1.  Venetoclax is a P -gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.
Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
The primary  toxicities associated with repeat -dose oral administration of venetoclax were 
effects on the hematologic sy stem (decreased ly mphocy tes and red blood cell mass) in 
mice, rats, and dogs, the male reproductive s ystem (testicular germ cell depletion) in dogs, 
and embry o-fetal toxicity  in mice.  Other noteworthy  findings in dogs were epithelial 
single cell necrosis in multiple tissues and hair coat color change towards white.  I n 
general, the primary  toxicities and other noteworthy  findings were consistent with the 
expected pharmacologic effects of venetoclax, a selective Bcl -2 inhibitor.
In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced decreases in lymphocy tes in the peripheral 
blood (up to – 75% in mice, – 64% in rats, and – 81% in dogs) and in ly mphoid tissues, 
generall y following 2 to 4 weeks or more of dail y dosing (but after a single dose in dogs).  
Lym phocy te decreases were expected on the basis of venetoclax pharmacology  and, when 
sustained over periods of 6 to 9 months in chronic venetoclax toxicity  studies, were not 
associated with opportunistic infections.16
In mice, total ly mphocy te counts at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day  after 4 weeks of 
dosing were minimally  decreased –21% to – 26% relative to concurrent controls at the end 
of the 4- week recovery  period, indicating partial recovery .  In dogs, the recovery  of 
peripheral blood decreases in total ly mphocy tes and ly mphocy te subsets (CD4+ T -cells, 
CD8+ T- cells, and CD21+ B -cells) was prolonged, requiring up to 18 weeks after a single 
dose or 2 weeks of dail y dosing.  B- cells were the most sensitive ly mphocy te sub type 
based on the magnitude of decrease (> –90%) and/or the length of time required for 
recovery .  Lymphocy te decreases in l ymphoid tissues were reversible in mice and dogs ; 
but, as with peripheral blood ly mphocy tes, required up to 18 weeks in dogs.

Veneto clax produced dose -related decreases in red blood cell (RBC) mass due to altered 
hemoglobinization and decreased RBC production in mice, rats, and dogs.  Based on a 
criterion of hemoglobin decreases of ≥ –20% as compared to control and/or baseline, 
these e ffects were considered adverse at the highest dosages in the 4 -week mouse and dog 
studies (observed decreases of – 21 to –23%) but were reversible following a 4 -week 
recovery  period.  In studies designed to select dose levels for possible carcinogenicity 
assessment, RBC mass decreases were also observed in rats and were generally  more 
severe (hemoglobin decreases to – 49%) than in mice or dogs.
Venetoclax produced adverse, non dose -related microscopic findings of testicular germ 
cell depletion (spermatogonial loss with maturation depletion) in dogs at all doses tested.  
Reversibility  was assessed after 4 weeks of dosing and a 4 -week recovery  period; there 
was no evidence of reversibility .  Testicular germ cell loss may  be related to venetoclax 
pharmacology , asBcl-2 play s a role in spermatogonial maintenance.17,18  There were no 
testicular effects in mice or rats at venetoclax exposures overlapping those in dogs.
Venetoclax resulted in increased post -implantation loss and decreased fetal body  weights 
in the mouse embry o-fetal development study  at the highest dosage administered 
(150 mg/kg/day ); the no -observed -adverse -effect -level was defined at the mid -dose of 
50mg/kg/day .  In mice and rabbits, venetoclax was not teratogenic, and there were no 
other effects on development or fertility .
Additional noteworthy  effects of venetoclax included minimal to mild single cell necrosis 
in multiple epithelial tissues (gallbladder, exocrine pancreas, epididymides, prostate, and 
stomach) in dogs and a change in the hair coat towards white in dogs (occurring after 
approximately  3 months of dosing in the 9 -month study ).  None of these effects was 
considered to be adverse.  Hair follicle melanocy tes are critically  dependent on Bcl -2 for 
survival during the normal hair replenis hment cy cle in mice, suggesting that the decrease 
in hair pigmentation in dogs was a likel y effect of Bcl -2 inhibition.19  In regards to single -
cell ne crosis, Bcl-2 is expressed in epithelial tissues and may  regulate survival in rapidly  
dividing cell populations.20-22  Venetoclax appears to increase the rate of normally

occurring apoptosis without adversely affecting the normal tissue architecture or functions 
of these tissues .
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity  of venetoclax, nor was there 
evidence of phototoxicity  (tested in vivo in hairless mice).  In a juvenile toxicity  study , 
mice were administered venetoclax at 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day  by oral gavage from 7 to 
60 day s of age.  Clinical signs of toxicity  included decreased activity , dehydration, skin 
pallor and hunched posture at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day .  Mortality  and bod y weight decreases 
occurred at 100 mg/kg/day .  Other venetoclax -related effects were reversible decreases in 
lymphocy tes at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day ; these findings were consistent with those in adult mice 
and considered non adverse.
The major human metabolite of venetoclax, M27, was characterized at steady -state in R/R 
CLL patient plasma with an average metabolite to paren t AUC ratio of 0.48 at the 400 mg 
venetoclax clinical dose.  In contrast, ss plasma levels of M27 in mice and dogs were 
≤5.1% of human exposure, making M27 a disproportionate human metabolite.  The 
safet y of M27 was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies.  M27 was negative in Ames 
and chromosome aberration in vitro assays, has at least 58 -fold less in vitro potency  than 
venetoclax, and demonstrates low off -target toxicity  potential based on in vitro secondary  
pharmacology  assay s.  Additionally , no adverse effects were observed in a 4 -week mouse 
toxicity  study  in which M27 was orall y administered at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day, 
achieving M27 AUC plasma exposures at or above those observed clinically.
Dogs at the high dosage of 150 mg/kg/day  (AUC 572 µg•h/mL) in the 4- week toxicity  
study  had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and 
forepaws and/or hind paws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in 
3 dogs the swelling reaction was observed after the first dose.  The clinical signs were 
limited to the 150 mg/kg/day  dosage, were mild to moderate in severity  and transient and 
sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the 4- week recovery  period.  A 
mechanistic basis for the swelling reactions wa s not established, but a histamine -like 
reaction to copovidone, a primary  excipient in the formulation, is possible.23  There were 
no signs of anaph ylaxis.

Venetoclax was tested in a battery  of safet y pharmacology  assay s, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respiratory studies in mice at oral doses up to and 
including the highest dose of 600 mg/kg.  To assess cardiovascular safet y, venet oclax was 
tested in an in vitro human ether -a-go-go related gene (hERG) assay  and in both 
conscious and anesthetized dogs.  InhERG, a 50% inhibition constant (I C50) could not be 
calculated due to limited solubility  (1.5 µg/mL ).  Only minimal effects on QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) were observed up to a maximum plasma concentration of 
46 µg/mL  in dogs.  In conscious dogs, venetoclax did not produce an y cardiovascular 
effects up to and including the highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (C max= 16 µg/ mL).  In the 
anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, venetoclax produced mild reductions in 
myocardial contractility  (–6% to – 13%) and cardiac output ( –11% to – 19%) at plasma 
concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL and ≥ 32 µg/mL , respectively .  These conce ntrations are 
greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in humans (geometric mean 
Cmax=3.46 µg/mL  at the 1200 mg dose).
On the basis of nonclinical safet y pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of 
venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical an d human studies of related anti -apoptotic 
Bcl-2 family  protein inhibitors, key potential mechanism -based toxicities may include 
lymphopenia and neutropenia,16signs of tumor ly sis, reduction in RBC mass, decreased 
spermatogenesis, skin swelling, and hair h ypopigmentation.  The potential for 
development of hair color change in humans is unknown.  No advers e events of changes 
in hair color, skin pigmentation, or eye color have been reported in the venetoclax clinical 
studies to date.  Although no effects of venetoclax on female reproductive tissues have 
been observed in repeat -dose general toxicology  studies , embry o-fetal toxicity  studies in 
animals have identified a fetal toxicity  risk.  Thrombocy topenia has not been observed in 
toxicology  studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with venetoclax as a 
Bcl-2 specific (Bcl -XLsparing) inhibitor.  Consequently , thrombocy topenia is not 
expected to be a DLT clinically .  Overall, the toxicities observed in animals administered 
venetoclax are consistent with the expected pharmacologic effects of Bcl- 2 inhibition.

Venetoclax Clinical Data
As of 28 November 2019, on the basis of data available in the clinical databases for 
compan y-sponsored studies with unblinded data, a total of 3974 subjects have been 
exposed to at least 1 dose of venetoclax across company -sponsored studies, as described 
in Section 8.0.  Of these subjects, 3962 are included in the overall pooled analyses for 
reporting Reference Safety  Information (RSI) ( Appendix A):  3610 oncology  subjects, 
255 healthy  volunteers, 12 from a study  conducted outside the venetoclax development 
program, 24 subjects with h epatic impairment, and 73 SL E subjects.  Of the 
2590 oncology  subjects, 3481 were adults in the venetoclax oncology  program (1183 in 
monotherap y studies and 2298 in combination therap y studies):  1639 with CLL/SLL, 
597with AML , 483 with MM, 572 with NHL , 144 with my elodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS), and 44 with ALL, 1 with rhabdomy ocarcoma, and 1 with Evans tumor.  The 
remaining oncology  subjects included 65 pediatric subjects in the venetoclax program 
(26ALL /LL, 29 AML, 1 NHL, 6 neuroblastoma, 3 other solid t umors):  5 received 
monotherap y and 60 received combination therap y.  64 subjects from studies conducted 
under another investigational new drug (IND) compounds outside the venetoclax program 
(52 AML, 11 NHL, 1 unknown).  An additional 1125 subjects with bl inded data have 
been treated with either venetoclax combination therap y or a comparator treatment in 
compan y-sponsored venetoclax oncology  studies.  Based on nonclinical and clinical data 
available with venetoclax administration, important identified risks are tumor ly sis 
syndrome (TLS), neutropenia, and serious infection.  Tumor ly sis sy ndrome is a risk 
associated with venetoclax treatment and it is highest in CLL and MCL.  Other adverse 
events commonly  observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, an d other 
hematological effects (including, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and l ymphopenia).  Events 
of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topenia are also commonly  observed with the 
underly ing hematologic malignancies.  Infections, including serious infections, a lthough 
also common with the underly ing malignancies, have been reported with venetoclax

treatment and their incidence is higher with combination treatments.  Co -administration 
with CYP3A inducers and inhibitors can cause changes in venetoclax exposure.  
Decreased spermatogenesis has been observed in nonclinical studies with dogs.  
Embry ofetal toxicity  was observed in nonclinical studies; thus, venetoclax should not be 
used during pregnancy .  In addition, as venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with R/ R 
disease who had previously  been treated with various cy totoxic agents, second primary  
malignancies are closel y monitored.  Following multiple -dose administration, the 
maximum plasma concentration of venetoclax was attained 5 to 8 hours after dosing.  The
harmonic mean terminal phase elimination half -life (t 1/2) ranged from 17 to 41 hours 
following a single oral dose of venetoclax.  I n subjects with CLL, venetoclax showed 
minimal accumulation, and steady -state AUC increased proportionally over the dose 
range of 150 to 800 mg.  Venetoclax has been administered with food in all clinical 
studies, as food increased the bioavailability  of venetoclax by  approximately  3-to 5-fold.  
Venetoclax is highl y bound to plasma proteins with unbound fraction (fu) < 0.01, a nd it is 
primarily  eliminated as metabolites in feces with negligible renal elimination (< 0.1%).  
Drug -drug interaction (DDI) studies of venetoclax with ketoconazole, rifampin, warfarin, 
ritonavir, azithromy cin, and digoxin were conducted to provide dosin g recommendations 
for patients concomitantly taking CYP3A and/or P -gp inhibitors, inducers, and/or 
warfarin.  Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy Chinese subjects and in 
Japanese subjects to provide dosing recommendations for those specific p opulations.  
Additionally , a dedicated study  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in subjects 
with hepatic impairment was conducted.  Based on the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, age, sex, race, weight, and mild and moderate renal or hepatic impairment do not 
have an effect on venetoclax clearance.
Updated data are described in detail in the Investigator's Brochure.25
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
Acute m yelogenous leukemia is characterized b y the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts 
in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and extramedullary tissues.  It is the most common 
form of acute leukemia in adults.  An estimated 18,500 adults will be diagnosed with

AML  in 2014 and 10,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.26  The median age of 
diagnosis is 72 years, with individuals 80 –85 years of age having the highest incidence 
rates.27  Elderly  AML is a biologically  and clinically  distinct disease with a diminished 
response to chemotherapy with low remission rates and short disease -free and overall 
survival compared to AML  that occurs in y ounge r patients.  Higher proportion of 
unfavorable cy togenetics, higher frequency  of antecedent hematologic disorders or prior 
therap y for previous malignancies, and more frequent expression of the multidrug 
resistance phenoty pe accounts for the poor outcomes a ssociated with current therap y.  
Additionally , the presence and severity  of comorbid conditions, compromised end organ 
function that enhance the toxicity  of induction chemotherap y, and functional incapacity 
all decrease the ability  for the elderl y patient to tolerate induction chemotherap y and 
survive life -threatening infections often associated with AML  therapy .28Several studies 
have demonstrated the benefits of active therap y over supportive care onl y, with respect to 
survival and quality of life, suggesting that treatment should be offered to all patients 
diagnosed with AML.29,30
3.1 Study Rationale
Currently , there is no consensus as to a single optimal therap y for older patients with 
AML  who are not candidates for conventional induction treatment though subcutaneous 
low-dose cy tarabine (LDC) is a common therapeutic approach.  A common approach that 
hemato- oncologists utilize to determine fitness for intensive induction therapy  is to 
conduct a thorough clinical evaluation including history taking, phy sical examination, and 
review of pertinent laboratory and clinical tests.  This "clinical judgment" approach was 
supported by  findings from a prospective study  of 157 subjects with hematological 
malignancies that found "clinical judgment" to be the stron gest prospective predictor of 
survival and was superior to formalized geriatric assessment without clinical judgment.31  
Another approach, suggested by  Ferrara and colleagues,32,33incorporates specified co -
morbidity  criteria in addition to clinical judgment.  Conceptual criteria proposed to define 
subje cts unfit for conventional intensive chemotherap y32are:
1. Advanced age (over 75 years)
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
32
2. Severe cardiac c omorbidity
3. Severe pulmonary  comorbidity
4. Severe renal comorbidit y
5. Severe hepatic comorbidity
6. Active infection resistant to anti -infective therap y
7. Cognitive impairment
8. Low performance status (ECOG functional scale)
9. Any other comorbidit y that the physician judges to be incompatible with 
chemotherap y
Low-dose cy tarabine is a standard treatment option for patients with AML who are 
ineligible for intensive induction therap y due to comorbidities.  I nitial studies from the 
Acute Leukemia Group B, over 40 years a go, reported that 15% –20% of patients with 
AML  receiving LDC at dose of 10 – 30 mg/m2achieved a CR.31  Subsequently, a meta -
analysis including 293 previously  untreated patients with newly  diagnosed acute non -
lymphocy tic leukemia reported a CR rate of 32% with L DC.35More recently , a large, 
international trial for newly diagnosed patients ages 65 years and older with A ML and 
poor prognostic features reported a combined CR rate (CR + CR with incomplete blood 
count recovery ) of 11% for those patients receiving LDC using modern and more 
sensitive methods to determine the depth of clinical response.30
Though LDC has been available for decades, the low response rate and associated short 
expected survival leaves a significant unmet medical need for patients with treatment -
naïve AML who are ≥ 60 with comorbidities making them poor candidates for standard, 
high dose, anthracy cline -based induction chemotherap y.  Single -agent clinical activity  
observed in other advanced hematologi c malignancies (Study  M12 -175) and AML  
(Study M14- 212), along with activity  demonstrated using venetoclax alone and in 
combination with cy tarabine in AML  cell lines and primary  patient samples, suggest the

possibility  of significant clinical activity  in AM L for the combination of venetoclax with 
LDC.  The clinical trial described in this protocol is designed to evaluate if venetoclax 
may be combined safel y with L DC and whether potentially  meaningful clinical activity  
can be observed.
3.2 Differences Statement
This is the first study  of venetoclax in combination with L DC for subjects with AML .  
Venetoclax was tested in Phase 2 trial (Study  M14 -212) in subjects with relapsed, 
refractory  AML or in a frontline setting in subjects who are unfit for intensive therap y to 
examine preliminary  activity  and safet y as monotherap y.  A Phase 1b/2 trial 
(Study M14- 358) was also initiated testing the combinations of venetoclax with either 
azacitidine or decitabine in subjects with naïve AML who are aged 65 and older and not 
eligible for intensive induction chemotherap y.  Clinical trials in other indications which 
employ  venetoclax monotherapy  include a Phase 1 clinical trial to ascertain the safet y, 
PK, maximum tolerated dose, RPTD of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory  
CLL and NHL (Stud yM12- 175) and a Phase 2 trial of venetoclax in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory  CLL harboring 17 p deletion (Study  M13 -982).
3.3 Benefits and Risks
Based on the venetoclax studies, the regimen is designed to escalate the dose of 
veneto clax rapidly  and safely  with a standard dose and schedule of LDC to optimize the 
opportunity  for achieving a response and enable close subject monitoring.  The dosing 
regimen will also enable interruptions and slower intra -subject dose escalation to target
assigned dose if rapid tumor ly sis is observed.  Based on the ex vivo testing of primary  
subject AML samples that has shown significant variability among subjects, initial signs 
of leukemia response may occur at different doses of venetoclax when combined with 
LDC for different subjects.
Venetoclax was administered to 32 subjects with AML  as monotherapy  in Study M14 -212.  
Safety  data from 28 (87.5%) subjects who experienced adverse events of grade 3 and 
above, showed the most common events being febrile ne utropenia (31.3%), malignant 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
34
neoplasm progression, (25.0%), hypokalemia, and pneumonia (21.9% each).  Serious 
adverse events were reported for 27 (84.4%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (9 
subjects), malignant neoplasm progression (8 subjects), pne umonia (5 subjects), 
abdominal pain, sepsis, urinary  tract infection, failure to thrive, renal failure acute, and 
hypotension (2 subjects each).  All other events occurred in 1 subject each.
Study  M14 -212 has completed with efficacy  data available for 32 s ubjects, the majority  of 
them (30, 94%) with R/R AML .  The ORR was 19% (6 of 32 subjects), with CR in 2 (6%) 
and CRi in 4 (13%) subjects.  Anti -leukemic activity  was observed in an additional 
6(19%) subjects.
For additional safet y and efficacy data please refer to the current Investigator Brochure.25
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated. Subjects receiving venetoclax may  be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected. 
Management of these adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/risk. However, based on the population and disease being studied 
and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially  
between stud y subjects and the broader population of subjects receiving treatment for 
AML , no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is expected.
4.0 Study  Objective
The primary  objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to assess the safet y profile, characterize 
PK, determine the dose sche dule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199) in combination 
with L DC in treatment -naïve subjects with AML who are ≥65years of age and who are 
not eligible for standard induction therap y due to co- morbidity  or other factors.
The primary  objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion of the study  are to evaluate the 
preliminary  estimates of efficacy  including the overall response rate (ORR), and to 
characterize the toxicities of the combination at the RPTD.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
35
The primary  objective of Phase 2 Cohort C is to evaluate the ORR for subjects allowed 
additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.
The secondary  objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion and Phase 2 Cohor t C are to 
evaluate leukemia response (rates of CR, CRi, PR, and MLFS), duration of response 
(DOR) and overall survival (OS).
Additional exploratory  objectives of both phases of the study  may  be evaluated to find 
biomarkers that may  serve as surrogates or predictors for clinical outcomes in future 
studies of venetoclax in AML .
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 1/2, open- label, non- randomized, multicenter study  that will evaluate the 
PK, safet y and efficacy of o rally administered venetoclax combined with LDC in 
treatment -naïve subjects with AML  ≥ 60 y ears old and who are not eligible for standard 
induction therap y due to co -morbidity  or other factors.  This study  is sponsored b y 
AbbVie in collaboration with Genen tech/Roche.
This study  will consist of three distinct portions.  The first portion of the study is a 
Phase 1, or dose -escalation portion, that will evaluate the safet y and PK profile of 
venetoclax administered with L DC with the objective of defining the MT D and generating 
data to support a RPTD.  A subsequent initial Phase 2 portion will evaluate if the RPTD 
has sufficient efficacy  and acceptable toxicity  to warrant further development of the 
combination therapy.  Subsequently, Phase 2 Cohort C, will evalua te the ORR for subjects 
allowed additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically 
indicated.
The study  is designed to enroll up to approximately  42 subjects in Phase 1.  For the initial 
Phase 2 portion, up to approximately  50 subject s will be treated at the RPTD and schedule 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
36
defined in the Phase 1 portion of the study.  Phase 2 Cohort C will enroll approximately  
20subjects.
All efforts will be made to adhere to these specified enrollment numbers; however, 
recognizing the acute nature of the disease, it might not be possible to deny treatment to 
subjects in screening for ethical reasons or maintain individual subjects on therap y 
sufficiently  long to evaluate safety  or efficacy .
Figure 1. Overall Study Design
Biomarkers (such as cy togenetics, molecular markers, characterization of Bcl -2 and 
associated proteins or ex vivo testing of AML subject samples) that may be predictive of 
venetoclax activity will be assessed throughout the trial and may  be used to enrich for 
subjects likely  to respond to venetoclax.
Dosing Schedule Overview – Venetoclax – Phase 1 Portion
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD) on Day s 2 through 28 of Cy cle 1 
of the 28 -day cycle.  Beginning with Cy cle 2, venetoclax will be a dministered Day s 1 
through 28 of each 28- day cycle.  Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with 
approximately  240 mL of water within 30 minutes after the completion of a meal, 
preferabl y breakfast.  The dose should be administered at the same time each d ay.  On 
days the subject is given LDC, venetoclax should be given prior to LDC.  The regimen is 
designed to escalate the dose of venetoclax in combination with L DC rapidly toward the 
target dose to optimize the opportunity for achieving a response and enab le close subject 
monitoring.  The dosing regimen will also enable interruptions, reductions (if necessary) 
and a slower intra -subject dose escalation if rapid tumor ly sis or other toxicities are 
observed.

EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
37
The initial period, approximately  one week, of ther apy until the target dose of venetoclax 
is achieved is considered the venetoclax ramp -up period (Day  1 through Day  4, 6 or 7 of 
Cycle1, based on the escalation steps in the cohort).
Dose modifications of venetoclax in the ramp- up period may  be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at risk for TL S or any  new adverse events > Grade 2.  Dose 
reductions must follow original dosing schema.  If the subject requires dose reductions or 
dose holds during the venetoclax ramp -up period, a discussion with the AbbVie m edical 
monitor is required.
To mitigate the potential risk of TL S,36subjects will receive TLS proph ylaxis prior to any  
venetoclax dose escalation in combination with LDC (See Appendix Efor specific 
allopurinol and IV fluid dosing guidance).  Subj ects will be hospitalized during the ramp 
up period, with confinement recommended to begin by  Study  Day  –1, and must occur b y 
at least Day  1, through at least 24 hours after completion of the ramp -up period 
(e.g., Day –1 through Day  5 of C ycle 1 based on t he escalation steps in Cohort C).  Tumor 
lysis sy ndrome prophy laxis will be initiated in all subjects starting at least the day before 
the first dose of venetoclax.  Refer to Section 6.1.8.2 , Management of Tumor Ly sis 
Syndrome, for the details on TL S prophy laxis, Appendix E–Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrol yte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Ly sis Syndrome for 
procedures to follow, and Appendix Hfor information regar ding how to recognize 
laboratory  and clinical TLS.
If a subject develops an y laboratory  changes suggestive of TL S within the first 24 hours 
after either the first dose or during dose escalation, venetoclax dose escalation should be 
withheld or the dose sho uld be reduced.  Dose reductions and dose holds during the 
ramp -up period require notification of the AbbVie medical monitor as do any  occurrence 
of clinical TL S.

Dose Escalation and Modification Guidelines for Venetoclax –Phase 1
During Phase 1, modifications in the ramp- up period may  occur based on tolerability  of 
the first week dose escalation in earlier dose levels.  I ncreases in starting dose and/or 
change s in the dosing increments may  be implemented.  The initial dose in subsequent 
cohorts may  be lowered based on the tolerability , including the presence of signs of 
clinically  significant laboratory  or clinical tumor ly sis.  Dose escalation to the target do se 
may then occur in smaller increments.  Decisions to modify  the ramp -up period will be 
made b y AbbVie following discussion between the investigators and AbbVie medical 
monitor.  Historically , subjects receiving treatment for AML are at risk for developin g 
TLS and accordingl y TLS is an AESI  in this protocol.  If a subject experiences clinical 
TLS while receiving protocol therap y, AbbVie's medical monitor and safet y team will 
review safet y data (both pertaining to the individual subject and in aggregate) to
determine if modifications to the first week dose escalation schedule or TLS prophy laxis 
are warranted.

Once 3 subjects are enrolled to a dose level, dose escalation or de -escalation decisions to 
the next designated dose level will be made after subjects have been evaluated to 
determine if each experienced a DLT during the first cycle of therap y or not.  This will 
typicall y occur 28 ± 14 days from the last subject within a cohort starting therap y.
Subjects are enrolled in cohorts of three, and the first su bject from the subsequent cohort 
should not begin their intended dosing regimen until it is declared by the sponsor that no 
DLTs have occurred during C ycle 1 of the previous cohort.  All efforts will be made to 
adhere to these specified enrollment numbers (e.g., cohorts of three); however, 
recognizing the acute nature of AML, it might not be possible to deny treatment to 
subjects in screening for ethical reasons or maintain individual subjects on therap y 
sufficiently  long to evaluate safety  or efficacy .  In the event that more than 3 subjects 
enroll into a cohort, onl y the first 3 subjects dosed and will be informative for defining the 
MTD.  Should more than 3 subjects initially  enroll into a dose level, subsequent subject 
data may  be used to replace initial subjects if an y of those subjects become non -evaluable 
due to non- adherence or other reasons.
For this trial, DLTs are defined as experiencing a CTCAE grade 4 toxicity , unless such 
events are in the common list of health events due to AML  (Appendix F), or not 
recovering platelets to at least 25,000/µL  and ANC to 500/µL  within 14 day s of the last 
dose of venetoclax unless such cy topenias are due to r esidual leukemia effect.  Should 
1subject experience a DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose 
level (a total of 6 subjects at this dose level).  Should 2 subjects at a dose level experience 
a DLT, that dose level is considered too toxic.  The dose level below the too toxic dose 
level is considered the MTD.  Additional subjects are then enrolled at the MTD to bring 
the total number enrolled at the MTD to 6.  If during this cohort expansion, a total of 
2subjects at this dose level a lso experience a DLT, this level would also be considered 
too toxic and the method continues thusly  until the maximal dose level is achieved where 
6 subjects can be treated through C ycle 1 and no more than one subject experiences a 
DLT.  Additional subject s may  be enrolled at the current dose level at the discretion of the 
AbbVie medical monitor, if enrolled subjects are not evaluable.  In addition, significant

adverse events occurring after C ycle 1 in previous dose levels and ongoing PK 
assessments may  inform dose escalation decisions and should such unanticipated 
occurrences necessitate a modification to the planned cohort dose assignments, decisions 
will be communicated in writing to all investigators.
Dose Escalation Guidelines
Number of Subjects with DL T Dose Escalation
0 of 3 Begin enrollment in the next dose level 
1 of 3 Enroll 6 subjects in current dose level
1 of 6 or < 33% DLTs Begin enrollment in the next dose level
≥ 2 of 6 or ≥ 33% DLTs Previous dose determined as the MTD or dose de-escalation
If a dose de -escalation occurs and < 33% of subjects enrolled experience a DL T at the 
reduced designated cohort dose, this dosing regimen will be declared the MTD.  If ≥ 33% 
of the subjects enrolled at the reduced designated cohort dose sti ll experience a DLT, dose 
de-escalation of the designated cohort dose regimen will continue to be explored.
The MTD will be defined as the highest designated cohort dose level (and corresponding 
ramp -up period regimen, if applicable) at which < 33% of the subjects enrolled experience 
a DLT.
Subjects should experience a DLT and/or complete at least 80% of indicated venetoclax 
and cy tarabine dosing in the first cy cle to be considered evaluable regarding dose 
modification decisions.
Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2
Once the MTD is determined, enrollment into the dose escalation portion of the study will 
end.  The dose level for the Phase 2 cohort will be communicated to all participating 
investigators prior to the start of Phase 2 enrollment.  Subjects from t he dose escalation 
portion of the study  are not eligible for enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the study .

Dosing Schedule Overview – Venetoclax – Initial Phase 2 Portion and Phase 2 
Cohort C
Once the MTD is declared, and the RPTD determined, a cohort of up to approximately  
50–100additional eligible subjects will be enrolled at the RPTD in order to further 
define the toxicity  profile and to estimate the efficacy  of the combination.
Subject s enrolled in the initial Phase 2 portion will receive the RPTD of venetoclax that 
will be administered orally  once dail y (QD) on Days 2 through 28 of C ycle 1 of the 
28-day cycle.  Beginning with Cy cle 2, venetoclax will be administered Days 1 through 
28 of each 28 -day cycle.  Cy tarabine 20 mg/m2/QD will be administered on Day s 1 –10 
of each cy cle.

Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
46
Subjects enrolled in Phase 2 Cohort C will receive venetoclax on Days 1 through 28 
of each 28- day cycle, including Cycle 1.  Cytarabine 20 mg/m2/QD will be 
admi nistered on Days 1 –10 of each cycle.
Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with approximately  240 mL of water within 
30minutes after the completion of a meal, preferably  breakfast.  The dose should be 
administered at approximately  the same time each d ay.  On day s the subject is given LDC, 
venetoclax should be given prior to LDC.  The regimen is designed to escalate the dose of 
venetoclax in combination with L DC rapidly  toward the target dose to optimize the 
opportunity  for achieving a response and enab le close subject monitoring.  The dosing 
regimen will also enable interruptions, reductions (if necessary) and a slower intra -subject 
dose escalation if rapid tumor ly sis or other toxicities are observed.
The initial period, approximately  one week, of ther apy until the target dose of venetoclax 
is achieved is considered the venetoclax ramp -up period (e.g., Day  1 through Day  4 of 
Cycle1 in Phase 2 Cohort C).
Dose modifications of venetoclax in the ramp- up period may  be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at risk for TL S or any  new adverse events > Grade 2.  Dose 
reductions must follow original dosing schema.  If the subject requires dose reductions or 
dose holds during the venetoclax ramp -up period, a discussion with the AbbVie medical 
monitor is required.
To mitigate the potential risk of TL S,36subjects will receive TLS proph ylaxis prior to any  
venetoclax dose escalation in combination with LDC.  Subjects will be hospitalized 
during the ramp- up period, Day  –1 through 24 hours post highest cohort dose 
(e.g., Day  –1 through Day  5 of C ycle 1 in Coh ort C).  Tumor ly sis sy ndrome prophy laxis 
will be initiated in all subjects starting at least the day prior to the first dose of venetoclax.  
Refer to Section 6.1.8.2 , Management of Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome, for the details on TL S 
prophy laxis, Appendix E–Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrol yte 
Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis S yndrome (TLS) for procedures to follow, and 
Appendix Hfor information regarding how to recognize laboratory  and clinical TL S.

EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
47
If a subject develops an y laboratory  changes suggestive of TL S within the first 24 hours 
after either the first dose or during dose escalation, venetoclax dose escalation should be 
withheld or the dose should be reduced.  D ose reductions and dose holds during the 
ramp -up period require notification of the AbbVie medical monitor as do any  occurrence 
of clinical TL S.
Option to Continue Venetoclax Treatment 
Subjects enrolled in either Phase 1 or Phase 2 portion may discontinue LDC but may  
continue receiving venetoclax once daily  as monotherap y for up to 4 years following the 
first dose of the last subject enrolled on stud y provided they complete LDC dosing, 
continue to tolerate venetoclax, have no evidence of disease progressio n, and do not meet 
any criteria for subject discontinuation (Section 5.4.1).  Additionally , should a subject 
discontinue venetoclax or LDC due to re asons other than progression or unacceptable 
toxicity , subjects may  be allowed to subsequentl y resume treatment with venetoclax 
and/or LDC upon discussion between the AbbVie medical monitor and the investigator.
For subjects that continue to derive benefit after this 4 y ear period, AbbVie will work with 
the investigator to evaluate options for continuation of venetoclax.  Approval of a subject 
to transition to monotherapy  and dose/schedule determination will also be based on 
review of other laboratory param eters and discussion between the AbbVie medical 
monitor and the investigator.
5.2 Selection of Study  Population

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
All study  procedures outlined in Table 3are discussed in detail in this section, with the 
exception of adverse event information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study data will be 
recorded on eCRFs.
Study  visits may  be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  This may  include changes 
such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit 
frequency  and timing of study  procedures, among others.  Additional details are provided 
in the subsequent section.  Every  effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects 
and site staff, while maintaining the integrit y of the study.  If visits cannot b e conducted 
onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, follow Table 3on how 
to proceed.
Procedures performed at Screening will serve as base line, unless repeated on Cy cle 1 
Day 1 prior to dosing, in which case the latter will serve as baseline.
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative in order to participate i n this study .  The IEC/IRB approved 
informed consent must be signed and dated b y each subject prior to undergoing an y stud y 
procedures or before an y prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to 
participate in this study .  Refer to Secti on 9.3 for details on obtaining and documenting 
informed consents.
Medical and Oncologic History 
The following will be collected during the Screeni ng Visit and updated prior to the 
firstdose of study  drug on Cy cle 1 Day  1:
●Complete medical history, including documentation of an y clinicall y 
significant medical condition
●History  of tobacco and alcohol use
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
65
●Detailed oncology  history  including:
○Histology
○Date of diagnosis of AML
○Any surgical procedures
○Treatments administered (including dates and t ype of modality)
●Detailed prior and concomitant medication usage including dates of usage and 
dosing information for all medications and supplements taken.
On Cycle 1 Day  1, any  additional medical history that is observed after signing of the 
informed consent but prior to initial study  drug administration and not considered related 
to study -required procedures will be recorded in the subject's medical history .
Adverse Event and Prior/Concomitant Medication Assessment
On Cy cle 1 Day  1, any  events observed from the time of signing of the informed consent 
but prior to initial study  drug administration will be recorded as a serious or nonserious 
adverse event, if con sidered by  the investigator to be causall y related to the study -required 
procedures.  At each visit, including the Final Visit and the 30 -Day Safet y Follow -Up 
Visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and an y changes from baseline will 
be recor ded on the adverse event eCRF.
All medications (prescription or over -the-counter, including vitamins and/or herbal 
supplements) will be recorded beginning with the Screening Visit and continuing until 
30days following the last dose of study  drug.
Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination (PE) will be performed at Screening.  A 
symptom -directed PE including weight changes will be performed at visits as outlined in 
Table 3.  Height will be measured onl y at Screening.  The subject should wear lightweight 
clothing and no shoes during weighing.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
66
Physical exams may  be performed up to 72 hours prior to or after a scheduled study  visit 
beginning with Cy cle 3, if necessary .  If the Screening PE is performed within 7 day s of 
Cycle 1 Day  1, PE is not required on C ycle 1 Day 1, unless clinically indicated.  
Clinically  significant changes from baseline will be documented in the source 
documentation and eCRF s as adverse events.
Vital Signs
Body temperature (oral), weight, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate will be 
measured at the study  visits as outlined in Table 3.  Vital Signs may  be performed up to 
72 hours prior to or after a scheduled stud y visit beginning with Cycle 3, if necessary.
Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subjec t has been sitting for at 
least 5 minutes.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, subject visits may  be conducted via phone or video 
conference.  In these situations, weight, blood pressure, vitals and respiratory  rate 
measurements may  be performed b y the subject or caregiver as needed.
ECOG Performance Status
The ECOG performance status37will be assessed at the study visits outlined in Table 3as 
follows:
Grade Description
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre- disease performance without restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a 
light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work.
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities.  Up and 
about more than 50% of w aking hours.
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of w aking hours.
4 Com pletely disabled.  Cannot carry on any self -care.  Total ly confined to bed or chair.

M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
67
ECOG performance status may  be assessed up to 72 hours prior to or after a scheduled 
study  visit beginning with Cy cle 3, if necessary .
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A single 12- lead resting ECG will be obtained at Screening, Final Visit, and as clinically 
needed.  The Final Visit ECG may  be obtained within ± 2 day s of the visit.
Electrocardiograms will be recorded after the subject has been in the supine position for at 
least 5 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to remain completel y stationary (no talking, 
laughing, deep breathing, sleeping, or swallowing) for approximately 10 seconds during 
the ECG recording.  While ECGs are being acquired, subjects and staff are prohibited 
from having devices (e.g., cellular tel ephones, fans, heaters, etc.) that emit radiofrequency  
signals in the room.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event this may  not be performed due to study  modifications related to the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, perform the 12 -lead ECG at the next earliest feasible visit or 
arrange to have an alternative acceptable local facility perform the ECG for the subject.
ECG Safety Review
Each ECG will be printed and evaluated b y an appropriatel y qualified ph ysician at the 
study  site (the "lo cal reader") who will determine if an y findings outside normal 
physiological variation are clinically  significant.  The local reading of the ECG will be 
used by  the investigator for subject safety assessments, including adverse event 
determination and mana gement, and decision on whether a subject will be discontinued 
from the study .
The local reader will sign and date the safet y ECG and provide a global interpretation 
using the following categories:
●Normal ECG
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
68
●Abnormal ECG – Not clinically  significant (NCS)
●Abnormal ECG – Clinically  significant (CS)
●Unable to evaluate
All local reader evaluations of the ECGs will be entered into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  If the global interpretation is Abnormal (NCS or CS), the local reader will 
provide furth er information (e.g., sinus brad ycardia, arrh ythmia).  The QT interval 
measurement will be documented in the eCRF only  if a "prolonged QT" is observed.  
Correction b y the Fridericia formula (QTcF) is preferred; however, correction by other 
methods may  be a cceptable based on discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor.  The 
original ECG tracing will be retained as source documentation in the subject's records at 
the study  site.
Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA)/2D Echocardiogram with Doppler
Assessment o f ejection fraction will be made at Screening b y either a MUGA (preferred 
method) or 2D echocardiogram with Doppler provided that such assessment would not 
inappropriatel y delay  therapy  per discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation 
will be mad e as clinically  indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.  
It is preferred that the same method of assessment is used for a given subject.
Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  will be done at Screening, at Cycl e 2 Day  1, Cy cle 4 
Day 1, and every  3 cy cles thereafter for response assessment until two successive bone 
marrow biopsies demonstrate CR then will be repeated if clinical evidence for recu rrence 
occurs.  Historical bone marrow aspirates at screening will not be sufficient, a bone 
marrow aspirate and biopsy  must be performed for study  entry  to collect mandatory  
biomarker assessments.  Flow cy tometry  may  be used to detect the presence of abno rmal 
cell phenot ypes (based on the inappropriate expression of myeloid lineage markers).  
Minimal residual disease status may  be determined, based on the phenot ypic markers 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)

detected in the screening sample.  Bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies performed as 
standard of care throughout the study  should also be captured on an eCRF.
Note:  For all study  visits after Screening, bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies may be 
performed within 7 day s of the anticipated Day  1 visit of the subsequent cycle.  Bone 
marrow aspirates and/or biopsies should be performed and resulted prior to drug 
dispensation beginning with Cy cle 4 Day  1 visit.
A sufficient bone marrow aspirate (biops y) must be collected for clinical assessment and 
predictive biomarker assessments.
Bone ma rrow aspirates and biopsies performed as standard of care throughout the study , 
typicall y because the investigator has suspicion for improved response or progression, 
should also acquire bone marrow aspirate for MRD detection and blood for serum and 
blood for mutational profiling (per Table 6) and also be captured on an eCRF.
Due to differences in standard of care bone marrow core biops y collection and a nalyses 
procedures amongst countries and individual sites, the core biops y collection will be 
considered an optional procedure for subjects enrolled at sites where aspirate evaluation 
with cy tometric and/or molecular diagnostics is considered standard of c are.  The aspirate 
samples should be collected for all subjects.
A sufficient bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy must be collected for clinical assessment 
(pathology ) performed by  local laboratory  as well as for shipment of a portion to AbbVie 
(or designee ) for biomarker anal yses as described in Section 5.3.1.5 .  The biopsy  
collection for biomarker analys es is only  applicable to countries/individual s ites where the 
procedure is performed as part of standard of care.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at all study  visits as outlined in Table 3for, at minimum, the 
clinical laboratory  tests outlined in Table 10.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23

Local laboratories will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory  
tests.  The principal investigator or sub -investigator, if delegated, will review, initial, and 
date all laboratory  results.  The laboratory  test results will be collected on an eCRF.  
Laboratory  normal ranges will be provided to t he AbbVie Clinical Team, as requested.
All local laboratory  measurements will be entered on the eCRF within 5 days of report 
availability , unless the report reflects a Grade 3 or 4 test result in which case the results 
will be entered immediately  on the eC RF within 24 hours of report availability .
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID- 19 
pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the stud y 
site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospital, 
or other facility .  Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation.  L ocal lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided the investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and 
discusses with the subject that there is no safet y concern for the subject to continue use of 
the study  drug in the absence of current labs.  The subject should be scheduled for 
laboratory  draws as soon as feasible from the scheduled visit.

a. At room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples 
potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The following special sample handling 
procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.
Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre -chilled tubes containing heparin 
anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma sa mples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.   Plasma 
samples must be prepared by centrifugation in a pre -cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be 
maintained in an ice water bath and analyzed for uric acid within 4 hours of collection.
For an y laboratory  test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers 
clinically  significant:
●The investigator may  repeat the test to verify  the out -of-range value.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
72
●The investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study, requires a 
subject to receive treatment, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding 
toxicity  management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse event.
Chemistry and Hematology
Chemistry  and hematology  will be collected at the following time points and as outlin ed 
in Table 3.
Starting with Cy cle 3 Day  1, chemistry  and hematology  may  be performed within 
72hours before or after the scheduled visit.  However, th ere is no 72 -hour window 
permitted for post -dose chemistry  and hematology samples collected during Cy cle 1 
Day 1, Cy cle 2 Day  1, or at the time of an y dose escalation.  Amylase and lipase are only 
required at Screening, C ycle 2 Day 1, and at the Final Visi t.  Refer to Section 6.1.8.2 .  If 
subject is taking rasburicase, the special sample handling procedure outlined in Table 10
must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation in the presence of rasburicase.
Refer to Section 6.1.8.2 , Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Ly sis S yndrome, for 
monitoring required.  If laboratory  abnormalities consistent with TL S are observed, see 
Appendix E, Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrol yte Imbalances and 
Prevention of Tumor Lys is Sy ndrome (TLS) for procedures to follow.
Coagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) samples will be 
collected as outlined in Table 3and as needed throughout the study .  Beginning at Cy cle3, 
coagulation may  be perfo rmed within 72 hours before or after the scheduled visit.

Urinalysis
Urinaly sis samples will be collected as outlined in Table 3and as needed throughout the 
study .  Beginning at Cy cle 3, urinal ysis may  be performed within 72 hours before or after 
the scheduled visit.
Clinical Disease Progression Assessment
Assessment of clinical disease progression will be made at visits as outlin ed in Table 3
and as deemed appropriate by  the investigator at an interval of no greater than every  
3cycles.  Subjects exhibiting disease progression should be discontinued from the study  
per Section 5.4.
Cytogenetic Assessment
Cytogenetic assessment will be done locall y within 3 months prior to beginning therap y.
Molecular Markers
Profiling of common genetic abnormalities in AML may  be explored at screening on a 
mandatory  screening bone marrow sample and sent to a central laboratory  designated by  
AbbVie.  Although this is not a complete list, the following genes are commonly  altered 
in AML  subjects:
●fms-related t yrosine kinase -3 (FLT3), nucleophosmin1 (NPM1), 
CCAAT/enhancer -binding protein alpha (CEBPA), I socitrate Dehy drogenase 1 
(IDH1), Isocitrate Deh ydrogenase 2 (IDH2), ten -eleven translocation 2, 
(TET2) and DNA meth yltransferase 3A(DNMT3A).
Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis
Tumor ly sis sy ndrome prophy laxis will be initiated in all subjects starting at least the day  
before the first dose of venetoclax and continued through 24 hours post the firs t dose at 
the highest administered dose level of venetoclax per the guidelines in Section 6.1.8.2 .

Subject Calendars/Diaries
Subject calendars/diar ies will be provided.  Subjects will be instructed to bring their 
calendars/diaries back to the site to be reviewed at each visit, including at any visit at 
which a dose level change may  be required.
Subjects will be instructed to record the date and time each dose of stud y drug is taken, 
(indicating if an y doses of study drug are missed) and whether or not doses were taken 
within 30 minutes after the completion of a meal (preferabl y breakfast).
Subjects will also be instructed to record adverse events and concomitant medications in 
the subject calendars/diaries.
The calendars/diaries are to be reviewed at each visit and relevant pages are to be 
photocopied by  study  staff.  By  the end of the subject's participation in the study , the 
calendars/diaries are to be returned to the site and appropriatel y filed with the subject's 
source documents for this study .
Enrollment and Assignment of Subject Numbers
An Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) s ystem will be utilized to register subjects.  
Once the subject has si gned the informed consent the site will obtain a screening (subject) 
number via the IRT s ystem.  Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not 
enrolled into the study , the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source 
document a nd will be captured in the eCRF.
The results of all screening evaluations must be within clinically  acceptable limits, upon 
review b y the investigator before a subject can be administered study drug.  Subjects will 
not be enrolled in the study  if laborator y or other screening results are unacceptable.
Subjects who complete all screening procedures and meet the eligibility  criteria in 
Section 5.2.1 andnone of the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2.2 will proceed to enrollment.

Post-Treatment Follow -Up Visit(s)
For subjects who discontinue study  treatment for reasons other than disease progression, 
the following post -treatment assessments will be performed every  12 weeks (± 1 week) 
until criteria are met for discontinuation from the study (e.g., disease progression, death or 
a subject's refusal of t he Post- Treatment visits) for a period of 1 year after last subject's 
last dose or possibly  sooner if all patients have discontinued and most patients have 
expired:
●Hematology
● Disease Assessment
Survival Assessment(s)
Survival information (e.g., date and cause of death, post -treatment cancer therapies, 
including transplantation) will be collected once the subject's disease has progressed via 
telephone calls (e.g., to subject or famil y member) and/or clinical visits at 12 weeks 
intervals (± 1 week) after the subject's last study  visit for a period of 1 y ear after last 
subject's last dose or possibly  sooner if all patients have discontinued and most patients 
have expired .
5.3.1.2 Confinement
Subjects will be hospitalized during dose escalation of venetoclax.  Confine ment is 
recommended to begin by Study Day  –1 and must occur b y at least Day 1 through at least 
24hours after completion of the ramp -up period for subjects in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 
including Cohort C.
5.3.1.3 Meals and Dietary  Requirements
Each dose of venetocl ax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 
30minutes after the completion of a meal, preferably  breakfast.

Subjects may  not consume grapefruit or grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including 
marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within the 3 -day period prior to the 
first study  drug administration and until the last day of treatment is completed due to 
possible CYP3A mediated metabolic interaction.
5.3.1.4 Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic A nalysis
A 4 mL  whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected on C ycle 1 Day 1, 
Cycle4 Day  1, and the Final Visit.  The sample collection tubes will minimally  be labeled 
with "PG- DNA," protocol number, visit, and subject number.  Pharmacogenetic collection 
should occur unless precluded by local or national regulations or policies.  AbbVie will 
store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect 
confidentiality .  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or drugs of 
this class) continues but no longer than 20 years.  Sample collection and shipping 
information are detailed in the most current version of Study  M14 -387 Laboratory  Manual.

metabolite(s) may  be determined with either validated or non -validated me thods.  Plasma 
concentrations of cy tarabine will be determined at an external lab using a validated 
method under the supervision of the Drug Anal ysis Department at AbbVie. 
5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
Efficacy Assessments
Responses will be evaluated based on the revised guidelines b y the International Working 
Group (IWG) for AML.38  As a significant number of th e subjects in this study  might 
have antecedent hematologic illnesses, hematologic response will also be evaluated.  
Transfusion dependence is defined as having received ≥ 2 units of RBCs and or platelets 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
83
within 8 weeks prior to study  treatment.  Duration o f Response will be measured from the 
time when all response criteria are first met until recurrent or progressive disease is 
documented.
Criteria for Evaluation is as follows:
●CR:  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 103/µL, platelets ≥ 105/µL, red cell 
transfusio n independence, and bone marrow with < 5% blasts.
●CRi:  bone marrow with < 5% blasts, and peripheral neutrophils of <103/µL or 
platelets < 105/µL.
●PR:  all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% 
in the percentage of blasts t o 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate.
●MLFS:  less than 5% blasts in an aspirate and/or bone marrow core sample. 
There should be no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary 
disease. The presence of a unique phenot ype (b y flow cy tometry ) identical to 
what was found in the pretrea tment specimen (e.g., CD34, CD7 coexpression) 
should be viewed as persistence of leukemia.
●RD:  failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR; only  including subjects surviving at least 
7 day s following completion of initial treatment cycle, with evidence of 
persistent leukemia b y blood and/or bone marrow examination.
●PD:  one or more of the following:  ≥ 50% decrement from maximum response 
levels in neutrophils or platelets, a reduction in hemoglobin by at least 2 g/dL , 
or transfusion dependence,* not due to other toxicities and bone marrow blast 
≥5%.
In addition to the response determination using the above I WG AML response criteria, 
each subject will also be evaluated for hematologic response and complete remission with 
partial hematologic recovery  (CRh).
●HR:  improvement in peripheral blood counts with all of the following:  fewer 
absolute peripheral blood blasts than prior to initiating study treatment for 
subjects presenting with peripheral blood blasts, ANC ≥ 500 (cells /μL), 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
84
platelets ≥ 0.25 × 105(platelets/μL ), and no more than 2 units of packed red 
blood cells within a 28 -day period.
●CRh:  all of the following criteria are met:  Bone marrow with < 5% blasts, 
peripheral neutrophils of ≥ 0.5 × 103/µL, and peripheral pla telets 
≥0.5×105/µL**
* Transfusion independence is defined as the absence of any RBC or platelet transfusion during any consecutive 
8weeks during the treatment period.39
** For a bone marrow sample collected before the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results collected 
from the date of bone marrow sample collection up to Day 1 of a sub sequent cycle of study treatment will be used 
for CRh analysis.  For a bone marrow sample collected during or after the last cycle of study treatment, the 
hematology lab results collected within 14 days after bone marrow sample collection date will be used for CRh 
analysis.
Reporting of Results
All dosed subjects will be assessed for response to treatment based on the published 
guidelines.  Assessments will be performed at Cycle 2 Day  1, C ycle 4 Day 1, and every 
3cycles thereafter for response assessment until two successive bone marrow samples 
document a CR.  When additional bone marrow evaluations are routinel y indicated for 
clinical management, additional collection of bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood 
are strongl y encouraged as these findings h ave the potential to define either remission 
status or potential progression of leukemia.  NOTE:  For subjects who achieve CR or CRi, 
MRD status may  be determined.
Subjects will be assigned to one disease state for best I WG response assessment, 
achievement of protocol defined hematologic response, and minimal residual disease 
positivity  at the time of the best response.
5.3.4 Safety  Variables
The following safet y evaluations will be performed during the stud y:  adverse event 
monitoring and vital signs, phy sical e xamination, ECG and laboratory  tests assessments.

M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23

5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
For the intensive PK days of venetoclax, values for the PK parameters including the 
maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max(peak time, T max), the 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from 0 to the time of the last 
measurable concentration (AUC t) and AUC over a 24 -hour dose interval (AUC 0-24) will 
be determined using noncompartmental methods.  For the intensive PK day s of cy tarabine, 
values for the PK parameters includi ng C max, Tmax, half -life (t 1/2), AUC t, AUC from 0 to 
the time of infinity  (AUC ∞) and clearance (CL/F) will be determined using 
noncompartmental methods. Additional analy ses may  be performed if useful in the 
interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic Variables
DNA samples may  be sequenced, and data anal yzed for genetic factors contributing to the 
disease or to the subject's response to venetoclax (or other study  treatment) in terms of PK, 
efficacy , tolerability , and safet y.  Such genetic factors may  include genes for drug 
metabolizing enzy mes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway , other 
genes believed to be related to drug response, or genes related to the disease state.  Some 
genes currentl y insufficiently char acterized or unknown may  be understood to be 
important at the time of analy sis.  The samples may  be anal yzed as part of a multi -study  
assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to venetoclax, drugs of this class, 
or the disease state.  The samples may  also be used for the development of diagnostic tests 
related to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The results of 
pharmacogenetic anal yses may  not be reported with the study  summary .
5.3.7 Pharmacody namic Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy  and response may  be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between drug concentration and disease status.  
Samples taken may  be used for the assessment of specific biologic markers, including 
proteins an d/or nucleic acids not currently known to be prognostic, in order to better 
understand the biology  of AML and disease prognosis, to predict response to treatment 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
86
with venetoclax, or to assess venetoclax activity.  Biospecimens collected during the 
course o f this study  may  be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific 
questions related to this study .  These anal yses are exploratory  in nature and may  not be 
conducted in GLP laboratories and may  not be included in the clinical study report.  T he 
samples may  also be used for diagnostic test development.  AbbVie (or a designated 
laboratory ) will store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality .  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or 
drugs of this class) continues but no longer than 20 y ears.
Reduction in subject leukocytosis or blast counts may be evaluated as a measure of 
pharmacod ynamics activity  to venetoclax.  Measurement of relevant nucleic acids and 
proteins (including but not limited to the Bcl -2 family  members) in tumor cells in the 
blood, pre -treatment, and at time of disease progression, may  be examined for putative 
stratification markers for correlation with efficacy.
For the stud y to be comprehensive, a determination o f whether the cellular context 
influences response to this drug will need to be made; therefore both subject bone marrow 
and peripheral blood collections may  be evaluated for a subset of the biomarker anal yses 
which are planned.  Overall, the goals of the biomarker anal yses described in this section 
are to 1) determine the relationship between drug concentration and disease status 
(pharmacod ynamics) and 2) identify responsive subject populations (based on subject 
characteristics at baseline and relapse).
Venetoclax inhibits the ability  of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by  
blocking the activity  of the anti -apoptotic protein Bcl -2.  Preclinical studies have 
demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax based on the levels of Bcl -2 family  
proteins.  High levels of Bcl -2 and low levels of Mcl -1 and Bcl -XLare generall y 
predictive of response to this drug in vitro.  The measurement of relevant DNA, RNA and 
proteins (including those in the Bcl -2 family  and those related to AML disease biology )in 
leukemic blood and bone marrow as well as serum and protein may be examined 
pre-treatment, on therapy, and at the time of progression for putative stratification markers 
and correlation with efficacy .  In addition, blood and bone marrow samples will be

M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
87
collected and may  be used to determine ex vivo sensitivity  of leukemic cells by  BH3 
profiling and/or b y treatment with venetoclax (I C50values) to evaluate if response to 
venetoclax can be predicted in vitro.  These methods may  be further used along with 
subject cy togenetics and mutational profile to enrich for subjects likel y to respond to 
venetoclax in the second portion of the study .  Based on the ongoing assessment of data, 
the criteria for subject enrichment will be defined.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from T herapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time.  In addition, the 
investigator will discontinue a subject from the study at an y time if the investigator 
considers it necessary  for any  reason including:
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject;
●The subject's response to therapy is unsatisfactory, as evidenced b y 
progression of disease while on study  drug;
●The subject experiences toxicities related to study  drug that require more than 
a 4-week (one cy cle) dose interruption of venetoclax;
●The subject requires more than two dose reductions, in two consecutive cycles, 
of venetoclax, in the absence of clinical benefit from the study  treatment;
●The subject requ ires radiotherap y or alternate anti -neoplastic agents during the 
study  period (with the exception of h ydrox yurea [allowed in first month 
only]);
●The occurrence of an adverse event that precludes further investigational drug 
administration;
● Noncompliance wi th the protocol.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the stud y, the reason(s) for 
the discontinuation from the study  and the primary reason will be recorded and a Final 
Visit and procedures listed in Table 3will be performed as soon as possible after 
discontinuation from the study .
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
88
At the end of the subject's participation in the study, the calendars/diaries are to be 
returne d to the site and appropriately filed with the subject's source documents for this 
study .
A safet y follow -up visit should be performed for all subjects approximately  30 day s 
following discontinuation of study  drug and then as clinically  appropriate for saf ety 
assessment.  The subject will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of any 
adverse event is achieved.
A separate safet y follow -up visit does not need to be performed for subjects who had a 
Final Visit conducted ≥ 30 day s after discontinu ation of study  drug and did not require 
additional adverse event follow -up.  If the subject refuses or is unable to attend the safety 
follow -up visit, this should be noted in the subject's source documentation.
Post-treatment assessment will be performed e very 12 weeks (± 1 week) until 
discontinuation from the study  (e.g., disease progression death or a subject's refusal of the 
Post-Treatment visits) for a period of 1 year after last subject's last dose or possibly  
sooner if all patients have discontinued a nd most patients have expired.
Survival information (e.g., date and cause of death, post- treatment cancer therapies, 
including transplantation) will be collected once the subject's disease has progressed via 
telephone calls (e.g., to subject or famil y memb er) and/or clinical visits at 12 weeks 
intervals (± 1 week) after the subject's last study visit for a period of 1 year after last 
subject's last dose or possibly  sooner if all patients have discontinued and most patients 
have expired .
Additionally , in the event a subject withdraws from the study , PD and predictive samples 
stored for long term (up to 20 y ears) biomarker research will also be destro yed.  In the 
event that destruction is not possible, they  will no longer be linked to the subject.  If the 
subject changes his/her mind, and the samples have alread y been tested, those results will 
still remain as part of the overall research data.  In the event of a subject's death or loss of 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
89
competence, the samples and data will continue to be part of AbbVie's re search, but will 
not be stored more than 20 y ears.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modification
During the COVID 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and contin uity of care.  Refer to the 
Section 5.3.1.1 , Study  Procedures and Table 3for details on how to handle study  
activities/procedures accordingl y.  Study drug interruptions due to COVID -19 restrictions 
should be captured in EDC.
The investigator should contact the spo nsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject 
from the study  for a reason other than "planned per protocol," to ensure all acceptable 
mitigation steps have been explored.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety  or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written n otice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
notify  the investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
If, in the judgment of the investigator and AbbVie, the continued exposure to the study  
drug represents a significant risk to subjects, the study will be stopped.  The following 
procedures for discontinuation will be followed:
If the sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the sponsor will promptly 
notify  in writing the investigator as well as regulatory  authorities of the decision and give 
detailed reasons for t he discontinuation.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
90
●The investigator must promptly  notify  the IEC/I RB and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation.
The investigator must promptly  notify  the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of the 
treatment regimen, if applicable, b y other appropriate regimens.
Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID -19 Infection
Decisions to delay  or interrupt an y stud y treatment based on the current situation and an y 
conc ern for active infection should be made b y the treating investigator after considering 
the subject 's current oncologic status and treatment tolerance, as well as their general 
medical condition. As a potentially  serious infection, consideration for treatm ent 
interruption is advised.  If needed, an y questions can be discussed with the Therapeutic 
Area Medical Director (TAMD).
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
Study  drug will be administered dail y as follows:
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with appro ximately  240 mL of water.  Subjects will 
be trained to self -administer venetoclax orally  QD within 30 minutes after the completion 
of a meal, preferabl y breakfast.
If vomiting occurs within 15 minutes of taking venetoclax and all expelled tablets are still
intact, another dose may  be taken and the second dose noted in the drug log.  Otherwise, 
no replacement dose is to be taken.  In cases where a dose of venetoclax is missed or 
forgotten, the subject should take the dose as soon as possible, ensuring the do se is taken 
within 8 hours of the missed dose with food.  Otherwise, the dose should not be taken.

and the relevant ethics committee
●Venetoclax can be administered b y the subject (or subject's caregiver) at home
●Subject agrees to have the venetoclax shipped directly  to their home
○Shipments may  also include other study  supplies (e.g., drug dosing diaries).  
Instructions will be provided by AbbVie as to how a study site can initiate 
a DTP shipment using Marken, a global vendor selected b y AbbVie to 
provide this service when necessary .  Shipments of venetoclax from the 
study  site to a subject's home will be appropriately temperature controlled 
(qualified shipper or temperature monitoring) within the labeled stor age 
conditions.  Signature is required upon delivery ; due to COVID -19 related 
social distancing, this may be provided b y the courier after delivery.  
Documentation of the shipment is to be retained by the clinical site.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Trea tment Groups
There is no randomization schedule for this study .  Subjects will be assigned at screening 
a unique subject number via I RT sy stem beginning with 30101 for the Phase 1 portion of 
the study .  For the Phase 2 portions of the study , subjects will be assigned at screening a 
unique consecutive subject number b y an IRT s ystem beginning with 30201.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the dose for this study  is discussed in Section 5.6.4.  Venetoclax will be 
administered orall y once daily  (QD) on Day s 2 through Day  28 of C ycle 1 (28 -day cycle) 
for subjects enrolled into Phase 1 and the initial Phase 2 portion.
Venetoclax will administered orally once daily (QD) on Day  1 through Day  28 of C ycle 1 
(28-day cycle) for subjects enrolled into Phase 2 Cohort C.
Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with approximately  240 mL of water within 
30minutes after the completion of a meal, preferably  breakfast.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open -label study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will dispense study 
drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The stu dy 
drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.
An interactive response system (IRT) will assign every  bottle of venetoclax to be 
dispensed to a subject during the study.  Prior to each scheduled visit, site personnel must 
contact IRT for the next bottle number(s) for assignment.  AbbVie or its designee will 
provide specific instructions on the use of IRT.

94
To document compliance with the treatment regimen, subjects will be instructed to return 
all unused tablets and/or bottle s, even if empt y, and any other stud y related items as 
necessary , to the study  coordinator at scheduled study  visits.  Compliance will be 
monitored and documented by  the study  coordinator on the appropriate form.  The study  
coordinator will question the su bject regarding adherence to the dosing regimen, record 
the number of tablets and/or bottles returned, the date returned and determine treatment 
compliance before dispensing new study drug to the subject.  Compliance below 80% 
may require counseling of the subject b y study site personnel.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt or sim ilar document.  The investigator or his/her designated 
representatives will administer study  drug only to subjects enrolled in the study.  A 
current (running) and accurate inventory of stud y drug will be kept by  the investigator and 
will include shipping i nvoices and the date on which study  drug is dispensed to the 
subject.  An overall accountability  of the study  drug will be performed and verified b y the 
AbbVie monitor throughout the study  and at the study  site closeout visit.  Upon 
completion or termination of the study , all original containers (containing partially  used or 
unused study  drug) will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie or 
the designated monitor(s).  If pre -arranged between AbbVie and the site, destruction of 
used and u nused venetoclax bottles will be performed at the site.  Empty containers will 
be destro yed at the site.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
Low-dose cy tarabine is a commonly  prescribed treatment within the United States for 
subjects who fulfill the entry  criteria of this study .  Venetoclax is undergoing testing in 
other clinical trials as a single -agent treatment for AML and in combination with other 
standard AML treatments.  The ongoing single -agent study , Study  M14 -212, has 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
95
demonstrated that venetoclax has anti -leukemia activity  for subjects with relapsed or 
refractory  AML and therefore may  be efficacious for subjects with previously  untreated 
AML .  This study  consists of a Phase 1 portion to define the MTD and generate data to 
support a RPTD for the Phase 2 portion.  The Phase 1 portion of the study  is a dose 
escalation phase which will consist of up to 42 subjects who initiate therap y with 
venetoclax combined with cytarabine.  In each cohort, a minimum of 3 and/or up to 
6subjects will be evaluated before making venetoclax designated cohort dose escalation 
decision.  A subsequent Phase 2 portion will enroll approximately  50 subjects who will be
administered venetoclax at the RPTD and schedule defined in the Phase 1 portion of the 
study .  An additional Phase 2 cohort, Cohort C, will evaluate if the ORR for subjects 
enrolled with modified entry  criteria and allowing additional supportive medicatio ns 
(strong CYP3A inhibitors) is substantially  different than the ORR observed for subjects 
enrolled under the prior entry criteria in Phases 1 and 2.  There are no direct control 
groups in this study  although a recent historical control cohort of treatment naïve subjects 
age 65 and older with AML  receiving LDC reported an 11% ORR utilizing the same 
response definitions.30
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard PK, statistical, clinical and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .  
The efficacy  measurements in this study  are standard and validated.
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
Subjects who have histological confirmation of acute my elogenous leukemia who are 
treatment -naïve, greater than or equal to 60 y ears of age, and who are not eligible for 
standard induction therapy due to co -morbidity  or other factors will be selected to 
participate in this study .
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
In the initial Phase 1 trial (Study  M12 -175) evaluating venetoclax monotherapy  in 
subjects with CLL and NHL , the most significant toxicity  was TLS in CLL subjects 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
96
during the initiation of dosing.  Reductions in circulating CLL cells and electroly te 
changes consistent with tumor ly sis have been observed within 6 to 8 hours after initiation 
of therap y, a time consistent with the T maxfor venetoclax.  To minimize the risk of TLS36
in Study  M12 -175, a dose titration scheme is being employ ed, starting at doses 
significantl y lower than the final target dose.  The re sponse in CLL is dose -dependent, 
with incremental reductions in circulating CLL cells observed at the titration steps.  Final 
target doses of up to 800 mg have been shown to be tolerable in subjects with CLL.  
Subjects with NHL have received target doses o f 1200 mg without dose limiting toxicities.
Few D LTs for subjects at venetoclax target doses (≥ 600 mg) have been seen and include 
2events of neutropenia and 1 event of febrile neutropenia.
Preclinical studies evaluating the activity of venetoclax ex vivo in primary AML  subject 
samples have shown sensitivities similar to those seen in primary CLL samples.  Ex vivo 
sensitivity  even greater than that in CLL cells has been observed in a small fraction of the 
primary  AML cells with IC50 values < 1 nM.8Based on these data, rapid tumor ly sis of 
AML  may  occur upon initiation of dosing with venetoclax.  Therefo re, a dose titration 
scheme based on that being used in CLL studies will be utilized in this study .  The 
escalation steps are similar, but the timeline has been condensed due to more acute nature 
of AML versus CLL.  No serious or nonserious AE of clinical TLS have been reported in 
the Phase 2 study  of venetoclax monotherapy  in AML .  Phosphate and potassium 
laboratory  changes have been observed and managed using the TLS electroly te 
management guideline as described in Appendix E.
This combination regimen is designed to escalate the dose of venetoclax rapidly with 
LDC to optimize the opportunity  for achieving a response and enable close subject 
monitorin g.  The dosing regimen will also enable interruptions and slower intra -subject 
dose escalations to the assigned target dose if rapid tumor lysis is observed.  Based on the 
exvivo testing of primary subject AML samples that has shown significant variabilit y 
among subjects, it is expected that initial signs of tumor response will occur at different 
doses for different subjects.  However, the C ycle 1 Day  2 dose and the final target dose 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
97
are anticipated to be the same for all subjects with modifications to the regimen permitted 
to respond to signals consistent with antitumor activity /tumor l ysis.
Potential target daily  doses of venetoclax are 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg, 
1600 mg and 2000 mg for dose levels ( –)2 through 5 respectivel y.  Based on pote ntial 
dose limiting impurities, the dose of venetoclax for this protocol will not exceed 
2000 mg/day .
6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any  written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical characteristics, identity , qual ity, purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Sectio n 6.1.6).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.8.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the stud y.  The investigator will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom, severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relations hip of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of being associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse event s to be considered 
intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query , observed b y site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject 
will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.

6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relatio nship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not th e event is considered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity  
management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the conditio n for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event reported by a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of study drug i s administered 
until 30 day s have elapsed following discontinuation of study  drug administration.

6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse 
event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes 
with the activities of daily living of a stud y subject.  Disability  
is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor 
medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth 
is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
100
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Deaths related to disease progression will 
not be recorded as serious adverse events (see Section 6.1.3.1 ).
Hospitalization of a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospitalization or an additional criterion for 
seriousness other than hospitalization (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).  Additional criteria for defining TLS 
are in Appendix H.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with A cute 
Myelogenous Leukemia Study  Population and/or 
Progression of A cute My elogenous Leukemia
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study  population (AML) at some 
frequency  independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of the 
underly ing disease or condition under investigation (e.g., s ymptoms, disease progression) 
and events unlik ely to be related to the underl ying disease or condition under investigation 
but common in the study  population independent of drug therap y (e.g., cardiovascular 
events in an elderly  population).
These events are listed in Appendix F(Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with AML 
Study  Population or Progression of AML).
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes for this protocol.
Cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocy topenia) are part of the natural history  of 
AML .  Persistent cy topenias at the same CTCAE grade as at baseline are not to be 
reported as adverse events, unless they fulfill a seriousness criteria, result in perm anent 
discontinuation of a study drug, or the investigator had an identifiable cause other than the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
101
underly ing disease.  However, all laboratory  data should be entered regardless of whether 
an adverse event is reported.
Although exempted from expedited rep orting to Health Authorities and IRBs as 
individual cases, if an event commonly associated with AML  or progression of AML 
meets seriousness criteria (as defined in Section 6.1.1.2 ) it must be reported to AbbVie 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.  For deaths 
related to disease progression, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case repo rt form, but the death will not be expedited as an individual case 
safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Termin ology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0).40  If a reported adverse event increases i n severit y, the initial adverse event 
should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect 
the change in severit y.  The dates on the adverse events cannot overlap.  For all reported 
serious adverse events that increase in severity , the supplemental eCRFs also need to be 
updated to reflect an y changes due to the increase in severity .
For adverse events not captured by the Common Terminology Criteria, the following 
should be used:
Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by the subject (mild).
Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities (moderate).
Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and m ay be incapacitating (moderate to severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life threatening requiring urgent intervention 
(severe).
Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).

6.1.3 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study  Related Endpoints
6.1.3.1 Deaths
For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint.
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 6.1.5) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of AML  should 
be recorded onl y on the Study  Completion and Death eCRF.  All other on -study  deaths, 
regardless of relationship to study  drug, must be recorded on the Adverse E vent eCRF and 
immediately  reported to the Sponsor (see Section 6.1.6).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generall y, only  one such event should be reported.  
The term "sudden death" should only  be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and 
unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre -existing 
heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an 
unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the 
cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
death later becomes available (e.g., after autops y), "unexplained death" s hould be replaced 
by the established cause of death.
6.1.3.2 Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearl y consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underly ing disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study  and w ill not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
103
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors includ ing timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there 
is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there 
is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal 
relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the inv estigator has not reported causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by th e investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period
All protocol -related serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events must be 
collected from the signing of the stud y specific informed consent until study drug 
administratio n.
Serious and nonserious adverse events occurring after the stud y-specific informed consent 
is signed but prior to the initial dose of study  drug will be collected onl y if they are 
considered b y the investigator to be causally related to the study -require d procedures.
In addition, all serious and nonserious adverse events reported from the time of study drug 
administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration have 
elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported b y the subject.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 11.

6.1.6 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
investigator will notify  Clinical Ph armacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the serious adverse event b y entering the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site 
having access to the RA VE®system or if RAVE is not operable should be documented on 
the SAE Non -CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site or investigator being made aware of the 
serious adverse event.

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Supplemental study  case report forms should be completed in the even t of COVID -19 
related missed/virtual visits, study  drug interruptions or discontinuations, or adverse 
events (including capture of specific signs/s ymptoms of infection and testing results).
COVID- 19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the event meets the criteria 
for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the 
protocol and above.  The following COVID -19 related supplemental eCRFs should be 
completed (for both serious and non -serious events):
●COVID -19 Supplemental Signs/ Sy mptoms
● COVID- 19 Status Form
6.1.7 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to an AbbVie representative (Section 6.1.6
or Section 7.0) within 1 working day  of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy .  
Subjects who become pregnant during the stud y must be discontinue d (Section 5.4.1).
All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken throughout 
the study  and for 180 days after discontin uing study drug.  Male subjects should be 
informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by  their female partner.  
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected.  In the event of pr egnancy  occurring in the partner of an 
enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the 
partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy -specific information and 
the pregnancy  will be followed to outco me.

Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, s tillbirth or congenital anomaly  is 
considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the 
site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.8 Toxicity  Management
6.1.8.1 Definition –Dose Limiting Toxicity
Dose limiting toxicities (DL Ts) for dose -escalation purposes will be determined during 
Cycle 1 (4 weeks) of study  treatment.  Adverse events that occur after the first cy cle will 
also be evaluated b y the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor and may be 
considered as dose limiting.
Any of the following events, which cannot be attributed by  the investigator to a clearl y 
identifiable cause such as tumor progression, underlying illness, concurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication, will be considered a DLT:
●Grade 4 or 5 non -hematologic toxicity  considered at least possibly  related to 
the study  drug, except those listed in Appendix F.
●Grade 4 or 5 pancy topenia with a hy pocellular bone marro w and no greater 
than or equal to 5% marrow blasts lasting for 42 days or more.
Any DLT will require an interruption and possible discontinuation of venetoclax or L DC.  
Venetoclax and LDC therap y ma y be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity  grad e 
returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if Grade 2 at study  entry .
Any reduced dose level will be jointly  defined b y the investigator and the AbbVie medical 
monitor.  The dose may  be increased thereafter upon joint determination of the 
investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor.  This dose is not to exceed the highest 
tolerated dose level.  All decisions regarding continued dosing for individual subjects will 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
108
be medicall y managed by the investigator, per discussion with the AbbVie medical 
monitor, as appropriate.  These decisions will be driven by the definition of DL Ts as 
described above.
6.1.8.2 Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome 
(TLS)
There is a potential for TLS for patients with AML receiving induction therap y, especiall y 
for those with elevated pretreatment LDH levels, elevated leukocyte count, renal 
dysfunct ion, and deh ydration.  To mitigate the risk for TL S,36subjects will receive tumor 
lysis proph ylaxis, including h ydration (e.g., oral, intravenous) and treatment with an agent 
to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol, rasburicase).36,41
TLS prophy laxis must be initiated in all such subjects prior to the first venetoclax dose or 
first new escalated dose.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis and Management for Subjects Dose Escalated 
in Protocol Version 1 and Amendment 1
●Hospitalization recommended on Day  –1 and mandated by  Day  1 and for a 
minimum of 24 hours after an y venetoclax dose escalation.
●Nephrology  (or other acute dialy sis service) should be available on each 
admission per institutional standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available.
●An agent to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol) to be initiated at least 
24 hours prior to venetoclax dosing.  Treatment may need to be continued for 
up to 28 day s based on the ongoing risk of TL S development.  Subjects 
allergic to allopurinol must use a nother uric acid reducer starting at least 
24hours prior to venetoclax dosing or rasburicase on the day of treatment 
(prior to venetoclax dosing).
●Oral h ydration (at least 1 to 2 liters) starting from at least 24 hours prior to 
firstvenetoclax dose or an y dose escalation.
●Intravenous h ydration (target 150 to 200 mL /hr, as tolerable) must be started 
upon admission and continued during hospitalization as appropriate.  Urine 
output must be monitored.

●Chemistries on the first day of venetoclax dosing at 0 (within 4 hours prior to 
dosing), 4, 8 and 12 hours and each day  of a new dose at 0 (within 4 hours 
prior to dosing), 4, 8 and 12 hours.*
●Chemistries at 24, 48, 72 hours after receiving the first designated target dose.*
●Collection of samples for venetoclax P K assay  8 hours after dosing on each 
day of new dose.  The 8 -hour post -dose PK sample may  be collected up to 
1hour earlier or up to 20 minutes after the scheduled time, if necessary  to 
facilitate sample processing.
* Chemistry samples (calcium, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, uric acid, and creatinine) must be reviewed by the 
investigator real time and prior to the subject's next dose to ensure appropriate subject management.  Based upon 
the results, subjects may need further monitoring or may need additi onal post- dose labs.  Refer to Appendix E
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
[TLS]) and Appendix H(Tumor Lysis Syndrome Classification) for toxicity management guidelines and 
procedures to follow for TLS prevention.  If a subject meets criteria for clinically significant laboratory or clinical 
TLS, no additional venetoclax doses should be administered until resolution.
Refer to Table 10(footnote "a") for a special sample handling procedure that must be 
followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation in the presence of rasburicase.
Drug interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemica l 
changes and laboratory  TLS may  be allowed and will not require a dose reduction.  If the 
TLS has not resolved within 72 hours, then a dose reduction should be considered.
If TL S requires a dose hold or dose modifications, after resolution of electroly te 
imbalances ( Appendix E), venetoclax may  be continued at the same dose per discussion 
between the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis and Management in Phase 2 Cohort C –
Applies to Subjects Enrolled in Amendment 2
Safety  data from the 94 subjects treated in 3 AML studies demonstrated no events of 
clinical TL S; 40 subjects treated in the escalation phase of thi s study ; 32 subjects in 
monotherap y study (Study M14 -212) and 22 subjects in a combination study  
(Study M14- 387) using low dose cy tarabine.  Based on this data, simplification of TL S 
prophy laxis and management will be followed for subjects enrolled into Co hort C.

All subjects enrolled into Phase 2 Cohort C will need TLS proph ylaxis and monitoring.  
Below are the minimum requirements for TL S prophy laxis and management for subjects 
enrolled into the expansion phase.  All other prophylaxis and monitoring proce dures for 
TLS will be done as per institutional/regional standards:
●All subjects will be hospitalized on or before Day  1 of Cy cle 1 prior to 
administration of the initial dose of stud y treatment and remain in the hospital 
at least for 24 hours after reachi ng the final dose of venetoclax . TLS chemistry  
tests should be confirmed 24 hours after reaching the maximal dose of 
venetoclax.
●Administration of uric acid reducing agent, adequate oral and intravenous 
hydration while monitoring the fluid status of the subject prior to and during 
the ramp- up of venetoclax will be based on regional standards or institutional 
guidelines.
●Tumor Ly sis S yndrome chemistry tests to be drawn (calcium, inorganic 
phosphorus, potassium, uric acid, and creatinine) on the first day  of venetoclax 
dosing and each day  of a new dose at 0 (within 4 hours prior to dosing) and 6 –
8 hours post dose.* Add itional laboratory  assessments may  be performed, per 
investigator discretion, post -dose during ramp -up and up to 48 hours after 
reaching final dose if clinically  indicated.
●Abnormal chemistry tests should be corrected promptly .
●If a subject meets criteria for clinicall y significant laboratory or clinical TLS, 
no additional venetoclax dose should be administered until resolution.
○Prophy lactic r eductions of potassium, inorganic phosphorus and/or uric 
acid above normal range are recommended prior to beginning stud y 
treatment and continue based on the ongoing risk of TL S.
* Chemistry samples (calcium, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, uric acid, and creatinine) must be reviewed by the 
investigator real time and prior to the subject's next dose to ensure appropriate subject management.  Based upon 
the results, subjects may need further monitoring or may need additional post- dose labs.  Refer to Appendix E
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
[TLS]) and Appendix H(Tumor Lysis Syndrome Classification) for toxicity management guidelines and 
procedures to follow for TLS prevention.  If a subject meets criteria for clinically s ignificant laboratory or clinical 
TLS, no additional venetoclax doses should be administered until resolution.

111
For continued dosing of venetoclax, monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment, and 
manage abnormalities in serum creatinine, uric acid and electrol ytes promptly .  For 
subjects at higher risk (e.g., circulating blasts), more intensive measures should be 
considered.
Refer to Table 10(footno te "a") for a special sample handling procedure that must be 
followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation in the presence of rasburicase.
Drug interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemical 
changes and laboratory TLS may  be allowed and will not require a dose reduction.  If the 
TLS has not resolved within 72 hours, then a dose reduction should be considered.
6.1.8.3 Management of My elosuppresion (Cy topenias)
Venetoclax
Myelosuppression and the related adverse events (thro mbocy topenia, anemia, neutropenia, 
and febrile neutropenia) are common in both treated and untreated subjects with AML .  
Subjects with baseline neutropenia or have significant bone marrow involvement may  be 
particularl y at high risk.  If a participant achi eves a CR or CRi or is found to have a 
morphologicall y leukemia free bone marrow, and has Grade 4 neutropenia or 
thrombocy topenia, venetoclax should be held from Day  28 until ANC ≥500 –1000/µL  
and platelets ≥ 25 –100 × 105/μL.  At the investigator's dis cretion, subjects may  resume a 
subsequent cy cle of therapy  after a 2 -week interruption if the investigator believes the risk 
of AML progression outweighs the risk of further treatment before cytopenia recovery .  
Typically , if morphologic AML remains in the bone marrow, concurrent cy topenias are 
thought to be attributable to the disease processes of AML.  In subsequent cycles, if a 
subject in CR presents with new onset Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for more 
than 1 week, unless it is due to the unde rlying disease, venetoclax dosing may  be 
interrupted until ANC recovery  to ≥500 – 1000/µL or platelets ≥ 25 –100 × 105/μL per 
investigator discretion in consultation with the AbbVie medical monitor.  Venetoclax may 
be re -initiated at a lower dose per dis cussion with the AbbVie medical monitor.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
112
Administration of venetoclax in subjects with ly mphoproliferative disorders has been 
associated with clinicall y significant l ymphopenia (B and T l ymphocy te subty pes).  If 
clinically  indicated in AML  subjects treated in this study , anti -infective prophy laxis 
should be implemented at the investigator's discretion, including appropriate proph ylaxis 
for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocystis infections.  Potential for drug -drug interactions 
should be considered.  Pleas e refer to Table 1and Appendix Cfor a d escription of 
excluded and cautionary  medications.
If a subject is continuing to respond based on the bone marrow assessment beyond 
Cycle2 of treatment but has persistent neutropenia or thrombocy topenia venetoclax dose 
may be reduced as follows:
Table 12. Dose Reduction Guidelines for Management of Persistent 
Neutropenia or Thrombocytopenia
Venetoclax Dose/Duration Reduced Venetoclax Dose/Duration
600 mg daily × 28 day cycles 600 mg daily × 21 days with 7 day interruption
600 mg daily × 21/28 day cycles 600 mg daily × 14 days with 14 day interruption
600 mg daily × 14/28 day cycles 400 mg daily × 14 days with 14 day interruption
Standard Therapy:  Low –Dose Cytarabine
In a recent international clinical trial, subjects receivin g LDC experienced the following 
treatment emergent CTCAE grade 3 or 4 adverse events at a rate of at least 10%: 
thrombocy topenia 35%, anemia 27%, febrile neutropenia 25%, disease progression 22%, 
neutropenia 20%, pneumonia 19%, general ph ysical health dete rioration 16%, leukopenia 
10%.35  It is unknown whether the aforementioned adverse events are attributable to 
receiving treatment with LDC or were attributable to the underlying health condition of 
AML .  Complications of my elosuppression, including infections and bleeding, may  be 
exacerbated b y treatment with L DC.  During C ycle 2 and subsequent cy cles, L DC 
treatment may  be delay ed at the discretion of the investigator, if the subject experiences 
myelosuppression associated complications, such as those described below:
●Febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and ANC < 1,000/µL )
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
113
●Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection (i.e., requiring IV anti -infectives or 
extensive supportive care)
●Hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, genito -urinary , pulmonary  with platelets 
<25,000/µL  or any  central nervou s system hemorrhage)
Treatment with LDC may be resumed once the above conditions have improved or have 
been stabilized with adequate treatment (anti -infective therapy , transfusions, or growth 
factors).
Myelosuppression caused by  LDC is reversible.  Comple te blood and platelet counts 
should be performed regularly, as clinicall y indicated and prior to each treatment cycle.  
In the presence of my elosuppression or its complications, treatment with LDC may  be 
interrupted or supportive measures instituted.
LDC d ose reductions are not ty picall y recommended.  If a dose reduction is believed to be 
necessary  a discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor is required.
6.1.8.4 Management of Decreased Spermatogenesis
Based on findings in a preclinical study  of venetoclax, there i s a potential for decreased 
spermatogenesis.  Male subjects should consider sperm banking before treatment with 
venetoclax if they  are considering preservation of fertility .
6.1.8.5 Management of Other Toxicities
If other events occur that are related to venetocla x or LDC the investigator, in consultation 
with the AbbVie medical monitor, may  interrupt or dose reduce venetoclax and/or 
reference therap y, as appropriate.  Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when additional supportive care fails), that is related 
to venetoclax or LDC will require interruption and possible discontinuation of dosing.  
Venetoclax or LDC may  be reintroduced, but only at a reduced dose, (in consultation with 
the AbbVie medical monitor) if the toxi city returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if Grade 2 
at study  entry .
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
114
Subjects should be monitored for new onset hematologic toxicity and renal toxicities, with 
dose delay  or reduction as appropriate.  Please follow local, approved product label or 
applicabl e SmPC for monitoring guidelines.
6.1.8.6 Determination of the MTD
If a single subject within a cohort experiences a DLT, a total of 6 subjects will be enrolled 
and dosed at the same dose level.  If these additional subjects do not exhibit a DLT, dose 
escalation m ay proceed.  If any  of the additional subjects exhibits a DL T, then dose 
de-escalation may  occur to interrogate lower dose levels.  The MTD, if identified, will be 
defined at the highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 subjects or < 33% of (if cohort 
is expanded bey ond 6) subjects experience a DLT.
6.1.8.7 Determination of the RPTD
If an MTD is reached, the RPTD will not be a dose higher than the MTD and will be 
selected b y the sponsor based on the types of DLTs which occur and the MTD identified.  
If an MTD i s not reached, then the RPTD will be defined based on the safety  and PK data.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol.  The 
principal investigator is responsible for compl ying with all protocol require ments, and 
applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  I f a protocol deviation 
occurs (or is identified , including those that may  be due to COVID -19 pandemic ) after a 
subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory  
authorities (as applicable), and the following AbbVie Clinical Monitor(s):

M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
116
8.1.1 Baseline Characteristics
All baseline summary statistics and analy ses will be based on characteristics obtained 
prior to the initiation of study  drug.  Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable 
will be defined as the last value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of study 
drug.
8.1.1.1 Demographics
Age, height, weight and gender will be summarized with means, standard deviation and 
range.  Frequencies and percentages will be computed for the following parameters:  race, 
smoking history , and performance status.
8.1.1.2 Medical History
Frequencies and percentages will be computed for each medical history parameter.
8.1.2 Pharmacokinetics
8.1.2.1 Tabulations and Summary  Statistics
Plasma concentrations and PK parameter values of venetoclax and cytarabine will be 
tabulated for each subject, visit, and dose regimen, and summary statistics will be 
computed for each sampling time and each parameter.
8.1.2.2 Model and Tests
All analyses will be perform ed on the Phase 1 portion subjects only .
Dose Proportionality and Covariate Selection of Venetoclax 
The following anal ysis will be performed separately  on C ycle 1 Day 10 and Cycle 1 
Day 18 venetoclax PK parameters.
An anal ysis will be performed for dose -normalized C max, AUC 24, and other PK parameters 
provided that they  can be adequatel y determined from the data.  The model used for the 
statistical analy ses will include designated cohort dose level.  This may  be done by  
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
117
classify ing subjects by  dose level or, if appropriate, using dose level as a continuous 
variable.  Covariates such as age, bod y weight, body surface area, gender, and perhaps 
others that might explain some of the variabilit y in the population will be included in the 
model initially .  However, a covariate may  be dropped from the model if the regression 
coefficient is not significant at alpha level 0.10.  The natural logarithmic transformation 
will be employ ed for C maxand the AUC's unless the data clearl y indicate that other 
transformation or t he untransformed variable provides more nearly  symmetric probability  
distributions and/or more nearly homogenous variances across dose levels.  Within the 
framework of the model, tests that have good power for a trend with dose will be 
performed on the eff ect of designated cohort dose level.
Venetoclax Effect on Cytarabine Pharmacokinetics Parameters
A linear mixed effects analy sis will be performed for C max, AUC tand AUC ∞, to compare 
cytarabine PKparameters when co- administered with venetoclax (Cycle 1Day 10) 
relative to cy tarabine a dministered alone (C ycle 1 Day 1).  For C maxand AUC, the 
logarithmic transformation will be used unless the data indicate that the logarithm has 
significant non- normality.  The model will include effects for visit (Cy cle 1 Da y 1, 
Cycle1 Day  10).  To account for the correlation among visits, the repeated statement for 
the visit effect will be specified under SAS procedure mixed.  The relative bioavailability 
of cy tarabine co -administered with venetoclax relative to cy tarabine alone will be 
estimated and a 90% confidence interval will be provided for each of C maxand AUC.  The 
confidence intervals will be obtained b y the antilogarithm of the endpoints of confidence 
intervals for the difference of mean logarithms obtained within the mixed modeling 
framework.
Cytarabine Effect on Venetoclax Pharmacokinetics Parameters
A similar anal ysis to venetoclax effect on cy tarabine PK parameters will be performed on 
Cycle 1 Day  10 and C ycle 1 Day  18 venetoclax PK parameters.

8.1.2.3 Missing Values and Model Violations
All available data will be included the mixed effect analyses.  Data exclusion, if any, will 
be documented and justification provided.
Normally  distributed values of PK variables (C max, AUC, etc.) will be determined without 
replacing mis sing individual concentration values, simply  using the available data, and if 
necessary  doing the analy sis with some missing values for a PK variable.  However, if a 
missing individual concentration results in a value of a PK parameter that may be too low 
or too high to a meaningful degree, the value of the PK parameter will tentatively be 
considered missing.  In this case, a value for the missing individual concentration may be 
imputed so that an appropriate value of the PK parameter can be included in the analysis.  
The imputed value will be obtained using appropriate methodology that takes into account 
the individual characteristics of the subject.
If an outlier is identified and/or a pronounced non -normal probability  distribution is 
observed (after logar ithmic transformation for C maxand AUC), then a non -parametric 
analysis may  also be performed.  Such a model violation may  be identified by  graphical 
methods, measures of non -normality  (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) or other appropriate 
methods.  If the regime ns have unequal variances to the extent that conclusions might be 
affected, then approximate methods that allow for unequal variances will be used.
8.1.3 Efficacy  Summaries
Efficacy  will include analyses of ORR as defined by  CR + CRi + PR, CR rate, CRi rate, 
CRh rate, CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh rate, DOR, EFS, OS, the exploratory analysis of the 
proportion of for all subjects who achieve MRD negativity , the proportion of subjects who 
are transfusion independent post baseline, and the proportion of subjects who under go 
subsequent stem cell transplant.  Transfusion support needs will be recorded to define 
ongoing transfusion dependence.

8.1.3.1.1 Overall Response Rates
CRh (Complete remission with partial hematologic recovery) is a derived response based 
on bone marrow blast cou nt and hematology  lab values.  A response of CRh is achieved 
when the following criteria are met:
●Bone marrow with < 5% blasts and 
●peripheral blood neutrophil count of ≥ 0.5 × 103/µL* and
●peripheral blood platelet count ≥ 0.5 × 105/µL.*
*For a bone marro w sample collected before the last cy cle of study  treatment, the 
hematology  lab results collected from the date of bone marrow sample collection up to 
Day 1 of a subsequent cycle of stud y treatment will be used for CRh anal ysis.  For a bone 
marrow sample collected during or after the last cycle of stud y treatment, the hematology 
lab results collected within 14 days after bone marrow sample collection date will be used 
for CRh anal ysis.
CR + CRh rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or CRh at 
any time point during the study .  Subjects who never achieve CR or CRh or have not had 
IWG disease assessment will be considered to be non -responders in the calculation of 
CR+ CRh rate.
Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a CR, CRi, 
or PR at any  time point during the study  per the IWG criteria for AML.  Subjects who do 
not achieve a response of CR, CRi, or PR will be considered to be non -responders 
participating in the calculation of the ORR rate.
In addition, the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, the proportion of subjects who 
achieve a CRi, the proportion of subjects who achieve a CRh, and the proportion of 
subjects who achieve CR + CRi will be summarized.  The 95% confidence interval based 
on the binomial distribution will be provided for CR + CRh rate, ORR, CR rate, CRi rate, 
CRh rate, and CR + CRi rate.

8.1.3.1.2 Duration of Response
Duration of response will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response 
(CR, CRi, or PR) per the IWG criteria for AML to the earliest recurrence or PD.  I f a 
subject is still responding, then the subject's data will be censored at the date of the 
subject's last available disease assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, 
the subject's da ta will not be included unless otherwise indicated.  Duration of response 
will be anal yzed by Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data for all enrolled subjects who 
responded.  Median DOR will be calculated and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be presented.
8.1.3.1.3 Event -Free Survival
Event -free survival (EFS) will be defined as the number of day s from the date of first dose 
to the date of earliest evidence of progression or relapse, subsequent treatment other than 
stem cell transplant while in composite c omplete response (CR + CRi), or death.  If the 
specified event (relapse, start of subsequent treatment, or death) does not occur, patients 
will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Data for subjects without any 
disease assessments performed after the baseline visit will be censored at the date of first 
dose plus 1 day .  Event -free survival (EFS) will be anal yzed by Kaplan -Meier 
methodology .  Median EFS will be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median 
EFS will be presented.
8.1.3.1.4 Overall S urvival
Overall survival will be defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the date 
of death.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study 
visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever is later. Overall survival will be 
analyzed by Kaplan -Meier methodology  using data from all enrolled subjects.  Median 
time survival will be estimated and 95% confidence interval for the median time survival 
will be presented.

The proportion of subjects who undergo a subsequent transplant will be summarized.
8.1.3.1.7 Post Base line Transfusion Independence (RBC/Platelet)
Post baseline transfusion independence is defined as a period of at least 56 days with no 
RBC or platelet transfusion between the first dose of study drug and the last dose of study 
drug + 30 day s.  Post baselin e transfusion independence rate will be estimated as the 
portion of subjects who achieve transfusion independence post baseline.  The 
corresponding 95% CI for transfusion independence rate will be provided based on the 
binomial distribution (Clopper -Pearson exact method).
In addition, the baseline transfusion dependence rate, which is defined as the portion of 
subjects who received either RBC or platelet transfusion within 56 days prior to the 
firstdose of study  drug, will be summarized.
8.1.4 Safety
The safet y of Venetoclax and cy tarabine will be assessed b y evaluation study drug 
exposure, adverse events, serious adverse events, all deaths, as well as changes in 
laboratory  determinations and vital sign parameters.
Safety  analyses will be performed for all subjec ts who take at least one dose of study  drug.
8.1.4.1 Adverse Events
Analy ses of adverse events will include only  "treatment -emergent" events, i.e., those that 
have an onset on or after the day  of the first dose of study  drug.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
122
Analy ses of adverse events will not in clude those that have an onset greater than 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by  preferred terms within a 
System and Organ Class according to the most current MedDRA dictionary.42  In addition, 
the percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event at a NCI CTCAE Version 4.040
toxicity  grade, and relationship to study  drug will be provided.
8.1.4.2 Serious A dverse Events
Serious adverse events will be summarized using the same methods as adverse even ts 
described above.
8.1.4.3 Deaths
The number of subject deaths will be summarized (1) for deaths occurring within 30 days 
of the last dose of stud y drug, (2) for deaths occurring more than 30 days of the last dose 
of study  drug and (3) for all deaths in this stud y regardless of the number of day s after the 
last dose of study  drug.
8.1.4.4 Longitudinal A nalyses of Laboratory  and Vital Signs Data
Changes from baseline will be analy zed for each scheduled post -baseline visit and for the 
final visit for blood chemistry  and hem atology  parameters, as well as urinaly sis and vital 
sign parameters.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day, 
then an arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that 
subject's measurement fo r that day .  Post -baseline measurements more than 30 day s after 
the last dose of study  drug will not be included.  Subjects that do not have a baseline 
measurement or do not have an y post -baseline measurements will not be included.
8.1.4.5 Analyses of Laboratory  Data Using NCI CTCA E
Where applicable, blood chemistry, hematology  and ly mphocy te enumeration 
determinations will be categorized according to NCI  CTCAE Version 4.040grades, and

shifts from baseline NCI CTCAE40grades to maximum and final post -baseline grades will 
be assessed.
The baseline and final grades will be defined respectivel y as the grade of the last 
measurement collected prior to the first dose of study  drug, and as the l ast post -baseline 
measurement collected no more than 30 day s after the last dose of study  drug.  The 
percentage of subjects experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum 
post-baseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final post -baseline 
grades of 3 to 4 will be summarized.
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing NCI  CTCAE40grade 3 to 4 blood 
chemistry  and hematology  values will be provided.  All measurements collected, 
regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  drug, will be included in these 
listings.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
This is a Phase 1/2 study  where the Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation study  and the 
Phase 2 portion is a dose expansion study .
For the Phase 1 portion of the study, the sample size is dependent upon the dose levels 
utilized and whether toxicities require and allow enrollment of 3 or 6 subjects to dose 
levels.
For the initial Phase 2 portion, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled.  With 
50subjects, the 95% confidence intervals for estimation of ORR would have a margin of 
error not exceeding ± 15%.  Clopp er and Pearson 95% confidence intervals for expected 
observed rates for a sample size of 50 subjects are shown in Table 13.  With 50 subjects, 
an ORR rate of approximately 15% lower than the observed rate would be ruled out.

For Cohort C, approximately  20 subjects will be enrolled to assess the experience of 
dosing venetoclax with LDC to evaluate if the efficacy  of the combination is still 
consistent with that observed in previously treated subjects.  These factors include mor e 
objectively  defined criteria with a lower age limit, modification to the venetoclax dose to 
account for strong CYP3A inhibitors, and potential reduction in liver/kidney function 
allowed for enrollment.  With 20 subjects, the ORR and Clopper and Pearson 9 5% 
confidence interval are specified in Table 14.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, an y protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of 
subject information related to the study  (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and
any other necessary  documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
125
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  
IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to ICH GCP.
Serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated b y local regulations, 
will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencie s as 
required b y local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should 
promptly  provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports or any additional reports 
required b y local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect t he conduct of the 
study  and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing 
clinical study  conduct and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epid emic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified procedures, 
AbbVie may  engage with study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, 
maintain protocol compliance, and minimiz e risks to the integrit y of the study while 
trying to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative methods for 
assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data 
collection (e.g., use of a loc al lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational 
product and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.  
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
126
In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed b y local regulations and permitted 
by IRB/I EC.  Investigators should notify  AbbVie if an y urgent safet y measures are taken 
to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard.
Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appe ndix A.
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study  to the subject, 
and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any stud y-related screening 
procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the informed 
consent, and an y other signatories according to local requirements. A copy  of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the stud y, stored 
pharmacogenetic and pharmacod ynamic samples will continue to be used for research and 
analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using 
these samples, the subject may  request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once AbbVie 
receives the request, remaining samples will be destroy ed.  If the subject changes his/her 
consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of 
the overall research data.
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, it is possible that additional protocol modifications not 
outlined in this protocol may become necessary .  If this situation arises, in addit ion to the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
127
study  informed consent, additional verbal consent may  be obtained prior to these 
adaptations or substantial changes in stud y conduct in accordance with local regulations.
10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form

10.1 Source Documents
Source d ocuments are defined as original documents, data, and records.  These may 
include hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subject 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy  dispensing and other records, recorded data 
from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, and/or x -rays.  Source document data may  be transcribed onto case report forms 
(CRFs) as required.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropria te 
source document.
The investigator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC/I RB review, 
and regulatory  inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for e ach subject screened/enrolled in this 
study .  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study  to 
AbbVie and regulatory  authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study  are being 
collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) sy stem called Rave®provided by  the 
technology  vendor Medidata Solutions I ncorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC sy stem and the 
study -specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply  with Title 21 CFR 
Part11.  The documentation related to the valid ation of the EDC sy stem is available 
through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study -specific eCRFs will be 
conducted b y AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/he r own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the stud y.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -387 Protocol Amendment 7
EudraCT 2014 -002610 -23
128
be recorded b y investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the 
eCRF will be supported by  source docu mentation.
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make an y 
necessary  corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC 
system.  For an y correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodicall y for completeness, legibility , and acceptability  by AbbVie 
personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed 
access to all source documents pertinent to the study  in order to verify  eCRF entries.  The 
principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide 
his or her electronic signature and date to e CRFs as evidence thereof.
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, remote monitoring of data may  be employed if allowed 
by the local regulatory  authority , IRB/IEC, and the study  site.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC s ystem for the duration of the trial throug h a 
password -protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from 
investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study .  Data from the EDC 
system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the 
investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for 
the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality  Assurance
Prior to enrolling an y subject in the study, an initiation meeting will be held with AbbVie 
personnel, the investigator(s), and the stud y coordinators/project manager(s).  This 
meeting will include a detailed discussion and review of the protocol and essential 
documents, performance of study  procedures, case report form completio n and specimen 
collection methods.

Appendix E. Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
Abnormality Management Recommendations
Hyperkalemia (including rapidly rising potassium)
Potassium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L increase from 
prior value (even if potassium within 
normal limits [WNL])Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 1 hour STAT.  If further ≥ 0.2 mmol/L increase in 
potassium, but still < upper limit of normal (ULN), manage as 
per potassium ≥ ULN.  Otherwise recheck in 1 hour.
Resume per protocol testing if change in potassium is 
<0.2mmol/L, and potassium < ULN, and no other evidence of 
tumor lysis.
At discretion of investigator, may recheck prior to 
hospitalization.  If stable or decreased, and still within normal 
limits (WNL), hospital ization is at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine must be rechecked within 24 hours.
Potassium > upper limit of normal Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry
Nephrology (or other acute dialysis se rvice) notification with 
consideration of initiating dialysis.
Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if 
there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life-threatening arrhythmias.
Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 1 hour STAT.
If potassium < ULN 1 hour later, repeat potassium, phosphorus, 
uric acid, calcium and creatinine 1, 2 and 4 hours, if no other 
evidence of tumor lysis.
Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L (6.0 mEq/L) 
and/or symptomatic (e.g., muscle cramps, 
weakness, paresthesias, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea)Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) assessment with 
consideration of initiating dialysis.
Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
Administer insulin 0.1 U/kg IV + D25 2 mL/kg IV.
Administer sodium bicarbonate 1 –2 mEq/kg IV push.
o If sodium bicarbonate is used, rasburicase should not be 
used as this may exacerbate calcium phosphate 
precipitation.
Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if 
there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life -threatening arrhythmias.  
Do not administer in same IV line as sodium bicarbonate.
Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine every hour STAT.

COVID -19 Coronavirus Disease -2019
DTP Direct -to-patient
Section 3.3  Benefits and Risks
Add:  new last paragraph
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated. Subjects receiving venetoclax may  be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected. 
Management of these adverse events will be mad e on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/risk. However, based on the population and disease being studied 
and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially  
between stud y subjects and the broader popul ation of subjects receiving treatment for 
AML , no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is expected.

If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID- 19 
pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory  testing at the stud y 
site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory  work done at a local lab, hospital, 
or other facility .  Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as pos sible.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided the investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results and confirms and 
discusses with the subject that there is no safet y concern for the subject to c ontinue use of 
the study  drug in the absence of current labs.  The subject should be scheduled for 
laboratory  draws as soon as feasible from the scheduled visit.

Study Title  An Open label, Compassionate Use Study of Tenalisib  (RP6530) in Patients currently 
receiving t reatment on Tenalisib trials in Hematological Malignanc ies. 
Study 
Sponsor  Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S .A. 
Study 
Rationale  Compassionate use provides an important avenue  for patients with life -threatening 
conditions to gain access to unapproved investigationa l drugs, biologics and medical 
devices. Currently, Tenalisib has been evaluated as an investigational new drug  in 
number of early clinical studies in patients with relapsed/refractory hematological 
malignancies . Tenalisib demonstrated acceptable safety and  promising efficacy in these 
patients .  
 
Since these advanced relapsed/refractory patients have limited therapeutic options , it is 
reasonable to continue Tenalisib in  responding patients  post completion of their 
participation in previous clinical studies . It is anticipated that Tenalisib would not expose 
patients to an unreasonable and significant risk or injury.  Therefore, t his trial is designed 
to offer patients benefited by Tenalisib and who completed study without progression an 
opportunity to continue Tenalisib as compassionate medication and followed up on 
treatment for safety and disease progression.  
Study 
Objectives  1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tenalisib as single agent or in combination 
until the withdrawal of subject from the study d ue to disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity or any other reason including consent withdr awal or 
investigator’ s decision.  
2. Time to disease progression   
 
Endpoints  1. Adverse Event s (AEs), Grade 3/ 4 AEs  and Serious Adverse Event (SAE s). 
2. Date of disease pr ogression.  
Study Design  This is an open label, compassionate use study in patients who have completed a clinical 
trial of Tenalisib sponsored by Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A. This trial offer s an 
opportunity to patients who have responded (either have CR, PR or SD on Tenalisib 
treatment) to receive Tenalisib as compassionate medication following their completion 
of previous study. Patients will continue to receive Tenalisib (schedule and dose) as they 
receiv ed in previous protocols , unless dose adjustments or delays are necessary fo r 
toxicity management .  
 
Trials evaluating Tenalisib as a single agent or in combination with other therapies will 
be part of this compassionate study protocol. The patients of these studies will be rolled 
over to compassionate us e study once the y complete  the participation in original study .       
No. of 
Patients  Approximately 50 patients  
Inclusion 
Criteria  Patients must meet all inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study:  
1. Patients must be currently receiv ing treatment with Tenalisib  either as monotherapy 
or in combination with another agent  on a previously approved protocol for 
hematological malignancies including but not limited to indications DLBCL, iNHL, 
PTCL, CTCL , CLL  and HL.  
2. Patients must have had at  least one efficacy evaluation following the initiation of 
Tenalisib in previous study and should have achieved either SD, PR or CR.  
3. Patients must have completed at least 6 cycles of Tenalisib in previous study  
4. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication . 
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                      Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 37 5. Female patients of child -bearing potential must consent to use two medically 
acceptable methods of contraception throughout the study period and for 4 weeks 
after the last dose of Tenalisib. A barrier method o f contraception must be included.   
6. Male pati ents must be willing to use adequate contraceptive measures throughout 
the study period and for 12 weeks after the last dose of Tenalisib.  
7. Willingness and ability to comply with trial and follow -up procedures.  
8. Willingness to provide new written informed co nsent.  
Exclusion 
Criteria  Patients must meet none of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible for 
participation in this study:  
1. Patient has been discontinued from their previous Tenalisib study 4 weeks prior to 
entering the compassionate use trial.  
2. Patient progressed while receiving Tenalisib therapy in his/her previous study.  
3. Pregnant or lactating woman . 
4. Inability or unwillingness  to comply with study and/or follow -up procedures 
outlined in the protocol . 
5. Concurrent condition that in the investigator ’s opinion would jeopardize compliance 
with the protocol.  
Study 
Procedure  Once rolled over to compassionate use study, p atients will v isit the study center every 3 
months until documented disease progression or treatment discontinuation due to 
toxicity or  consent withdrawal. During these visits, Tenalisib will be dispensed and 
medication compliance will be monitored. In case of roll over  from a combination study, 
the investigator has a choice to continue with the combination therapy or to maintain the 
patient on Tenalisib monotherapy. If combination agent is continued, it will be 
administered as a part of SOC.  
Safety and efficacy assessm ents will be done as mentioned below.  
• Safety assessments:  Safety assessments will be done during these visits and AEs 
will be reported as required by the protocol. There  are no specific safety labs or 
evaluations (including vitals, physical examinations, pregnancy tests and ECGs) 
required as per protocol. As par t of SOC, laboratory tests or other evaluations will 
be done pe r Investigator’s discretion. Adverse events (AEs, SAEs and deaths) will 
be recorded and reported until 30 calendar days after last dose or until a new anti -
cancer treatment is initiated, whiche ver is earlier. After this period, only AEs, SAEs, 
or deaths as sessed by the investigator as treatment related are to be reported.  
• Efficacy assessments:  Disease assessments should be performed as part of SOC.  
Date of disease progression will be re corded in the CRF.  
• Drug dispensing:  Patients will be given drug supply of 3 months.   
Estimated 
Study 
duration  Approximately 5 years  
Assessment of 
Response   Efficacy evaluations will be performed as per physician’s discretion as part of SOC . 
These evaluations (e.g. measurement of lymph node, mSWAT)  will not be re corded in 
CRF, however the date of disease progression will be reported.  
Study 
Treatment  
 Patients showing clinical benefit will continue to receive Tenalisib as they are currently 
receiving in previous  protocols. The treatment plan will be the same dosing schedule  
unless dose adjustments or delays are necessary for toxicity m anagement. In case of roll 
over from a combination study, the investigator has a choice to continue with the 
combination therapy or to maintain the patient on Tenalisib monotherapy . If combinat ion 
agent is continued, it will be administered as a part of SOC.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 37 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
 
1.1 Tenalisib ( RP6530 ) 
The phosphoinositide -3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular 
functions, including cell proliferation  and survival, cell differentiation, intrace llular 
trafficking and immunity.  Tenalisib  is a highly specific and orally available dual PI3K δ/γ 
inhibitor with nano-molar inhibitory potency and several fold selectivity over α and β PI3K 
isoforms. The specificity of Tenalisib  towards PI3K δ and γ is evidenced by >1000 and >100 
fold selectivity over α and β isoforms in an enzyme based a ssay. Chemically, Tenalisib  is an 
iso-flavone substituted adenine.  Refer to Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed 
background information on Tenalisib .1  
 
1.2 Summary of Clinical Evaluation  
In the clinical setting, Tenalisib  demonstrated a promising single agent activity with 
objective response rate (ORR) of 19.4 % (CR: 6.5% and PR: 12.9  %) in patients with 
hematological malignancies ; and 46% (CR: 8.5% and PR: 37%) in evaluable R/R TCL 
patients  with a manageable safety profile .1 Below is the summary of clinical studies of 
Tenalisib.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 37 1.3 Study Rationale  
Compassionate use provides an important avenue for patients with life -threatening 
conditions to gain access to unapproved investigational drugs , biologics and medical 
devices .2 Currently , Tenalisib is being evaluated as an investigational new drug in number 
of early clinical studies in patients wit h relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies. 
Tenalisib demonstrated acceptable safety and promising efficacy in these patients.  
 
Since these advanced relapsed/refractory patients have limited therapeutic options, it is 
reasonable to continue Tenalisi b in responding patients post completion of their participation 
in previous (original) clinical studies. It is anticipated that Tenalisib  would not expose 
patients to an unreasonable and significant risk or injury. Therefore, this trial is designed to 
offer patients benefitted by Tenalisib and who completed previous study without progression 
an opportunity to continue Tenalisib as compassio nate medication and followed up on 
treatment for safety and disease progression.  
 
1.4 Benefit and Risk  
It is anticipated that Tenalisib would not expose patients to an unreasonable and significant 
risk or injury. Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for subjects 
participating in this clinical trial may be found in the accompanying IB and  Informed 
Consent documents.  
 
2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tenalisib as single agent or in combination until 
the withdrawal of  subject from the study due to disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or any other reason inclu ding consent withdrawal or investigator’s decision.  
• Time to disease progression   
   
3 TRIAL DESIGN  
3.1 Trial End Point  
• Adverse Event (AE), Grade 3/ 4 AEs  and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
• Date of disease progression  
 
3.2 Design of Trial 
This is an open label, compassionate use study in patients who have completed a clinical 
trial of Tenalisib sponsored by Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A. This trial offers an opportunity 
to patients who have responded (either have CR, PR or SD on Tenalisib trea tment) to receive 
Tenalisib as compassionate medication following their completion  of previous study . 
Patients will continue to receive Tenalisib (schedule and dose) as  they receiv ed in previous  
protocols unless dose adjustments or delays are necessary for toxicity management.   
 
Trials evaluating Tenalisib  as a single agent or in combination with other therapies will be 
part of this compassionate study protocol. The patients of these stud ies will be rolled over to 
compassionate use study once they complete the ir participation in original study.

period.  Please note, patients will continue to receive the same dose they were receiving 
in previous p rotocols.  (e.g. If patient is receiving Tenalisib 400 mg BID while rolling 
over, he/she will continue to receive 400 mg BID dose in compassionate study 
protocol) . 
• Tenalisib  tablets should be taken at approximately same time eac h day.  Tablets should 
be swal lowed; and should NOT be crushed or chewed.   
• If a dose of Tenalisib  is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on same day with 
an interval of 8 hrs  between two doses. If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be 
repeated. If vomiting occur s, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.  
• Study drug compliance should be reviewed with the patient at the beginning of cycle. 
Missed doses  should be documented.  
 
3.4.4 Accountability of Investigational Products  
The PI/ designee is responsible f or accountability of all trial drug supplies (used/unused) at 
the site. The study monitor will verify receipt of investigational product at the site during 
monitoring visit(s), and will conduct an inventory of remaining clinical trial supplies at the 
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                                                             Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

monitor, sponsor representatives and regulatory agency inspectors /monitor  upon request.  
 
Following monitor verification, returned or expired trial drugs can be destro yed according 
to local institutional policy after sponsor approval . Certificate (s) of destructions must be filed 
at the site and in Trial Master File.  
 
3.4.5 Precautions and Risks associated with Investigational Product  
• Monitoring of liver enzymes and levels of TSH, T3,  and T4  in subjects receiving 
Tenalisib  is recommended  based on target organ toxicity . Patients should be monitored 
for increased ALT/AST,  skin rash /drug reaction , neutropenia as these events are reported 
with Tenalisib . Monitor patients for sig ns and symptoms of these events and interrupt 
Tenalisib  for Grade 3 or higher event.  In addition, enteritis (colitis), 
pneumonia /pneumonitis as these events are reported with other PI3K inhibitors .  
• Tenalisib  may cause  serious infections that may include s epsis and other infections. 
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and interrupt Tenalisib  for Grade 
3 or higher infection.  
• Tenalisib  elicit s no photo instability upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations. 
However, in absence of in  vitro d ata, possibility of photo -toxicity with Tenalisib  cannot 
be ruled out.  
• Tenalisib  demonstrated moderate to high inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymes. Therefore, 
concomitant administration of Tenalisib  with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. calcium channel 
blockers, warfarin , carbamazepine, macrolide antibiotics, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
terfenadine) may reduce clearance of these drugs increasing the risk of adverse events.  
• Similarly, as Tenalisib  is inhibited by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9, there is possibility of 
drug interaction with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. If concomitant 
treatment of these drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is 
advised.  Raised INR has been reported with concomitant warfarin administration. 
Therefore, use of hepar in or warfarin is generally avoided. Low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) is advised for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis.  
• Strong inhibitor or  inducers should be avoided as directed in Section on prohibited 
medication . Please  refer to the recent Investigator Brochure for additional safety 
information . 
• In absence of reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity data, the study participants should 
be advised to follow post treatment contraceptive measures.  
  
3.5 The Expected Duration of  Subject Participatio n and Follow -up 
The expected duration of subject partic ipation in the study is variable. Participation in the 
study will be continued until withdrawal of the subject from the study due to disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other reason inclu ding consent withdrawal by 
patient or investigator’s decision.  
 
Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study in the interest of patient safety, for non -
compliance with the protocol, lack of recruitment or any other administrative reasons. The

5 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
5.1 Administration of Study drugs  
Patients showing clinical benefit s (have achieved either SD, PR or CR)  will continue to 
receive Tenalisib as they were receiving in previous protocols. The treatment plan will be 
the same dosing schedule unless dose adjustments or delays are necessary for toxicity 
management.   
In case of  roll over from a combination study, the investigator has a choice to continue with 
the combination therapy or to maintain the patient on Tenalisib monotherapy . If combination 
agent is continued, it will be administered as a part of SOC.   
 
5.2 Concomitant Med ications  
• Antimicrobial  and anti-viral prophylaxis should be used according to local st andard 
practice; PCP and Zoster prophylaxis is strongly recommended.   
• G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used for the management of acute 
toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or at the discretion of the 
investiga tor. 
• Transfusions (blood/platelets) may be given, based on standard criteria and clinical 
judgment.  
• Patient may receive prophylactic anti -emetics at the discretion of th e investigator  if 
require d for a combination agent .    
• Patient may receive prophylacti c allopurinol, in case risk of tumor lysis syndrome.  
• Low doses of steroids are allowed if it  stabilized at < 20 mg per day of prednisone or 
equivalent .  
• Patients are per mitted to use of topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhaled 
corticoster oids (with minimal systemic absorption). A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of 
corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g. contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -
autoimm une conditions (e.g., delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact 
allergen) and also for the treatment of drug-related AE is permitted.  
• Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine can be given to subjects before treatment and while 
on therapy wit hout restriction.  
• If concomitant treatment of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 /CYP2C9  enzymes are 
clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient i s advised. Refer prohibited 
medication sectio n [Sec 5.3 ]. Use of heparin or warfarin for prophylaxis and treatment of 
venous thrombosis is prohibited.  Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is acceptable.  
• Patients sh ould be warned about the possible photosensitivity and advised to be careful 
with the UV exposure while on Tenalisib  treatment. Patients should be recommended to 
wear loose -fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure, in case they need to be 
outdoo rs. If sunburn like reaction or skin eruption occurs, patients should contact study 
physician.

phenytoin ). Patients should stop using these medications at least 7 days prior to C1D1.    
• Steroids  > 20 mg unless for management of toxicity.  
 
Discontinuation of patient who received concomitant/prohibited medication will be taken 
by the PI in consultat ion with medical monitor on case by case basis, after reviewing 
ongoing clinical benefit and risk. The decision to allow a patient to continue will be 
documented.  
 
5.4 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance.  
The following measures will be employed to en sure treatment compliance.  
Subjects will be asked to bring any unused study drug to the study center at their next visit. 
Site personnel will count and record the number of used and unused study drug tablets at 
each visit. The study coordinator will questi on the patient regarding ad herence to the dosing 
regimen, record the number of tablets and strengths returned, the date returned and determine 
treatment compliance before dispensing new m edication to patient.   
 
6 TRIAL ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURE  
 
6.1 Overview  
The Schedule of Events (Table 1 ) summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit and is divided into following :  
1. Screening (Day -14 to Day C1D1 ) 
2. On treatment procedures (C1D1 to EOT ) 
3. End of Treatment (EOT)  
4. End of St udy (EOS) (Day + 30 from last dose ) 
 
6.2 Screening  Procedure  
6.2.1 Informed Consent  
The investigator /qualified designee must obtain written informed consent from each 
potential subject or each subject’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in 
a clinical trial. Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature or by the 
subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature on a n IRB /IEC  approved  
consent form along with the dated signature of the person conducting the consent discu ssion. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 37 The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subj ect must  receive the IRB/IEC’s 
approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingne ss to co ntinue participation in the trial. The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or 
by the subject’s legally acc eptable representative’s dated signature.  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment of patient  
During the screening period, the investigator/designee will complet e the patient enrollment 
form  and submit to the Sponsor  for review and approval  prior to enrolling the patient in the 
study. 
 
6.2.3 Scre ening Procedure  
Medical history , ECOG status and weight will be taken. Information on prior medication 
use, prior therapies including Tenalisib treatment will also be obtained to confirm eligibility 
of the patient . 
 
6.3 Treatment and Study Procedure s  
Patients will visit the study center every three month s until documented disease progression 
or treatment discontinuation due to toxicity or consent withdrawal. During these visits, 
Tenalisib will be dispensed  and medication compliance will be monitored. Safety and 
efficacy assessments will be done as mentioned below.  
• Safety assessments:   
- Safety assessment will be done during the visits and AEs will be reported as required 
by the protocol.   
- Concomitant medications may be administered as clinically indicat ed.  
- A medication history should be reviewed at each clinic visit to assure no potential  
adverse events are noted.  
- There are no specific safety labs or evaluations (including vitals, physical  
examinations, pregnancy tests and ECGs) required as per protocol . As part of SOC, 
laboratory tests or other evaluations can be done per Investigator’s discretion. 
Adverse events (AEs, SAEs and deaths) will be recorded and reported for 30 calendar 
days after last dose or until a new anti -cancer treatment is initiated , whichever is 
earlier. After this period , only AEs, SAEs, or d eaths assessed by the investigator as 
treatment related are to be reported.  
• Efficacy assessments:  
- Disease assessments [e.g. radiological imaging (e.g. CT, PET -CT) or any other 
appropriate evaluat ion tool (e.g. mSWAT  in case of skin involvement )] should be 
performed as part of SOC.  These evaluations (e.g. measurement of lymph node, 
mSWAT) will not be re corded in the CRF , however, date of disease progression will 
be reported .  
• Drug dispensing:  
- Patients will be given drug supply for 3 months .   
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                     Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

(SOC), laboratory tests or any evaluations can be done per Investigator’s discretion.   
 
Foot notes:  
1. Depending on the feasibility, s creening /eligibility assessment and dispensing of the study drug can be done on 
same  day. Assessment perfor med in previous study (e.g. Medical history, vital signs demographics, Weigh and 
ECOG) can be used for eligibility evaluation . The first day of Tenalisib admin istration will be considered as C1D1   
2. Demographic profile will include age, sex and race.  
3. Medical  history will include history of cancer, past history of Tenalisib, no of prior therapies and prior medication 
(last 4 weeks); and other medical history. Any m edical significant history at subsequent visit will be captured as 
adverse event.   
4. Applicable onl y for women of child -bearing potential.  
5. Disease assessment may include evaluation of disease condition by r adiological imaging (e.g. CT, PET, PET -CT 
or MRI) or by any other appropriate evaluation tool depending on the disease condition (e.g. mSWAT in case  of 
skin involvement, bone marrow biopsy in case of marrow involvement). Disease evaluation will be performe d at 
the discretion of study investigator.  
6. The day of the last dose of study drug will be considered as EOT.  
7. Tenalisib will be dispensed in a HDPE  container having 30 tablets of Tenalisib. A 3-month  supply of study drug 
will be dispensed at each visit. In case of roll over from the combination study, the combination agent (e.g. Table 1:  Schedule of Events

study drug  or till new anti -cancer treatment is initiated whichever is earli er.  
10. All events that meet the definition of serious but, in the opinion o f the treating investigator, are clearly expected 
from the Patient’s disease or related to disease progression (i.e. there exists no reasonable possibility that they 
were caused by th e study drug) should be reported on the case report forms and do not requ ire expedited reporting. 
In addition, progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate method 
(e.g. CT/ PET) or clinically confirmed, should n ot be reported as a serious adverse event.  
11. Patients should be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after the last dose of study treatment  or till new anti -
cancer treatment is initiated whichever is earlier.  Telephonic follow up during this period is acce ptable.  All new 
AEs occurring during this period should be repo rted and followed until resolution unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the adverse event or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying 
disease.  
 
6.4 End of Trial Treatment  (EOT)  
The day of the last dose of study dr ug will be considered as EOT.  Reason of discontinuation should 
be recorded.  
 
6.5 End of Study (EOS)  
All patients will be followed for adverse events until 30 calendar days after the last dose of st udy 
drug or until new anti -cancer treatment is initiated whichever is earlier. Telephonic follow up is 
acceptable. In case of drug related AEs, further safety assessments will be performed as warranted, 
at the discretion of PI.  The patient will be followed  until resolut ion or stabilization of related 
adverse event.  
 
7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Adverse Events  
 
7.1.1 Definitions of adverse events  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which  does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.   
 
7.1.2 Recording of adverse events  
All adverse events should be graded as per the CTCAE v 5.0. and should be recorded in the case 
report form. All adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until 
resolution or stabilization. Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after the last 
dose of study treatment  or till new anti -cancer treatment is initiated whichever is earlier . All new 
AEs occurring du ring this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the 
opinion of the investigator, the adverse event or l aboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to 
improve because of the underlying disease. After 30 days of completion of protocol -specific 
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                     Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.  
Version : 2 .0, 15 October 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 37 treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment 
related  are to be reported.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Causality Assessment  
The causality assessment will be categorized as related and n ot related .  
• Related:  All toxicities should be considered to be related to Tenalisib  unless there is a clear 
alternative explanation.    
• Not related:   If there is no temporal association, or another etiology has been identified as the 
cause, or the trial tr eatment ca nnot be implicated based upon the current information.  
 
7.3 Serious Adverse Events  
7.3.1 Definitions of serious adverse events  
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life -threatening, require s at least a 24 -hour in -patient hospitalization or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect  or an important medical event.  
 
All events that meet the definiti on of serious but, in the opinion of the treating investigator, are 
clearly expected from the Patient’s disease or related to disease progression (i.e. there exists no 
reasonable possibility that they were caused by the study drug) should be report ed on th e case 
report forms and do not require expedited reporting.  In addition, p rogression of malignancy 
(including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate method ( e.g. CT/ PET) or 
clinically confirmed , should not be reported as a serious ad verse ev ent.  
 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in-patient hospitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported) : 
• Emerge ncy Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospice or skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respite care facility  
 
Hospitalization during the tria l for a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which is  
planned prior to entry in the trial  or planned in advance and not related to the study procedure/ 
drug), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the Sponsor.  
 
7.3.2 Serious adverse event reporting by Investigators  
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious  require expedit ious handling and 
reporting to s ponsor in order to comply with regulatory requirements. Serious adverse events may 
occur at any time from the signing of the informed consent form through the 30 -day follow -up 
period a fter the  last dose of study drug . Sponsor/sponsor representative must be notified of all 
SAEs, regardless of causality, within 1 day of the first knowledge of the event by the in vestigator. 
The SAE report should be sent to the sponsor/s ponsor representative via e -mail. Follow -up 
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                     Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.  
Version : 2 .0, 15 October 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 37 information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become serious should also be 
reported to Sponsor as soon as it is available. Investigators m ust report S AEs and follow -up 
information to their responsible IRB/IEC  according to the policies of the responsible IRB/IEC . 
 
7.3.3 Sponsor SAE Reporting Requirements  
Sponsor/Sponsor representative  is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the competent 
authority, other  applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance 
with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
 
Sponsor/sponsor representative is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or life -threatening  
events associated with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities 
via fax /mail  within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.   
 
The Sponsor will report all related, unexpected SAEs, including non -death/non -life-threatening 
related unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the trial medications to the FDA by a written 
safety report within 15 calendar days of notification. Reporting to the IRB/IEC  will be done 
according to institutiona l policy.  
 
7.3.4 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/ Congenital Anomalies  
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  Please 
refer to pregnancy section  7.4.1 for specific instructions.  
 
7.4 Protocol -Defined Even ts of Special Interest  
The following are events of special interest and will need to be reported expeditiously.  
 
7.4.1 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/ Congenital Anomalies  
Female patients of child -bearing potential (see Appendix A ) must consent to use two medically 
acceptable method of contraception throughout the study period and for 4 weeks  after the last dose 
of Tenalisib .  
 
During the course of the trial, all female patients of childbearing potential and pregnant partner of 
male subjects must contact the treating investigator immediately if they suspect that they may be 
pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating investigator).   
 
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant afte r the patient has been receiving trial 
drug(s), the trial drug(s) must immediately be withheld until the result of t he pregnancy test is 
confirmed. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(s) must be immediately and permanently 
stopped, the patient must  be discontinued from the trial, and the investigator must notify the 
medical monitor and Sponsor Representative as soon as possible. If a patient b ecomes pregnant 
while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form should be completed and mailed to the Sponsor.  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be monitored as outlined in Appendix A. 
    
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously descri bed pr ocess for SAE reporting. A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed and will need to be updated to reflect 
the outcome of the pregn ancy.

7.4.2 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as accidental or intentional administration of any dose of product th at is 
considered both excessive and medically important. For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be 
defined as any dose exceeding the proposed dose of Tenalisib  (e.g. > 800 mg  twice a day ).   
 
Symptomatic and non -symptomatic overdose must be re corded in the CRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the trial treatment that is symptomatic, and if not fulfilling a seriousness 
criterion, is to be reported to the Sponsor immediately as an AE . All symptomatic overdose, 
fulfilling a seriousness crite rion is to be reported as an SAE as per the SAE reporting procedure.  
For patients who experience overdose, treatment should consist of supportive  therapy.  A decision 
to interrupt treatment or dose reduction to be taken depending on the symptoms.  
 
7.5 Dose Mod ifications  
The dose modification should be performed for the drug toxicity or underlying disease conditions. 
Guidelines ( Refer Table 2  and 3) are intended to be applied when the investigator determines th e 
event related to Tenalisib. Please note t he dose modifications provided below should be used a s a 
guidance and should be determined as per PI’s clinical judgement.  
 
Patients may resume Tenal isib, provided that the toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤2 or bas eline  and 
there is n o clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression. If study drug is delayed >2 
weeks because of an adverse event, strategy of re -initiation of study drug should be  discussed with 
medical monitor.  
 
At the discretion of the Inves tigator, a dose re -escalation may be permitted for patients who 
previously had a dose reduction. Holidays from study drug are discouraged. Any patient in whom 
similar toxicity recurs at the reduced dose should be discontinued from further Tenalisib  treatme nt. 
Note: In e xception al case, a patient may be allowed following a careful asses sment of benefit and 
risk by the investigator and with approval from the medical monitor.

8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Efficacy evaluations will be performed at the physician’s discretion as part of standard of care 
(SOC) . These evaluations (e.g. measurement of lymph  node, mSWAT) will not be reported  in CRF , 
howe ver the date of disease progression will be reported.  
 
9 STATISTICAL METHOD AND CONSIDERATIONS   
The primary purpose of this study is to offer patients who completed a Rhizen sponsored clinical 
study without pr ogression the opportunity to continue to receiv e Tenalisib on a compassion basis.  
The safety and progression status will be summarized as appropriate. No formal sample is 
determined for this study and final sample size will depend on the number of patient s who 
benefitted and completed the Tenalisib study.  
 
10 ETHICAL, FINANCIAL, AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This trial will be conducted according to the sta ndards of Good Clinical Practice outlined in the 
ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline, and CFR Title 21 part 312,  World Medical Association’s Declaration 
of Helsinki, applicable government regulations, institutional research policies and procedures  and 
any other lo cal applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Rhizen  immediately. A serious breach is a breach 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely 
to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the 
study or the scientific value of the study.  
 The patient will be closely monitored until the QTcF <500 msec and the 
QTcF has returned to <30 msec from baseline. Immediate attention to 
potassium a nd magnesium and other clinical factors such as oxygenation 
and ischemia should be addressed.   
All cardiac events should be treated as per the local standard of care and 
referral to a specialist if clinically indicated. Any final decisions concerning 
dose modifications or permanently discontinuing the patient from study drug 
due to QTcF prolongation  will occur after discussion with medical monitor.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 37 10.1  IRB/ IEC Approval  
The trial documents (e.g,  protocol, ICF, IB, available safety information, patient documents, patient 
recruitment procedures , information about payments (i.e., PI payments) and compensation 
available to th e patients and documentation evidencing the PI’s qualifications ) should be submitted 
to the IRB/IEC  for ethical review and approval if required by local regulations, prior to the trial 
start.   
 
The PI/ Rhizen and/or designee will follow all necessary regul ations to ensure appropriate, initial, 
and ongoing, IRB/IEC  trial review. The PI/ Rhizen  (as appropriate) must submit and, where 
necessary, obtain approval from the IRB/IEC  for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes 
to the informed co nsent document.   Investigators will be advised by Rhizen /designee whether an 
amendment is considered substantial or non -substantial and whether it requires submission for 
approval or notification only to an IRB/IEC . 
 
10.2  Regulatory Approval  
As required by loc al regulations,  Rhizen  will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and approval of 
the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to trial initiation. If required, Rhizen  will also 
ensure that the implementation of substantial amendment to the protocol a nd other releva nt trial 
documents happen only after approval by the relevant regulatory authorities.  
 
10.3  Insurance and Indemnity  
Details of insurance and/or indemnity will be contained within the written agreement between the 
PI or site and Rhizen. Rhizen will reimburse t he subject for all study -related injuries provided that 
the injury does not arise from the subject’s misuse of the study drug or failure to follow the 
Investigator’s instructions.  
 
10.4 Financial Disclosure and Obligations  
Principal Investigators and Sub -Invest igators are required to provide financial disclosure 
information to allow Rhizen to submit the complete and accurate certification or disclosure 
statements required under Part 54 of Title 21 of the CFR. In addition, th e Principal 
Investigator /Sub- Investig ators must provide to the Sponsor a commitment to promptly update this 
information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for 1 year 
following the completion of the study.  
 
10.5  Informed C onsent  
The informed consent form will be submitted for approval to the IRB/ IEC that is responsible for 
review and approval of the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements 
currently required by the US FDA or state regulations and national requirements.  Translation of 
the informed consent form is allowed if necessary.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial. Once the essential informa tion has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, a nd the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of 
participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the trial by 
signing an informed consent form. A notation that written info rmed consent has been obtained will

provided by the investigator to the patient.   
 
If an amendment to the pro tocol substantially alters the trial design or the pot ential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s re-consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained.  
 
10.6   Confidentiality  
10.6.1  Patient confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be  protected in accordance with the Health  
Insura nce Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and national data protection laws, 
as applicable. HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participa te in the trial, a patient must sign 
an authorization from the trial that he or she has been infor med of following:  
a. What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this trial;  
b. Who will have access to that information and why;  
c. Who will use or disclose that information;  
d. The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the patient’s 
medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after the conclusion 
of the trial;  
e. Whether t he authorization contains a n expiration date;   
f. The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization.  
 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients t hat have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the pa tient is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled trial period.  
 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and app licable parts of 21 CFR, it is a requirement that 
the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of Sponsor, the regulatory 
author ities and the IRB/IEC  direct access to review the patient’s original medical records at the site 
for verif ication of trial -related procedures and data.  
 
Measures to protect confidentiality include - only a unique trial number and initials will identify 
patients on CRF , or other documents submitted to Rhizen . This information, together with the 
patient’s date o f birth, will be used in the database for patient identification. Patient names or 
addresses  will not be entered in the CRF or database. No material bearing a patient’s name will be 
kept on file by Sponsor. Patients will be informed of their rights within the ICF.  Therefore , absolute 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  
 
10.6.2    Investigator’s responsib ilities  
Medical supervision is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator named on the FDA Form 
1572. The Investigator may delegate day -to-day activities to a  sub-investigator listed on these 
forms but retains overall responsibility for ensuring that  the study is conducted properly and in 
accordance with the study protocol.   The Investigator is required to provide the Sponsor with 
his/her own CV and applicable licensure, as well as those of the personnel assuming significant 
responsibility in the stud y (e.g., sub -investigators).  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                     Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

practices, and in compliance with applicable regulations (21 CFR, ICH).  
 
10.6.3   Investigator an d Staff training  
All Investigators and their study personnel will receive training regarding the study procedures and 
GCP/regulations specific to the conduct of cl inical trials. This training will be documented and will 
take place prior to enrollment and throughout the study as necessary.  
 
11 RECORD RETENTION AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE TRIAL  
11.1 Amendments to the Protocol  
If an amendment to the protocol is required, the am endment will be originated and documented by 
Rhizen . All amendments require review and approval of Rhizen. The written amendment must be 
submitted and approved by the IRB/IEC . 
 
11.2 Protocol Deviations  
The Prin cipal Investigator is required to follow the protoc ol. A protocol deviation is an unintended 
and/or unanticipated departure from the protocol procedures.  The Investigator /designee must 
document and explain in the subject’s source documentation any deviatio n from the approved 
protocol.  Protocol deviations w ill be documented by the CRA/ monitor throughout the course of 
monitoring visits. Principal Investigator will be notified of deviations in writing by the 
CRA/ monitor.  The IRB/IEC should be notified of all p rotocol violations and deviations according 
to their IRB/IEC reporting requirements.  
 
11.3  Documentation Required to Initiate Trial  
Before the trial may begin, documentation required by US  FDA will be provided by the Sponsor.  
At minimum, d ocuments required to begin a trial in the US include, but are not limi ted to: a  signed 
protocol acceptance page, and contract; a copy of the official IRB/IEC  approval of the  trial and the 
IRB/IEC  members hip list; current Curricula Vita for the Principal Investigator and any sub-
investigator who will be involved  in the trial;  indication of appropriate accreditation for any 
laboratories to be used in the trial and a copy of the normal ranges for tests to be performed by that 
laboratory; completed signed Form FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator), financial disclosure 
forms for a ll investigators listed on Form FDA 1572; site qualification reports, where applicable; 
verification of Principal Investigator accepta bility from local and/ or national debarment list(s).  
 
12 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
The PI must maintain a list of ap propriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated trial 
duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of  the trial are informed of their 
obligations. All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on the CRFs are to  be 
included on this document. All entries in the patient’s CRF are to be supported by source 
documentation where appropriate.  
 
Source  documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copies of original records 
of clinical findings, observ ations and activities from which the patient’s CRF data are obtained. 
These can include, but are not limited to, hospital records, cli nical and office charts, laboratory, 
medico -technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, ECG traces, c opies or

The PI and site staff are  responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized fil ing system 
(Site Trial File/SSF or Investigator Site File ( ISF) of all trial -related (essential) documentation, 
suitable for inspection at any time by representatives from the Sponsor and/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.  The ISF/SSF must consist of t hose documents that individually or collectively permit 
evaluation of the conduct of the trial and th e quality of the data pr oduced. The ISF/SSF should 
contain as a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP section 
E6 and 21 CFR Part 312.57, including key documents such as the IB and any amendments, protocol 
and any amendments, signed ICFs, copies of completed CRFs, IRB/ IEC approval documents, 
Financial Disclosure forms, patient identification lists, enrollment logs, delegatio n of authority log, 
staff qualification documents, laboratory normal ranges, records relating to the trial drug inc luding 
accountability records. Drug accountability records should, at a minimum, contain information 
regarding receipt, shipment, and disposi tion.   
 
Each drug accountability record, at a minimum, should contain PI name, date drug 
shipped/received, date, quantity an d batch/code, or lot number for identity of each shipment. In 
addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRF  must be maintained and be 
readily available.  
 
The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as required by the applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  The investi gator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents  
 
The Investigator sh all maintain adequate records of drug disposition, case histories and any other 
trial-related records as per 21 CFR Part 312.62 for  no less than 2 years after the last marketing 
application has been approved by FDA; or, in the event that the marketing appl ication has not been 
approved by FDA, for no less than 2 years after the last shipment / delivery of the drug for 
investigational u se is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation.  
 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the identity of  all 
participating patients (sufficient information to link records e. g., CRFs and medical records), all 
original, signed informed consent forms, and copies of all CRFs, SAE Reporting forms, source 
documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory 
documents.   The documents listed above mu st be retained by the investigator for as long as needed 
to comply with national and international regulations (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical 
development or after the la st marketing approval).   Sponsor will notify the 
investigator(s)/insti tutions(s) when the trial -related records are no longer required.   
 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, both site and sponsor 
should be p rospectively notified.  The trial records must be transferred to an ac ceptable designee, 
such as another investigator, another institution, or to sponsor.  The investigator must obtain the 
sponsor written permission before disposing of any records, even if  retention requirements have

12.1   Data Collection  
Data will be captured via Case Record Form (CRF).  All data requested on the CRF must be 
supported  by and be consistent with the patient’s source documentation. All missing data must be 
explained. The Principal Investigator will sign and date each CRF casebook attesting to his/her 
responsibility for the quality of all data included therein, and that the data represent a complete and 
accurate record of each subject's participation in the study.  
 
Clinical data management will be performed in accordance w ith applicable standards. Data 
cleaning procedures will be performed with the objective of verifying errors and inconsistencies in 
the data which would otherwise impact on the analysis and reporting objectives, or the credibility 
of the Clinical Study Repo rt. Adverse events, medical hist ory and concomitant medications will be 
coded using industry standard dictionaries (MedDRA and WHO Drug).  
 
12.2   Trial Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor and/or Sponsor's representat ives at all stages of study 
cond uct from inception to completion i n accordance with current GCPs.  Monitoring will be done 
in the form of on-site visits , remote monitoring  and other communication and will include review 
of origi nal source documents and CRFs . The frequency of these visits will depend upon the

        Appendix  A: Contraceptive Guidelines and Pregnancy  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows 
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spon taneous amenorrhea with 
serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by  follow up hormone level assessment 
is she considered not of child bearing potential.  
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Child -Bearing Potential  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 5 T1/2 plus an 
additional 4 weeks after stopping treatment . The highly effective contracep tion is defined as 
either:  
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of cont raception.  
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up horm one level 
assessment.  
3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the  
absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that patient.  
4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):  
a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauter ine system (IUS).  
b. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or   
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
 
The following are unacceptable  forms of contraception for women of childbearing pote ntial:  
• Oral contraception  injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as Tenalisib  
may potentially decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeedin g  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
Fertile Males  
Protocol No.  RP6530 -1803                                                     Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

 Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use 
condom during treatment, plus additional 12 weeks after stopping treatment  and should not 
fathe r a child in this period.   
Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study treatment must be reported to 
Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should 
be followed up for 3 months  after the termination of the pregnancy to  determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Consen t to report information regarding these pr egnancy outcomes should be obtained from the 
mother.  
Pregnancy is not considered a SAE. Initial and follow up information should be recorded on a 
Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to Rh izen Pharmaceuticals SA. 
Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of 
the possible relationship to the investigational drugs to any pregnancy outcome  will also be 
captured on the pregnancy form . Any SAE experi enced during pregnancy must be reported on  
the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obt ained from the mother.

        STATIS TICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
PROTOCOL NO. RP6530 -1803 
An Open label, Compassionate Use Study of Tenalisib 
(RP6530)  in Patients currently receiving treatment on Tenalisib 
trials in Hematological Malignanc ies 
 
 
        
 
 
 
  
Statistical anal ysis Plan  
Page | 2  
 1 STATISTICAL METHOD AND CONSIDERATIONS   
The primary purpose of this study is to offer patients who completed a Rhizen sponsored 
clinical study without progression the opportunity to continue to receive Tenalisib on a 
compassion basis.  The safety and progression status will be summarized as appropriate. 
No formal sample is determined for this study and final sample size will depend on the 
number of patients who benefitted and completed the Tenalisib study.  
 
2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS   
A tabular presentation of the patient disposition will be provided  by type of cancer  and 
previous study protocol and dose of tenalisib . All patients’ data will be used for this 
analysis.  
 
3 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
3.1 Adverse Events  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.   
 
All adverse events should be graded as per the CTCAE v 5.0. and should be recorded in the case 
report form. All adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until 
resolution or stabilization. Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after the last 
dose of study treatment  or till new anti -cancer treatment is initiated whichever is earlier . All new 
AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the 
opinion of the investigator, the adverse event or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to 
improve b ecause of the underlying disease. After 30 days of completion of protocol -specific 
treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment 
related  are to be reported.  
The causality assessment will be categorized as related and not related.  
• Related:  All toxicities should be considered to be related to Tenalisib  unless there is 
a clear alternative explanation.    
• Not related:   If there is no temporal association, or another etiology has been 
identified as the cause, or the trial treatment cannot be implicated based upon the 
current information.

 3.2 Serious Adverse Events  
• Definitions of serious adverse events  
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life -threatening, requires at least a 24 -hour in -patient hospitalization or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect  or an important medical event.  
 
All events that meet the definition of serious but, in the opinion of the treating investigator, are 
clearly expected from the Patient’ s disease or related to disease progression (i.e. there exists no 
reasonable possibility that they were caused by the study drug) should be report ed on the case 
report forms and do not require expedited reporting.  In addition, p rogression of malignancy 
(including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate method ( e.g. CT/ PET) or 
clinically confirmed , should not be reported as a serious ad verse event.   
 
 
3.3 Protocol -Defined Events of Special Interest  
The following are events of special interest and will need to be reported expeditiously.  
• Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/ Congenital Anomalies  
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously descri bed process for SAE reporting. A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed and will need to be updated to 
reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Overdose  
An overdose is defined as accidental or intentional administration of any dose of product that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. For purposes of this trial, an overdose will 
be defined as any dose exceeding the proposed dose of Tenalisib  (e.g. > 800 mg  twice a day ).   
 
The safety endpoints will include:  
• Incidence of AEs and related AEs  
• Incidence of grade 3 , grade 4  and grade 5  AEs 
• Incidence of SAEs and death s  
 
The analyses of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events  for patients who received 
at least one dose of study treatment.

4 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Efficacy evaluations will be performed at the physician’s discretion as part of standard 
of care (SOC) . These evaluations (e.g. measurement of lymph node, mSWAT) will not 
be reported  in CRF , however , the date of disease progression will be reported.  
 
The duration  of disease progression will be calculated for  patients who received at least one 
dose of study treatment.

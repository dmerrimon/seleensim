Background/Justification 
Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common voiding dysfunction in children1. While many 
children may outgrow these issues, for some these symptoms persists and can lead to emotional, social, behavioral and physical problems.  Multiple treatm ents exist for OAB but rarely is th ere guaranteed 
success. Many behavioral and lifestyle treatments involve a significant time investment  and office visits  
on the part of the patient and family. Furthermore, medication therapy is often associated with bothersome side effects and is disconti nued, even despite efficacy
2.  As such, treatments with 
potentially less adverse effects, often used in adult urology, are making their way into the pediatric urology practice. These include intravesical botulin um toxin injections, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS)  
and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation  (PTNS) . 
PTNS , first cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011  for adult 
use, has evolved into transcutaneous nerve stimulation in the pediatric population; obviating the need for needles during treatment. Studies suggest mixed efficacy in electric nerve stimulation for overactive bladder in the pediatric population,  owing largely to the marked heterogeneity in treatment protocols. 
While some researchers follow the traditional tibial nerve pathway, others take a cue from SNS and target the parasacral area, while still others rely on signaling from even further periphe ral nerves to 
modulate bladder overactivity 
3-5. Perhaps f urther contributing to the disparate data is the varying 
treatment schedules used. Some centers perform treatments daily, others weekly, others twice or thrice 
a week. Similarly, some physicians recommend twenty -minute  treatments, while others thirty or even 
sixty minutes. The majority of studies rely on an office -based treatment model, while a few have 
explored in home treatments3-5. In the United States, there has been no study examining the feasibility 
or efficacy of home parasacral transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (PTENS) on pediatric voiding 
dysfunction.  
 
Definitions  
Terminology adheres to the standards recommended by the International Children’s Continence Society 
(ICCS) except where specifically noted6. 
Bowel and bladder dysfunction (BBD)  concomitant bladder and bowel disturbances –  does not explain 
etiology but describes parallel dysfunction  
Lower urinary tract dysfunction a term encompass ing many times of urinary dysfunction (see below) in 
children older than 5; excludes bowel dysfunction  
Increased voiding frequency  ≥8 voids per day; may be subjectively described as fewer than 8 voids  
Incontinence  involuntary leakage of urine; includes con tinuous and intermittent incontinence –  
continuous incontinence is typically associated with an anatomic abnormality  
 Daytime incontinence  intermittent incontinence that occurs while awake  
 Enuresis  intermittent incontinence that occurs exclusively during sleeping periods; though 
enuresis is sometimes used to refer to daytime incontinence, the ICCS definition specifies nocturnal  
Urgency  sudden and unexpected experience of an immediate and compelling need to void  
Overactive bladder  condition in which a child experiences urgency symptoms; may or may not be 
associated with incontinence; replaces the term bladder instability7 
Nocturia waking at night specifically to void; distinct from enuresis, in which the child is incontinent 
during sleep  
 
Specific Aims  
Primary Aims  
1. To examine feasibility (adherence) of thrice weekly, thirty minute home treatment sessions  
2. To evaluate recruitment into a randomized trial for pediatric voiding dysfunction  
 
 
3. To refine, if needed, treatment protocol for both study and control groups  
4. To estimate effec t size, with point estimates and confidence intervals, of treatment and control 
groups  
Secondary Aims  
1. To confirm safety and identify potential adverse events with use of in -home PTENS  
2. To identify possible barriers to in -home PTENS  
3. To compare the efficacy o f in-home, PTENS to traditional behavioral therapy on parameters of 
urinary voiding dysfunction in the pediatric population  
4. To explore efficacy of in -home, PTENS to traditional behavioral therapy on parameters of bowel 
dysfunction in the pediatric populati on 
 
Recruitment Methods  
 Participants will be recruited through the Primary Children’s Urology Clinic  by nurse 
practitioners . Patients and families of patients with diagnoses of enuresis or daytime incontinence (ICD -
10 R32), bladder instability  (ICD -10 N32.89) , bladder dysfunction  (N31.9), nocturnal enuresis ( N39.44) , 
nocturnal and diurnal enuresis (ICD -10 N39.498), urinary frequency (ICD -10 R35) and urinary frequency  
(ICD -10 R39.15) , who meet inclusion criteria, will be counseled on possible st udy enrollment by the 
primary treating nurse practitioner.  Clinic schedules, with reason for visit, will be queried twice weekly 
by study coordinators (non -clinical personnel) to identify potential subjects  based on keywords including 
incontinence, dysuria, urinary tract infection (UTI), enures is, wetting, urinary retention, incomplete 
emptying, voiding dysfunction and dysfunctional voiding. Providers will be given a list of potential 
subjects.  Subjects wil l be randomly assigned into either treatment or control  by study coordinators 
using an electronic randomization function using Research Electronic Data Capture software  (REDCap). 
Patients and families will be asked no more than once to consider participation in the study. A potential patient list, screening log and patient num bers will be kept in a secure file on a secure drive on the 
University of Utah servers.    
 Sample Size  
 Based on prior work in examining continuous variables for averages and variability during pilot 
studies, the recommended sample size per group is 12 subjects
8. To account for attrition, 15 subjects 
will be randomized to each group.

Summary of Methods  
At the initial visit all subjects will complete a Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS) and be given a packet on controlling overactive bladder and pediatric enuresis (see Appendix 1). All subjects will then complete a 48 -hour voiding diary, a nighttime wetting log  (at home) , a urinalysis and culture, a renal and 
bladder ultrasound, a non -invasive u roflowmetry test and they will watch short videos on daytime and 
nighttime wetting as well as constipation in children.  (All items at this visit are standard of care)  They 
will also complete a medical colon cleanout using polyethylene glycol and senna, as is the current clinic standard of care.   In 4-6 weeks, after all testing is completed, all subjects will follow -up for review of these testing results. 
(This follow -up visit is considered standard of care). Patients who had a positive urine culture or oth er 
abnormalities found on ultrasound or uroflowmetry that suggest an anatomic obstruction will be excluded from this research study.  
 Subjects  who are still eligible to participate will then be randomized , at the same office visit, using an 
online randomi zation tool to either standard behavioral therapy (control) or standard behavioral 
therapy in addition to the PTENS device.  Subjects  will then be instructed on standard behavioral 
therapy or  standard behavioral therapy in addition to PTENS (see  Appendix 2).  This randomization is for 
research purposes only.  
 Subjects will then be contacted weekly by study personnel to assess and document treatment adherence as well as identify any potential adverse events.  (Research Purposes Only)  
  In 6 weeks, subjects will complete (at home) a voiding diary, a wetting log and a DVSS. These will be 
transmitted to the office through secure e- mail and uploaded into the chart. (Research Purposes Only)  
 
In 12 weeks, subjects will follow -up in clinic wit h repeat voiding diary, wetting log and DVSS for further 
assessment and discussion of treatment adherence, barriers to adherence and adverse events, if any. 
(This visit is standard of care and would occur regardless of the patient participating in the rese arch 
study)  
 Risks and/or Ethical Issues  
Based on previous data, there is a risk of minor skin irritation  or redness at the application site
9, and 
families will be informed of this prior to initiation of treatment and be instructed to discontinue treatment if this occurs.  Previous studies have shown this risk to be <20%
9. This can be prevented by 
correct placement and adherence to recommended treatment10. Other foreseeable risks may be pain at 
the site of electrode application. No serious side effects have been reported10. There is a risk of 
psychological stress (some children may experience frustration with the length of the treatment or with 
the process itself) of treatment. This will be monitored throughout the study period.  
 
 
 
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality. Data will be obtained from the medical record and patient 
encounters and be maintained on case report forms that will be stored in a locked office. This data will be entered into REDCap. REDCap is a HIPAA -compliant, secure database that restricts access to study 
data based on user roles and p ermissions. Patient list will be kept in a password -protect file, on a 
password -protected desktop computer, in a locked office.  
 
There is a potential ethical issue of continuing inferior treatment. If interim analysis reveals clear 
superiority of one treat ment type or schedule, other study participants will be offered the superior 
treatment option.  
 Benefits  
Subjects may benefit from this study in improvement in their lower urinary tract symptoms.  
 Informed Consent Process  
IRB compliant informed consent from parents (or guardians) will be undertaken and documented  (See 
Appendix 3) . Assent for children will be obtained as age appropriate.  
 Measures to Protect Privacy and Confidentiality of Participants  
The confidentiality of all patient information will be maintained and all guidelines set forth by HIPAA and the IRB will be strictly adhered to. All patient data will be stored on either in a password -protected file, 
on a password -protected desktop computer in a locked office, case report forms in a locked office, or 
electronically in  REDCap  on a secure server . Any information used in statistical analysis will be de -
identified.  No identification of patients will be made in any presentations or publications  related to this 
study  
 Timetable  
Pilot study and data gathering will be undertaken over the next three months ( January 2019 –  March 
2019). One month will be given to analyzing the feasibility, designing and randomized trial and completing the IRB process.  Once pilot study has been completed and analyzed, this data will be used to 
refine and complete a larger scale randomized control trial. P lan will be for study to take place over a 
six-month period, estimated to be Summer through Winter  of 2019.  
 Data Management of Statistical Analysis  
Descriptive statistics of the study population will be completed. Univariate relationships between 
potentially relevant clinical and demographics factors will be determined.  
T-test or Wilcox- Mann -Whitney test and chi -squared  test will be used to determine differences and 
relationships between variables.  
Assistance in statistical analysis has b een sought from the center for Study Design and Biostatistics . 
 
Cost, Compensation and Participant Reimbursement  
During the initial pilot study, families will not bear the cost of acquirin g a TENS unit  and a unit will be 
loaned to them after they are randomized.  The unit will be returned at the end of the study.  There will 
be no participant compensation or reimbursement.  
 
Safety and Clinical Monitoring  
 
 
Families will be contact weekly to monitor for any adverse reactions as well as to assess adherence to 
treatment protocol. Contact will consist of a phone call from study personnel. If unable to make contact a voicemail with follow -up n umber will be left.  
 
Provisions for Research Related Injury  
Patients and families will be counseled on known potential adverse reactions (redness and skin 
irritation) and to discontinue use if these should occur. At this time, there are no provisions for r esearch 
related injury.  
 
Future Work  
The goal of this pilot study is to assess recruitment and adherence feasibility as well as understand averages and variability in improvement. These data will be used to power and perform a larger, randomized control tr ial to assess efficacy of home -based, PTENS and compare this to traditional 
behavioral therapy.  Our goal is not to have the PTENS indication updated to show that it can be used for 
voiding dysfunction

Bowel and Bladder Retraining and Fitness  
Colon Clean -out 
For all children  
Recommended to be done on a weekend  
 
Senna (Ex -lax®) squares – 1 square for 6 -12 year olds; 2 squares for those over 12  
Polyethylene glycol (Miralax®) –  17 grams (one capful) in 8 ounce of water  
Take both senna and polyethylene glycol every 12 hours for four doses.  
(For example, Friday evening, Saturday morning, Saturday evening and Sunday morning)  
 Stool should be  clear/watery at the end of the clean- out. If not, repeat the following weekend.  
 Bowel Health Maintenance  
For children with bowel dysfunction, such constipation or fecal soiling  
Polyethylene glycol  
Take polyethylene glycol daily –  one capful in 8 ounces of water once per day. Adjust dose to 
maintain a soft, semi- formed bowel movement. This may require every other day dosing, half 
capfuls or two capfuls  
 Toilet sitting  
After each meal and after school for 5 -10 minutes sit on a toilet and practice deep brea thing 
and pelvic floor relaxation techniques  
 
For all children  
Dietary changes  
Eat plenty of fiber and drink plenty of water (see Guide to Fiber and Fluid below)  
 Age plus five equals the number of grams of dietary fiber a child should eat per day  
Limit dairy to three servings daily – two 8 -oz glasses of milk and one cheese/yogurt  
 
Foods and Drinks to Avoid  
Some foods and drinks are known to make you pee more, because they bother your bladder or because they have things that make you pee. It doesn’t mean you can’t have them at all, but limiting them will help you stay dry  
Spicy foods  
Sugary drinks, including juice  
Caffeine  
 Fluid Timing  
No fluids within three hours of bedtime  
 For example, if you go to bed at 9pm you should try not to drink after 6pm  
  This may mean eating dinner earlier!  
 It is ok to drink a sip of water if you need to take medicine  
  
 
 
Exercise  
Exercise, play sports or play outside at least sixty minutes five times per week

High Fiber Foods  
Whole grain bread  
Whole wheat pasta  
Apples, with skin  
Raspberries

Drink Plenty of Water  
 
6 years old  6 cups (48 oz.) 
7 years old  7 cups (56 oz.) 
≥8 years old  8 cups  (64 oz. ) 
 
Bladder Retraining and Fitness  
Scheduled voiding  
Timed voiding you should pee every two hours while you are awake  
 You may need to set a watch alarm to help you remember in the beginning  
 We have a note for school to give to your teacher, if needed  
 Double voiding after you pee you should wait ten to fifteen minutes and try to pee again  
 This is especially important at night to keep you dry  
For example, before you get ready for bed you should pee, then after your brush 
your teeth, wash your face, and change your clothes, right before you go to bed, you should pee again  
 You can also do this before long car trips or activities that tend to make you leak  
 Midnight voiding set an alarm and wake -up once at night to pee  
 This is for kids who are mostly wet  at night 
 
Pelvic floor relaxation  
Be sure to do at least 3 -5 relaxation breaths during each void  
Deep breath in and blow out through an open mouth to a count of five  
For younger children, it may help to use bubbles or a pinwheel  
For girls, sit up straight  with your feet on the floor (or a stool) and your knees wide apart  
 It may help to take one foot out of your pants and underwear

Controlling Overactive bladder and P ediatric Enuresis (COPE) 
PTENS  
 
What is PTENS?  
 Parasacral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PTENS) is electrical current that 
is used to stimulate the nerves near your sacrum. These are the nerves that stimulate your bowel and bladder. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was initially used for muscle pain and tension. Nerve stimulation has been shown in adults and childre n to improve 
symptoms of overactive bladder but traditionally needles are used to transmit electrical 
current. Use of transcutaneous electrodes for nerve stimulation for voiding dysfunction is 
thought to be safe and effective but, at this point, is investi gational. It has not been approved 
for use by the Food and Drug Administration.  
 
How do I use PTENS?  
 PTENS should be used three times per 
week for 30 minutes at a frequency of 10 Hz, 
a pulse width of 200 milliseconds.  Electrode pads should be placed on the sacrum, on 
either side of the spine. These will be set by your nurse practitioner before you begin use. The intensity, or current, should be start at 10 milliamps and can be slowly increased in intensity to a maximum for 40 milliamps. 
These settings a re on the dials number 1 –  8 
on the top of your unit. You should NOT 
exceed 4. If there is pain, the settings should 
be turned down by 5 milliamps (half a setting) and re -tried until there is no pain. There may 
be a slight sensation. If there is visible mu scle 
twitching, the settings should be turned down 
by 5 milliamps and retried until twitching 
stops. Treatments can be done sitting or lying down but should be done at a time when the child can be calm or relaxed. Pads should not be 
used if wet. Pads shoul d not touch each other or the spine. A mild amount of redness after use 
is normal, but if there is pain or persistent redness, stop use and call your practitioner.  
  
Where can I get a PTENS unit?  
 You can order a PTENS unit online from 
https://www.lgmedsupply.com/tenslg3000kit.html
. They cost $40 - $50 depending on shipping 
and handling. You must bring your unit to your nurse practitioner appointment prior to use. 
You should NOT use the unit without first discussing use with your practitioner.

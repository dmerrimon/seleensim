1. BACKGROUND1
A number of new oral anticoagulants are being developed and marketed to replace vitamin K 
antagonists (e.g., warfarin) , one of the most important drugs in modern medicine .[P12- 08021 ]
Unlike vitamin K antagonists, these new drugs do not re quire dose titration involving 
intensive therapeutic monitoring of prothrombin time to achieve target anticoagulation within 
a narrow therapeutic range. In Phase III studies, these drugs were found to be therapeuticall y 
advantageous or non-inferior over warfarin ; however, little is known about their efficacy  
relative to one another. [R11-
4190 ; P09-11669 ; R11-4223 ]In the coming years, as man y as 
six new anticoagulants could be on the market and a lack of valid comparative evidence will 
hinder prescriber and payor decision -making.
To date, these drugs have been studied in pre -marketing clinical trials for three separate 
indications: (1) prevention of stroke and s ystemic embolism among patients with atrial 
fibrillation; (2) prevention of deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) among patients 
undergoing hip or knee replacement therap y; and (3) treatment of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) . Phase III clinical trials comparing dabigatran, rivar oxaban, and apixaban to warfarin 
in patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have been completed. [R11-4190 ; 
P09-11669 ; R11-4223 ] 
It was h ypothesized that the eff ectiveness and safety  of oral anticoagulants in stroke 
prevention will strongl y depend on their use patterns. [ P12-08021 ] A thorough understanding 
of (1) the existing utilization patterns for warfarin, and changes in this utilizat ion that occur 
after the introduction of NOACs ; (2) differences in utilization patterns between warfarin and 
NOACs; and (3) differences between specific NOACs, will help with the design, anal ysis and 
interpretation of comparative effectiveness and safety  studies for the NOAC. 
This protocol is for a series of descriptive anal yses starting with the cohort of patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation identified in the currently  available Jan 2009 -Jun 2012 data, 
followed b y inclusion of additional cohort s identified in 6-month data increments. Such 
sequential approach will extend initial analy ses by allowing (1) examination of shifts in 
utilization patterns over time, and (2) inclusion of additional NOACs at they  become 
available.

2. OBJECTIVES
To provide an overview of existing utilization patterns for warfarin and the NOAC 
medications as they  become available in patients w ith non -valvular atrial fibrillation at risk 
for stroke . Specificall y:
  
Examine t reatment initiation , switching and discontinuation.
  
Update i nitial anal yses on a 6- month basis. 
3. STUDY DESIGN
This study  will use a cohort design with descriptive anal yses, using data from 2009-2015. It 
will be conducted within two US -based longitudinal healthcare claims databases (MarketScan 
and UnitedHealth Research Database, see alsosection 3.1 for more details). Cohort selection 
and a ll anal yses will be conducted separatel y within each data sourc e.
3.1 DATA SOURCE S
The data source for this project is a combination of claims data from UnitedHealth, a 
commercial health insurer , and MarketScan, a research claims database from commercial 
employ er-sponsored health plans both of which provide comprehensive medical coverage for 
members with active policies.

3.2 STUDY POPULATION
From the UnitedHealth Research Database andMarketScan source data, we will identify  
patients with a recorded diagnosis of non- valvular atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke who 
initiated anticoagulant medications between January  2009 andJune 2012 .Additional 
increments of data will be added as they  become available (in 6 month intervals). Data from 
the time period before dabigatran was launched will be used to describe the characteristics of 
warfarin patients before the availability  of NOAC, and to evaluate a potential shift in 
characteristics of warfarin patient over time as NO AC enter the market.
Inclusion criteria2: 
Any person within the source data who had a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation recorded 
(ICD-9 Dx code of 427 .31, atrial fibrillation) andreceived a dispensing of an 
anticoagulant medication (warfarin and dabigatran for the initial anal ysis; with others 
to be added as they  become available for stroke prevention in later time intervals ) in 
the timeframe of the study.
The first dispensing is preceded b y at least 12 months continuous enrollment in the 
study  database , defined as < 32 day senrollment gap using enrollment and 
disenrollment dates. T he study  will thus focus on ‘new initiators’ defined 
operationall y as no dispensing of an y anticoagulant 
in the prior 12 months. Note that 
new initiators will turn into prevalent users over time.
Patients’ follow -up will end when there is a treatment gap of ≥30 day s. If the same 
patient re -
initiates treatment later on – after a treatment gap of ≥12 months –, (s)he
may re-enter the cohort at that time (an indicator variable will be created to identify  
such patients, known as former users ).
18 years or older at the time of treatment initiation
CHA 2DS 2-VASc score3≥ 1
Exclusion criteria : 
patients with less than 12 months continuous enrollment in the study  database without 
anticoagulant use 
before the first dispensing of anticoagulant medication.
Patients with missing or a mbiguous age or sex information.
Patients with documented evidence of valvular disease defined as at least 1 inpatient

3.2.1 Study s ize
This study  will be estimating anticoagulant utilization parameters within a sampled 
population .  The precision of these estimates will depend on the numbers of patients on which 
the estimate is made, an d features of the estimate itself. The number of patie nts receiving
anticoagulant medication and meet ingstudy selection criteria is unknown at this stage .  
However, w e assume that between 10,000 and 15,000 patients per yearwill meet selection 
criteria as having used warfarin or a newer anticoagulant so that 
by the end of the study  (data 
from 2009- 2015), there will be a total of at least 100,000 patients in each data source. 
(source : These are projections based on preliminary counts in the available UnitedHealth 
data)
The precision of proportion estimates ( e.g. prevalence) is a function of the proportion and the 
number of patients contributing to the proportion (precision = standard error = square 
root[p(1- p)/n ]).  As indicated in the table below, across a range of estimates provided, the 
precision for a prevalence estimate o f 10% or 20% is less than 5% even for sample sizes that 
willlikely be present in subgroups described in this study .
Table 1 Precision of estimates for proportion measures
Numerator Denominator Prevalence 95% CI Precision (s.e .)
10 100 10% 4.9%-17.6% 3.0%
100 1,000 10% 8.2%-12.0% 0.9%
1,000 10,000 10% 9.4% -10.6% 0.3%
10,000 100,000 10% 9.8% -10.2% 0.1%
20 100 20% 12.7% -29.2% 4.0%
200 1,000 20% 17.6% -22.6% 1.3%
2,000 10,000 20% 19.2% -20.8% 0.4%
20,000 100,000 20% 19.8% -20.2% 0.1%
For continuous measures such as medication possession ratio ( (MPR) , see Table 3 ), the 
precision depends on the number of subjects on whom the estimate is made and the 
variability  of the measures (precision = s tandard error = sq uare roo t[standard deviation2/n]).
As indicated in the table, the precision for a continuous measure is 5% or less even for 
measures that appl y to strata that represent subgroups to be defined in this study .

100,000 1 0.5 0.2%
By the end of the study , with a projected 100,000 patients meeting selection criteria, the 
various adherence measures will be estimated with a precision of 1% or less, except within
fairly small strata.
3.3 EXPOSURES
Initiation of oral anticoagulant medication (i.e., no use in the prior 12 months) 
represents the primary  exposure.  
Utilization patterns will be defined b y individual oral anticoagulant: warfarin and 
dabigatran for the initial cohort (Jan 2009- June 2012 ), as well as rivaroxaban and 
other NOACs as they  enter the market within the study  time horizon for subsequent 
cohorts (July 2012- Dec 2015).
3.4 OUTCOME S
Patterns of anticoagulant medication use will be identified on the basis of a pharmacy  
dispensing. Pharmacy  dispensing is considered the most accurate utilization measure short of 
electronic 
pillcounting caps. [R13-0543 ] 
The primary  outcomes considered include the proportion of patients d ispensed specific 
anticoagulants and anticoagulant doses (for NOAC) , as well as a description of the 
characteristics of these patients.
In addition, a variet y of measures will be derived from features of the dispensing data, 
including: number of dispensing s, characteristics of dispensings (dose, and day s supplied) ,
 along with persistence 
measures ( e.g., proportion with a single dispensing, proportion remaining on therapy  over 
time, time until tre atment switch or 
discontinuation) . [R13-0542 ; R12-3689 ; P06-11504]
Treatment persistence over time constitutes the secondary  outcome,

medication within 30 days of the end of days supplied)
*: Days supply likely reflect suse patterns in a commercial insurer such as United Health or MarketScan .
**: Estimation of dose will be challenging during the dose titration period for warfarin. We explore warfarin dose over 
time and assess the feasibility of estimating average dose, seeking to identify maintenance dose (i.e., dose needed for 
consistent therapeutic INR).

Notes: 
Incident user: Patient with no dispensing of an oral anticoagulant in the prior 12 months
(potential) prevalent user: Patients with < 12months enrollment before first observed dispensing. Since these patients c ould 
have been treated in the prior 12months (treatment status during the unobserved time period is unknown), they are 
considered ‘potential’ prevalent patients.

3.6 DATA ANALYSI S
All analy ses will be conducted separatel y within each database .
3.6.1 Main analys es
Analy ses in this protocol are inherentl y descriptive in nature.   The anal yses described below 
will initially  be con ducted for the base cohort ( Jan 2009- June 2012 data).   Analy ses willbe 
updated at 6 -
month intervals as more data become available for the existing cohort(s) and 
new users are identified wit hin the additional time period (July 2012- Dec 2015 data) .  As 
new data become available, we will characterize the patients newl y initiated on treatment 
during that time period separately , in order to enable characterization of the shift in patient 
characteristics and use over time. In addition, short and long
-term outcomes for the alread y 
existing cohorts (i.e., patients identified in previous time periods) will be updated with the 
newly  available information in terms of switches, discontinuations, adherence and 
persistence. 
A 12- month time window of no treatment is used to define a “new” treatment episode (i.e., 
incident user). Patients who re -
initiate treatment after a treatment gap of ≥ 12 months will re -
enter the cohort as former users.
Primary outcomes:
Treatment initiation over time :
The y early  anticoagulat ion initiation rate will be estimated as the proportion of patients who 
initiated treatment among the source cohort of patients with non -valvular atrial fibrillation 
who met the study  inclusion criteria and were not alread y on treatment.  To identify  the

source cohort of treatment candidates in a given calendar time window (i.e., the denominator 
for the rate) , all patients with at least one day  eligibility  will be identified .  Arandom date 
within the first eligibility period (if more than one) within the calendar time window w ill be
selected and set as the index date .  The cohort 
inclusion and exclusion criteria w ill be
evaluated using this index date. Patients who were dispensed an anticoagulant before the 
assigned index date (prevalent users) w ill be removed from the denominator, unless they  are
identified as new initiators (i.e., included in the numerator) for that particular time period .
Characteristics of anticoagulant users :
The anal yses will describe the proportion of patients treated with various o ral anticoagulants, 
as well as the characteristics of these patients.   For the NOACs, the starting dose will also be 
considered. Anal yses will be conducted  
as well for the combined cohort of 
incident and former users. Characteristics for the combined cohort will be presented in the 
core set of tables;  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Data prior to the launch of dabigatran in October 2010 will be used to characterize warfarin 
patients before the NOACs became available, and to evaluate the potential shift in patient 
characteristics over time. A comparison of patient characteristics across treatment groups will 
only be conducted within a common time window.
Secondary outcomes:
Utilization measures: Non-persistence
To ensure a valid comparison of utilization measures ( Table 3 ), patients exposed to the 
various NOACs will be matched to warfarin on an ex posure propensity  score (PS) in a 1:1 
fixed ratio using a nearest neighbor technique and a caliper of 0.05.   In addition, the patients

will be matched within calendar quarters (3 month periods).  
  
Briefl y, all covariates listed in will be included in a logistic regression propensity  
score (PS) model without further variable selection. I n addition to demographic information, 
variables included in the PS were identified based on the a -priori expectation that they  might 
be both associated with choice of anticoagulant and risk factors for study  outcomes so that 
they represent likely  confounding variables in a compar ative safet y and effectiveness 
analysis. The underl ying assumption is that these variables capture the most important 
predictors of treatment persistence.
Balance of baseline characteristics in the matched cohorts will be evaluated.  The utilization 
measur es included in Table 3 will be described for the PS -matched cohort.  To properl y 
account for differential follow -up, survival ty pe analy ses (i.e., Kaplan -Meier) will be used to 
describe time from treatment initiation to non -persist ence (discontinuation or switch).  
Number of patients at risk for this treatment outcome will be provided at 3 -month intervals.

4. STUDY LIMITATIONS
As an observational study, there are inherent limitations with respect to potential for alternate 
explanations for any observed association.
The source claims data include limitations with respect to certainty  of the capture of 
exposure, covariates, and outcomes.  As a comprehensive insurance database, essentially  all
billable medical services will result in claim s for reimbursement, so that the certainty  of 
capture is tied to likelihood of a claim being submitted to the insurer.
Although duration of atrial fibrillation may  represent a risk factor for stud y outcomes, this 
covariate will be incompletely  captured sin ce the patient history  in the dataset is relatively  
short (at least 12months, and an average of approximately  2 years), and a first claim within 
the database may  not represent atrial fibrillation onset since the condition is ty picall y not 
diagnosed at its onset.
Dosing of warfarin in clinical practice is complicated, and estimating dose and duration of 
exposure based on healthcare utilization data is therefore challenging.  The “day s’suppl y” 
field is expected to be most meaningful, but the potential for m isclassification exists.
New initiators are operationally  defined as patients with no use in the prior 12 months. This 
does not ensure, however, that patients have never used anticoagulants ; the possibility  
remains that these patients were treated at some prior time point before they enrolled in 
United or insurance plans that are part of the MarketScan database .
Medication use in United Healthcare and MarketScan data -as in all administrative 
healthcare databases -is restricted to prescription drug medica tion. Consequently , the use of 
over-the-counter (OTC) medications (e.g., OTC aspirin) is not captured. In addition, exposure 
is assessed based on prescription pick- up at a pharmacy  and might be misclassified in “as 
treated” anal ysis if patients do not take their medications. However, misclassification of 
prescription drug exposure is generally  considered less than in other exposure assessment

6. QUALITY ASSURANCE AN D CONTROL
All aspects of data anal ysis will be conducted according to standard procedures of the 
.Programming for this project will be conducted by  a 
primary  anal yst and validated by  a separate anal yst (validation anal yst).  For all da ta 
processing and anal ysis steps, the validation analyst will review the program along with input 
and output data sets, and for select steps of the project will employ  double programming 
techniques to reduce the potential for programming errors.

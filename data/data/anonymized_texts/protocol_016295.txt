Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  1.0 Background    
1.1 Oropharynx Cancer: Current State of Practice and Purpose of this Trial 
 
Several treatment modalities are availabl e for patients with oropharyngeal cancer, 
including definitive surgery, definitive ra diotherapy, and chemoradiation.  After 
definitive surgery, certain factors place patient s at increased risk fo r disease recurrence.  
These patients receive either adjuvant radiot herapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.  
Advances in both systemic and radiation th erapy in the adjuvant setting have been 
associated with improved survival and local control.    
Adjuvant treatment comes at the cost of increased  acute and late toxicity.  Furthermore, it 
is unclear if recent improvements in outcome can be completely attributed to the 
aggressiveness of adjuvant care.  The recent rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) have prompted a re-evaluation of 
past trial outcomes.  HPV associated orophary ngeal cancers have been demonstrated to 
be more chemo and radiation sensitive comp ared to non-HPV related tumors.  Large 
phase II/III studies which evaluate less morb id treatment approaches for definitive 
chemoradiation in HPV-associated patients ar e currently ongoing.  However, clinical 
trials designed for patients in the post-surgical setting are lacking.    The overall goal of this trial is to identif y a less toxic approach to HPV-associated 
cancers of the oropharynx while preserving the high survival currently associated with 
aggressive adjuvant radiation courses.  We fi rst aim to demonstrate the feasibility of a 
novel adjuvant therapy course using low- dose, hyperfractionated radiation with 
concurrent docetaxel.  We also aim to  show that low-dose, hyperfractionated 
chemoradiation will substantially reduce the burden of acute toxicity, result in faster 
recovery, carry lower rates of late effects, with similar rates of long-term survivorship 
compared with historical results from standard adjuvant care. 
 
1.2 Role of HPV in Oropharyngeal Cancers 
 
HPV-associated cancers have been shown to be distinct from HPV-negative cancers in regards to risk factor profiles, molecula r characteristics, treatment response, and 
prognosis.  In a meta-analysis of retrospective studies, HPV-associated oropharynx 
cancer had an estimated 50% reduction in risk of death when compared to patients with HPV-negative tumors.  (
Dayyani F, Etzel CJ, Liu M , et al. )  This may be due to the fact that 
HPV-associated tumors are more responsive to  chemotherapy and radiation.  In an ECOG 
trial prospectively evaluating the effect of tumor HPV status, HPV-associated tumors were found to have a higher response rate to induction paclitaxel and carboplatin when 
compared to HPV-negative tumors. (
Fakhry C, Westra WH, Li S , et al. )  Similarly, an 
analysis on survival outcomes in RTOG 0129,  a randomized trial where patients received 
accelerated versus standard fraction radiotherapy, patients who were HPV-associated had 
a 51% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to HPV-negative patients.  
Among HPV-associated patients, there is a further stratification of outcome based upon smoking status.  In a further sub-group analysis of RTOG 0129, HPV-associated patients who had <10 pack-year smoking history were  found to have a 3 year OS of 93% 
compared with a 70.8% OS among HPV-asso ciated patients with a >10 pack-year 
smoking history.  (
Ang KK, Harris J, Wheeler R , et al. ) 
MC1273 
 6  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   Given these excellent results, two large clinical  trials are currently investigating whether 
HPV-associated patients can be spared th e long-term complications of intensive, 
multimodal therapy without compromising thei r survival.  RTOG 1016 is a Phase III trial 
that randomizes HPV-related oropharyngeal patie nts to receive definitive chemoradiation 
consisting of 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions delivered  over 6 weeks with cisplatin vs cetuximab.  
ECOG 1308 is a phase II trial that uses induction chemo followed 54 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with cetuximab if patients have a complete response to induction.  Patients with partial response receive the standard dose of 70 Gy with cetuximab.    Though RTOG 1016 and ECOG 1308 both address the issue of treatment de-escalation 
for HPV-associated oropharynx patients, both tr ials are testing de-escalation in the setting 
of definitive chemoradiation.  There curren tly are no large trials testing equivalent 
strategies for de-escalating radiation for post-operative patients.   Whether HPV-
associated patients could benefit from milder  treatment in the post-operative setting is 
now a highly relevant clinical question.   
 
1.3 Adjuvant Radiation Therapy: Risk factors and Dose  
  
Previous retrospective trials have highlighted risk factors that place patients at increased 
risk for local recurrence and death after definitive surgery.  (
Lundahl RE, Foote RL, Bonner 
JA, et al. )  These risk factors include positive marg ins, extracapsular extension of tumor 
from a lymph node (ECE), number of involved lymph nodes, lymph nodes larger than 3 cm, lymphvascular space invasion (LVSI), close margins, and perineural invasion (PNI).    For patients with positive margins or extracapsu lar extension, adjuva nt radiation therapy 
plus concurrent cisplatin has historically been the standard of care.  These risk factors 
were identified as high risk on a meta-analy sis of the two largest randomized trials 
addressing adjuvant radiotherapy  (RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931.)  (
Bernier J, Cooper JS, 
Pajak TF , et al.)   In this analysis, patients with ECE or positive margins had a benefit to 
local control and overall survival from high dose chemoradiation.  In this joint analysis, 
however, the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve overall 
survival in patients with intermediate risk f actors such as 2+ lymph nodes, PNI, LVSI, or 
Stage III-IV disease.   
 The optimal implementation of adjuvant radi otherapy in patients with only intermediate 
risk factors is less clear.  Only one pr ospective randomized trial opened in 1983 has 
investigated the post-operative radiation dose for these patients. (Kokal WA, Neifeld JP, 
Eisert D, et al.)  This study was limited by using outdated treatment techniques (
60Co 
machines) in a patient era that was pre-HPV.   Despite these limitations, the control rate 
for the neck in patients with intermediate risk factors was 89% with doses between 52.2-
54.0 Gy.  The current standard of care for adjuvant radiation alone is a dose of 60-66 Gy.  This is based upon the control arm of the EORTC/RTOG trials, not prospective data.   
 The use of ECE as a high risk factor for adjuvant  therapy is also unclear in the HPV era.  
Both RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931 were conducted in an era where oropharynx cancer was mostly secondary to smoking and alcohol, rather than HPV.  A recent large, multi-institutional retrospective analysis on HPV-associated patients, for example, 
demonstrated that ECE was a poor predicto r of disease recurrence after surgery in the 
MC1273 
 7  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  modern era (Lewis JS, Carpenter DH, Thorstad  WL, et al.)  These data have been the 
foundation for the ADEPT trial, an ongoing treatment de-escalation trial for post-
surgical, HPV-associated patients with positi ve ECE.  However, the treatment de-
escalation in ADEPT is restricted to chemot herapy (radiotherapy plus/minus cisplatin) 
and does not the address the question of radiation de-escalation.  
1.4    Toxicity of Standard Adjuvant Treatment 
 
Adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with acute  and late toxicities that significantly impact 
a patient’s quality of life.  When lookin g at acute reactions on EORTC 22931, adjuvant 
radiation alone was associated with a 21% rate  of severe, grade 3+ mucositis, a 20% risk 
of severe xerostomia, and a 5% risk of grade 3+ muscular fibrosis.  These acute reactions also translated into late complications.  The rate of late, severe xerostomia was 22% 
while the rate of severe muscular fibrosis was 5%.  Similar numbers were also seen in RTOG 9501.  In this trial, 34% of patients r eceiving adjuvant radiotherapy alone had an 
acute adverse effect of grade 3 or higher wh ile 17% of the radiotherapy alone group had 
severe late adverse effects.    The etiology of these acute and late complications is well known. Radiation 
complications are related both to the total dose received by normal structures, and the 
size of each individual radiation fraction.  The radiation dose limits for a variety of 
normal tissues within the head and neck have been previously documented.  For example, 
a mean radiation dose of 26 Gy to a parotid gland has a 20% risk of rendering the organ 
non-functional, while a mean dose of 50 Gy to the pharyngeal constrictors carries a 20% 
risk of long-term dysphagia and aspiration.  (
Eisbruch A, Ten Haken RK, Kim HM , et al.)  
(Blanco AI, Chao KS, El Naqa I , et al. )  (Kuhnt T, Jirsak N, Muller AC , et al.)  (Levendag PC, 
Teguh DN, Voet P , et al. )  (Debelleix C, Pointreau Y, Lafond C , et al.)  Since these normal 
structures directly abut against areas standardly treated to 60 Gy, it is often impossible to keep these normal structures below their radia tion dose constraints.  Furthermore, using 
twice-daily fractionation with smaller radiation doses has been previously demonstrated to decrease toxicity in head and neck patients.   Thus an adjuvant therapy strategy that 
utilizes both decreased total radiation dose, and twice daily fractionation is expected to 
have a large impact on patient quality of life. 
 
 
1.5 Preliminary Data: Increased treatment sensitivity of HPV+ tumors 
 
Cell and animal studies have detailed the incr eased sensitivity of HPV-associated tumors 
to both radiation and chemotherapy.  Cell lines containing E6 isoforms associated with 
HPV have an eightfold reduction in survivin g cells fraction after receiving 10 Gy of 
radiation when compared to cell lines containing non-HPV related isoforms.  ( Pang E, 
Delic NC, Hong A , et al. )  In vitro studies of HPV-associated tumors implanted within 
immunocompetent mice have demonstrated complete clearance of tumor with 20 Gy of treatment while the HPV-negative counterparts demonstrated persistent growth after 20 
Gy.  The sensitivity of HPV-associat ed tumors was also seen with cisplatin in this study.   
Cisplatin in vivo cleared HPV-associated tumors but not HPV-negative tumors.  (Pradier O, Rave-Frank M, Lehmann J , et al. )
  Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 
patients with HPV-associated  tumors do not require as much chemotherapy nor radiotherapy for complete disease clearance.

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  1.6 Selection of Chemoradiation Dose   The doses and schedule for chemoradiation we re chosen based upon the results of prior 
and current multi-institutional studies.  Docetaxel at 15 mg/m2 was used as part of a radiosensitizing regimen in RTOG 0234 with a milder toxicity profile compared to 
cisplatin.  Preliminary results also sugg est that docetaxel may have a greater 
radiosensitizing effect when compared  with cisplatin.  (Le QT, Raben D.  et al.)  
 The radiation dose of 30-36 Gy in 1.5-1.8 Gy fractions b.i.d. was selected to be proportionally equivalent to the degree of dose reduction seen for HPV-status and treatment acceleration seen on past and current  multi-institutional clinical trials.  Using 
the linear quadratic model for determining a biologically equivalent dose (where n = # fractions, d = fractional dose, and α/β = 10):   
 


  /1dnd BED 
 
yields that 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions is equivalent to 34.5 Gy 10. (Hall EJ, Giaccia AJ., et 
al.)  
 
Concerning HPV-status, ECOG 1308 is an ongoing multi-institutional trial for definitive 
treatment of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers.  The standard of care for treating definitive oropharyngeal cancers is 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (84 Gy
10) with concurrent 
cisplatin.  On ECOG 1308, patients receive induction chemotherapy followed by 54 Gy 
in 2 Gy fractions (64.8 Gy 10) with concurrent cetuximab.  (Peres J.)  This translates into a 
23% dose reduction in chemoradiation compar ed with standard of care due to HPV-
positivity.  Concerning accelerated radiation, a multi-institutional trial run by the University of Chicago (9502b) used 39 Gy in 1.5 Gy b.i.d. fractions (44.85 Gy
10) for microscopic 
disease while the standard dose for microscopic disease is 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions 
(63.72 Gy 10.)  (Haraf DJ, Rosen FR, Stenson K, et al. )  This translates into a 29% dose 
reduction compared with standard of care due to treatment acceleration. 
 
Combining the dose reduction due to HPV-pos itivity and treatment acceleration yields a 
dose reduction of 52% compared to standard of care.  A dose reduction of 52% on the 
standard of care dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (72 Gy 10) is equal to 34.56 Gy 10, a figure 
essentially equivalent to 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions bid.   
 
In terms of normal tissue toxicity (using an α/β = 3), 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions is equal to 
45 Gy 3.  This compares favorably to the equivalent normal tissue dose of the standard 
post-operative dose (60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions), which is 100 Gy 3. 
 
1.7 QOL Evaluation 
 
Quality of life will be measured using previously validated metrics and compared to a prospective cohort of similar patients under standard treatment.  Acute effects will be 
assessed weekly during treatment using the CTCAE version 4.  After the completion of radiation and chemotherapy, the patient will r eceive clinical follow-up including physical 
MC1273

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  examination, flexible nasopharyngoscopy, and late effect assessment (xerostomia with 
the University of Michigan Inventory, dysphagia with the MD Anderson Dysphagia 
Inventory, quality of life with the Performa nce Status Scale for Head and Neck) every 3 
months for the first two years.   
 
A baseline swallowing assessment consisting of a videofluroscopic examination, 
including a modified barium swallow study, and an esophagogram will be performed by 
Speech Therapy after surgery, before the initiation of radiation.   Swallowing will be scored (yes, no) for aspiration, penetrati on, velopharyngeal incompetence, epiglottic 
everson, tongue base retraction, and pharyngeal swallow response using metric outlined by Eisbruch et al.  (Eisbruch A, Teresa L, Bradford CR, et al.)  A swallowing assessment 
will be performed by Speech Therapy after surgery, before the initiation of radiation, and 
will be repeated at one month and 12 months after the completion of protocol treatment

7.4 RADIATION THERAPY  
NOTE: FOR THIS STUDY, IMRT AND IGRT ARE MANDATORY 
Dose Specifications for both Arms 
The prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 30-36 Gy in 1.5-1.8 Gy twice-daily fraction size 
(total of 20 fractions). Radiotherapy should aim to begin on a Monday. The daily dose will be prescribed such that 100% of the PTV volume receives at least 30 Gy.  PTV 
coverage has precedence over normal tissue constraints.

7.41 Technical Factors 
Treatment Planning/Delivery : Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation is 
required. Any treatment planning and delivery system that has been credentialed for head and neck IMRT is acceptable. 
7.42 Image Guidance for IGRT : Daily image guidance of IMRT may be achieved 
using any one or more of the following techniques: 
 Orthogonal kilovoltage (KV) images, e.g. ExacTrac; 
 Linear-accelerator mounted kV and MV conebeam CT images; 
 
The institution’s procedure to register treatment day imaging dataset with the 
reference dataset should comply with the following recommendations: 
MC1273 
 19  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   Region-of-Interest (ROI) or “clip box” fo r fusion should be set to encompass 
the high dose PTV and adjacent spinal cord ; if the supraclavicular region is a 
part of the target volume the ROI should extend to the C6 level; 
 If the fusion software allows the user to create an irregular ROI (e.g., ExacTrac), treatment room objects seen on in-room X-rays should be excluded from the registration; 
 Both manual (e.g., based on bony anatomy) and automatic (e.g., based on mutual information) types of registration can be used; the result of the fusion 
must be visually checked for the ali gnment of the bony anatomy, such as 
vertebral bodies and applicable soft tissue structures (e.g., optic nerves and/or 
optic chiasm). 
 Following the registration, the translationa l and (if the appropriate technology is 
available) rotational corrections should be applied to the treatment couch. If all the 
variances are less than 2.5 mm (this typically corresponds to one half of the usual PRV 
margin), the treatment can proceed without correction (however, the physician/team may 
elect to perform adjustments even for a va riance < 2.5 mm). If one or more corrections 
are 2.5-5 mm, adjustment is necessary prior to treatment; however, re-imaging is not mandatory. If one or more of the corrections are larger than 5 mm, the imaging must be 
repeated in addition to performing table/positioning adjustments. 
 
7.43 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization 7.431 Patients must have an immobiliza tion device (e.g., aquaplast mask) made 
prior to treatment planning CT scan. 
 
7.432 The treatment planning CT scan should be performed with IV contrast so 
that the major vessels of the neck are easily visualized. The treatment 
planning CT scan must be performed  with the immobilization device and 
in the treatment position. Slice thickness should be 0.3 cm. 
 7.5 Target and Normal Tissue Volume Definitions 
 
7.51 Definition of Target Volumes 
 
7.510 CTV_HIGH: This volume will receive 1.8 Gy per day bid and will 
only apply to patients who have ECE.  This volume will be restricted 
to the prior location of the ECE-involved lymph node, expanded by 1.5 cm, and shaving off of bone and relevant normal anatomy.  In the instance where the exact ECE-involved lymph node is unclear, CTV_HIGH will be defined as the nodal station from which the ECE-involved node originated.  For questions, contact the Primary 
Investigator, Dr. Daniel J. Ma. 
 7.511 CTV_LOW: This volume will receive 1.5 Gy per day bid. CTV will 
include the primary tumor bed (based on preoperative imaging, preoperative physical exam/endosc opy, operative findings, pathologic 
findings) plus region(s) of grossly involved lymphadenopathy. This volume may approach the skin but should not approach < 2mm. It is recognized that after surgery, there can be considerable distortion of 
MC1273 
 20  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  normal anatomy. If possible, map preoperative GTV(s) onto the postoperative radiation therapy pla nning CT scan, and add appropriate 
margins for microscopic spread (1.5-2  cm).  CTV also will include the 
bilateral necks.  This generally means encompassing nodal levels 2a, 3, 
and 4 for all cases. Nodal levels 1, 2b, 5a, and 5b are included in CTV in 
selected circumstances. Ip silateral neck irradiation for the involved hemi-
neck will be allowed for a well-late ralized tonsillar cancer. For questions, 
contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Daniel J. Ma.   
 7.512  Planning Target Volumes (PTVs): In general, the PTV should not go outside of the skin surface; if it does exceed the skin surface, the 
application of bolus material over this portion of the PTV may be 
considered but is generally not recommended.  
 
7.513  PTV Expansion With Daily IGRT 
The minimum CTV-to-PTV expansion is 2.5 mm (a larger expansion 
may be necessary for a target volume subject to significant intra-fraction 
variability.  In general, the CTV- to-PTV expansion (with IGRT) should 
not exceed 5 mm. 
 
7.52 Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs) 
 
7.521  Spinal Cord: The cord begins at the cranial-cervical junction (i.e., the top 
of the C1 vertebral body). Superior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior border of th e spinal cord is at approximately T3-
4 (i.e., just below the lowest slice level that has PTV on it). The spinal cord shall be defined based on the treatment planning CT scan. In 
addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spinal cord shall be 
defined. The PRVcord = cord + 5 mm in each dimension. This is irrespective of whether or not IGRT is used. 
 7.522  Brainstem: The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial-cervical junction where it meets the sp inal cord. For the purposes of this 
study, the superior most portion of the brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior cli noid. The brainstem shall be defined 
based on the treatment planning CT scan. In addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) brainstem shall be defined. The PRVbrainstem = brainstem + 3 mm in each dimension. 
 7.523  Lips and Oral Cavity: These should be contoured as 2 separate structures as the goal is to keep the lip dose mu ch lower than the oral cavity dose. 
The definition of lips is self-explanatory. For non-oral cavity cancers, the oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the 
anterior ½ to 2/3 of the oral tongue /floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and 
palate. For oral cavity cancers, the oral cavity will be defined as the 
subset of this composite structure that does not overlap with PTV. 
 
MC1273 
 21  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  7.524  Parotid Glands: Parotid glands will be defined based on the treatment planning CT scan.  Parotid gland volu me will not include any portion of 
any of the CTVs, although they can overlap the PTVs. 
 7.526  OARpharynx: This will be defined as the “uninvolved” posterior pharyngeal wall plus adjacent constrictor muscles. This extends from the 
superior constrictor region (the infe rior pterygoid plates level) to the 
cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cric oid cartilage level). This should not 
overlap the PTVs. 
 
7.527  Cervical Esophagus: This will be defined as a tubular structure that starts 
at the bottom of OARpharynx and extends to the thoracic inlet. 
 
7.528  Glottic/Supraglottic Larynx (GSL): Obvi ously, for patients who have had 
a total laryngectomy, this structure is  not applicable. This will be defined 
as a “triangular prism shaped” volume that begins just inferior to the 
hyoid bone and extends to the cric oid cartilage inferiorly and extends 
from the anterior commissure to include  the arytenoids. This includes the 
infrahyoid but not suprahyoid epiglottis. 
 
7.529a Mandible: This includes the entire boney structure of the mandible from 
TMJ through the symphysis. It is recognized that for oral cavity cancers, 
this may overlap with CTVs and PTVs. 
 
7.529b Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets: This will be defined as tissue 
located between the skull base and thor acic inlet that is not included in 
either the target volumes or the normal tissues described above. 
 
7.6 Treatment Planning and Delivery 
 
7.61  Management of the Low Neck/Supr aclavicular Region (No Match) 
No Match: The entire clinical target volume (CTV) [upper and lower neck and 
primary tumor bed] is irradiated with IMRT. There is no match line between 
upper and lower portions of the regions at risk. In this technique, limiting 
radiotherapy dose to organs at risk (OARs), e.g., the cervical esophagus, is entirely achieved by inverse treatment planning via IMRT algorithms.  
 
7.62  IMRT Dose Prescription to PTVs 
See Section 6.4.1 for definitions of CTVs and PTVs. As described in Section 6.1, 
prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 30-36 Gy in 1.5-1.8 Gy twice-daily fraction 
size. For inverse planning IMRT, the goal is for 100% of the PTV_LOW to receive ≥ 1.5 Gy / fraction.  It is recognized that portions of the PTV_LOW close 
to the skin may receive significantly l ess than 30 Gy. This is acceptable as long 
as cold spots within PTV do not exist at  a depth deeper than 8 mm beneath the 
skin (see Section 6.7, compliance criteria).  At least 98% of PTV_HIGH should receive at least 1.8 Gy / fraction.  For prioritization, PTVs will be the highest priority target structure.  
 
7.63  IMRT Dose Constraints to Normal Structures 
MC1273 
 22  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  There are two goals for the dose constraints in this protocol.  First, structures such as the parotid glands and the minor salivary glands within the oral cavity 
have a continuous, inverse relationship between dose and function.  Thus the 
dose constraints for these structures reflect what should be achievable using IMRT techniques.  Second, the dose recei ved by critical structures such as the 
spinal cord and brainstem may limit the ability for re-irradiation if such treatment 
is required.  Thus the dose constraints on these structures have been set 
conservatively to facilitate possible fu ture interventions. PTV coverage has 
precedence over normal tissue constraints.  
 
7.631  Spinal Cord : The PRVcord (as defined in Section 6.4.2.1) should not 
exceed 35 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spinal cord PRV should not exceed 30 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.01 cc.  
 7.632  Brainstem : The PRVbrainstem (as defined in Section 6.4.2.2) should not 
exceed 35 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm).  
 7.634  Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possibl e. The mean dose should be < 
15 Gy.  
 
7.635  Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose 
should be < 20 Gy. 
 
7.636  Parotid Glands : In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than 
the other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid 
gland to receive a mean dose of < 10 Gy. Otherwise, the goal will be for 
the total mean parotid dose to be < 15 Gy. 
 7.637  Submandibular Glands:   If either submandibular gland is outside of the 
target volume, the goal will be for a mean dose for that gland to be <20 Gy.  Otherwise reduce the dose as much as possible. 
7.637  OARpharynx : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 7.638  Cervical Esophagus : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 7.639a  Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL) : Reduce the dose as much as 
possible.  
 7.639b  Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 
7.7 Compliance Criteria  
Treatment breaks must be clearly indicate d in the treatment record along with the 
reason(s) for the treatment break(s). Radiation breaks, if necessary, should not exceed one treatment day. Radiation breaks should be  allowed only for resolution of severe acute 
toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical reasons. Any 
radiation break(s) exceeding one treatment day for reasons other than toxicity/illness will 
be considered a major protocol deviation.

7.8  Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4 will be utilized for grading all adverse events. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE, v. 4. A copy of the CTCAE, v. 4 can be  downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 Grade 3 therapy-induced mucositis and/or dy sphagia are expected to develop in about 
one third of patients. Nutritional evaluati on prior to the initiation of therapy for a 
prophylactic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placeme nt is highly recommended. Placement of a 
feeding tube should be recorded on the a ppropriate case report form, as should use of a 
feeding tube during and after treatment (e.g., greater than or less than 50% of nutrition by tube).   Other common radiation adverse events incl ude: fatigue, weight loss, regional alopecia, 
xerostomia, hoarseness, transient ear discomfort, dysgeusia, and skin erythema and desquamation within the treatment fields.  Less common long-term treatment adverse events include: hypothyroidism, loss of hearing, chronic swallowing dysfunction re quiring permanent feeding tube, and cervical 
fibrosis.  
 
Much less common radiation adverse events include: mandibular osteoradionecrosis (< 5% incidence with attentio n to dental recommendations), and cervical myelopathy (< 
0.1% with restriction of spinal cord dose to ≤ 30 Gy). 
 
 
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 
Strictly follow the modifications in this table.  If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions 
are based on adverse events observed since the prior dose. 
 
ALERT: ADR reporting may be required for some adverse events (See Section 10)

9.3 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study.  This includes blood 
product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or 
concurrent medical conditions.  All blood products and concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiem etics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days afte r the final dose will be recorded in the 
medical records.  
9.4 Diarrhea:  This could be managed con servatively with loperamide.  The recommended 
dose of loperamide is 4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.   
 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydr ation) and/or associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospitalized  for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte 
imbalances.  
9.5 For mucositis, esophagitis, and nutritional support: These may include analgesics, 
antiemetics, topical mouth rinses, skin creams /ointments, etc. The use of amifostine as a 
radioprotector is not allowed.

Next, determine whether the event is e xpected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Secti on 10.4).  Important: Expedited adverse 
event reporting requires submission of a MedWatch report(s). Expedited reports 
are to be completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in 
MC1273 
 26  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  Sections 10.4. All AEs reported via exped ited mechanisms must also be reported 
via the routine data reporting mechanisms  defined by the protocol (see Sections 
10.52 and 18.0). 
 10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current version is  a unique representation of a specific event 
used for medical documentation and scientif ic analysis and is a single MedDRA 
Lowest Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an esse ntial element of the Guidelines and, in 
general, relates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI. 
  
NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT  the same 
as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected  
 
 The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on the agent-specific information provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 
 Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312) NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64) 
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death 2) A life-threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospita lization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the abi lity to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  6) Important Medical Events (IME) that  may not result in death, be life th reatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312 .32; ICH E2A and ICH E6). 
 
ALL SERIOUS adverse events that m eet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the sponsor within

During Treatment Not 
Otherwise Warranting an Expedited Report   Complete a Notification Form: Grade 4 or 5 Non-AER Reportable Events/Hospitalization Form electronically via the MCCC Remote Data Entry System or paper form within 5 
working days of the date the clinical research associate (CRA) is 
aware of the event(s) necessitating the form. If an expedited written report has been submitted, this form does not need to be submitted. 
 
 10.5 Other Required Reporting 
 
10.51 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth 
defects, must be reported immediately if they occur at any time following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reported to the 
sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b). 
 
10.52  Death 
 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours.  Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
 
Reportable categories of Death   
 
 Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
 
 Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by cessation of 
life during the first 28 days of life. 
 
 Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
 
MC1273 
 29  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (d efined as instant or within 
one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
 
 Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 
5 “Neoplasms benign, maligna nt and unspecified (incl 
cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the 
system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. 
 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
 
 A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not 
considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 
 All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an IND/IDE be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML]) 
 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
10.54 Second Malignancy 
 
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy 
(and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second 
malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.

the event-monitoring phase and be followed per Section 18.0. 
 
13.2 Patients who go off protocol treatment or observation for reasons other than recurrence 
will go to the event-monitoring phase and be followed per Section 18.0. 
 13.3 Patients that complete all adjuvant treatme nt will then be followed during the observation 
phase at 14 days post-XRT, 1 month post-XRT, followed by every 3 months post-XRT for 2 years, followed by every 6 months for year 3, then annually for years 4 & 5.   
 
13.4 A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each a nd every eligibility criteria for study entry.  
The patient may continue treatment off-protocol at the discretion of the physician as long 
as there are no safety concerns, and the patient  was properly registered. The patient will 
go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable).  
 
 If the patient received treatment, all data  up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted.  Event m onitoring will be required per Section 18.0 
of the protocol.  
 If the patient never received treatment, on-study material must be submitted.  
 
13.5 A patient is deemed a major violation , if protocol requirements regarding treatment in

14.4 Background and Methodology 
  
14.41 Circulating Cell Free DNA (cfDNA): Several studies indicate that circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) includes representation of key genetic alterations related to cancer progression or resistance to systemic therapy; these alterations 
include mutations of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53 ) and oncogenes (e.g., 
PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF ). Commercially available platforms exist with a 
predefined set of genes and point mutations of interest for use across multiple 
malignancies. A more flexible system for individualized monitoring is needed. 
Mayo Clinic Rochester has developed an internal assay for this purpose.  
 
 
 

MC1273 35  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   15.0 Drug Information  
 
15.1 Docetaxel (Taxotere®, TATER) Commercial Supply 
 
15.11 Background: Antineoplastic Agent, Antimicrotubular, Taxane derivative. 
Docetaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers, and inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin which stabilizes microtubules in the cell. This results in inhibition of DNA, RNA,  and protein synthesis. Most activity 
occurs during the M phase of the cell cycle. 
 
15.12 Formulation: Note: Docetaxel is now available as a one-vial formulation in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. The older formulation included 2 vials 
which consisted of a concentrated docetaxel  vial and a diluent vial, resulting in a 
reconstituted concentration of 10 mg/mL. Admixture errors could occur due to the concentration difference between the new formulations of 10 mg/mL and 20 
mg/mL and the old formulation (10 mg/mL). Do not use the two-vial formulation with the one-vial formulation for the same admixture product. 
 
15.13 Drug procurement: 
 
Preparation, storage, and stability : Storage conditions:
  Store the packaged 
docetaxel between 2 and 25 C (36 and 77 F).  Retain in the original package to 
protect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product. 
 
One-vial formulation: Note: One-vial formulation is available in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. Further reconstitution with diluent is 
not required. Further dilute for infusion in 250-500 mL of NS or D 5W in a non-
DEHP container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thoroughly. Solutions prepared from the one-vial formulation and diluted for infu sion should be used within 4 hours of 
preparation (infusion should be  completed within 4 hours). 
 Two-vial formulation:  Vials should be diluted with 13% (w/w) ethanol/water 
(provided with the drug) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Do not shake. Further dilute for infusion in 250-500 mL of NS or D
5W in a non-DEHP 
container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thorou ghly. Diluted solutions of the two-vial 
formulation are stable in the vial for 8 hours at room temperature or under 
refrigeration. Solutions prepared with th e two-vial formulation and diluted for 
infusion in D
5W or NS are stable for up to 4 weeks (Thiesen, 1999) at room 
temperature of 15ºC to 25ºC (59ºF to 77ºF) in polyolefin containers; however, the 
manufacturer recommends use within 4 hours (infusion should be completed within 4 hours).  
15.14 Administration:   Administer IV infusion over 1-hour through nonsorbing 
polyethylene lined (non-DEHP) tubi ng; in-line filter is not necessary. Note: 
Premedication with dexamethasone 8 – 10 mg orally twice daily for 3-5 days, 
beginning the day before docetaxel administration is recommended to decrease the incidence and severity of fluid retention and prevent hypersensitivity 
reactions and pulmonary/peripheral edema.  When administered as sequential 
MC1273 36  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  infusions, taxane derivatives should be admi nistered before platinum derivatives 
(cisplatin, carboplatin) to limit myel osuppression and to enhance efficacy.  
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : Docetaxel exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics at the recommended dosage range. 
Distribution:  Extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding; 
Vd: 80-90 L/m2, V dss: 113 L (mean steady state) 
Protein binding:  ~94% to 97% 
Metabolism:  Hepatic; oxidation via CYP3A4 to metabolites 
Half-life elimination: Terminal: ~11 hours Excretion: Feces (~75%, <8% as unchanged drug); Urine (<5%)  
  15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :   
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate  (major) of CYP3A4; Inhibits  
CYP3A4 (weak).  Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided. If systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, a 50% reduction in docetaxel 
dose should be considered along with close monitoring for docetaxel 
toxicity. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 for example inhibitors. 
When administered as sequential infu sions, observational studies indicate 
a potential for increased toxicity when platinum derivatives (carboplatin, cisplatin) are administered before taxane derivatives (docetaxel, paclitaxel). Taxane derivatives may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of 
anthracyclines. 
Decreased Effect: CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of paclitaxel. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 for example inducers. 
Ethanol/Herb/Nutraceutical Interactions : Avoid ethanol (due to GI 
irritation). Avoid St John’s wort (may decrease docetaxel levels). 
 15.17 Known potential adverse events: Consult the package insert for the most current and complete information. Percentages reported for docetaxel 
Monotherapy; frequency may vary de pending on diagnosis, dose, liver 
function, prior treatment, and premedication. The incidence of adverse events was usually higher in patients with elevated liver function tests. 
 
Common known potential toxicities, > 10% :

15.18 Nursing guidelines -  
 
15.181 Monitor CBC closely, as neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are 
common and may be life threatening, and dose limiting.  Instruct patient to report any signs or symptoms of infection, any unusual bruising, or bleeding.  
 15.182  Administer antiemetics as ordered.  Evaluate for their effectiveness. 
 15.183  Monitor for signs/symptoms of  hypersensitivity reactions that may 
include chills, rigors, dyspnea, bronchospasms, etc.  Stop infusion 
immediately and administer proper emergency treatment. 
 
15.184 Because of the risk of anaphylaxi s and development of edema, instruct 
patient that is imperative to take steroid premedications as ordered.  
 15.185  Instruct patient on proper oral care, as mucositis may occur. 
 
15.186 Advise patient about alopecia.  15.187 Monitor liver function tests. 
 
MC1273 38  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  15.188 Drug is a vesicant.  Monitor infusion site frequently for signs of irritation 
or infiltration.  Drug extravasation cau ses acute streaking, burning pain, 
and discoloration at the site.  Skin may be reddened for several weeks 
and occasionally blister and/or peel.  Reactions are usually reversible 
over time.   Because of this centr al venous access may be necessary.  
Discuss with MD if patient has poor peripheral venous access.  If 
docetaxel concentrate or diluted solu tion comes into contact with skin, 
wash with soapy water immediately.   If it comes into contact with 
mucosa, wash with warm water immediately. 
 15.189a Instruct patient to report any sign s of peripheral neuropathy to the health 
care team (pain, numbness, tingling). 
 15.189b Monitor for signs and symptoms of  fluid retention, weight gain, ascites 
and CHF.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 Note:   The first patient enrolled will be excluded from all analyses because they received Docetaxel (15 
mg/m2) on days 1, 8 and Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 15 as well.  All other patients will only 
receive Day 1 and 8 of Docetaxel (15 mg/m2 each da y).  This first patient was still eligible per 
protocol.  Per Addendum 1, day 15 was removed for all subsequent patients. 
 In addition, this study will be st ratified into two patient cohorts: pa tients who do not have ECE (“cohort 
A”) and patients who have ECE (“cohor t B”).  Cohort B patients will be treated with a slightly higher 
MC1273 39  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  radiation dose (36 rather than 30 Gy), but will be fo llowed and evaluated in the same fashion as patients 
in Cohort A.  Each cohort will be independently evaluated for all the endpoints described below 
 
16.1   Overview:  This phase II study, with a feasability analysis in the first 5 pts, will 
evaluate adjuvant hyperfractionated radi ation and docetaxel for HPV-associated 
Oropharynx Cancer using a 1-stage design.  Standard therapy for this disease 
yields a 2-year cumulative incidence of local/regional failure of approximately 
10% (Ang KK, Harris J, Wheeler R, et al.), but it also has high rates of grade 3 or worse adverse events (Bernier J, Domenge C, Ozsahin M, et al).  Given the high 
rates of severe or worse functional mucosal adverse events (AEs), especially, it is of high interest to find a chemo/RT combination that can still yield low rates of 
local/regional failure with reduced AE rates.  If this new treatment combination 
can achieve a 2-year cumulative inciden ce of local/regional failure of no more 
than 20% (primary endpoint), while significantly reducing the acute grade 3+ functional mucosal AE rate as compared to historical controls (key secondary endpoint), further study would be warranted.  In addition to the 2-year cumulative incidence rate and the acute functional mucosal adverse event rate, 
this study will assess many additional sec ondary endpoints, including, overall 
survival, disease-free survival, distant failure rates, quality of life (QOL) 
measures, swallowing studies, other acute adverse events, and late adverse events 
and translational studies.     
 
16.2 Primary Endpoint: The 2-year cumulative in cidence of local/regional failure associated 
with adjuvant hyperfractionated radiation and docetaxel in patients with intermediate risk 
HPV+ Associated Oropharynx Cancer.  All pa tients meeting the eligibility criteria who 
have signed a consent form, and begun treatme nt will be considered evaluable for the 2-
year cumulative incidence rate.   
 
16.21  Analysis plans: Given that the cu rrent standard therapy yields a 2-year 
cumulative incidence of local/regional failure of around 10% (Ang KK, Harris J, 
Wheeler R, et al.), this study treatment will be of interest for further study if the   2-year cumulative incidence of local/reg ional failure does not exceed 20%, while 
also significantly reducing AE rates (see 16.3, key secondary endpoint).  The 2-
year cumulative incidence of local/regional failure will be estimated by the 
competing risk method (Gooley, et al.), where the competing risks are distant failures and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from distant failure or non
-
Oropharynx Cancer).  If the 2-year cumula tive incidence of local/regional failure 
does not exceed 20%, this will give eviden ce that a 2-year local/regional failure 
rate of around 10% can not be ruled out, since the 2-sided 85% confidence interval would contain 10% (85% CI: 10 – 30%) with 35 evaluable patients  using nQuery Advisor version 6.01 for confidence intervals for a single proportion.   
  
16.3  Key Secondary Endpoint:  To characterize the acute grade 3 or higher functional mucosal 
adverse events (up to 1 month post-XRT) associated with adjuvant hyperfractionated 
radiation and docetaxel in patients with in termediate risk HPV+ Associated Oropharynx 
Cancer.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form, and 
begun treatment will be considered evalua ble for this key secondary endpoint.  
 
16.31 Definition of success:  A success will be defined as a patient who does   
MC1273 40  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  not experience a grade 3+ functional mucosal adverse event in the first 
month post- XRT.   
16.32 Power, Sample Size:  The current standard of care yields acute grade 3+ 
functional mucosal AE rates of approximately 40% (Bernier J, Domenge C, Ozsahin M, et al.).  This regimen will be of high interest based on safety if the acute grade 3+
 functional mucosal AE rate could be reduced 
to around 20% or lower.    
With 35 evaluable patients per cohort,  this study would have 85% power 
to detect an acute grade 3+ functional mucosal AE-free rate of 80%, with 
a 0.06 level of significance if the true grade 3+ AE-free rate is 60%.  The decision rule for this trial is as follows:  If 25 or fewer patients are grade 3+ AE-free after 1 month post-XRT, we will conclude that the AE rate is 
not significantly reduced in this patient population.  If 26 or more patients are grade 3+ AE-free, this will be considered adequate evidence 
of safety for this treatment and it may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies, especially if the primary endpoint discussed above meets criteria as well (see 16.21).  
 
16.4  Sample Size:   We will enroll 35 evaluabl e patients per cohort  to the combination of 
adjuvant hyperfractionated radiation and docetaxel (total patients = 70 evaluable patients.)  We anticipate accruing an add itional 5 patients per cohort to account for 
ineligibilities, cancellations, major violations , or other reasons.  Therefore, maximum 
accrual will be 80 patients. Following the a pproval of addendum 6, overall accrual will 
increase to 81 patients so that additional pa tient data can be used for analysis.  
 
16.5  Accrual Time and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is approximately 1 
patient per month or 12 patients per year per cohort. Therefore, the accrual period for this 
Phase II study is expected to be around 3 years.  The final analysis can begin 
approximately 5 years after the trial begins, i. e., as soon as the last patient registered has 
been observed for 24 months. 
 
16.6 Safety Analysis in First 5 patients:  In th e first 5 patients, acute adverse events (up to 1 
month post-XRT) will be closely monitored to make sure that nothing unusual occurs.  
Based on the current standard of care, we e xpect that no more than 50% of patients will 
have a grade 3+ non-hematologic AE (regardless of  attribution).  If 3 or more patients in 
the first 5 have a grade 3+ non-hematologic AE, we will consider lowering the dose even further for further evaluation.  In addition, if 1 or more of the first 5 patients has a local or 
distant failure or expires from this cancer during the first 6 months, the dose for the study may be modified going forward.  Accrual will continue while we wait for the first 5 
patients to be followed for a minimum of 6 months.  As long as the dose remains the same, the first 5 patients will be included in the final analysis as well.     
 16.7 Definitions and Analyses of Secondary Endpoints: 
 
16.71   Overall Survival (OS) is defined as th e time from registration to death due to any 
cause. The distribution of OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier
 (Kaplan E, Meier P).   
 
MC1273 41  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  16.72  Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from registration to the first of 
either disease recurrence or death. The distribution of DFS will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan E, Meier P).    
 
16.73 Distant Failure Rates:   The 2-year cumulative incidence of distant failure will be 
estimated by the competing risk method (Gooley, et al.), where the competing 
risks are local/regional failures and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from local/regional failure or non-Oropharynx Cancer).   
 
16.74    Quality of Life (QOL): The patient QOL will be measured using the following 
tools:   1) XeQOLS form, 2) Eq-5D, 3) FACT H & N (Version 4), 4)  
Dermatology Life Quality Index; and QLQ H&N35 (see QOL Booklet).  These 
QOL measures will be assessed at baseline, 14 days post-XRT and 3, 12 and 24 
months post-XRT.  These QOL scores will be explored descriptively to detect 
patterns and substantial changes over time. In addition, differences between post-baseline and baseline QOL scores will be analyzed using a paired-sample t-test or the nonparametric equivalent to see if the QOL tends to improve over time with 
treatment.   
 
16.75 Patient Assessment Form (Appendix V) : The data from this form will be 
analyzed descriptively, using frequenci es and percentages for each timepoint 
(baseline, 14 days post-XRT, and 3, 12 and 24 months post-XRT). 
 
16.76 Swallowing Studies:  Swallowing will be scored (yes, no) for aspiration, 
penetration, velopharyngeal incompeten ce, epiglottic everson, tongue base 
retraction, and pharyngeal swallow response using the metric outlined by 
Eisbruch et al.  (Eisbruch A, Teresa L, Bradford CR, et al.)  Swallowing assessments will be completed at baseline, along with 1and 12 months after the 
completion of protocol XRT.  The swallowing questions will be explored 
descriptively to detect patterns and subs tantial changes over time. In addition, 
McNemar’s test for paired samples w ill be used to see if the swallowing 
questions significantly change over time for each post-baseline timepoint.   
 16.77  Acute Adverse Events (up to 1 month po st-XRT):  All eligible patients that have 
initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing acute adverse events, defined as any adverse event that occurs in the 1
st month post-XRT.  The 
maximum grade for each type of acute adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be revi ewed to determine patterns, especially 
focusing on grade 3+ adverse events, regardless of attribution to the study 
treatment. 
 
16.78 Late Adverse Events (up to 2 years post- XRT):    All eligible patients that have 
initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient for up to 2 years post-treatment, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine patterns, especially  focusing on grade 3+ non-hematologic 
adverse events, regardless of attributio n to the study treatment.  Hematologic 
adverse events will not be followed closely long-term given that adjuvant 
treatment is only given for 1 month.   
 
MC1273 42  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  16.79 Translational studies: Due to the limited sample size in this study, the proposed 
translational studies are considered expl oratory and hypothesis generating.   
Tumor specimens (at baseline) will be assessed for E6/E7 mRNA of HPV16 and 
other high-risk serotypes on a chromogenic RNA ISH assay called RNAscope 
(see 17.4).  In addition, serum collected before and one week post-radiation will be assessed for changes in TGF-beta1 levels (see 14.3).  We will also assess the pre-surgery blood samples as well for patients that are pre-registered to the trial.  We plan to correlate these markers w ith clinical endpoints like acute adverse 
events, cumulative incidence rates of lo cal/regional failure, overall survival, and 
disease-free survival.  Statistical and graphi cal techniques will be used to explore 
the relationships between tumor markers and clinical data. For time-to-event 
endpoints, we will use Cox proportional hazards models, and for binary endpoints we will use Logistic regression models. In addition, we will use the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests to test the association between categorical 
marker data and binary endpoints. All th ese statistical techniques will allow us to 
explore whether these tumor markers are potentially related to the clinical 
endpoints of acute adverse events, cumula tive incidence rates of local/regional 
failure, overall survival, and disease-free survival.  
16.8     Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.81   The principal investigator(s) and th e study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing.  The trial is monitored continually by the study team who are notified of every grade 4 and 5 event in real time.  The Mayo Clinic 
Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Mon itoring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on 
reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office.  Any safety issues requiring protocol changes are communicated through protocol amendments.   
 
16.82    Adverse Event Stopping Rules:   The stopping rules specified below are based on  
the knowledge available at study development.  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduc t of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The st udy team may choose to suspend accrual 
because of unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. 
 
Based on data from previous studies, we  expect about 50% of patients to 
experience Grade 3+ non-hematologic adverse events within 1 month post-
treatment.  Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe adverse events that satisfy  any of the following criteria: 
 
 If at any time 12 or more patients in the first 20  treated patients 
experience a Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse event (regardless of attribution). 
 If at any time 2 or more Grade 5 ev ents occur in the first 20 treated 
patients (regardless of attribution). 
 If after the first 20  patients have been treated:  
MC1273 43  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  o 60% or more of all patients experience a Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic adverse event (regardless of attribution). 
o 10% or more of all patients experience a Grade 5 adverse event 
(regardless of attribution). 
 
We note that we will review all Grade 5 adverse events on a case-by-case basis 
as well (regardless of attribution), and may suspend accrual after just one Grade 5 event, if we feel it is necessary for patient safety. 
 
16.9 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
(i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.  For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 60 months after 
the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” 
(PECD) for this study is when the last patient  registered has been followed for at least 2 
years for the 2-year cumulative incidence rate.   
 
16.10 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
16.11  This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or 
ethnic origin. 
 
16.12  There is no information currently ava ilable regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender , or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Theref ore, although the planned analysis will, as 
always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
 
16.13   The geographical region served by the Mayo Clinic, has a population which 
includes approximately 5% minorities.  We expect about 5% of patients will be 
classified as minorities by race and about 40% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table:

Either 2-6 FFPE tissues curls or samples from fresh  frozen tumor will be collected from original 
tumor biopsy, tumor removed during surgery, or r ecurrent tumor specimens. This tissue is already 
being collected and shared through  protocol 50-97.  This tissue will be 
used for determining tumor-specific genetic alterations. Detected alterations may be compared to 
upwards of 50 samples of normal tissue from IRB 13-000883. 
 
Additionally, we may examine tumor specimens from Tissue Registry through our collaborators 
either within Mayo Clinic or at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).  This may 
include whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, focused exome sequencing, mate-
pair analysis, HPV-subtyping, immunologic profiling, RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, cytogenetics, molecular testing, protein expression, or immunohistochemistry.  Towards this end, up to 30 slides (5 microns thick) will be retr ieved from tissue blocks from the primary tumor, 
nodal disease, and/or sites of metastatic/ recurrent  disease.  If slides need to be obtained from 
FNA or core biopsy specimens, particular care will be taken to minimize the slides taken so that 
the block is not exhausted.  Slides sent to MS KCC will be de-identifie d of patient data and 
labelled with the patient st udy number from MC1273.

Guidelines for the use of IMRT (including Intra-Thoracic Treatments) 
 
3/2009 
 
 1. For all patients, as outlined in Section 7.0, th e prescription isodose must cover 100% of the PTV 
volume; therefore, the total dose in the PTV_LOW volume will be 3000 cGy.  The minimum 
acceptable dose within PTV_LOW will be 3000 cGy.  If the minimum dose falls below these 
parameters, an unacceptable deviation will be assi gned.  At least 98% of PTV_HIGH should be 
covered by 36 Gy.  The maximum dose for th e PTV should not exceed 115%.  If the maximum 
doses exceed these parameters, an unacc eptable deviation will be assigned. 
 
2. Up to 1 day of radiation treatment interruption is permitted for any reason. For interruptions of 2 
days or greater, an unacceptable deviation will be  assigned.  In the case of toxicity there should 
be no deviation for breaks greater than one day.

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  Appendix III 
 
Radiation Therapy Quality Control Guidelines 
 
 1. Tumor Volume Coverage 
a. No deviation -- coverage + < 1 cm of specified. 
b. Minor deviation -- coverage + > 1 to 2 cm of specified or failure to cover tumor volume + > 1/2 
specified margin. 
c. Major deviation -- > 2 cm of specified or no CT and/or MRI scans available to assess treatment 
volume appropriateness (if not initially available shoul d be requested) or failure to cover the target 
(tumor or tumor + edema) as defined in the protocol. 
 2. Isodoses - initial volume isodose plots are required on a mi nimum of three contours; one at central axis (CA), 
one superior to CA (2 cm below the superior field edge) and one inferior to CA (2 cm above the inferior field edge).  Boost volume isodose plot required at CA.   a. No deviation -- isodoses submitted as required, and inhomogeneity across the target volume shall be 
no greater than + 5%. 
*b. Minor deviation -- isodose information incomple te or inhomogeneity across the target volume > 5 
but < 10%. 
*c. Major deviation -- no isodoses submitted or  inhomogeneity across the target volume > 10%. 
 * Deviations would occur only if is odose information is incomplete or not submitted after there has been a 
request to submit complete isodose information. 
 3. Normal Tissues  Normal structures are only to be included within the radi ation field in as much as this is necessary to treat the 
primary tumor volume.  A minor deviation will result when normal structures are unnecessarily included, but this is not felt to result in unacceptable toxicity that w ould interfere with the scientific aims of the protocol.  
A major deviation will result when normal structures ar e unnecessarily included in the radiation therapy field 
and such inclusion is felt li kely to result in a major increase in toxicity which would potentially compromise 
the scientific goals of the study. 
 4. Other parameters: (dose per fraction, total dose, overall treatment time and portal films). 
a. No deviation -- +/- < 5% of protocol specification. 
b. Minor deviation -- +/- > 5% to 10% of protocol specification. 
c. Major deviation -- +/- > 10% of protocol specificati on or incomplete data (i.e. no portal or sim films, 
etc.) available for review (after additional request has been made). 
 
5. Any individual minor deviation will result in an ove rall score of minor deviation; any major deviation will 
result in an overall score of a major deviation.  Multiple minor deviations will not add up to a major 
deviation.

Patient Assessment Form  
 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:  
This form is completed by the investigator (rater) and submitted at each 
time point specified by the protocol, whether or not any of the patient 
assessment items (Q's 6,7,8) are answered.  
 
 
SUGGESTIONS  FOR ADMINISTRATION:  
These performance scales must be rated by health professionals such as 
physicians, nurses, nutritionists, etc. Ratings are determined through use 
of  an unstructured interview format. 
 
1 SCHEDULED  DATA  POINT  (CHECK  ONE) (1) 
1 = Pre- treatment assessment  
2 = At completion of radiotherapy  
3 = Four weeks followup

6 NORMALCY  OF DIET  (CHECK  ONE)  RATING (11) 
Begin by asking the patient what kind of foods are difficult for him/her 
to eat.  Based on patient's response, choose an item at the low end of 
the scale.  Move up the scale giving examples of foods in each category and ask patient if s/he can eat those food items.  The  
patient's score is the highest number  to which an affirmative response 
is received.  
100 = Full diet (no restrictions)  
90 = Peanuts  
80 = All meat  
70 = Carrots, celery  
60 = Dry bread and crackers  
50 = Soft, chewable foods (e.g., macaroni, canned/soft fruits, 
cooked vegetables, fish, hamburger , small pieces of meat)  
40 = Soft foods requiring no chewing (e.g., mashed 
potatoes, apple sauce, pudding)  
30 = Pureed foods (in blender)  
20 = Warm liquids  
10 = Cold liquids  
0 = Non-oral feeding (tube fed)  
 
7 PUBLIC  EATING  (CHECK  ONE)  RATING (12) 
Score the Public Eating scale by asking the patient where s/he eats, with whom s/he eats and whether s/he alters his/her diet according to 
where s/he is eating.  Choose the score beside the description 
that 
best fits the patient. 
100 = No restriction of place, food or companion (eats out 
at any opportunity)  
75 = No restriction of place, but restricts diet when in public (eats 
anywhere, but may limit intake to less "messy" foods, e.g., liquids)  
50 = Eats only in presence of selected persons in selected places  
25 = Eats only at home in presence of selected persons  
0 = Always eats alone 
 
8 UNDERSTANDABILITY OF SPEECH  (CHECK  ONE)  RATING (13) 
This scale is scored based on the interviewer's ability to understand the 
patient during conversation (in this case, based on conversation regarding 
the Normalcy of Diet and Public eating scale. Choose the score beside the 
description that best fits the patient. 
 
100 = Always understandable  
75 = Understandable most of the time; occasional 
repetition necessary  
50 = Usually understandable; face-to-face contact necessary 
25 = Difficult to understand  
0 = Never understandable; may use written communication

Best imaginable 
health state 
 
 
  
 
To help people say how good or bad a health state is, we have drawn a scale (rather like a 
thermometer) on which the best state you can imag ine is marked 100 and the worst state you can 
imagine is marked 0. 
  
We would like you to indicate on this scale how good or bad your  own  health   is  today,  in  
your  opinion. Please do this by drawing a line from the box below to whichever point on the scale 
indicates how good or bad your health state is today.

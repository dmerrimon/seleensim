mg/kg/hour for 23 hours  
 
7.2.2.  Study Drug Accountability, Storage  and Mode of Admi nistration  
 
Page 8 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019  The manufacturer of citrulline  will supply the study drug  in sufficient quantities to 
complete  the study. The study drug will be stored at ambient room temperature . 
The pharmacist will be asked to maintain a temperature log to document storage 
temperature conditions. The pharmacist w ill prepare and label all study drugs, and 
all labeling will meet standard req uirements. L -citrulline will be supplied from th e 
pharmacy as open label vials, and  administered as a 50 mg/mL (5%) isotonic 
solution, wit h distilled water as a suspending agent.  
 
6.4 Data Collection at Enrollment and Follow -up 
 
For this study, participant data will be collected by paper source documents.  Every 
effort should be made to collect all required data, including blood samples and to 
complete all assessments required for each visit as detailed in the study plan.  
 
Clinical information obtained as part of standard clinical care before the informed 
consent is signed may be used as part of the screening and evaluation process.  
 
The investigator will ensure the data are recorded on the CRFs as specified in the study 
protocol.  He will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data 
recorded.  
 
 
 
7 Blood Sample Processing  
 
7.2 Citrulline Pharmacokinetic and NOx metabolite sampling  
 
Plasma sampling for PK studies and NO x metabolites will be collected. As noted 
above, b aseline  PK and NOx testing will be performed just prior to giving the bolus  
(trough levels) , 10 minutes after the bolus  (peak level) , and then 30 minutes, 1 hour, 
2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours , 6 hours , 8 hours, 12 hours   and 24 hours after the bolus  
infusion.   
 
 
7.3 Collection and Processing of Blood Samples  
 
Ten ml of venous blood will be collected in collection tubes containing citrate or 
EDTA. Samples will be kept on ice and processed within 3 hours after collection. 
Specimens will be centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min and plasm a collected and 
stored at –80ºC. Samples will be sh ipped by overnight courier to Marshall Summar 
MD, Center for Genetic Medicine Research at the Children’s National Medical 
Center  for amino acid testing, and Paresh Ray, PhD at Jackson State University for 
nitric oxide testing.  
 
 
8.3 Amino Acid Analysis   
Page 9 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019   
Briefly, deproteinated  plasma samples will be subjected to cation exchange 
chromatography using a 4 -component pH and ionic strength graded lithium citrate 
buffer system on a Beckmann 7300 amino acid analyzer (Beckmann, Palo Alto, 
CA).  Arginine and citrulline  will be the main f ocus  as measurable products of urea 
cycle function , but will measure all urea cycle intermediates. In addition, the level of 
total essential amino acids (TEEA) to control for overall nutrition and metabolic stat e 
will be calculated. Analysis of amino acids  will be complete d as previously 
described . 
 
8.4 Nitric Oxide Assay  
 
NO will be measured by chemiluminescence using a Sievers 280 nitric oxide 
analyzer (NOA). Samples are mixed one part sample with two parts of cold ethanol 
at 00C for 30 minutes. Following centrifugation at 14000 RPM for 5 min, samples 
are injected into the NOA. This method relies on catalytic reduction of NOx by 
exposure to warm vanadium hydrochloride. Liberated NO is driven by nitrogen gas 
into an ozone chamber.  Light released by NO/O3 - interaction is captured by a 
photomultiplier tube and relayed to an analytical software program. A standard 
curve using sodium nitrite is required.  
 
8.5 Pharmacokinetic analysis  
 
Data obtained for each patient will be fit to a single -compartment pharmacokinetic 
model.   The appearance of citrulline in plasma is described by a zero -order process 
(rate of citrulline appearance, R app) to account for endogenous production, whereas 
the removal of citrulline is determined by a first -order process (constant of citrulline 
removal, k rem). It is assumed that the values of all parameters will remain constant 
for each patient during the course of plasma sampling. Origin   (OriginLab 
Corporation, Northhampton, MA) will be used to solve for the pharmacokinetic 
parameters using a weighted, least squares procedure to obtain simultaneous 
values for R app, Co (plasma concentration at time zero), k rem, and AUC (area under 
the curve).The volume of distribu tion (V d)  will be calculated from the total dose/C o 
and the half -life from 0.693/k rem. Clearance will be calculated from k rem multiplied by 
the V d. 
 
8 Safety Assessments  
 
Safety assessments will be collected as part of this bolus and continuous dose infusion,  
pharmacokinetic study.  Safety will be assessed throughout the infusion in all subjects, and 
monitored through 30 days after the end of the infusion. Subject safety will be assessed by 
monitoring adverse events (see section 10 for full detail), c linical laboratory tests, vital 
signs and physical examinations.  
 
8.2 Clinical Parameters  
 Vital Signs  
Page 10 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019   
Vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate) 
will be collected prior to the initiation of study drug and prior to each blood 
sample collection at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 
hours, 6 hours , 8, 12 hours  and 24 hours after the infusion.  
 
 Physical Examination  
 
A complete physical examination will be performed during the screening 
period.  If the drug infusion  occurs on a different day than the screening 
procedures are performed, then an abbreviated physical examination will 
be completed prior to the drug infusion.  A follow up complete physical 
examination will be performed at 24 hours  after the end of the inf usion.  
 
 
8.3 Laboratory Parameters  
 
Laboratory parameters will be evaluated at screening and then at 24 hours at 
completion of  infusion and then at 30  days after the infusion to include the 
following:  
 
 Complete Blood Count (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, MCV, platelet 
count)  
 Renal Function (Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), HCO3, 
Creatinine)  
 Liver Function (Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, alanine 
transferase, and total bilirubin) .  
 
9 Adverse /Serious Adverse  Events  
 
9.2 Adverse Event  (AE) Definition  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered a pharmaceutical  product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  AE may be reported by the subject, discovered 
by investigator  questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory 
test, or other means.   
 
At each evaluation, subject will  be interviewed to elicit potential ad verse reactions 
from the drug . The o ccurrence of an AE will be based on changes in the subject’s 
physical examination, laboratory results, and/or signs and symptoms. All AEs 
(except Grade 1 and 2 laboratory abnormalities that do not require an 
intervention), regard less of causal relationship , will be recorded in the case 
reporting form ( CRF) and source docu mentation. The Investigator will  determine 
the intensity of any AE according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Page 11 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019  Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 (see http://ctep.info.nih.gov) an d their 
causal  relationship.  
 
In this phase 1 trial, a participant with at least a grade 2 level of toxicity will be 
considered as dose -limiting for IV citrulline, and will be used as the stopping rule 
for testing further cohorts of participants.  
 
 
 10.2  Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
AE will be monitored and reported on a  CRF that includes the description of the 
event , onset date, stop date, and outcome. The subjects will be instructed to 
inform the  study personnel  or clinical staff of any AEs  experienced duri ng the 
trial. In addition, subject safety will be assessed by monitoring clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs and physical examinations.  Any subject who has an AE will be 
evaluated by the investigator and will be trea ted accordingly.  The investigator or 
designated study physicians will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the drug treatment (unrelated, possibly related, or probably related)  based on the 
following definitions:  
 
10.2.1. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
An AE or suspected AE is considered serious if , in the view the Investigator , it 
results in any of the following outcome  
 
1. Death;  
 
2. A life -threatening adverse event;  
 
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization, 
excluding  hospitalization for VOC re quired for inclusion into the study;  
 
4. A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
 
6. Other events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgic al intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed  above.  
 
10.2.2 . Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not described in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or if it is of  greater frequency and/or severity than mentioned in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. Unexpected, as  used in this definition, refers to an 
adverse drug event that has not been previously observed rather than from the 
Page 12 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019  perspective of such event not  being anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the pharmaceu tical product.  
 
10.2.3 . Relationship  
 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the event (not -related, unlikely -
related, possibly  related, probably related, or definit ely related) . The relationship  
of an adverse event will be assessed  using the following definitions:  
 
Not Related: Evidence exists that the adverse event definitely has an etiology 
other than the  investigational agent, such as a pre -existing condition or 
underlying disease, a concurrent  illness, or concomitant medication, and does 
not meet any of the criteria above.  
 
Unlikely: The causality of the AE is supported by enough evidence to reasonably 
suggest  that the event could more likely be attributed to something other than the 
investigational  product such as the underlying disease or  an intercurrent illness 
or injury.  
 
Possibly Related: A temporal relationship exists betwe en the event’s onset and 
investigational agent administration. Although the event may appear unlikely to 
be related to  the investigational agent, a relationship cann ot be ruled out with 
certainty, and/or the  event cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical 
state or concomitant treatment.  
 
Probably Related: A temporal relationship exists between the event’ s onset and 
investigational agent administration, and  the event appears with some degree of 
certainty to  be related to  investigational agent , based on the investigational 
agent’s known  therapeutic and pharmacologic actions. The event cannot be 
readily explained by the  subject’s clinical state or concomitant treatment. If the 
investigational agent is discontinued  or the dose is reduced the event abates or 
resolves.  
 
Definitely Related: Strong e vidence exists that the investigational agent caused 
the adverse event. There is a temporal relationship betwe en the e vent’s onset 
and investigational agent administration, and strong therapeutic and 
pharmacologic evidence that  the investigational agent caused the event. The 
subject’s clinical state and  concomitant treatment have been rule d out as causes. 
If the investiga tional agent is  discontinued or the dose is reduced the event 
abates or resolves, but it reappears upon  rechallenge.  
 
10.2.4. Severity of Adverse Events  
Severity or intensity of adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
Version 4.03, and reported as  indicated on the CRF.  
 
Page 13 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019   
10.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
10.3.1. Time -Frame for Reporting  
 
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), the Principal Investigator will notify the FDA within 7 calendar 
days an event that meets all three definitions of a suspected adverse reaction, serious 
adverse reaction and unexpected adverse reaction via a secure e -mail account wi th the 
FDA. The Principal Investigator will evaluate the available information and decide 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug causes the adverse event, and 
therefore, that the event meets the definition of suspected  adverse reaction. In  addition, 
the investigator will identify in each IND safety report all IND safety reports previously 
submitted to the FDA concerning a similar suspected adverse reaction in light of 
previous, similar reports of any other relevant information. As per 21 CF R part 312, the 
investigator will conduct ongoing safety evaluations, including a periodic review and 
analyses of the entire safety database, not only for IND safety reporting purposes, but 
also to update investigator brochures, protocols, and consent form s with new safety 
information.  
 
10.3.2 Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
 
Any SAE or AE assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely related after last dose of 
study treatment will be followed until either  resolution of the event or determination by 
the Invest igator that the event has become stable or  irreversib le. This follow -up 
guidance also  applies to possibly, probably, or definitely related  SAE that occur 7 days  
after the last dose of study drug administration . The status of all other  continuing  AEs 
will b e documented as of 7 days after last dose of IV citrulline . Follow -up data 
concerning reported SAE must also be reported to the FDA. 
 
 
10.3.3. Regulatory Reporting  
 
Reporting of SAEs by the Investigator to the IRB  will be done in accordance with the  
standard operating proced ures and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation will  be 
maintained showing that the IRB  was properly notified.  
 
 
 
11. Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be comprised of 3 University of Mississippi 
Medical Center physicians who are not related to the study.  Every third patient will be 
reviewed by the DSMB to ensure the safety of the study participants.  
 
12. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
Page 14 of 16 
Last Updated: 01/10/2019  In compliance with ICH guidelines, the investiga tor will maintain copies of all source 
documents that support data collected from each patient and all study documents as 
specified in ICH Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial. The 
investigator will take measures to prevent ac cidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.  
All data containing protected health information will be collected and stored in a locked 
cabinet located in the Children’s Cancer Clinic. In addition, all electronic data in for the 
form of Microsoft excel spreadsheet, word documents etc. will be stored in a password 
protected encrypted computer. The study coordinator will file all the material. Any 
information that is shared with other study personnel via e -mail will be de -identified in 
order to protect the participants ’ health information.  
 
13. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics  
The protocol complies with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. In 
addition, the protocol complies with the laws and regulations of the state of Mis sissippi.  
The collection and processing of personal data from patients enrolled in the this study 
will be limited to that data which is necessary to investigate the efficacy, safety, quality, 
and utility of the investigational study medicine used in this study.  
The data will be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure 
confidentiality and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and 
regulations.  
Only approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), explicit consent for t he 
enrollment in this research study, and processing of personal data will be obtained from 
the participating patient before collection of data.  
The patient has the right to request through the investigator access to his/her personal 
data and the right to  request rectification of any data that is not correct or complete. 
Reasonable steps should be taken to respond to such a request, taking into 
consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of the study, and the applicable

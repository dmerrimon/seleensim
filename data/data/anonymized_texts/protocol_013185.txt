STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the safety  and 
effectiveness of IV CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after 
each dialysis session. This study will consist of a Screening Period and 
an up to 12- week Treatment P eriod. The Screening Period includes a 
Screening Visit and a Run- In Period . After the completion of the 
Treatment Period , patients will be required to complete a Follow-up 
Visit.  
Screening Period  
Screening Visit:  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.  The Screening Visit will occur within 21 days 
prior to the start of the Run -in Period.  Patients should be trained on 
completing patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionna ires prior to the 
start of the Run-in Period. The site has the option of starting the Run -in 
Period on the same day as the Screening V isit at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
Run-In Period:  
Patients will start the Run -in Period during the week prior to T reatment  
Period  to complete eligibility  verification . The Run- in Period will start 
on the first dialysis session of that week (i.e, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for p atients 
on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule). The primary 
purpose of the Run- in Period is to confirm that each patient has 
moderate- to-severe pruritus (ie, weekly average worst itch ing score 
>5), as measured by the
 patient  reported Worst Itching Intensity NRS  
and to establish a baseline itch intensity. During the Run-in Period, 
patients will complete the  Worst Itching Intensity NRS and Sleep 
Quality questionnaires only on the dialysis days and the EQ -5D-5L 
with EQ -PSO bolt on (EQ-5D-5L-P) on the third dialysis session.   
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 8 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 If patients continue to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria by the end of the Run -in Period, they will enter the 
Treatment Period  of the study.   
Treatment Period : Day 1 of the Treatm ent Period  will be defined as 
the day of administration of the first dose of study drug and will occur 
on the first dialysis session of the first treatment week (ie, Monday for 
patients on a Monday -Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule, or Tuesday 
for patient s on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule).  
Before the first dose of CR845 , patients will complete their Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS  and a series of itch -related quality of life and 
sleep questionnaires (ie, Sleep Quality , 5D Itch , Skindex-10, and EQ -
5D-5L-P questionnaires).   
All scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period  will be 
conducted on dialysis days.  Patients will be administered CR845 as an 
IV bolus after the end of their dialysis, either during rinse back or 
after rinse back .  Hospitalizations, infections, missed dialysis 
sessions, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital 
signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications will be monitored 
throughout the study.  
End of treatment (EOT) is defined as the first day of dialysis following 
the last dose of drug. The EOT procedures will be conducted on the 
dialysis visit following the last dose of study dru g.   
Follow -up Visit  
A final safety Follow -up Visit will be conducted 7- 10 days after the 
EOT or Early Termination ( ET) Visit.  
  
STUDY DRUG  Study drug will be supplied in glass vials containing an extractable 
volume of at least 1.3 mL of CR845 at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL 
in 0.04M isotonic acetate buffer, pH 4.5.  CR845 dose will be 
calculated and adjusted based on prescription dry body weight.  
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT  No placebo will be used for this study.  
TREATMENT

 In nonclinical studies, CR845 has been shown to exhibit antipruritic and 
anti-inflammatory properties [ Investigator’s Brochure ].   Thus, CR845 is intended to 
reduce the severity of itching in hemodialysis patients and thereby decrease the likelihood of developing additional serious conditions associated with pruritus. 
4.2 Clinical Experience 
4.2.1 Overall Exposure 
As of October 2018, the intravenous (IV) formulation of CR845 has been evaluated in 
>1440 patients and healthy volunteers across 17 studies (including two Phase 2 studies for 
the relief of moderate -to-severe pruritus and an ongoing long- term safety trials in 
hemodialysis patients conducted in the US).  CR845 has been evaluated both as an IV 
bolus and a 15-minute infusion of single or repeated doses ranging from 0.25 to  40 mcg/kg.  
Of the patients exposed to IV CR845 to date, >450 hemodialysis patients have received single or repeated IV injections of CR845 doses (for up to 1 year ) ranging from 0. 25 to 6 
mcg/kg across Phase 1 to Phase 3 studies with > 90 and > 30 hemodialysis patients exposed to the intended therapeutic dose of 0.5 mcg/kg for 6 months and for one year, respectively . 
4.2.2 Safety in Hemodialysis Patients 
A review of the aggregate safety data in completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials shows that CR845 was generally well tolerated in hemodialysis patients when administered after each dialysis session for up to 8 weeks at I V doses ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 6 mcg/kg.  
Although patients exposed to CR845 reported more adverse events compared with placebo patients, most events were mild or moderate in nature.  Generally mild, transient paresthesias (facial tingling) and/or hypoesthesias (in different anatomic locations), mostly 
on the first week of dosing, as well as headache, dizziness, and somnolence, were the most 
frequently reported adverse events associated with CR845 administration. Consistent with its lack of affinity for  mu-opioid receptors , CR845 did not cause euphoria or respiratory 
depression.  
The study CR845- CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 
repeated IV doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8- week treatment period in 
174 hemodialysis patients.  As expected with patients on hemodialysis, a significant 
number of the reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered not treatment -
related, but related to the disease and/or comorbid conditions.  Of the 174 patients 
randomized and treated on the study, 31 (17.8%) had treatment- emergent SAEs.  Out of 
these SAE reports, 4 (9%) occurred in 45 placebo -treated patients and 27 (21%) in 
129 CR845-treated patients.  Only 1 SAE of mental status changes (moderate in severity) in a patient who received CR845 1.5 mcg/kg IV was considered by the Investigator to be 
probably related to study drug.  However, based on the Sponsor’s medical review, an alternate etiology of urgent/emergent hypertension offers a more plausible explanation for 
the acute change in mental status.  There were 4 patient deaths (1 in placebo group, 1 in

 CR845 0.5 mcg/kg group, and 2 in CR845 1.5 mcg/kg group; 2.3% of the total study 
population) in the study, all of which were considered not related to the study drug. In patients with normal renal function, CR845 can cause free- water diuresis (aquaresis) and 
increased  serum sodium.  However, as would be expected in patients undergoing dialysis 
in whom there are few functioning nephrons, there was no evidence of aquaresis or significant increases in serum sodium concentrations.  There were no adverse trends in 
clinical chemistry or hematology values (drawn pre-dialysis), including no apparent 
differences between the placebo and CR845 groups in serum sodium.  There were no discernable differences between treatment groups in vital sign results.  Of particular note, 
among patients receiving CR845, there was no apparent reduction in blood pressure or 
respiratory rate following dosing. 
Adverse event summary tables can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , with further 
details of the safety profile of CR845.   
4.2.3 Efficacy of CR 845 in Hemodialysis Patients with Uremic Pruritus  
The efficacy of CR845 at reducing itch  was evaluated in two Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (CR845-CLIN2005 [Part B] and 
CR845-CLIN2101). 
CR845-CLIN2005 (Part B) included 65 he modialysis patients with moderate -to-severe 
pruritus who received either IV CR845 1.0 mcg/kg (n=33) or placebo (n=32) 3 times per 
week for 2 weeks, after each hemodialysis session .  CR845 significantly decreased itching 
intensity compared with placebo (p=0.016), as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) 
and significantly improved quality of life related to itching (Skindex- 10) (see 
Investigator’s Brochure for details).  Furthermore, CR845- treated patients exhibited 
statistically significant reductions in b oth daytime (p=0.03) and nighttime (p=0.007) worst 
itching scores compared with placebo, and the reduction in itching intensity scores was 
similar on dialysis and nondialysis days.  The mean change from baseline VAS curves 
over time showed numerical separa tion between the treatment groups within the first week 
of treatment.  
CR845- CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated IV 
doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8-week treatment period in 174 hemodialysis patients experiencing moderate -to-severe pruritus daily or near -daily for 
4.4 years on average.  The study was conducted at 33 dialysis centers and assessed the effect of 3 doses of CR845 (ie, 0.5 mcg/kg, n=44; 1 mcg/kg, n=41 and 1.5 mcg/kg, n=44) or placebo (n=45) admini stered at the end of each dialysis session (ie,  3 times/week).  The 
primary efficacy endpoint for Study CR845-CLIN2101 was based on itch intensity measurement and defined as the change from a 1 -week baseline recorded prior to the start 
of study drug to the last week of the 8 -week treatment period with respect to the weekly 
mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) score.  The least squares (LS) mean (±standard error [SE]) treatment group difference from placebo at Week  8 across all CR845 doses was -1.3 (±0.41) (95% confidence interval [CI]:  
-2.1 to -0.5) (p=0.002) with an average NRS score reduction from baseline of -3.2 (±0.22) (LS mean ±SE) and 95% CI ranging from -3.7 to -2.8.  Examination of the individual 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 19 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 CR845 dose group results for the Full Analysis Population indicates that a substantial 
improvement over placebo was observed with all 3 doses.  These differences from placebo were statistically significant for the lower dose group of 0.5 mcg/kg (p<0.001) and the 1.5 
mcg/kg group (p=0.019), with an effect size estimated as 0.82, 0.39, and 0.62 for the 0.5, 
1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg doses, respectively.  Average reduction from baseline (LS mean ± SE) ranged from -2.8 (±0.38) in the 1.0 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -3.5 to -2.0) 
to -3.8 (±0.38) in the 0.5 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -4.5 to -3.1).  The 
reduction in itch intensity directly correlated with a significant improvement in itch -
related quality of life and sleep measurements (see Investigator’s Br ochure, with further 
details of the efficacy  profile of CR845).   
4.2.4 Pharmacokinetics in Hemodialysis Patients  
CR845 is eliminated primarily through the kidney and no major metabolites have been identified in humans.  Consequently, total body clearance of CR845 in patients with 
severe renal impairment is reduced relative to healthy, matched, control patients 
(CR845-CLIN1005) such that plasma levels of CR845 remain relatively constant until cleared during dialysis in hemodialysis patients (CR845- CLIN1003 and 
CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]).  Half-life ranges between 26 and 34 hours in hemodialysis patients compared to a typical range of 2 to 3 hours in patients with normal renal function.  Thus, lower doses of CR845 can be administered at a less frequent interval in 
hemodialysis patients to achieve the same or higher overall exposure compared to 
individuals with normal renal function.  Based on this pharmacokinetic profile, CR845 
does not need to be administered more than 3 times a week after each hemodialysis 
session, which is convenient for this patient population and ensures treatment compliance 
in a population already burdened with complex medication schedules.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of repeat -dose CR845 was studied in 24 hemodialysis 
patients who received doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mcg/kg 3 times per week for 1 week 
(CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]).  In this study, there were dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration and area under the curve, and minimal to no accumulation with 
repeat doses due to clearance of the drug by hemodialysis (see Investigator’s Brochure for 
details).   
4.3 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
During preclinical development, no specific safety findings to preclude the use of CR845 in humans were observed.  During early clinical development, IV CR845 was 
administered to healthy volunteers; patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment,  including end- stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis patients; 
recreational poly -drug users; and postsurgical patients.  The effects of CR845 have been 
shown to be in line with the underlying pharmacological mechanism of KOR activity.  Consistent with the nonclinical abuse liability studies conducted to date, the results of an 
abuse-potential study in humans indicated that CR845 is different from typical opioid 
medications as it does not attach to the mu receptors and therefore cannot produce mu recep tor mediated side -effects such as addiction.

Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 Overall, tingling/numbness, headache, dizziness, fatigue and/or drowsiness/somnolence 
have been the most common adverse events.  Precaution is recommended in the operation of machinery for patients who experience dizziness, fatigue, and/or 
drowsiness/somnolence.  This is described in the informed consent form (ICF), as 
appropriate, and will be discussed with each patient prior to initiation of the study.  In general, CR845 appeared to be generally well tolerated  in both single- and repeat -dose 
clinical studies  in hemodialysis patients , which support continued study and development 
of this compound.

 6.0 Investigational Plan  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description 
This is a multicenter, ope n-label study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of IV 
CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis session. This study will 
consist of a Screening Period, an up to 12- week Treatment P eriod  and a Follow Up Visit.  
 
6.1.1 Screening Period  
The S creening P eriod  can occur within 28 days prior to treatment to assess eligibility . It 
consists of a S creening Visit and a Run-in Period.  
6.1.1.1 Screening Visit  
The Screening Visit will occur within 2 1 days prior to the Run-In P eriod . During this  visit, 
patients will sign the Informed Consent Form and then will be evaluated for eligibility by 
assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential must be performed within 7 days prior to the first study dose.  
Medical history, including total number of missed dialysis sessions over the past month 
and the conditions of special interest (ie, gait disturbance, fall, dizziness, somnolence, 
seizure, syncope, mental status changes, mood altered, feeling abnormal, tachycardia, and 
palpitations)  will be recorded during screening. During s creening and before the first visit 
of the Run-in Period, patients will be trained on completion of the Worst Itching Intensity 
NRS , EQ-5D- 5L with EQ -PSO bolt-on (E Q-5D- 5L-P) and Sleep Qu ality questionnaires.  
Patients may also  be trained on other patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire s 
during the Screening  Period prior to treatment on Day 1 (ie, Skindex-10 and 5- D itch  
questionnaires).  
6.1.1.2 Run-in Period  
Eligible patients will begin the Run-in Period during the week prior to T reatment Period to 
complete  eligibility  verification , starting on the first dialysis session of that week 
(ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for 
patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).  The purpose of the Run-in 
Period will be to confirm that each patient has moderate -to-severe pruritus (ie,  weekly 
average worst itching score >5), as measured by the patient reported Wo rst Itching 
Intensity NRS, and to establish a baseline itch intensity.  These criteria for eligibility should not be communicated to the patients.  This period will also be used to record each patient’s use of a ntipruritic medications.   
During the first dialysis visit of the Run- in Period, patients will start the reporting of their 
Worst Itching Intensity NRS score s and will continue to do so at every dialysis session. 
For consistency the Worst Itching Intensity  NRS scores will be collected at approximately 
the same time around the start of the dialysis session  preferably within one hour of starting 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 23 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 dialysis . After the completion of the Worst Itching Intensity NRS, patients will complete 
the Sleep Quality Question naire. On the third dialysis session of the Run-in P eriod (Friday 
or Saturday), patients will complete the EQ -5D- 5L-P questionnaire. Preferably, the 
patients will complete the sleep questionnaire followed by the EQ -5D-5L and then the 
EQ-PSO bolt on. P atien ts may continue to be trained on PRO questionnaires during the 
Run-in Period. 
The site has the option of starting the Run- in Period on the same day as the Screening 
Visit at the discretion of the Investigator. In these cases, all screening procedures should 
be conducted first, and then Run-in procedures should be conducted after confirmation of 
eligibility with exception of the lab results , which will be reviewed during the Run-in 
Period . 
6.1.1.3 Treatment Perio d 
If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no ex clusion criteria at the end of the Run -in 
Period, they will be able to start the Treatment Period  and begin IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg.   
Day 1 of the Treatment Period  will be defined as the day of administration of the first dose 
of study drug and will occur on the first dialysis day of the first treatment week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for 
patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).   
All scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period will be conducted on dialysis days.
 
Patients will be administered CR845 as an IV bolus after the end of their dialysis, either 
during rinse back or after rinse back , during a Treatment Period of up to 12- week so that 
each patient will receive CR845 3  times weekly for a total of up to 36 doses. 
On Day 1, before the first dose of CR 845, patients will complete the  Worst Itching 
Intensity NRS, Sleep Quality , 5-D Itch , and Skindex-10 questionnaires.  
The Worst Itching Intensity NRS  and Sleep Quality  will also  be completed  at each dialysis 
session (Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday) during W eek 12. In 
addition, the EQ -5D- 5L-P questionnaire should be performed during the third dialysis 
session (Friday/Saturday) of Week 12. 
At the End of Treatment visit (the first dialysis session after last dose of CR845),  patients 
will complete the  Worst Itching Intensity NRS , Sleep Quality, 5- D Itch , and Skindex-10 
questionnaires preferably within one hour of starting dialysis. 
All questionnaires will be performed at Early Termination.  
On days when multiple questionnaires are to be completed, the following sequence should 
be adhered to : 
1. Itching  Intensity NRS questionnaire  
2. Sleep Quality questionnaire 
3. 5-D Itch  
4. Skindex-10 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 24 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 5. EQ-5D- 5L-P 
All questionnaires are to be completed preferably within one hour of starting dialysis but 
before the completion of dialysis. 
Clinical laboratory tests ( see detail in S ection 6.5.3.5)
 will be collected during first day of 
treatment and at
 End of Treatment  or Early Termination Visit.  Pre-dialysis vital signs will 
be monitored and recorded  on the third  dialysis session of the week for W eek 1  and every 
four weeks after Week 1 . Adverse events, infection assessment , and concomitant 
medications will be continuously recorded during the Treatment Period . 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored at the Screening Visit and at End of 
Treatment  or Early Termination Visit. 
The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis , hospitalization s (including duration) and  
the use of antipruritic medications will be recorded throughout the study. 
End of Treatment or Early Termination is defined as the first dialysis day following the 
last dose of study drug.  
6.1.1.4 Follow- up Visit   
Patients will have a  final safety Follow -up Visit conducted 7- 10 days after the Early 
Termination or End of Treatment Visit.

6.3 Removal of Patients from Therapy or Assessment 
6.3.1 Discontinuation of Individual Patients  
A patient may be withdrawn at any time  and at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
Sponsor for safety, behavioural , compliance, or administrative reasons, including, but not 
limited to:  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Adverse event  
• Lack of therapeutic efficacy  
• Pregnancy  
• Eligibility ( inclusion/exclusion criter ia) 
• Patient  non- compliance  
• Informed consent is withdrawn  
Whenever possible, withdrawal of a patient from study drug by the Investigator should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor before the patient stops study drug.  
If study drug is discontinued, regardless of the reason, an Early Termination Visit should 
be completed at the first dialysis after the last dose of study drug or, if not feasible during that timeframe, as soon as feasible.  A Follow-up Visit should be completed 7-10 days 
after the Early Termination Visit.   
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 28 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request. Although a 
patient will not be obliged to give a reason for withdrawing prematurely, the Investigator 
must make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while ful ly respecting the patient’s 
rights.  The reason(s) for termination and date of stopping study drug must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) and source documents. 
If a patient discontinues early due to an adverse event, the event will be followed until 
resolution, the patient returns to baseline status, the condition stabilizes, or the patient is 
lost to follow -up. 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up when no response is received from the 
patient after at least 3 documented attemp ts to contact the patient over a minimum time of 
2 weeks by the study site.  
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data already collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
6.3.2 Discontinuation or Suspension of Entire Study  
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any 
reason. Reasons may include the following, among others: 
• Investigators have not been able to enroll patients within a reasonable period of 
time or according to inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
• The target number of patients  required for the study is enrolled earlier than 
expected;  
• Unexpected safety concern.    
If the study is suspended or terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that applicable regulatory 
agencies and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) 
are notified, as appropriate.  
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to the 
Sponsor or destroyed at the site according to instructions provided by the Sponsor, as 
applicable.  
6.4 Treatments  
Detailed information on the study drug and its preparation, administration, storage, supply, disposition, and accountability can be found in the Pharmacy Manual . 
6.4.1 Treatments Administered  
The study drug will be dispensed by qualified staff members who have received t raining 
on study drug handling and administration and as per local regulations.   
Patients will receive CR845 three times per week for up to 12 weeks, for a total of up to

Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 29 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 administered after rinse back, the line MUST be flushed with an additional 10ml normal 
saline to ensure study drug doesn’t get stuck in the line. 
Patients who require an extra hemodialysis session in a given week should receive an 
additional dose of CR845; if the extra session is ultrafiltration only, no additional CR845 dose should be given. 
A maximum of four doses a week are allowed but patients who routinely r eceive 4 
dialysis/ultrafiltration treatments per week will not be eligible for the study.  
The patient’s prescription dry body weight (ie, the target post- dialysis weight  at the end of 
screening, as determined by the Investigator ) will be used to calculate the dose of the 
study drug to be administered during the Trea tment Period .

A single  vial of CR845 will be used for patients with a prescription dry body weight 
≤135.0 kg.  For patients with a prescription dry body weight >135.0 kg, 2 vials of CR845 
will be used to ensure that the full volume of study drug can be prepared. The syringes can be prepared up to an hour in advance of dosing.    
Information on the study drug preparation can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.4.5 Management of Missed Doses  
If a patient misses a dialysis visit, dosing of study drug should resume at the next dialysis 
visit.  
Contact the Medical Monitor if patient compliance or safety is of concern.  
6.4.6 Treatment Compliance  
Patient compliance with study drug is documented as part of standard procedures at the dialysis units where study drug is administered.   
6.4.7 Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Medications  
6.4.7.1 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior medications (including over-the-counter medications, vitamins and herbal supplements) are defined as those that the patient has taken any time during the 3 months 
prior to the first dose of study drug.  Concomitant medications are medications that are 
taken from after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of the Treatment  Period  through the 
end of the Follow-up Visit.   
Use of antipruritic medications during the study will be recorded on an ongoing basis, starting at screening.  Medications known for potential antipruritic effects but used for a 
different indication (ex. use of gabapentin for pain management) will not be reported as antipruritic medications.  
All prior and concomitant medications are to be recorded in the appropriate page of the eCRF, as applicable.   
6.4.7.2 Restricted and Prohibited Medications  
During the Screening and Treatment Period s (as a
 pplicable) , the following medications 
will be restricted or prohibited ( Table  1

 6.5.2 Effectiveness Assessments  
The effect of CR845 on itch and itch -related quality of life and quality of sleep will be 
measured by means of the following PRO questionnaires :  
• Worst Itching Intensity NRS  
• Sleep Quality  
• Skindex-10  
• 5-D Itch  
• EQ-5D- 5L-P 
Patient s will be trained on completion of the Worst Itching Intensity NRS , Sleep Qu ality,  
and EQ-5D- 5L-P questionnaires prior to the first visit of the Run-in Period, and will be 
trained on the other itch- related PRO measures at any time prior to dosing on Day 1 of 
the Treatment Period .  All questionnaires must be completed in strict adherence to the 
Training Manual for Patient Reported Assessments. Patients will be provided with these 
questionnaires to complete  at the clinic on specific dialysis  days per the schedule of 
events  (Table 2) .  
 
6.5.2.1 Wor
st Itc
hi
ng Intensity Numerical Rating Questionnaire  
Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS scale (Appendix 2, Section 14.2) on a 
worksheet on which pa
tients will be asked to indicate the intensity of the worst itching 
they experienced over the past 24 hours by marking one of 11 numbers, from 0 to 10, that best describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase “no itching” and “10” is labeled “worst itching imaginable.”   
The Worst Itchin
g Intensity NRS has been widely utilized for evaluation of chronic itch, 
including pruritus in hemodialysis patients [Kumagai 2010; Pisoni 2006; Mathur 2010; 
Ständer 2013].  
6.5.2.2 Sleep Quality  Questionnaire  
The impact of itch on patients’ quality of sleep will be mea sured using an NRS scale 
(Appendix 3,  Section  14.3)  on a workshe
et on which patients will be asked to indicate 
how their itch inter
feres with their sleep over the past 24 hours by marking one of 11 
numbers, from 0 to 10, that best describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase 
“did not interfere ” and “10” is labeled “completely interfered”   
6.5.2.3 Skindex -10 Questio
nnaire  
Developed specifically for pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease, the Skindex-
10 (Appendix 4,  Section  14.4)  is an instrument for measurement of quality -of-life that 
correlates with itch intensity [Mathur 2010].  Patients are asked to mark 1 of 7 boxes

6.5.3.1 Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Event s 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigational patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necess arily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medici nal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
In this study, adverse events will be captured from the time a patient signs the ICF to the 
Follow-up Visit and include the following: 
• Any new sign, symptom, or disease; 
• Any new clinically significant or symptomatic laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality; 
• Any clinically significant worsening of laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality;  
• Any worsening (ie, clinically significant change in frequency, nature, and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition.  
A pre -existing condition is a condition that is present prior to signing the ICF for the 
study.  Pre-existing conditions, such as illnesses, symptoms, reactions, progression of disease states, and other comorbidities, as well as laboratory/diagnostic test 
abnormalities, will be documented in the patient’s record as medical history. In addition 
to general history, patients will be specifically asked if they have a history of certain 
conditions including but not limited to gait disturbances , falls, dizziness, somnolence, 
seizures, syncope, mental status changes, mood alterations, palpitations and tachycardia.   
Signs and symptoms will be reported individually as adverse events (non-serious), unless a medical diagnosis was provided.  Medical diagnosis, whenever provided, will be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms.   
Any adverse event that satisfies any of the seriousness criteria described below will be 
reported as an SAE using the SAE Report Form, in addition to documenting in the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events that occurred up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug need 
to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by the Investigator to be “Related” to study drug.  
An SAE that occurred after a period of 30 days from the last dose of study drug must be reported when the investigator becomes aware of it if there is a possible relationship to the study drug or the conduct of the study. 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 37 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The Investigator will assess the severity (i e, intensity) of each adverse event (serious and 
non-serious) reported during the study based on his/her clinical judgment.  The severity 
of each adverse event will be assigned to one of the following categories:  
Mild : Transient, requires no special treatment, is easily tolerated by the 
patient, causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities  
Moderate : Introduces a level of inconvenience or concern to the patient that may 
interfere with daily activities, but usually is ameliorated by simple 
therapeutic measures  
Severe : Interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity and requires systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment 
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening; 
NOTE:  The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have ca used death if it were 
more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require inter vention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  These are usually considered serious. 
Severe versus Serious Adverse Event  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate , or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  An adverse event as well as an SAE must be assessed for severity.  An adverse event that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  “Severity” is not the same as “Serious,” which is 
based on patient outcome or reaction criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 38 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a gui de for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Adverse Event Causality or Relatedness to the Study Drug  
Every effort should be made by the Investigator to explain each adverse event and assess 
its relationship, if any, to study drug.  The Investigator should consider many factors, 
including, but not limited to, temporal association of the event and date/time of study 
drug, duration of study drug, medical/biologic plausibility, pharmacology and adverse event profile of study drug, medical history (past medical history, underlying disease, 
comorbidities, intercurrent illness), concomitant medications, medical judgment, 
dechallenge, rechallenge, drug interaction, other plausible causes, etc., to determine the causality assessment of an event.   
The Investiga tor as well as the Sponsor will determine adverse event/SAE causality as 
‘Related’ or ‘Not Related’ to study drug.  Although there is no international consensus on how to define ‘Related’ and ‘Not Related,’ in general, an event is considered ‘Related’ if 
there is reasonable possibility that the event is related to study drug rather than to any 
other possible cause(s).  Conversely, an event is considered ‘Not Related’ if there is 
reasonable possibility that the event is related to other factors than the stud y drug.  
Adverse Event Documentation and Follow- up 
All adverse events, including observed, elicited, or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms are to be recorded on the adverse event page in the patient’s eCRF from the time the patient signs the ICF and until the Follow-up Visit/early termination, whether or 
not judged by the Investigator to be related to study drug.  The need to capture this 
information is not dependent upon whether adverse events are related to study drug.  Serious adverse events th at occurred up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug need 
to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by the Investigator to be “Related” to study drug.  
Each adverse event is to be documented with a verbatim/reported term, start and stop date 
and time, severity, causal relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, and 
outcome (resolved, resolved with sequelae, resolving, fatal, unknown).  The Investigator must review new adverse events and the outcome of ongoing adverse events frequently throughout the study.  
In addition to recording all adverse events (serious and non- serious) in the patient’s 
eCRF, all SAEs must also be documented on the SAE Report Form for the study. The Investigator will follow all adverse events until they resolve, the Investigator 
assesses them to be stable, or the patient’s participation in the study ends, whichever comes first.  In addition, the Investigator will follow all adverse events assessed as related 
to study drug that are ongoing at the time of the patient’s last visit, until they resolve or 
the Investigator assesses them as stable, even if the patient's participation in the study has ended.  Resolution of such events is to be documented in the patient’s record as appropriate.

Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 It is anticipated that some patients may undergo procedures and/or experience events that 
are common in the study population under investigation, independent of study therapy.  
Preplanned procedures and procedures (e g, kidney transplant, catheter replacement) or 
events that are independent of study therapy, according to the Investigator’s assessment, will be documented as specified in the Safety Management Plan.   
Serious Adverse Event Notification, Documentation, and Reporting  
The Investigator will report an SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  An SAE Report Form will be completed regardless of relationship to the study drug.  The 
initial report will not be delayed in order to obtain additional information.  Any additional 
information will be reported as a follow-up to the initial report within 24 hours of collection.  
Details for reporting and follow-up of SAEs are provided in the ISF. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death) occurring after the last dose of study drug and 
prior to the Follow- up Visit, the patient will be instructed to contact the Investigator or 
designee immediately using the instructions provided on the ICF.   
The Medical Monitor will review reported SAEs and may contact the Investig ator 
directly for further information.  
The Sponsor will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to 
reporting of SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities  in the countries and regions 
this study is conducted, while the Investig ator and designated study personnel will 
comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to reporting of SAEs to the IRB /IEC  and the Sponsor.   
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee to send all regulatory reports to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities .  Adverse events that are serious, related to the study 
drug, and unexpected (per the Investigator’s Brochure ) will be reported to  the regulatory 
authorities as specified in the Safety Management Plan.  
As applicable, the Sponsor will also notify other participating Investigator(s) of SUSARs  
to ensure prompt notification of significant new adverse events or risks with respect to study drug.  This notification will occur as soon as possible and in compliance with country- specific regulations.  
Refer to the Safety Management Plan for further details about SAE reporting and processing.  The Medical Monitor should be contacted by study sites requiring additional clarification on an SAE. 
6.5.3.2 Physi cal Examination 
Physical examinations at Screening will include an examination of the heart, lungs, 
abdomen, extremities, and neurological and vascular systems. Any findings should be reported in t he medical history.

Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 6.5.3.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( sitting or se mi-recumbent body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure) 
will be measured prior to start of dialysis  as per schedule presented in Table 2 .   
Meas
uremen
ts
 will be repeated if a value is out of the reference range due to a technical 
issue, considered abnormal for the patient, or for other medical concerns.  Only the 
repeated measurement will be recorded.  
In the event of a clinically significant change in blood pressure and/or heart rate, the Investigator and dialysis staff will evaluate and manage the patient per standard dialysis 
unit practices with knowledge of the patient’s typical blood pressure and heart rate 
excursions. 
Heart rate will be collected at each dialysis; if clinically significant and outside the 
prespecified visits per schedule of events , the heart rate will be recorded on the relevant 
CRF page.  
6.5.3.4 Electrocardiogram  
The 12- lead ECGs will be obtained prior to the start of dialysis and will be read locally 
by the I
nvestigator or qualified designee as per schedule presented in Table 2 .  
El
ectroca
rdiograms read by a qualified designee must be endorsed by the Investigator.  
Clinically significant abnormalities or worsening findings observed after the first dose of 
study drug will be reported as treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
6.5.3.5 Clinic al Laborat
ory Tests 
Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests including hematology, serum chemistry, and serum pregnancy will be taken prior to dialysis as per schedule presented in  Table 2 and 
will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  The laboratory tests include the following: 
Assessment  Parameters to be analysed

 Serum Pregnancy (females 
of childbearing potential only) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) 
No more than 10 mL will be taken for each blood test. Processing and shipment of central 
laboratory samples will be described in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.5.3.6 Contraception and Pregnancy  
All females of childbearing potential will have blood samples taken at Screening for 
serum pr
egnancy testing and at the end of th e study as per Table 2 .  
Females are 
consi
dered to be of childbearing potential unless they are:  
• Surgic
ally sterile (ie, tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, and/or 
hysterectomy); or  
• Over 55 years of age and have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year  
Once they have consented to participate in the study, all women of childbearing potential 
will be counseled on the importance of avoiding pregnancy and on the need to practice adequate birth control for the duration of the study, from screening unti l 7 days after the 
last dose of study drug. 
Medically acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, vasectomized partner, 
hormonal contraceptives for at least 1 cycle of treatment before study enrollment, an 
intrauterine device, and barrier with spermicide (eg, male or female condom, or 
diaphragm).  
Per inclusion criteria, male patients will agree not to donate sperm after the first dose of 
study drug until seven  days after the last dose of study drug, and will agree to use a 
condom with spermicide or abstain from heterosexual intercourse during the study until 
seven  days after the last dose of study drug.  No restrictions are required for a 
vasectomized male, provided his vasectomy was performed ≥4 months prior to dosing. If 
sexual abstinence is chosen by the patient, it must be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient and must be practiced for the entire duration of the study. 
Women will be counseled to contact the Investigator or his/her staff immediately if 
pregnancy is suspected.  Males will be instructed to report to the Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study. 
If a patient becomes pregnant from start of treatment to seven  days after the last dose of 
study drug, the Investigator will immediately discontinue the patient from the study and 
contact the Sponsor or designee.  Diligent efforts will be made to determine the outcome 
for all pregnancies in the clinical study.  Infor mation on the status of the mother and the 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor.  Generally, follow-up will occur within 6 to 
8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported.  Both maternal and paternal exposure will be collected.  For 
exposure involving the female partner of a male patient, the necessary information must 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 42 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 be collected from the patient while respecting the confidentiality of the partner.  A 
pregnancy report will be completed. 
6.6 Addi tional Assessments  
The following additional assessments will be collected during the Treatment  Period : 
• Missed dialysis visits 
• Hospitalizations  
• Infections  
6.6.1.1 Missed Dialysis Visits  
The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis will be recorded. 
6.6.1.2 Hospitalization  
In-patient hospitalizations  (including duration) will be collected on the SAE and eCRF 
form s.  
6.6.1.3 Infections  
Infections will be recorded as per standard procedures at the dialysis sites and reported on 
the adverse event eCRF page.  Additional information pertaining to the nature of the 
infections will be collected  as applicable.

 7.0 Discussion and Justification of Study Design  
This is an open- label study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CR845 
0.5 mcg/kg IV administered after each dialysis session (generally 3 times per week for up 
to 12 weeks) in hemodialysis patients. This design is commonly used in clinical development to obtain additional safety information  regarding a novel investi gational 
drug.  
7.1 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The combined safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data from CR845-CLIN2101 provided the basis for the selection of the dose and dose regimen of CR845 to be used in 
this study.  The lowest dose tested (0.5 mc g/kg IV) in CR845-CLIN2101 appeared to be 
well tolerated and effective at reducing itch intensity over a period of 8 weeks.  
 
7.2 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Standard clinical, laboratory, and statistical procedures and methodology will be utilized 
in this study.  The PRO assessments to be used in this study are appropriate.

 8.0 Statistical Methods  
8.1 General Considerations  
This section describes the statistical analysis of safety, effectiveness, and additional 
endpoints collected during the study.   The statistica l analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description for the handling of 
missing data, patient eligibility criteria for the analysis, and statistical methodology. If differences occur between analyses of data described in the SAP and the current protocol,  
those found in the SAP will assume primacy.   Unless otherwise noted, continuous variables will be summarized using number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum; categorical variables will be summarized using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each category. In addition to the descriptive summaries, pertinent data listings  
will be provided.  All analyses will be performed using SAS
® version 9.2 or higher, unless otherwise 
specified.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size

 ancillary analysis.  Patients who complete the study and do not have missing data will be 
included in the main analysis.  Patients who either discontinue early or have missing data 
will be include in the ancillary analysis.  
 
8.5 Statistical Summary and Analysis 
8.5.1 Patient Disposition  
The number of patients who enrolled in the study, who received at least one dose of study 
drug, completed, or discontinued from the study drug prematurely, along with the reason for discontinuation, will be presented.  The percentage of patients who completed or discontinued will be based on the safety population.  
8.5.2 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be identified in several ways:  through programmatic checks, 
through medical reviews, and by clinical research associates during site monitoring.  Protocol deviations will be classified as minor or major prior to the database lock.  Major 
protocol deviations will be summarized.  All protocol deviations will be listed.   
8.5.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

coding listing of unique medications and their corresponding coding will be presented. 
8.5.6 Antipruritic Medication  
Antipruritic medications are identified as medications where ‘Yes’ is checked on the 
Previous or Concomitant Medications CRF page to the question ‘Medication was given to treat pruritus’.   
Prior and concomitant antipruritic medications will be summarized separately. 
Summaries will be presented by ingredient rather than by ATC codes . 
8.6 Effectiveness Endpoints and Analysis  
8.6.1 Endpoints  
24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score  
• Change from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score to Week 12. 
• Proportion of patients achieving >0, ≥1, ≥2, ≥3, and ≥4-point improvement from baseline with respect to the we ekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12. 
Sleep Quality Questionnaire  
• Change from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24- hour Sleep Quality score 
to Week 12.   
5-D Itch and Skindex -10 Questionnaires 
• Change from baseline in itch -related quality of life to Week 12 as assessed by 
the 5 -D Itch total score and each 5 -D Itch individual questions. 
• Change from baseline in itch -related quality of life to Week 12 as assessed by 
the total Skindex-10 total score and each Skindex-10 subdomain score (disease, mood/emotional distress, social functioning). 
EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire 
• Proportion of patients with reported problems by level (1 to 5) and EQ-5D- 5L 
dimension will be summarized at baseline and Week 12. 
• Proportion of patients with no problems (i.e. with a level 1 response) by EQ-5D-5L dimension will be summarized at baseline and Week 12. 
• Overall Self -Rated Health Status EQ VAS will be summarized (mean, SD, 
median, Q25- Q75) at baseline and at Week 12 along with the change from 
baseline.   
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 47 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 • Patients health state  will be expressed using the 5 dimensions: mobility, self -
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each 
dimension is evaluated using 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate 
problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  Response to these 5 dimensions will be converted into 1 of 3125 unique EQ-5D- 5L health state 
descriptions, which ranges between no problems on all 5 dimensions (11111) to extreme problems on all 5 dimensions (55555).  The patients’  health state 
will be displayed in a listing.  
EQ-PSO Questionnaire  
• Proportion of patients with reported problems by level (1 to 5) and EQ- PSO 
dimension will be summarized at baseline and Week 12. 
• Proportion of patients with no problems (i.e. with a level 1 response) by EQ-PSO dimension will be summarized at baseline and Week 12. 
8.6.2 Analysis 
The weekly mean of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score at Week 12 will be defined as the sum of the Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores collected on each dialysis 
visit of Week 12 and on the first dialysis visit of Week 13, divided by the number of days 
with non- missing scores for that week.  The baseline score will be defined as the average 
of the daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores collected over the Run-in Period, 
including assessments collected on Day 1 prior to the first dose of the Treatment Period.  
For the analysis of NRS, if the 24-hour daily Worst Itching Intensity score is missing for >2 dialysis  during the collection period on Weeks 12 and 13 then the corresponding 
weekly mean worst itching score will be set to missing.  
Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, min, max) for the weekly mean of the 24-hour Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS  score at baseline and at Week 12 of the Treatment Period along 
with the change from baseline will be produced. In addition, the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score to Week 12 
Treatment Period will be ana lyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  The model 
will contain baseline score as covariate.  LS means, standard errors, and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) derived from the model will be presented. The same procedure will be used to analyse Sleep Quali ty. 
The proportion of patients who have an improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score >0, ≥1, ≥2, ≥3, and 
≥4 points at Week 12 will be analysed using a logistic regression model containi ng 
baseline NRS score.  A figure presenting the proportion of patients who have an improvement from baseline in NRS scores at Week 12 that is >0, ≥1, ≥2, ≥3, and ≥4 will be prepared.  
The 5 -D Itch and the Skindex-10 questionnaires  total score and domains/individual 
questions will be summarized using summary statistics and analysed using a ANCOVA 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 48 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 as described for the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score. For the analysis of 5- D 
Itch and the Skindex-10 scores, missing scores will not be imputed. 
It is important to note that, in HD patients, the study drug administered during the last 
dialysis of a particular week does not begin to be cleared until the first dialysis of the next 
week.  Therefore, measurements that would reflect treatment effect at the end of a specific week (eg. Week 12) will actually be collected during the first day of the next week (eg, Week 13). 
Counts and percentages of subjects for each response will be reported as well as a count 
of subjects with missing values.  
8.7 Safety Analysis 
Analysis of all safety data collected during the T reatment P eriod  will be performed on the 
Safety Population.  The SAP will provide further detail for the analyses to be applied to each safety parameter .  No statistical hypothesis testing will be carried out an d no 
inferential statistical analysis of the safety parameters will be performed.  
The baseline value for all analyses of T reatment P eriod  safety parameters will be defined 
as the last value obtained prior to the first dose of study drug and will include both scheduled and repeat (unscheduled) observations.  
8.7.1 Exposure to Study Drug  and Compliance  
For this study, the duration of treatment for each individual patient may be up to 12 
weeks, for a total of up to 36 doses of study drug administered immediately following 
each dialysis session.  Day 1 of the Treatment Period will be defined as the day of administration of the first dose of study drug.  The last day of the Treatment Period will 
be defined as the day of the dialysis session immediately following the last injection of 
study drug.  
Exposure and treatment compliance during the Treatment Period will be summarized by the following parameters: 
• Duration of treatment (days) 
• Total number of doses actually received  
• Number of missed doses 
Duration of treatment (days) = (date of first dialysis after last dose) – (date of first dose) + 1. 
If a patient receives additional dialysis during a given week for any reason, an additional dose of CR845 will be administered following dialysis.  A maximum of 4 doses per week 
is allowed  if an infrequent occurrence.  No additional doses will be given for patients 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 49 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 receiving an additional unscheduled ultrafiltration treatment.  The number of pati ents 
getting such an extra treatment will be summarized.  
8.7.2 Adverse Events  
All adverse events, as reported by the site, will be coded using MedDRA to MedDRA 
SOC and Preferred Term for standardization and summary purposes. 
All reported adverse events (whether or not treatment-emergent) will be included in a 
by-patient adverse event listing.   Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables . 
Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Run -in Period are 
identified as any adverse event wit h an onset date after the start of the Run-in Period and 
up to the first dose of study drug. 
Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Treatment Period 
are identified as any adverse event  with an onset date after the first dose of the study drug 
up to the Follow- up Visit or Early Termination Visit (or 7 days after the last dose if no 
Early Termination Visit was conducted), whichever is later.  
The number and percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs will be summarized.  A 
patien t will be counted only once in the incidence count for a MedDRA SOC or Preferred 
Term, although a patient may have multiple occurrences (start and stop) of an event 
associated with a specific MedDRA Preferred Term or SOC.   The most frequent TEAEs 
(≥5% of patients) will also be tabulated by SOC and Preferred Term.  
The incidence and percentage of patients experiencing treatment -emergent SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be presented by the appropriate MedDRA 
SOC and Preferred Term.   Adverse events that result in death will also be summarized.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be summarized by severity and by 
relationship to study drug.  If the severity and/or relationship to the study drug of an adverse event is missing, a worst -case scenario will be assumed (ie, the adverse event 
will be categorized as “severe” and/or “related” to the study drug).  If a patient reports the 
same TEAE multiple times the event with the worst severity and the strongest 
relationship to study drug will b e tabulated.  
An overall summary table will be provided including the number and percentage of 
patients with an adverse event (both treatment and non- treatment emergent), a TEAE, 
serious TEAE, related TEAE, severe TEAE, TEAE leading to dose interruption, and 
TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation.  This table will also include the number of events for each specific Preferred Term.  
Separate tables summarizing the incidence of AESIs will be presented for Run-In and Treatment Period. S elected preferred ter ms will be determined prior to database lock and 
combined into the following categories:  
• Gait disturbance                     
• Fall 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 50 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 • Dizziness  
• Somnolence 
• Seizure 
• Syncope 
• Mental status changes  
• Mood altered  
• Feeling abnormal  
• Tachycardia  
• Palpitations  
All adverse events will be listed in chronological order, including patient identifier, age, 
race, gender, a flag indicating whether the event was treatment -emergent, and all related 
event status information (start and stop dates, whether the event was ongoing, study day of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, action taken with study treatment, and outcome).  Separate listings will be generated for SAEs, deaths, and 
adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation.  Additionally, a coding list of 
Preferred Terms and the verbatim text associated with them will be produced.  
8.7.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Summary statistics for each scheduled time point measured and mean changes from 
baseline to each time point (whe n applicable) will be presented for clinical laboratory 
results.   
All laboratory evaluation summaries will include the patients in the Safety Population 
who have at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline 
assessments) and with both a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline).  
Laboratory values will be reported in Système International units.   
Laboratory test results will be assigned an L/N/H classification according to wheth er the 
value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference range.  
Comparisons will be based on 3×3 tables (shift tables) that, for a particular laboratory 
test, compare the baseline L/N/H classification to the highest and/or  lowest L/N/H 
classification during the Treatment Period.  Clinically important laboratory values based 
on prespecified criteria defined in the SAP will also be summarized.  
Additionally, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase will be presented in a separate listing, with 3× and 5×ULN flagged for 
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; 2×ULN flagged for bilirubin, 
and 1.5×ULN flagged for alkaline phosphatase.  
8.7.4 Vital Signs and ECGs 
Summary tables will include descriptive statistics for baseline and each postbaseline 
assessment.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated on both the actual score and the 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 51 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 change from baseline score.  Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken on or prior 
to the first day of dosing.  Note that the Day 1 assessment can be included in the 
evaluation of baseline if that the assessment is performed prior to dosing.  
If two  or more evaluations occur in the same visit window, the evaluation closest to the 
target vi sit day will be selected for inclusion in the analysis.  If multiple evaluations are 
equally close to the target visit day, then the latest evaluation will be selected for 
inclusion in the analysis.   
All vital sign summaries will include the patients in the Safety Population who have at 
least a postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline assessments) and with both a baseline and at least one postbaseline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline).  
Clinically notable vital signs will be identified based on the criteria defined in the SAP.  For each vital sign parameter, the number and percentage of patients with at least one notable value will be tabulated by week and overall for the Treatment Period. 
All vital signs will be listed in by- patient listings, including visit and collection date/time, 
and will be sorted by patient identifier and date/time of assessment.   
Electrocardiogram results include an overall interpretation of ‘normal,’ ‘abnormal but not 
clinically significant,’ or ‘abnormal and clinically significant.’  These results will be tabulated at each time point.   
Electrocardiogram results will be listed for each visit, including visit, whether ECG was 
performed (yes/no), explanation (if not performed), assessment da te/time, study date, 
overall interpretation, and relevant medical history number or adverse event number, if deemed a clinically significant abnormality.  
8.8 Additional Analyses  
8.8.1 Missed Dialysis Visits , Hospitalizations and  Incidence of Infection  
The number and percentage of patients who missed one or more dialysis visits during the 
Treatment Period, and the total number of missed dialyses visits will be tabulated.   
Incidence of infections based on adverse events and/or use of antibiotics for treatment of 
infection overall or related to pruritus wi ll be presented.  
The number and percentage of patients hospitalized during the Treatment Period, and the total number of hospitalization days will be tabulated.

 10.0 Ethics and Regulatory Compliance  
10.1 Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board 
A properly constituted, valid IRB /IEC, and the national regulatory authority, if required 
by the applicable laws in the country must review and approve the protocol, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, ICF, and related patient information and recruitment materials (if applicable) before the start of the study.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
ensure that written in formed consent is obtained from the patient before any activity or 
procedure is undertaken that is not part of routine care. 
The IRB /IEC  will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the 
rights, safety, and well-being of the patients.  The study will only be conducted at a site 
where IRB /IEC  approval has been obtained.   
If it is necessary to amend the protocol and/or ICF during the course of the study, the 
Investigator must ensure that the IRB /IEC /the national regulatory authority, if required by 
the applicable laws in the country reviews and approves these amended documents.  
Except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients, or when 
the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the s tudy (eg,  change in 
monitor, change of telephone number), no amendments to the study protocol will be 
made without the prior written agreement of the Sponsor and acknowledgement by the 
Investigator and, as applicable, the IRB /IEC /the national regulatory au thority, if required 
by the applicable laws in the country.  
The Investigator(s) will maintain documentation of the composition of the IRB /IEC  as 
well as all correspondence with the IRB /IEC .  The Investigator(s) will comply with local 
requirements for rout ine reporting to the IRB /IEC  as well as local and government 
requirements for notifying the IRB /IEC  of SAEs.  The Investigator will provide the 
Sponsor or its designee copies of all IRB /IEC  approval notices, correspondence, annual 
reports, and final study progress reports. 
10.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study

 10.3 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is required for all patients participating in this study.  In obtaining and 
documenting informed consent, the Investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirements and must adhere to GCP regulations.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that written informed consent is obtained from the patient before any activity or procedure is undertaken that is not part of routine care.  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and that continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  The Investigator or designee will discuss extensively with the pa rticipant patient the 
study risks.  Copies of the current, IRB /IEC -approved ICF detailing the risks and benefits 
of study participation will be provided to the participants.  Consent forms describing in detail the study drug and study procedures/intervention and risks will be fully explained to the patient and written documentation of informed consent will be required prior to starting participation in the study.  Upon reviewing the document, the Investigator or designee will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  The participants will sign the ICF prior to any procedures being performed specifically for the study.  The participants should have sufficient opportunity to discuss the study and process the information in the consent process prior to agreeing to participate.  The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study.  A signed copy of the ICF will be given to the participants for their records. Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF during their 
participation in the study.  
10.4 Patient Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all eCRFs, study drug accountability records, study reports, and communications will identify the patient by assigned patient number.  The Investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority(ies) access to the patient’s original medical records for verification of data gathered on the eCRFs and to audit the data collection process.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.  
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating Investigators, their 
staff, and the Sponsor(s) and their agents.  This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participating patients.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held 
in strict confidence.  No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the Sponsor may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by the Investigator, including, but not 
limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the 
participan ts in this study.

 11.0 Data Handling and Quality Assurance  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless transmitted to 
the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).  No data are to be recorded 
directly in the eCRF s (eg, all data will have a unique source).  The Investigator is 
responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF.  
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that  supports the 
information entered in the eCRF.  
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/I EC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including 
quality checking of the data.  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from 
source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that 
the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, ICH -GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study 
must be retained by the Investigator for 2 years after the marketing approval of the study drug or after discontinuing clinical development unless local regulations or inst itutional 
policies require a longer retention period.  No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor.  No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  If the 
Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must 
be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility.  If a custodial change or a change in record location occurs, the Sponsor must be notifi ed in writing.

 12.0 Administrative Procedures  
12.1 Protocol Adherence  
It is vital to the success of the study that the Investigator adhere to the details of the 
protocol, and thus to keep to a minimum the number of cases later classified as 
“incomplete,” “unusable,” or “not evaluable.”  If, in the interest of safety and/or well-being of a particular patient, it is necessary to depart from the protocol, then that 
protocol deviation will pertain to that individual patient only and will be documented.  Protocol deviations due to lack of patient compliance must also be documented.   
The site monitor will review protocol deviations throughout the course of monitoring 
visits and document new findings of deviations.  The monitor will notify the Investigators 
of deviations verbally or in writing.  The IRB/IEC  should be notified of all protocol 
deviations in a timely manner according to IRB/IEC  requirements.  
12.2 Publication of Study Findings  
All information regarding CR845 provided by Sponsor to the Investigator is privileged and confidential information.  By conducting this study, the Investigator affirms to the Sponsor that he/she will maintain, in strict confidence, information furnished by the 
Sponsor, including data generated from this study, except as exempted for regulatory 
purposes.  All data generated during the conduct of this study are owned by Sponsor.  The Investigator agrees to use the information to conduct the study and will not use it for 
other purposes without written permission from Sponsor .  Partial or full data o r results

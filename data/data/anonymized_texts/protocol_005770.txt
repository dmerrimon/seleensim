Study Site: Spaulding Clinical Research LLC, 525 South Silverbrook Drive, 
West Bend, WI53095
Background and 
Motivation:Sunscreens prevent skin damage by reflecting or absorbing 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation and they are regulated as drug products in 
the United States (U.S.). Most active ingredients in sunscreens are 
organic chemicals and some have been shown to be absorbed 
through human skin with detectable levels in the blood or urine. As 
part of the safety evaluation for sunscreen products, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) requests an assessment of systemic 
absorption in humans so that human blood levels can be compared 
with exposure levels obtained in nonclinical toxicology studies. If 
testing establishes that the sunscreen is not absorbed through the skin 
into the body, some aspects of toxicology testing may not be needed.
Sunscreen products may be applied multiple times daily as both 
primary sunscreen products and as ingredients in cosmetic products, 
in substantial amounts for a lifetime starting at 6 months of age. The 
amount of sunscreen ingredient in a product can vary, but permitted 
levels can be as high as 15% for some organic active ingredients and 
application to the skin can accumulate to gram quantities in a day 
even with modest use. Because of the significant use of these 
sunscreens, even a low percentage of systemic absorption (e.g., 
0.1%) could represent a significant systemic exposure in a single day 
and over a lifetime.
The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer calls 
on partners in prevention from various sectors across the nation to 
address skin cancer as a major public health problem by increasing 
awareness of skin cancer and promoting actions to reduce its risk. 
Given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 8 of 54 Version 1.4FDA is committed to finding ways to facilitate the marketing of 
sunscreen products that include additional over-the-counter (OTC) 
sunscreen active ingredients. The FDA will continue to work with 
industry and other public health agencies to ensure that the 
sunscreens consumers use are safe and effective for daily, life-long
use.
In November 2016, the U.S. FDA finalized the guidance titled 
“Guidance for Industry: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products 
Safety and Effectiveness Data” (sunscreen guidance). The guidance 
requests an assessment of the human systemic absorption of
sunscreen ingredients with a Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT). The 
FDA sunscreen guidance notes that some nonclinical toxicity studies 
may be waived if results of an adequately conducted human 
pharmacokinetic (PK) MUsT show a steady-state blood level less 
than 0.5 ng/mL.
Periodically, the FDA performs testing of products and formulations 
that the Agency sees as important for public health. This testing is 
not a reflection of rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but instead 
is done independently to measure the agency’s understanding of the 
products’ overall safety and effectiveness.
This study is not intended to meet all requirements of MUsT studies 
as outlined in the FDA guidance referenced above, but will follow 
many of the principles.
Summary and 
Objectives:Part 1is an open-label, randomized, 4-arm study in 24 healthy adult 
subjects with the primary objective:
To explore whether the active components (avobenzone, 
oxybenzone, ecamsule and octocrylene) of 4 sunscreen products 
(1 sunscreen product in each arm) are absorbed into the systemic 
circulation when a sunscreen productis applied under 
maximal-use conditions. 
One sunscreen product with the highest avobenzone exposure will be 
selected for the second part of the study. If there is no quantifiable 
exposure of avobenzone for any of the sunscreen products, the 
formulation with the highest oxybenzone exposure will be selected 
for Part 2. In addition,3 new sunscreen products are being included 
in Part 2.
Part 2is an open-label, 4-arm study in 48 healthy adult subjects with 
the following primary objective:
To assess the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of the 
active components (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene,
ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate, where applicable
[Part 2 products will not contain ecamsule]) of4 sunscreen 
products (1 sunscreen product in each arm) under maximal-use 
conditions.

13 December 2018 Page 9 of 54 Version 1.4Study Design: Part 1
Part 1 is an open-label, randomized, 4-arm pilot study to evaluate the 
effects of multiple applications of 4 different topical sunscreen 
formulations in healthy adult subjects. Each arm will include 
6 subjects (3 male and 3 female) with 1 formulation. A total of 
24 subjects (12 male and 12 female) from all 4 arms will be admitted 
to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 0. On the morning of 
Days 1 through 4, subjects will receive a topical application of the 
study drug at approximately 0900 hours. The study product will be 
weighed in advanceand applied by a qualified person from the study 
team. Subjects will then receive 3 more topical applications on the 
same day at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first dose.

Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 10 of 54 Version 1.4Part2
Part 2 is an open-label, 4-arm study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics 
of avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate and 
octinoxate (where applicable [Part 2 products will not contain 
ecamsule]) after multiple applications of a topical sunscreen 
formulation in healthy adult subjects. Part 2 will include 48 subjects 
(24 male and 24 female) and each arm will include 12 subjects (6 
male and 6 female). One of the formulations in Part 2 will be 
selected based on the plasma exposure data from the pilot study (Part 
1) along with 3additional formulations. A total of 48subjects (24
male and 24female) will be admitted to the CRU on Day0. On the 
morning of Days 1 through 4, subjects will receive a topical 
application of the study product at approximately 0900 hours. 
Thestudy drug will be weighed in advance and applied by a 
qualified person from the study team. Subjects willonly receive one 
application on Day 1. On Days 2, 3 and 4, subjects will receivean 
initial dose and 3 more topical applications on the same day at 2, 4, 
and 6 hours after the first dose.
Parts 1 and 2
In both parts, approximately 2 mg of active sunscreen ingredient per 
1 cm2of body surface (calculation per method of Dubois) will be 
evenly applied 4times per study day(except for a one-time 
application on the first day in part 2)to areas of thebody typically 
exposed to the sun: face, ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs 
(approximately 75% of the body surface area). The antecubital areas 
will be avoided when applying the sunscreen due to potential 
contamination of the sites used for intravenous PK blood sample 
collection. The topical applications of study drug will be 
administered with subjects in swim wear to simulate real-world 
settings as well as for easy application. In addition to swim wear, 
subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and at other times 
throughout the day/night. Subjects arerequired to shower each 
morning afterthe first PK blood sample collection(and before the 
first dose of the day), but not at other times during the day.
Blood samples (approximately 10 mL per sample) will be collected 
for determination of plasma concentrations for all active ingredients
(avobenzone, oxybenzone,octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, 
octisalate and octinoxate, where applicable).
Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital 
sign measurements, and physical examinations. All AEs reported by 
the subject or observed by the investigator or clinical research unit 
(CRU)staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed 
consent is signed and before study drug application will be recorded 
as medical history.
Subjects will remain in the CRU after admission on Day0 until the 
morning ofDay 7 following completion of scheduled End-of-Study
activitiesfor part 1. For part 2, subjects will undergo the same

Sunscreens prevent skin damage by reflecting or absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation and 
they are regulated as drug products in the United States (U.S.). Most active ingredients in 
sunscreens are organic chemicals and some have been shown to be absorbed through 
human skin with detectable levels in the blood or urine. As part of the safety evaluation 
for sunscreen products, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requests an assessment 
of systemic absorption in humans so that human blood levels can be compared with 
exposure levels obtained in nonclinical toxicology studies. If testing establishes that the 
sunscreen is not absorbed through the skin into the body, some aspects of toxicology 
testing may not be needed.
Sunscreen products may be applied multiple times daily as both primary sunscreen 
products and as ingredients in cosmetic products, in substantial amounts for a lifetime 
starting at 6 months of age. The amount of sunscreen ingredient in a product can vary, but 
permitted levels can be as high as 15% for some organic active ingredients and 
application to the skin can accumulate to gram quantities in a day even with modest use. 
Because of the significant use of these sunscreens, even a low percentage of systemic
absorption (e.g., 0.1%) could represent a significant systemic exposure in a single day 
and over a lifetime.
The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer calls on partners in 
prevention from various sectors across the nation to address skin cancer as a major public 
health problem by increasing awareness of skin cancer and promoting actions to reduce 
its risk. Given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, the FDA is 
committed to finding ways to facilitate the marketing of sunscreen products that include 
additional over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen active ingredients. The FDA will continue 
to work with industry and other public health agencies to ensure that the sunscreens 
consumers use are safe and effective for daily, life-long use.
In November 2016, the U.S. FDA finalized the guidance titled “Guidance for Industry: 
Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products Safety and Effectiveness Data” (sunscreen 
guidance) DHHS, 2016 ) [1]. The guidance requests an assessment of the human systemic 
absorption of sunscreen ingredients with a Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT). The FDA 
sunscreen guidance notes that some nonclinical toxicity studies may be waived if results 
of an adequately conducted human pharmacokinetic (PK) MUsT shows a steady-state 
blood level less than 0.5 ng/mL.
Periodically, the FDA performs testing of products and formulations that the Agency sees 
as important for public health. This testing is not a reflection of rulemaking or other 
regulatory actions, but instead is done independently to measure the agency’s 
understanding of the products’ overall safety and effectiveness.

FDA guidance referenced above, but will follow many of the principles.
4. Study Objectives
4.1. Primary Objectives
4.1.1 Part 1
Part 1 is an open-label, randomized, 4-arm study in 24 healthy adult subjects with the 
primary objective:
To explore whether the active components (avobenzone, oxybenzone, ecamsule and 
octocrylene) of 4 sunscreen products (1 sunscreen product in each arm) are absorbed 
into the systemic circulation when sunscreen is applied under maximal-use 
conditions. 
One sunscreen product with the highest avobenzone exposure will be selected for the 
second part of the study. If there is no quantifiable exposure of avobenzone for any of the 
sunscreen products, the formulation with the highest oxybenzone exposure will be 
selected for Part 2.
4.1.2 Part 2
Part 2 is an open-label, 4-arm study in 48 healthy adult subjects with the following 
primary objective:
To assess, where applicable, the pharmacokinetics and systemic absorption of the 
active components (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, 
octisalate and octinoxate) of 4 sunscreen products (1 sunscreen product in each 
arm) under maximal-use conditions.
5. Investigational Plan
5.1. Study Design
This will be a single clinical study conducted in 2 parts. The duration of study 
participation will be approximately 37 days for part 1, including a 30-dayscreening 
period, a 4-day treatment period (Days 1-4) and subjects leaving the clinic on the 
morning of Day 7 following completion of scheduled End-of-Study activities. For part 2, 
the duration of participation will be approximately 51 days, including a 30-day screening 
period, a 4-day treatment period (Days 1-4) and subjects leaving the clinic on the 
morning of Day 7. Subjects in part 2 will then return to the clinical for follow-up visits on 
Days 10, 14 and 21 after which End-of-Study activities will be completed.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 21 of 54 Version 1.45.1.1 Part 1
Part 1 is an open-label, randomized, 4-arm pilot study to evaluate the effects of multiple 
applications of 4 different topical sunscreen formulations in healthy adult subjects. Each 
arm will include 6 subjects (3 male and 3 female) with 1 formulation. A total of 
24 subjects (12 male and 12 female) from all 4 arms will be admitted to the clinical 
research unit (CRU) on Day 0.
On the morning of Days 1 through 4, subjects will receive a topical application of the 
study product at approximately 0900 hours. Thestudy drug will be weighed in advance 
and appliedby a qualified person from the study team. Subjects will then receive 3 more 
topical applications on the same day at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first dose.
5.1.2 Part 2
Part 2 is an open-label, 4-arm-study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of avobenzone, 
oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate(Part 2 products will not 
contain ecamsule)after multiple applications of a topical sunscreen formulation in 
healthy adult subjects. Part 2 will include 48 subjects (24 male and 24 female)and 12 
subjects in each arm (6 male and 6 female).One of the formulations in Part2 will be 
selected based on the plasma exposure data from the pilot study (Part 1). In addition, 3
new formulations will be added.
On the morning of Days 1 through 4, subjects will receive a topical application of the 
study product at approximately 0900 hours. Thestudy drug will be weighed in advance 
and applied by a qualified person from the study team. Subjects will only receive one 
application on Day 1. On Days 2, 3 and 4, subjects will receive an initial dose and 3 more 
topical applications on the same day at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first dose.
5.1.3 Tape Stripping
For Part 2 only, skin tape stripping(6 consecutive strippings)of the lower back (area: 
around 3.8 cm2)will be conducted once on Days 7 and 14 to determine residual 
sunscreen active ingredients in the superficial layers of the skin. The intention of the 
stripping is to determine the concentration of sunscreen active ingredients in superficial 
layers to estimate the potential skin deposit and 6-8 strips will be required to remove 
most of the stratum corneum layer [2-3]. The number of strips is restricted to 6 to 
minimize any skin irritation or skin rash [2-3].

13 December 2018 Page 22 of 54 Version 1.45.1.4 Common Procedures
Details of study visits and study procedures are described in Section 5.6 and Section 5.7,
respectively, and the overall Schedule of Events for both parts of the study is presented in 
Section 10.1.
In both parts of the study, approximately 2 mg of sunscreen per 1 cm2of body surface 
(calculation per method of Dubois) will be evenly applied 4 times per study day(except 
for a one-time application on the first day in part 2)to areas of the body typically exposed 
to the sun: face, ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs (approximately 75% of the body surface 
area). The antecubital areas will be avoided when applying the sunscreen due to potential 
contamination of the sites used for intravenous (IV) PK blood sample collection. The 
topical applications of the study drug will be administered with subjects in swim wear to 
simulate real world settings as well as for easy application. In addition to swim wear, 
subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and at other times throughout the 
day/night. Subjects are required to shower each morning afterthe first PK blood sample 
collection (and before the first sunscreen application for that day), but not at other times 
during the day. And, subjects should not use any personal care products which contain 
avobenzone, oxybenzone, ecamsule, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate or octinoxate
during the study.
Blood samples (approximately 10 mL per sample) will be collected for determination of 
avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate 
(where applicable)plasma concentrations.
Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, 
and physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the 
investigator or CRU staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed consent is 
signed and before study drug application will be recorded as medical history.
Subjects will remain in the CRU after admission on Day 0 until discharge on the morning 
of Day 7. In Part 2, subjects will return to the clinicon Day 10, 14 and 21 for follow-up
PK sampling(Days 10, 14 and 21)and tape stripping (Days 14).
Subjects are not allowed to use products containing any of theactive ingredients from 7
days before check-in until completion of End-of-Study procedures.
5.1.5 Risk/Benefit
Subjects will be informed that participation in a human PK study like the present one 
cannot be of benefit to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, the information from the 
physical examination, vital sign measurements, and ECG results may be shared with the 
subject’s personal physician if this is the subject’s choice. Subjects will be informed that 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 23 of 54 Version 1.4it is also their choice to inform their personal physician that they are participating in this 
research study.
Subjects will be informed that their contribution to the study is of major importance to 
agencies like the U.S. FDA for helping this agency better evaluate the effects of human 
systemic absorption of sunscreen ingredients. However, since this is a study involving 
healthy volunteers, subjects will be informed that they have the alternative not to 
participate.
Subjects will be informed that they may be exposed to risks associated with the 
pharmacological properties of the study drugs and the study procedures.
The study sunscreen products will not be administered to anyone who is pregnant. All 
women must take a pregnancy test before receiving any study drug in this study. All men 
and all women of childbearing potential enrolled in this study will be informed that they 
must use 2 highly effective birth control methods (as determined by the investigator or 
designee; one of the methods must be a barrier technique) during the study and for at 
least 1 month after the last application of study drug. Subjects will be informed that they 
must notify the investigator if they or their female partners become pregnant during the 
course of the study.
Subjects will be informed that insertion of an IV catheter may be required for blood 
sample collection on Days 1 and 4 and, during insertion of the catheter, soreness, 
bruising, or infection at the insertion site are possible but unlikely. Subjects will also be 
informed that dizziness and lightheadedness may occur during direct venipuncture, 
insertion of the IV catheter, or during blood collection.
Subjects will be informed thattape stripping applied to the skin may cause mild pain or 
irritation and skin rash at the area of tape stripping after the procedure.
Subjects will be informed that they may eat only meals and snacks that are provided 
during periods of their stay in the study clinic, and that they must consume all of each 
meal that is served at a reasonable pace (within 25 minutes).
Subjects will be informed that the confidentiality of their data will be respected at all 
times according to state law, and the study personnel handlingtheir study data are bound 
by confidentiality agreements.
Subjects will be informed that the study drug and all tests, procedures, and visits required 
by the study are provided at no cost to them. If subjects become ill or physically injured 
because of participation in this study, they will be informed that costs of treatment will 
not be covered by the sponsor.

documents the subject initials and reason(s) for screening failure, will be maintained by 
the investigator for all screening failures. A copy of the log should be retained in the 
investigator’s study files.
If a subject fails the screening process because of an abnormal laboratory result, they can 
receive a copy of the results upon request. The investigator will determine if follow up 
for the abnormal laboratory result is needed, and will encourage the subject to follow up 
with his or her personal physician as appropriate. All subjects will be informed as to the 
reason(s) they are excluded from study participation, even if follow up is not required. If 
a subject fails the screening process because of a positive test result for human 
immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis, the positive result will be reported to local health 
authorities as required by law.
5.4. Terminationof Study or Investigational Site
5.4.1 Criteria for Termination of the Study
The study will be completed as planned unless one of the following criteria is satisfied 
that requires early termination of the study:
New information regarding the safety or efficacy of the study product(s) that indicates 
a change in the known risk profile for the study drug(s), such that the risk is no longer 
acceptable for subjects participating in the study.
Significant violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to 
achieve the primary study objective or compromises subject safety.
5.4.2 Criteria for Termination of Investigational Site
The study site may be terminated if the site (including the investigator) is found in 
significant violation of GCP, the protocol, the contractual agreement, or is unable to 
ensure adequate performance of the study.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 27 of 54 Version 1.4In the event that the sponsor elects to terminate the study or the investigational site, a 
study-specific procedure for early termination will be provided by the sponsor; the 
procedure will be followed by the applicable investigational site during the course of 
termination.
5.5. Criteria for Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn by the investigator without the approval of the subject based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment. A subject is not required to provide a written request to 
withdraw from the study; however, a written request is required if a subject withdraws 
consent for his or her personaldata to be used for study-related purposes.
A subject may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:
AE: The subject has experienced an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
requires early termination. The appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) must 
be completed for each AE. If a subject is discontinued from the study due to an AE, 
the investigator is required to follow up with the subject until the event resolves or 
becomes stable. If a subject dies during the study, the cause of death must be reported 
as a serious AE (SAE), with an outcome of death noted in the eCRF.
Protocol Violation: The subject failed to meet protocol entry criteria or did not adhere 
to protocol requirements, and continued participation poses an unnecessary risk to the 
subject’s health.
Withdrawal by Subject: The subject (or other responsible individual [e.g., caregiver]) 
wishes to withdraw from the study in the absence of a medical need.
NOTE: Withdrawal due to an AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary 
withdrawal” category.
Study Terminated by Sponsor: The sponsor, IRB, FDA, or other regulatory agency 
terminates the study.
Pregnancy: The subject is found to be pregnant.
NOTE: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn 
immediately. The pregnancy will be followed up to term, and the outcome, including 
any premature termination will be recorded. All live births must be followed for a 
minimum of 30 days or until the first well baby visit.

Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 28 of 54 Version 1.4NOTE: This category records withdrawals caused by an accidental or a medical 
emergency, unblinding, and other rare cases. The specific reason should be recorded 
in the comment space of the eCRF.
5.5.1 Handling of Withdrawals
The investigator may terminate a subject’s study participation at any time during the 
study when the subject meets the criteria described in Section 5.5. In addition, a subject 
may discontinue his or her participation without giving a reason at any time during the 
study. Subjects will be informed that their participation in the study is voluntary, that 
refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time without 
penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.
Should a subject’s participation be discontinued, the primary reason for termination must 
be recorded. In addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures scheduled for 
the early termination visit. Any data and samples collected before subject withdrawal will 
become the property of the sponsor.
5.5.2 Replacement Subjects
Approximately 72 healthy subjects are planned for enrollment, of which 24 subjects will 
be enrolled and randomized in Part 1 and 48 subjects will be enrolled and randomizedin 
Part 2. Up to 18 subjects may be qualified as replacements. Thus, a maximum of 
90 subjects may be exposed to study drugs and procedures during the study.
5.6. Study Visits
5.6.1 Recruitment
Recruitment materials (e.g., internet, radio, and print advertisements, social media posts) 
will be approved by the local IRB before telephone screening. The sponsor is responsible 
for registration of the study on clinicaltrials.gov; however, this may not occur until the 
IRB has approved the final study protocol.
5.6.1.1 Compensation
Subjects will be offered payment for Screening; however, if the results of theiralcohol 
and drug screening tests are positive, they will not be compensated. Subjects who 
complete the entire study (Day0 to Day 7 in Part 1 orDay 0 to Day 21 in Part2) will 
receive payment according to the schedule provided in the informed consent form. No 
special incentives are offered. Final payment will not be released until all follow-up
procedures have been completed and accepted by the investigator.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 29 of 54 Version 1.4If a subject chooses to withdraw from the study prematurely, he or she will only be 
compensated for completed days. If subjects are withdrawn for medical reasons or if the 
study is halted temporarily or permanently, the subjects will receive compensation 
proportional to the time spent in the study. No compensation will be provided if a subject 
is dismissed from the study for noncompliance (e.g., improper conduct, ingesting alcohol 
and/or drugs [including recreational drugs], tampering with the study drug, consuming 
any prohibited foods or beverages).
If subjects are required to stay in the clinic for a longer period for safety reasons, they 
will be compensated at a rate proportional to the entire compensation for the study. If a 
subject becomes ill or physically injured because of participation in this study, the subject 
will be referred for treatment.
5.6.2 Screening
The following procedures and assessments will be performed at Screening (Day–30 to 
Day–1):
Obtain informed consent/HIPAA authorization (The informed consent process will be 
performed by a clinical research nurse in a private room. The subject will be given

NOTE: when a time point corresponds with sunscreen administration, the PK sample will 
be collected before sunscreen administration.
5.7.1.2 Tape Stripping Sample Collection
For Part 2 only, tape stripping of the lower back to an area of around 3.8 cm2will be 
conducted once on Days 7 and 14 to determine residual sunscreen active ingredients in 
the superficial layers of the skin. Tape stripping will be applied to different areas of the 
lower back on Day 7 vs. Day 14 to prevent false sampling.
The area on the lower back for each subject will be marked with a skin marker. Before 
executing the tape stripping, hair on the marked area will be removed with the 3M 
trimmer (no razors as this would damage the skin and could lead to false sampling). A 
pre-weighed standard tape (Standard D-Squame ® adhesive tape)will be applied to a 
marked area under constant pressure of 225 g/cm2for 5 seconds using a D-Squame ®

weighing. Tape stripping will be performed 6 additional consecutive times in the same 
area with sampling intervals of 1 ± 0.5 minutes.
5.7.1.3 Pharmacokinetic Specimen Handling
The PK blood samples (10 mL each) will be collected into tubes containing K 2EDTA, 
inverted several times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant, and placed in an ice bath. 
Within 30 minutes of collection, the samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at 
3000 revolutions per minute, at 4°C, by a study team member.
The plasma will be separated using a disposable plastic pipette and approximately half of 
the plasma will be transferred into duplicate cryotube vials labeled as Aliquot A 
(primary) and Aliquot B (backup). The plasma samples will be appropriately labeled and 
stored frozen at –70°C or below until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be 
maintained and accessible for review by the study monitor.
The Aliquot A samples (primary) will be shipped first, on dry ice, to the bioanalytical 
laboratory at FDA for processing when requested by the sponsor. The Aliquot B samples 
(backup) will be held for a second shipment at a time after the completion of all Aliquot 
A sample shipment(s) and the timing of the Aliquot B shipment communicated by the 
sponsor. None of the PK blood samples will be stored at clinical facility for future use,
however the sponsor will store them for analytical purposes of this study only.
Thetape strips will betransferredto pre-labeled D Squame ® standard storage cards and
stored frozen at –70°C or below until shipment.
Both plasmaand skin concentrations of avobenzone, oxybenzone,ecamsule, octocrylene,
homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate(where applicable)will be assayed using a 
validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method.

5.7.2 Safety Assessments
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AEs, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature), and physical examination findings.
5.7.2.1 Adverse Events
5.7.2.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions
An AE is defined as any untoward and/or unintended sign, including an abnormal clinical 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Events or conditions that 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 35 of 54 Version 1.4increase in frequency or severity during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human 
clinical trials will also be considered AEs.
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins after study 
drug administration.
An unexpected AE is any AE having a specificity or severity not consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure for the study drug(s).
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that meets the following criteria:
Results in death,
Is life threatening,
Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
Is an important medical event that may not meet the previous criteria but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent oneof the outcomes listed previously.
5.7.2.1.2 Adverse Event Reporting
The recording of AEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and 
will continue until discharge (or early termination). All AEs, whether serious or 
nonserious and whether or not related to the study drug, must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Study subjects will be instructed to warn study staff if he or she has any unexpected 
symptoms. In addition, all subjects will receive a reminder telephone call approximately 
24 hours before Check-in.
Any SAE (whether expected or unexpected) must be entered into the eCRF system and 
reported by facsimile to the medical monitor or designee using the SAE Reporting Form 
within 24 hours of the investigator or study clinic staff becoming aware of the event. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to report all SAEs to the medical monitor, to provide 
the most complete report possible, and to assess each SAE for its relationship to the study 
drug. The investigator is responsible for obtaining follow-up information on all SAEs and 
submitting follow-up SAE data. Any unexpected SAEs must be reported promptly to the 
investigator’s IRB as per the IRB’s requirements.
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, the sponsor will notify the appropriate 
FDA authorities by telephone or facsimile within 7 calendar days of receipt of the report. 
The sponsor will follow all 7-day alert reports with a written report within 10 working 
days of receipt of the case. Serious AE cases that concern nonfatal, nonlife-threatening 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 36 of 54 Version 1.4events that are unexpected and at least possibly related to the study drug will be 
submitted in writing to the FDA within 10 working days of receipt.
Furthermore, any AEs that are not expected, occur at a higher frequency, or would 
require modification of the study protocol and/or informed consent must be reported to 
the FDA within 10 working days.
Adverse events that are assessed by the investigator as possibly or probably related to the 
study drug will be followed until they resolve or stabilize. All SAEs will be followed 
until resolution.
5.7.2.1.3 Assessment of Severity
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using the following scale:
Mild: The subject is aware of the AE but is still able to perform all activities; minimal 
or no medical intervention or therapy is required.
Moderate: The subject has to discontinue some activities due to the AE; minimal or 
no medical intervention or therapy is required.
Severe: The subject is incapacitated by the AE and is unable to perform normal 
activities; significant medical intervention or therapy is required and hospitalization is 
possible.
5.7.2.1.4 Assessment of Causality
The investigator will assess the causal relationship/relatedness of each AE to the study 
drug using the following scale:
Not Related: Onset of the AE has no reasonable temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, a causal relationship to administration of the study 
drug is biologically implausible, or the event is attributed to an alternative etiology.
Unlikely Related: Onset of the AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study 
drug administration and although a causal relationship is unlikely, it is biologically 
plausible.
Possibly Related: Onset of the AE has a strong temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, cannot be explained by the subject’s clinical state or 
other factors, and a causal relationship is biologically plausible.
Probably Related: Onset of the AE shows a distinct temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug that cannot be explained by the subject’s clinical 
state or other factors, the AE is a known reaction to the product or chemical group, or 
can be predicted by the product’s pharmacology.

5.8.2 Method Assigning Subjects to Treatment
5.8.2.1 Randomization Process
Part 1 and Part 2
The FDA project biostatistician will create the specifications that will be used to generate 
the randomization schedule. The specifications will be based on the protocol 
requirements and appropriate statistical programming with consideration for study 
design, number of treatments, number of subjects planned for enrollment, stratification, 
and blocking.
Based on these specifications, the project biostatistician (or designee) will generate a 
dummy randomization schedule. The schedule is generated by a SAS®/ R or other
program, which produces output file(s) and/or SAS or R dataset(s).
The project biostatistician (or designee) distributes the ‘dummy’ randomization schedule 
to specified personnel for review. Any change (e.g., change in block size, change in 
stratification levels) that requires an update to the specifications will reset this process. 
Minor changes (e.g., display formatting) will not require a change to the specifications.
No transfer is necessary if the unblinded randomization biostatistician also created the 
‘dummy’ randomization.
The randomization biostatistician is responsible for generating the final randomization 
schedule. 
Randomization will occur after informed consent is obtained, either after completion of 
check-in procedures on Day0 or just before dosingon Day1. Unique subject numbers 
will be used in sequential order based on each subject’s order of qualification.

the use of personal health information (if separate from the informed consent form), 
copies of all eCRFs, query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition, to enable 
evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities, the sponsor, or its designees.
Furthermore, ICH4.9.5 requires the investigator to retain essential documents specified 
in ICH E6(R1) (Section 8) until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application for a specified drug indication being investigated or, if an application is not 
approved, until at least 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory 
authorities are notified. In addition, ICH4.9.5 states that the study records should be 
retained until an amount of time specified by applicable regulatory requirements or for a 
time specified in the clinical study site agreement between the investigator and sponsor.
Refer to the clinical study site agreement for the sponsor’s requirements on record 
retention. The investigator should contact and receive written approval from the sponsor 
before disposing of any such documents.
8.1.6 Financial Disclosure and Obligations
The investigator is required to provide financial disclosure information to allow the 
sponsor to submit the complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements 
required under 45 CFR 45. In addition, the investigator must provide to the sponsor a 
commitment to update this information promptly if any relevant changes occur during the 
course of the investigation and for 1 year after the completion of the study.
Neither the sponsor nor the study clinic is financially responsible for further testing or 
treatment of any medical condition that may be detected during the screening process.
8.2. Confidentiality and Disclosure of Data
All subjects will sign a HIPAA-compliant authorization form containing the mandated 
core elements and requirements before participation in this clinical study. The sponsor 
and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection against 
invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s electronic data capture system database or documentation via a unique 
identification number. As permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited 
subject attributes such as gender, age or date of birth, and subject initials may be used to 
verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique identification number.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 48 of 54 Version 1.4To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the 
sponsor requires that the investigator allow review of the subject’s original medical 
records (source data or documents) by the study monitor, representatives from any 
regulatory authority(e.g., FDA), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the appropriate 
IRB. These medical records will include, but will not be limited to, clinical laboratory 
test result reports, ECG reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospital 
admissions occurring during a subject’s study participation, and autopsy reports. Access 
to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific authorization of the subject as 
part of the informed consent process.
Copies of any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have 
certain personally identifiable information removed (i.e., subject name, address, and other 
identifier fields not collected in the subject’s eCRF).
Data will be maintained and backed up in the electronic data capture system. All access 
to the data is protected by username and password, and each staff member and all sponsor 
staff will have separate access that requires a separate username and password. Access is 
only given to site staff and requested sponsor staff who have completed the appropriate 
training.
8.3. Certificate of Confidentiality
In order to protect the privacy of subjects, Certificates of Confidentiality will be obtained 
prior to the initiation of the study.
8.4. Subject Consent
Written informed consent in compliance with 45 CFR 46 will be obtained from each 
subject before entering the study or performing any unusual or nonroutine procedure that 
involves risk to the subject. An informed consent template may be provided by the 
sponsor to the study clinic. If any institution-specific modifications to study-related 
procedures are proposed or made by the study clinic, the consent should be reviewed by 
the sponsor or its designee or both before IRB submission. Once reviewed, the consent 
will be submitted by the investigator to the IRB for review and approval before the start 
of the study. If the informed consent form is revised during the course of the study, all 
active participating subjects must sign the revised form.
Before enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of the study 
and be allowed to read the approved informed consent form. The informed consent 
process will be performed by a clinical research nurse in a private room. The subject will 
be given unlimited time to ask questions regarding study participation, and each subject 
will be questioned to ensure their understanding. Once the investigator is assured that the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 49 of 54 Version 1.4subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject will be 
asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.
The investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to the subject. 
The original form will be maintained in the subject’s medical records at the site.
8.5. Data Collection
Full details of procedures for data collection and handling will be documented in the data 
management plan, which is initiated with the final protocol receipt. The data management 
plan is a changing document that evolves over the course of the study and is finalized by 
database lock.
8.6. Publications
No information related to or generated by this study will be released to the public until it 
has been reviewed by the sponsor. The sponsor shall own intellectual rights for the data 
and analysis resulting from this study and results cannot be presented or published 
without written permission from the sponsor. Authorship on publications will be 
determined by standard journal requirements.
9. Study Management
9.1. Release of Study Drug to the Study Clinic
Before the study drug can be released to thestudy clinic, the following documents will be 
collected from the study clinic by the clinical research organization, retained in the trial 
master file, and a study drug shipment approval form will be completed by the clinical 
research organization:

Conduct study drug accountability
These monitoring activities will be done in order to verify that the: 
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
The safety and rights of the subjects are being protected.
The study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol 
(including any amendments), GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.
In addition, the sponsor, designated auditors, and government inspectors must be allowed 
access to eCRFs, source documents, and other study files that may be required to evaluate 
the conduct of the study.
9.3. Management of Protocol Amendments and Deviations
9.3.1 Modification of the Protocol
Any changes in this research activity, except those necessary to remove an apparent 
immediate hazard to the subject, must be submitted to the sponsor or designee and 
reviewed and approved by the IRB before implementation. Amendments to the protocol 
must be submitted in writing to the IRB for approval before subjects are enrolled into an 
amended protocol.
9.3.2 Protocol Violations and Deviations
Any significant protocol deviations that the investigator or study clinic staff believes are 
of major importance (e.g., incorrect randomizations, subject enrolled but not eligible) 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 51 of 54 Version 1.4should be reported to the IRB as soon as possible. Significant protocol deviations may 
include the following:
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria that may affect subject safety
Deviations (omission or delay) of safety monitoringprocedures
Deviations in the administration of the study drug
Deviations in obtaining informed consent

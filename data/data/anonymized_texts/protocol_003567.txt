The individuals below do not need to be identified by name, rather, by qualifications. As long as the qualifications of the individuals 
and the procedures performed remain the same, a modification is not needed. 
If an individual is not an agent of the UW, indicate his/her institution or organization. Should an individual not be associated with an 
institution or organization , state so. For all non-UW individuals , it will be necessary for this individual to receive !RB review. There 
are a number of mechanisms by which this may occur. 
• If the non-UW individual is associated with Pacific Northwest National Laboratories , Puget Sound Blood Center, King 
County-Seattle Public Health, or Northwest Kidney Center: the UW has an institutional Authorization Agreement with 
these institutions by which it provides the IRB review (as long as any funding is administered through the UW). 
• If the non-UW individual is assoc1ated with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Group Health, Seattle children's , 
Swedish Medical Center, or Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason: the terms of the UW's Cooperative IRB 
Agreement with these institutions may or may not allow the UW IRB to do the review. The individual should contact their 
institution 's IRB for guidance. 
APPLICATION : Human Subjects Review ( I 3-11 ), Full Board or Subcommittee (Rev. I 1/26/2014) 
PAGE4 
• If the non-UW individual is associated with an institution or organization in which the UW does not have a Cooperative IRB 
Agreement, it will be necessary for the non-UW individual to provide their own IRB review. If the non-UW individual 's 
institution or organization does not have their own IRB or does not use an IRB for review of their research and the non-UW 
individual 's institution or organization has a Federalwide Assurance (FWA), the non-UW individual's institution or 
organization may enter into an IRB Authorization Agreement with the UW. This means that the UW will provide IRB 
review for the non-UW individual. The non-UW Individual's institution or organization may also wish to enter into an IRB 
Authorization Agreement even if they have their own !RB to prevent duplication of effort. However, entering into an !RB 
Authorization Agreement with a non-UW individual's institution or organization is at the discretion of the HSD. 
• If the non-UW individual is not associated with an institution or organization or if the non-UW individual is associated with 
an institution or organization that does not have a FW A and does not routinely conduct research, an Individual Investigator 
Agreement may be entered into with the UW. The Individual Investigator Agreement extends the applicability of the UW's 
FW A to cover the non-UW individual , institution or organization . However, entering into an Individual Investigator 
Agreement with a non-UW individual , institution or organization is at the discretion of the HSD.

VIII. SUMMARY OF ACTIVITY. Answer in spaces provided (add numbered , referenced , single-sided sheets when necessary) . 
Do not refer to an accompanying grant or contract proposal. 
A. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF RESEARCH. Provide relevant background information and explain in lay language 
why this research is important and what question(s) or hypotheses this activity is designed to answer. 
Amputation of a limb is a life-altering event with profound physical , psychological , and 
social implications. To address their functional , vocational , and recreational needs, 
people with lower limb amputation (LLA) are often provided with a prosthesis or 
artificial leg. While use of a prosthesis can allow an individual to achieve a basic 
level of functional mobility , absence of an anatomical foot and ankle still impairs 
their physical performa nce. As a result , people with LLA regularly exhibit decreased 
walking speeds , diminished endurance, and restricted ability to participate in desired 
life situations. 
Over the past three decades, increasingly sophisticate d prosthetic foot designs have 
been developed by the prosthetics industry to replace amputated structures in the leg. 
Contemp orary, energy storing feet (ESF) employ advanced materials and unique geometric 
designs to improve walking performance and endurance of their users. Although prosthetic 
limbs with ESF allow people with LLA the potential to return to an active lifestyle, 
even the most advanced ESF do not significantly reduce the increased energy demands 
required for walking when compared to conventional prosthetic feet. 
Commercially -available running-specific feet (RSF) like the Ossur Cheetah (Ossur, 
Reykjavik , Iceland) allow people with LLA to participate in athletic activities and 
sporting events. RSF provide significantly enhanced performance , compared to traditio nal 
ESF, by extending the length and increasing the stiffness of the prosthetic keel 
(forefoot) . RSF also do not include a heel, as they are used only for running 
activities. Although transtibial runners with RSF exhibit endurance levels similar to 
non-amputees, the RSF design does not allow the biomechanical movements or provide the 
stability needed to use the foot for walking (over level or uneven terrain) . 
A Seattle -area prosthetist, Greg Davidson , currently provides many of his active LLA 
patients with a modified running -specific foot (mRSF). The mRSF combines the running 
keel (forefoot) of a RSF with the walking heel of a ESF. The mRSF can then be used for 
walking, running, and other routine daily activities . Mr. Davidso n has fit and provided 
this prosthetic foot on over 100 of his patients. Preliminary feedback suggests that 
users experience improved overall function and high satisfaction with the device . 
However , empirical evidence is needed to support prescription of this prosthetic foot at 
other clinical facilities . The goal of this study is therefore to evaluate endurance, 
walking performance, mobility , and perceived exertion of transtibial prosthesis users 
(i.e., study participants) walking with a conventional ESF and the mRSF. Results will be 
compared to determine if the mRSF provides superior performance to the ESF, which is 
commonly prescribed to most active individu als with LLA. 
Hypotheses: 
la. Participants with LLA will exhibit significantly increased endurance (as evidenced 
by an ability to walk significantly further in a timed walking test) wearing the 
mRSF compared to the ESF. 
lb. Participants will report significantly reduced levels of exertion after performing a 
timed walking test in the mRSF, compared to the ESF. 
2a. Participants will report significantly increased mobility, balance confidence , and 
health and significantly decreased fatigue when using the mRSF, compared to the ESF. 
3a. Use of the mRSF will signific antly reduce participants ' net energy cost of walking 
(ECW) at slow, comfortable , and fast walking speeds, compare d to the ESF. 
8. RESEARCH PROCEDURES INVOLVED. 
I. Provide a complete description of: a. the study design, and b. sequence and timing of all study procedures that will be 
performed, e.g., volume of blood, size of biopsy, drug administration, questionnaire, name of psychological test. Provide this 
information for each phase of the study (pilot, screening, intervention and follow-up). Use lay language . Attach study flow 
sheet, if available . 
APPLICATION: Human Subjects Review (13-11), Full Board or Subcommittee (Rev. 11/26/2014) 
PAGE 8 
We will conduct a study to compare endurance , walking performance , mobility , and 
perceived exertion of participants with transtibial amputation wearing two different 
prostheses : (1) a prosthesis with a modified Running Specific Foot (mRSF), and (2) a 
prosthesis with a Energy Storing Foot (ESF). To maximize study resources, we will 
recruit participants who will be receiving from their prosthetist the mRSF prosthesis 
as part of their normal clinical care. We will fabricate a duplicate prosthesis with 
the ESF as part of this study to be used as a comparison . 
Note: Both the mRSF and ESF included in this study are devices that people with LLA use 
daily in their normal lives outside of this study. These feet (and other components 
included in the prostheses created for this study) are class I devices and exempt from 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration premarket notificatio n procedures. 
We will conduct a randomized crossover study to compare endurance , energy expenditure , 
and reported health of participants with transtibial amputation wearing prostheses with 
the mRSF and ESF described above. Study participants will be randomly assigned to the 
first foot condition (i.e. ESF or mRSF). To standard ize test conditions , the 
participant 's prosthetist (Greg Davidson) will fabricate two comparable prostheses with 
identical (i.e. duplicated) prosthetic sockets, interfaces, and suspension mechanisms. 
The same socket cannot be used for both prostheses because of the unique , direct ­
lamination attachment of the mRSF to the socket. The duplicate socket will be fitted 
with common ESF, the Ossur Vari-flex foot. We have obtained written commitments from 
Ossur to donate prosthetic components and from Davidson Prosthetics to donate time and 
materials needed to fabricate the duplicate sockets and test prostheses. Participants 
will be asked to wear the same athletic shoes for all sessions in order to standardized 
footwear between tests. 
Participants will be recruited from their local prosthetist 's office (Davidson 
Prosthetics , Federal Way, WA). Davidson Prosthet ics is the sole location for 
recruitment as this is the only provider of the mRSF in the Northwestern United States. 
Partici~ants will be asked to come to the University of Washington Assessment and 
Training Laboratory (ATL) for three test sessions. Participation in the study will 
require participants attend three visits over the course of about three months , 
totaling approx imately 7.5 hours. 
Session i: At the first session , we will screen participants , explain the study to 
them, and obtain informed consent (Appendix 1). Participants who agree will then be 
administered a baseline survey and perform initial speed testing . The baseline survey 
will include non-identifiabl e, medical , and demographic questions we will use to 
characterize the study sample (Appendix 2). Participants will then be asked to walk on 
a treadmill for 6 minutes to determine their c·omfortable walking speed. The treadmill 
is equipped with full-length handrails that allow the participant to steady him/herself 
as needed. A researcher will be next to the subject at all times to assist the subject 
if he or she were to become distressed. 
Participants will be given blinded control of the treadmill speed for the first 30 
seconds of testing in order to select their preferred speed. Each participant 's 
comfortable speed will be noted and used as a reference for the metabolic testing (see 
Session 2 and 3, described below) . Slow and fast speeds will be self-selected using an 
identical method (blinded control of the treadmill adjustment) . Participants will be 
asked to perform a 6 minute practice trial at their self-selected fast speed to ensure 
the participant is capable of sustaining the speed without undo stress. If a 
participant is unable to sustain the set speed for the entire 6 minutes , he/she may 
reduce speed as desired, and a weighted average of the start and end fast speeds will 
be used for treadmill testing in Sessions 2 and 3. We will also give participants a 
step activity monitor to wear on their prosthesis . The activity monitor is a small, 
unobtrusive sensor about the size of a pager that is worn on the prosthesis and 
measures steps taken by the participant while they are away from the lab. Participants 
will be shown how to attach the activity monitor to their prosthesis by study 
investigators . Session 1 is expected to take about 1.5 hours. 
Session 2: The second session will be performed after participants use the randomly­
assigned ESF or mRSF prosth esis for a period of 1 month. Upon arrival at the lab, study

staff will remove the activity monitor and ask the participant to complete a self­
report survey (Appendix 2) to evaluate their perceived performance, health , and 
satisfaction with their prosthesis . The survey will be administered on a tablet 
computer (iPad) and includes the following standardized instruments selected to measure 
participants' mobility, fatigue , balance confidence, activity restrictions, and 
satisfaction: 
• Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility -PLUS-M measures respondents' self­
reported mobility with a prosthesis. The PLUS-M was developed by the 
investigators in a prior study to address methodological limitat ions present in 
existing mobility measures. We will administer the PLUS-M computer adaptive test 
(CAT) to achieve the greatest precision of measurement and ease respondents ' 
burden (i.e., CAT requires participants answer fewer questions than would taking 
the entire survey) . 
• PROMIS -Fatigue -PROMIS-F measures symptoms and effects of fatigue on 
respondents' ability to execute daily activities over a 1-week recall period . We 
will also administer PROMIS-F by CAT. 
• Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale -ABC measures respondents' 
confidence in performing basic ambulatory activities . We will administer a 
version of the ABC recommended to ease administration and improve scoring. All 16 
questions of the ABC will be administered (CAT not available). 
• Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales -Revised -TAPES-Risa 
multidimensional health instrument that measures activity restrictions and 
satisfaction with a prosthesis. We will administer 19 TAPES-R questions (CAT not 
available) . 
We will next assess participants' walking performance and endurance using the 6-minute 
walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT is a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance that 
exhibits good test-retest reliability in transtibial prosthesis users. The 6MWT will be 
conducted using a 100ft unobstructed indoor hallway , in accordance with recommended 
administration guidelines . During the 6MWT, participants will walk back and forth over 
a pressure -sensitive instrumented mat placed in the middle of the hallway . The mat will 
collect outcomes associated with walking such as step length , step width, walking 
speed. Upon conclusion of the 6MWT, participants will self-report their exertion using 
the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). The Borg RPE measures participants' 
perceived exertion after completing a standardized physical test. Note, participants 
will perform the 6MWT after evaluation of resting 02 consumption (see below) but before 
the treadmil l testing so as to ensure baseline 02 consumption is not adversely affected 
by the 6MWT. 
To assess the effect s of the studied prosthetic feet on energy cost of walking , we will 
measure participants ' real-time metabolic energy expenditure (i.e., 02 consumption) 
across three walking speeds (slow, comfortab le, fast). The gold standard method for 
determining energy consumption is measurement of the amount of oxygen a person intakes 
(VO2) and carbon dioxide that a person expires (VCO2). We will measure VO2 and VCO2 
using a portable Cosmed K4b2 monitor. The K4b2 monitor continuously samples the 
participan t's expiration and inspiration using a mask that fits over their nose and 
mouth. Plastic tubes convey the gases to sensors that are located in a small, 
lightweight (1 lb) backpack system . Breath-by-breath measurements of the expired gases 
are stored in the system until they are uploaded by the researcher to a laptop after 
the experiment is completed. 
Participants will be fitted with the K4b2 monitor upon conclusion of the self-report 
survey (described above) . They will sit quietly for 5 minutes to achieve steady-state 
resting VO2 consumption rate (ml/min) . Resting VO2 rate will be quantified as an 
average over the final minute of resting. Participants will then stand for 5 minutes to 
achieve a standing VO2 consumption rate (ml/min), again averaged over the final minute 
of standing . 
Participa nts will remove the K4b2 monitor and conduct the 6MWT according to the 
protocol described above. After completing the Borg RPE, the participan t will re-don 
the K4b2 monitor and sit quietly in order to return to their resting VO2 rate. 
APPLICATION : Human Subjects Review (13-11 ), Full Board or Subcommittee (Rev. 11/26/2014) 
PAGEIO 
Participants will begin the treadmill testing once they have returned to their resting 
V02 rate. 
Participants will walk for 6 minutes on the treadmill at comfortable, slow, and fast 
walking speeds (as determined in Session 1). The order of the speeds will be 
randomized within-subjects to control for fatigue . This randomized order.will be 
carried over into the third session so that participant s are tested in the same order 
both times. Walking V02 consumption rate (ml/min) will be averaged over the final 1 
minute period of each activity . Participants will rest at least 5 minutes between each 
walking trial in order to return to their resting V02 rate. 
Session 2 will require about 3.0 hours to complete. Upon conclusion of Session 2, 
participants will transition to the second prosthesis (ESF or mRSF, depending upon 
randomization) and will be asked to use it exclusively for 1 month before returning for 
Session 3. 
Session 3: The third session will be identica l to the Session 2, but will be conducted 
with participants using the alternate prosthesis (e.g., ESF if they were previously 
tested in the mRSF). 
2. Would subjects undergo these or similar procedures (medical, psychological, educational, etc.) if they were not taking part in 
this research? ~ No D Yes lf"Yes," describe how the study procedures differ from what subjects would otherwise 
undergo. 
The study procedures include outcome measure s (survey measures, 6MWT, or Borg RPE) 
that a prosthetist might perform in a clinic to evaluate a patient's performance with a 
new prosthesis . However , the Cosmed K4b2 portable metabolic analysis system and 
treadmill walking are unlikely to occur in normal prosthetic clinical practice . These 
procedures are more likely to be conducted as part of a physical therapy treatment plan 
and would not be considered unusual procedures at a physical therapy clinical visit.

See the HSD website for the definition of"human subject" http://www.washington .edu/research/hsd /docs/l 253. Before answering the 
questions below, be sure that you are familiar with the definition. 
1. Subject groups/categories and numbers. Complete this table by listing: 
• Your groups or categories of subjects. "Group" should be defined as appropriate for your research. 
o "Units" within a group. For most research, a group will consist of individuals, such as children aged 8-12, or 
individuals with high blood pressure. However, this will not be true for all research. Examples of groups with 
"units" that are not individuals : 
• Dyads such as Alzheimer's-patient-and-caregiver , with one group of the dyads assigned to one intervention 
(e.g., behavioral modification) and another group of the dyads assigned to a comparison intervention(e.g., 
drug treatment). 
• Families. For example, a study of mental health interventions for homeless families might have one group 
of30 families assigned to one intervention and another group of30 families assigned to a different 
intervention. 
• Other. For example, the "units" in autism research might be an autistic individual and all his/her living 
blood relatives. The units in an academic excellence study might be a student-parents-teacher unit, 
o Types of groups. There are many ways in which subjects might be grouped. Examples: 
• By intervention. Example: research comparing two different drugs for high blood pressure. 
• By subject population. Example: research comparing the incidence of domestic violence in families living 
in urban settings versus families living in rural settings. 
• If you have only one group, fill in only one line in the table. Add more lines if needed. 
• The age range of each group. 
• The upper limit/number of completed subjects you need for each group. Completed means that all research procedures 
involving the subjects or the obtaining of specimens/records/data have been completed as far as is possible (or each rnbiect, 
including any follow-up (such as follow-up access to medical records.) In some cases, such as an online survey, it is not

E. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
In order to approve the research the IRB must find that risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to 
subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. 
I. Describe nature and degree of risk of possible i.n.i.YrY, stress, discomfort , invasion of privacy, and other side effects from all study 
procedures , drugs and devices (standard and experimental ), interviews and questionnaires . Include psycho-social risks as well as 
physiological risks. Include risks of withholding standard care or procedures if this is the case .. Do not reference the consent form. 
Participants will be asked to walk for about 70 minutes total for this study (a maximum 
of 6 minutes at a time, and 30 minutes maximum per session). Because they are being 
asked to walk, there is the risk that they could become fatigued during the study 
procedures . In addition, there is a risk of falling. However , these risks are no larger 
than the risks that study participants generally undertake when walking outside of this 
study. 
2. Explain what steps you will take to minimize risks of harm and to protect subjects' rights and welfare. (If you will include 
protected groups of subjects (minors; fetuses in utero; prisoners; pregnant women; unviable neonates; neonates of uncertain 
viability; decisionally impaired or economically or educationally disadvantaged subjects) please identify the group(s) and answer 
this question for each group. Please also complete the SUPPLEMENT: Prote,cted and/or Vulnerable Populations .) 
This study will not require participants to perform activities at a level of endurance 
that they would not typically do outside of the study session . To minimize risks of 
fatigue and falling during the study session , the participants will be asked to take 
breaks after each walking measure is collected. The maximum time that each participant 
will be asked to walk continuously is 6 minutes. They are also instructed to take a 
break, including a sitting break, at any time during the data collection session, 
including in the middle of walking measures . If at any time it appears that the 
participant is at risk of falling or other harm, the data collection session will be 
stopped . 
3. Is it possible that you will discover a subject's previously unknown condition (disease, suicidal intentions , genetic predisposition, 
etc.) as a result of study procedures ? 0 No O Yes If yes, explain how you will handle this situation. 
4. Describe the anticipated benefits of this research for individual subjects in each subject group. If none, state "None." 
None 
5. Describe the anticipated benefits of this research for society. 
The rnRSF is a promising advancement in prosthetic technology . However , currently, Mr. 
Davidson is one of few prosthetists in the United States that is providing this foot. 
Empirical evidence that support s its provision for people with LLA will help the rnRSF 
become available to others who may benefit from its use. 
F. ADVERSE EVENTS OR EFFECTS 
I. Who will handle adverse events? r8] Investigator D Referral D Other, explain: 
N/A 
2. Are your facilities and equipment adequate to handle possible adverse events? r8]Yes O No, explain: 
A first aid kit will be available , if needed , to address minor injuries (e.g., scrapes 
or minor cuts). The investigators will contact emergency services (911) if a serious 
adverse event occurs . The UW Medical Center emergency room is located 5 floors below 
the researchers ' laboratory. 
G. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH DATA 
I. Will you record any direct subject identifiers (names, Social Security numbers, patient, hospital, laboratory or claim numbers, 
addresses , telephone numbers, locator information , etc.) 0 No r8] Yes If yes, explain why this is necessary and describe the 
coding system you will use to protect against disclosure . 
APPLICATION : Human Subjects Review ( 13-1 I), Full Board or Subcommittee (Rev. 11/26/2014) 
PAGE16 
Subject identifiers will be recorded (name, telephone number, social security number). 
Name and contact information are needed to schedule participant data collection 
sessions. Social security information is required by UW when payments of more than $50 
are made to study subjects. Identifying information will be linked to a 5-digit numeric 
study code. The file containing identifying information and the linked subject code 
will be stored separately from all other study data in a secure and password protected 
computer only accessible to study researchers. 
2. Will you retain a link between study code numbers and direct identifiers after the data collection is complete? D No [8J Yes If 
yes, explain why this is necessary and for how long you will keep this link. 
This research is a pilot study in a new line of investigation for our research lab 
(i.e., same PI and research team). We are currently pursuing funding for parallel 
studies of prosthetic foot technologies. We wish to combine data from related studies 
to maximize our ability to recruit from the small local populatio n of people with lower 
limb loss. Combining data from multiple studies would increase our power to detect 
differences and avoid participation of individuals in both studies (participation in 
both studies would lead to including a participant's data twice in the same dataset). 
To allow for accurate longitudinal tracking of partic ipants, we will retain the link 
between identifiers and study code numbers until 2026. Participants may request that 
we destroy their link at any point during the study, or any time thereafter. 
3. Describe how you will protect data against disclosure to the public or to other researchers or non-researchers . Explain who (other 
than members of the research team) will have access to data (e.g., sponsors, advisers, government agencies, etc.). 
Data will be stored on a study specifi c password protected computer which will be 
stored in a locked cabinet in the PI's office. Only members of the research team will 
have access to the information . 
4. Will you place a copy of the consent form or other study information in the subject's medical or other personal record? 
[8J No D Yes. If yes, explain why this is necessary . 
N/A 
5. Do you anticipate using any data (information, specimens, etc.) fro!TI this study for other studies in the future? D No [8J Yes 
lf"Yes," explain and include this information in the consent form. 
As noted above, this research is a pilot study in a new line of investigation for our 
research lab. We are currently pursuing funding for similar (parallel) studies of the 
prosthetic foot technologies included in this study. To maximize available resources 
and address larger research questions , we will combine data from this study with data 
obtained in subsequent studies . We have added this information to the consen t form. 
H. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

you. This may be because they are performing procedures or collecting data for you. It may also be required if an event happens 
on the CRC that requires treatment (such as fainting during a blood draw). This means that you must obtain a signed Hf PAA 
Authorization form from each subject and give a copy of it to the CRC. Complete and attach the UW research HIPAA 
Authorization template, available on the HSD Forms webpage. There is guidance in the template about how to describe the 
information that the CRC staff may access and disclose to you.

I. CONSENT 
Obtaining informed consent is a process that involves more than obtaining a signature on a form. It is a process of information 
exchange that may include subject recruitment materials, verbal instructions, question-and-answer sessions, and measures of 
participant understanding . Obtaining voluntary informed consent is one of the central protections required by all human subjects 
regulations and ethical principles. The key features of the consent process include: 
• Disclosure of the information needed to make an informed decision about participation 
• Facilitation of comprehension by the potential participant 
• Promotion of the voluntariness of the potential participant 's decision 
Refer to the SOP Consent and SOP Consent Documentation for more information . 
I. Description of consent process for adult subjects. How are you going to obtain informed consent from your adult subjects? 
Describe in detail your consent methods, process, and settings. Identify who will provide the information to subjects and who 
will interact with them during the consent process. If there is more than one consent process, describe each one separately . 
For subjects who do not speak English: Describe the process that will be used, and whether anyone on the research team will 
speak the subjects' language. Complete this section if you will obtain consent from any subjects for any aspect of the 
research. 
Potential participants will provide informed consent at their scheduled study 
session, but before any data collection procedures. A study investigator will 
describe the study to the partici pant using the written consent form (Appendix 1) 
as guide, allow time for the potential participant to read through the consent 
form, ask if the participants have any questions, and ask them to sign the form if 
they are interested in participating. If the potential participant is not 
interested, they will not be asked to perform any study procedures. 
2. Description of assent process for children subjects. Describe in detail how you will obtain assent from children subjects, 
following the instructions provided in the question above. Also, describe how these processes will differ based on 
age/cognitive ability. Finally, describe how you will determine whether a child is assenting or dissenting throughout the 
research (if applicable). * Assent means a child's affirmative agreement to participate in the research. Mere failure to object 
should not be interpreted as assent. 
N/A 
3. Special issues or considerations. The standard concept of consent is based on the Western ethical tradition of individual 
autonomy and privacy. This may not apply well to your research. Your research may be subject to specific cultural or other 
contextual issues that affect the consent process. Describe any special issues and considerations about obtaining consent for 
your research. If none, state: "Not Applicable ". 
Example issues: 
• Who is the appropriate person(s) for providing consent? 
• The desirability of a group consent process, or a surrogate consent process 
• Research that occurs in a setting with a blurred sense of what is public versus private 
• The cultural acceptability of the consent process (or documentation) 
• Cultures or groups in which it is considered impolite to refuse a request and/or in which people are fearful of refusing 
requests that they regard as coming from authorities 
N/A 
4. Undue influence. Describe how you will minimize any undue influence on your subjects' decision about participating in your 
research. If this is not an issue for your research, describe why. This is an important consideration when persons recruiting or 
consenting subjects are in a position of authority or influence -for example, the subject's teacher, doctor, or employer. 
Potenti al particip ants will be identified via flyers (Appendix 4) posted in their 
prosthetic office. However, all other recruitment and consenting procedures will be 
APPLICATION : Human Subjects Review ( 13-11), Full Board or Subcommittee (Rev. 11/26/2014) 
PAGE 20 
done by study investigator s who are not involved in potential participant 's health 
care. Study investigators will stress that participation is voluntary and in no way 
will participat ion (or non-participation) in the study affect their prosthetic (or 
other health) care. 
5. Subject comprehension . Describe anything that you will do to facilitate or verify your subjects' comprehension of the 
information you provide them during the consent process. 
Potential participants will be encouraged to ask questions throughout the consent 
process . 
6. Do you expect that all of your participants will be fluent in spoken and/or written English? D No ~ Yes. 
lf"No", please answer the following questions . 
6.1. In what language(s) will they be fluent? 
NIA 
6.2. Translation of documents into another language. Federal regulations require that consent, assent, and authorization 
documents must be presented to participants in a language that is understandable to them. The UW !RB expects that 
translated documents will be: 
• Linguistically accurate; 
• At an appropriate reading level for the subject population; and 
• Culturally sensitive for the locale in which they will be used. 
Describe how you will obtain translations of relevant documents , and how you will ensure that the translations meet 
these requirements . 
NIA 
6.3. Interpretation. Describe how you will provide interpretation, and when. Specifically : 
a. For what situations will you provide interpretation? (At a minimum , an interpreter should be available for the 
consent process, unless the !RB has waived consent.) 
NIA 
b. Who will be the interpreter ? 
NIA 
c. Describe the qualifications of the interpreter -for example, background , experience, language proficiency in 
English and in the other language, native language fluency, certification , other credentials, familiarity with the 
research-related vocabulary in English and the target language. 
NIA 
d. How will you ensure that the subjects will understand ongoing study-related communication? If the subject has 
questions, complaints, or adverse events, how will that be communicated to the researchers? 
NIA 
7. Check all that apply: 
~ Written A /tach copies of all consent forms for each subject group. Include a footer identifying the version date of each form 
and a header or title that identifies each differentfo,-m. If you propose to delete one or more of the required elements of

Researchers' statement 
We are asking you to be in a research study. The purpose of this consent form is to give you the 
information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not. Please read the 
form carefully. You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask 
you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the 
research or this form that is not clear. When we have answered all your questions, you can 
decide if you want to be in the study or not. This process is called "informed consent." We will 
give you a copy of this form for your records. 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
The purpose of the study is to evaluate walking in people who use different types of prosthetic 
feet. In this study, we will compare people's ability to walk in a typical "energy storing" foot to 
their ability to walk in a modified running foot. 
STUDY PROCEDURES 
If you choose to take part in this study, the study procedures will take place across three study 
sessions over approximately a three month period. The first session will occur before you receive 
the first of the two prostheses that will be provided to you during the course of this study. The 
second session will occur one month after you receive the first prosthesis. The third session will 
occur one month after you receive the second prosthesis. The sessions are expected to each take 
between 1.5-3 hours to complete. 
Session 1: Session 1 is expected to take about 1.5 hours. At the first session, you will be asked to 
complete a survey and walk on a treadmill using your current prosthesis. The survey will ask 
your age, ethnicity, income, military status, education, and height and weight. We will also ask 
questions about the date and cause of your amputation. You do not have to answer every 
question. 
Next, you will be asked to walk on a treadmill at three speeds: comfortable, slow, and fast. You 
will be allowed to choose these three speeds by increasing and/or decreasing the speed on PROVED 
FEB 19 2015 
Appendix 1: Consent form 02/12/2015 
. treadmill. You will then be asked to walk for 6 minutes at your preferred fast speed. You may 
reduce the speed as needed to ensure that you can continue at this pace for 6 minutes. 
You will also be informed about the prosthetic foot that you will receive first (the energy storing 
foot or the modified running foot). You will receive this prosthesis from Greg Davidson at 
Davidson Prosthetics at a time that you schedule with his office. You will be asked to wear this 
prosthesis in place of your current prosthesis for a period of one month. Please adhere to your 
normal wear schedule, as recommended by your prosthetist. 
You will also be given an activity monitor to attach to your study prosthesis. This device 
measures the number of steps you take throughout the day. We will show you how to attach the 
monitor to your prosthesis. We request that you leave the monitor on your prosthesis until we 
remove it. 
Session 2: Session 2 is expected to take about 3 hours. You will come to this session wearing the 
first prosthesis you were assigned. At this session, you will be asked to complete a survey that 
will ask you questions about your ability to move around with your prosthesis, tiredness, 
balance, activities that you engage in, and satisfaction with your prosthesis. Throughout this 
session, you will be able to rest when you feel like it and we will give you water to drink. 
You will be asked to wear a lightweight oxygen mask and waist pack during the some of this 
session. The oxygen mask helps us determine how much energy you use when you walk. You 
will be asked wear the mask while you sit for 5 minutes and then to stand for 5 minutes so we 
can measure your breathing while you are not active. You will then temporarily remove the 
oxygen mask. 
You will next be asked to complete a walking test called the Six-Minute Walk Test. For this test, 
you will be asked to walk back and forth between two cones for 6 minutes. While walking back 
and forth between the cones, you will be asked to walk across a mat. This mat records the steps 
you take while walking. You may rest at any point and a chair will be brought to you if you 
would like to sit during the test. You will be instructed to walk as quickly as possible during this 
test. You may use an assistive device, such as a cane or walker, when performing this test. We 
will record the total distance you walked during the test. Following the Six-Minute Walk Test, 
we will ask you to report your level of exertion on a scale from 0-100. A rating of 0 indicates no 
exertion at all and a rating of 100 indicates maximal exertion. This test will take under one 
minute. 
You will next be asked to put the oxygen mask on again. You will wear this mask while walking 
at your comfortable, slow, and fast walking speeds for a total of 18 minutes (6 minutes at each 
speed). You will be asked to rest for at least 5 minutes between each period of walking to make 
sure your breathing returns to normal. You will be able to rest when you feel like it and we will 
give you water to drink. 
Following this session, you will return to Davidson Prosthetics to receive your second prosthesis 
at a time that you schedule with his office. You will be asked to leave your first prosthesis at the 
office and wear the second prosthesis as your primary prosthesis for an additional month. 
Session 3: Session 3 is expected to take about 3 hours. You will come to this session wearing the 
second study prosthesis. Study activities for Session 3 will be identical to those in Session 2 
(above). 
You may choose not to complete any of these tests at any time during the session. 
Appendix 1: Consent form 02/12/2015 Page 2 of 5 
We would like your permission to take photographs and videos of you during this study so that 
we have an accurate record. Please indicate below whether or not you give your permission . 
We may ask for your additional permission to use the photographs and recordings outside this 
research study. We may want to use them publicly and keep them indefinitely. We will give you 
opportunity to review the photographs and recordings before giving your permission. 
RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT 
We ask you to walk for about 30 minutes during the study session. Some people may become 
tired. The risk of falling is about the same as walking in your daily activities. You can take a 
break or sit down whenever you like. If the researchers notice fatigue or risk of falling, they will 
end the study session.

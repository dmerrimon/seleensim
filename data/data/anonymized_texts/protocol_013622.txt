CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 43  1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
 
With more than 2 million abdominal operations occurring annually in the United States (US) , 
up to 20% of those patients developing ventral incisional hernias, a bdominal wall defects and 
incisional hernias represent a challenging surgical condition.1, 2 Approximately 250,000 
ventral hernia repairs are p erformed on a yearly basis .3 There are several options for repair, 
including primary repair, synthetic or biologic material placement, repair with relaxing 
incisions, and use of musculofascial flaps, utilizing both open and laparoscopic appr oaches.2 
However, there is no clear -cut consensus regarding the optimal hernia repair technique, 
particularly in complex hernia repair cases where patient co -morbidities exist and a high risk 
of infection is present.    
 
Simple suture repair has been associated with a high risk of hernia recurrence, with reports 
ranging from 10% to 55%, and has been nearly abandoned for the repair of hernias which are 
greater than  five centimeters (cm) in size.4, 5, 6, 7 As a result, many ventral hernia repair 
procedures involve the use of a mesh material.    
 
Synthetic mesh repair procedures, either open or laparoscopic, have been reported to lead to 
fewer recurren ces compared to primary repairs .8, 9, 10 Improved outcomes are believed to be 
related to reduced tension on the fascial edges and sutures when mesh is used in hernia repair 
procedures.  However, complex cases and large abdominal wall defects continue to pose a 
challenge to surgeons.  Factors such as patient co -morbidities, defect size, location, tissue 
viability and degree of contamination are included in a surgeon’s assessment and decision -
making process .11 These large abdominal wall defects have been associated with recurrence 
rates of up to 46 %.12 
 
Despite  reducing  hernia recurrence  rates , the use o f synthetic mesh has been associated with 
complications such as infection, adhesions, fistulae, and foreign body reaction s including 
increased inflamma tion and/or connective tissue deposition .13 
 
Non-absorbable m eshes can lead to c omplications related to the body’s reaction to the 
persistent  foreign mesh material resulting in  foreign body sensations including discomfort 
and chronic pain , which is described by the International Association for the Study of Pain as 
pain lasting for 3 mont hs or greater following  hernia repair .14, 15 
 
Ideally, an absorbable mesh would provide adequate  structural support throughout the 
healing  process and  would be fully absorbed when the wound has completely  healed, thereby 
potentially reducing the chances for  complications associated with the persistence of non-
absorbable mesh  material.  However, t he developmen t of absorbable mesh products has faced 
challenges related to the rate of absorption  with complications arising when  the mesh product 
is absorbed too quickly.  Rapid a bsorption does not support  sufficient  healing if structural 
reinforcement  is diminished during the tissue repair period .  An absorbable mesh should

tissue remodeling, maturation of collagen, and gradual shift of mechanical load.  
 
Phasix™  Mesh is a commercially available medical device in the US . It is a resorbable mesh 
prepared from poly -4-hydroxybutrate (P4HB)  which has been studi ed for use as a biomaterial 
for a number of applications in medical devices and tissue engineering due to favo rable 
mechanical properties, biocompatibility and desirable degradation times .16, 17, 18 Using 
standard measures of mechanical strength (suture pull -out, tear and ball burst strength) 
Phasix™ Mesh is comparable in performance to traditional polypropylene mesh.  Pre-clinical 
implantation studies indicate that the resorption of the Phasix™ Mesh fibers is minimal 
throughout the 12 week expected period of healing and up to ~26 weeks post -implantation.  
Resorption of the fibers is essentially complete in 12 -18 months .19, 20  Given the lo ng-term 
strength retention  observed in preclinical studies, it is anticipated that Phasix ™ Mesh  may 
result in low recurrence and complication rates with minimal pain and discomfort when used 
for hernia repair.  
 
A porcine bridging hernia repair study  demonstrated that  Phasix™ Mesh could perform as a 
durable scaffold for soft tissue repair when spann ing a surgic al defect .20  The results of the 
52-week s tudy showed that the repair site had significantly greater mechanical repair 
strength, as compared to native a bdomi nal wall .  This persisted even after significant 
Phasix™ Mesh resorption (as measured by molecular weight).  Phasix™ Mesh showed an 
initial mi ld-moderate host inflammatory response, that declined to mild over 52 weeks.  
Neovascularization (angiogenesis ) and new collagen deposition were evident at 6, 12, 26 and 
52 weeks.   In a 24 -week rat study,  histological analyses of the repair site demonstrated that 
some competitive meshes had a greater overall host inflammatory response, some had less of 
a response and one had a very similar response, to Phasix ™ Mesh.21 In the same study, 
histological analyses demonstrated similar variability on measures of host fibrotic response.  
 
MonoMax® suture (B. Braun Melsungen AG) is a product made from the same polym er as 
Phasix™ Mesh. A twelve month, 150-patient, multicenter clinical study demonstrate d the 
safety and efficacy of  MonoMax® for abdominal wall closure .22 Wound infection and wound 
dehiscence  rates were co mpar ed between  MonoMax® and an historical control (7.3% versus 
11.3%  combined ). One year after surgery, the rate of inc isional hernias w as similar 
comparing the two groups: 21 patients (14.0%) in the  Mon oMax® group compared to 30 
patients  (21.3%) in the control . 
  
This post-approval clinical study is  being conducted to evaluate the use of  Phasix™ Mesh  in 
primary ventral , incisional or multiply -recurrent hernia repair in  patients with a higher level 
of risk as defined by the presence of 1 or more common pre -existi ng conditions . Patient s who 
receive  a Phasix ™ Mesh implant will be followed for 60 months.

1.2 Rationale  
 
This study is intended to evaluate the use of Phasix™ Mesh for primary  ventral , incisional  
and multiply -recurrent incisional hernia repair amongst subjects at high risk for 
complications .  This protocol version (4.0) is intended to capture longer term data (through 
60 months) on all eligible subjects.  The protocol’s follow up period was not extended due to 
safety related concerns or trends.  
 
1.3 Device Description s 
 
1.3.1 Phasix™ Mesh   
 
The Phasix™ Mesh (Davol, Inc.)  is a resorbable mesh prepared from P4HB.  P4HB is 
produced from a naturally occurring monomer and is processed into monofilament fibers and 
knitted into a surgical mesh.  Phasix™ Mesh degrades through a process of hydrolysis and a 
hydrolytic enzymatic digestive process.  It was developed to minimize the variability of 
resorption rate (loss of mass) and strength and provide support throughout  the expected 
period of healing.  
 
Pre-clinical implantation studies indicate that the resorption of the Phasix™ fibe rs is minimal 
throughout the 12 -week expected period of healing and up to about 26 weeks post 
implantation.  Resorption of the fibers is essentially complete in 12 to 18 months .19, 20 
 
Phasix™ Mesh has been commercially available  in the US since 2012 and is indicated to 
reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists, such as the repair of hernia or other fascial 
defects that require reinforcement  or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical result.  
Because Phasix ™ Mesh is fully resorbable, it should  not be used in repairs where permanent 
wound or organ support from the mesh is required.  A full description of Phasix ™ Mesh is 
included in the product’s Ins tructions for Use (IFU)  (Appendix 2). 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES   
 
The objective of this study is to collect additional data on safety, performance and 
effectiveness  of Phasix™ Mesh in subjects requiring primary ventral, incisional or multiply -
recurrent hernia repair in subjects at high risk for complications . Subjects at high risk are 
defined as having 1 or more of the following co -morbid ity conditions: body mass index 
(BMI) between 30 -40 kg/m2, inclusive,  active smokers, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), diabetes, immunosuppression, coronary artery disease, chronic 
corticosteroid use, low pre -operative serum albumin , advanced age, or renal insufficiency . 
The study end points are described below.

Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 43   
There are two primary  endpoints , hernia recurrence rate and surgical site infection (SSI) rate, 
and six secondary endpoints:  
 
3.1 Primary Endpoints : 
 
1. Hernia Recurrence  Rate 
 
Hernia recurrenc e rates will be a ssessed by physical examination at  each study visit  
through 60 months.   A recurrent hernia will be defined as any hernia identified or 
confirmed by the investigator, during any study follow -up visit, in approximately  the 
same position as the hernia repaired in the study procedure.   Potential hernias 
identified via incidental magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or computed tomography 
(CT) scan will be evaluated by the operating surgeon for clinical significance and 
confir mation of hernia recurrence.  
 
2. Surgical Site Infections  
  
Infections at the surgical site  will be assessed by physical examination at each study 
visit through  60 months . If an infection is suspected, a routine culture, obtained via 
each site’s standard protocol, should be obtained to determine cell count and type (i.e. 
yeast, gram positive or gram negative bacteria, or other). If genus and species of the 
culture are identi fied as part of the routine practice at the site, that information should 
be recorded. Classification will follow the CDC guidelines for superficial and deep 
surgical site infections ( Appendix 3). 
 
3.2 Second ary Endpoints : 
 
1. Pain - Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  
2. Device related adverse event incidence  
3. Rate of reoperation due to the index hernia repair  
4. Quality of life assessment s (Carolinas Comfort Scale® and SF-12® - 12-item short 
form health survey ) 
5. Surgical procedure time as measured from incision to closure  (skin to skin)  
6. Length of stay 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a  prospective , multi -center open -label study designed to collect additional data on 
safety, perform ance and effectiveness  of Phasix™ Mesh for primary ventral  or incisional or 
multiply -recurrent hernia  repair . Follow -up visits will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 2 4, 30, 
36, 42, 48, 54, and 60  months following surgery. See Section 6 for a detailed schedule of 
study visits and procedures.

subjects’ records and a copy provided to the subject.  
 
6.1.2 Enrollment  
 
Subjects who sign an informed consent will be considered enrolled in this study.  Subjects 
who provide consent for participation but do not meet all of the study eligib ility criteria and 
do not receive the test  device  will be considered screen failures.  
 
6.1.3 Eligibility  
 
The subject’s eligibility for study enrollment will be reviewed and documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  At the time of screening, a related progress note m ust be entered in the 
source document ation to indicate that all eligibility criteria were reviewed and screening 
results noted. Final eligibility will be determined intraoperatively.  
 
Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria should be considered scre en failures and treated 
according to the Investigator’s standard of care.  Data are to be collected for screen failure  
subjects from the time the ICF is signed until the subject is deemed a failure . At a minimum, 
subject demographics an d the reason for fail ure must be collected ; adverse events (AEs) will 
also be collected and followed through satisfactory resolution or stabilization .

be performed by the physician.  Height and weight measurements will be recorded to allow 
for the calculation of BMI .  The subject’s ability to participate and meet the follow -up 
requirements will be established.  
 
6.1.8 Concomitant Pain Medication Usage  
 
Prescription  and over the counter ( OTC ) pain medication must be recorded in the source 
documentation and in the eCRF. All current pain medication will be captured at baseline.  
Hernia  associated pain medication only will be captured at 12 , 24, 36, 48, and 60  months.  
 
6.1.9 Patient Reported Outcome Assessments  
 
Subjects will complete the  Pain VAS , Carolinas Comfort Scale® and SF -12® to measure pain, 
discomfort and quality of life  at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 , 48, and 60  months .   
 
6.2 Surgical Procedure  
 
6.2.1 General  Procedure s 
 
Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 43  All subjects will undergo an open ventral repair of hernias . The size of the hernia is an 
intraoperative inclusion criteri on and must be greater than 10 cm2 and ≤350 cm2.  All other 
intraoperative exclusion criter ion should be verified  (e.g., a surgical wound classified as 
clean -contaminated, contaminated or dirty; absence of a n active or latent systemic  infection ; 
presence of peritonitis;  a hernia bridge as the sole  repair  procedure ). Defect closure must be 
confirmed .  
 
The surgical technique will require retro -rectus or onlay placement (using absorbable suture) 
with or without Component Separation Technique (CST) . Subjects will be administered 
antibiotics according to hospital protocol .  
 
Subjects are prepared to undergo hernia repair following the instructions supplied by the 
manufacturers. The IFU for Phasix™ Mesh device  is presented in  Appendix 2.  
 
Phasix ™ Mesh will be placed in the retro -rectus space  with absorbable m esh fixation. The 
peritoneum should remain posterior to the mesh up on completion of mesh placement . 
Phasix ™ Mesh may be cut to shape or size desired for each specific application. To prevent 
recurrence when repairing hernias, a mesh larger than the defect is required to ensure 
adequate coverage.  The mesh is to be positioned so  its edges extend beyond the margin s of 
the defect  by at least 5 cm . It is recommended that fixation be placed at approximately 5  to 6 
cm intervals (6 to 12 resorbable sutures) around the periphery  of the mesh. The edges are 
then fixated to assure proper closure under correct tension.  
 
The procedure may include C ST to obtain site closure . All incisions will be closed with 
staples and/or sutures  and wounds will be dressed with sterile occ lusive dressings.  
  
6.2.2 Component Separation Technique Surgery  
 
Prophylactic antibiotics will be  administered  according to hospital protocol . If a prior hernia 
repair utilizing mesh is in the affected area, every effort should be  made to remove any mesh 
remaining. Once all of the dissection is performed and all  of the hernia has been exposed, the 
largest vertical  and transverse dimensions should  be recorded.  
 
If the CST is utilized, t he surgical technique will be a modification of the “component 
separation  technique” by Ramirez et al . with the graft being implanted into the tissue plane of 
the surgeon’s prefere nce, according to the following : Separation of components may be done 
via open , posterior  or endoscopic/minimally invasive  technique  as described below .8, 23  
 
6.2.2.1  Open Technique  
  
After entering the abdominal cavity, adhesiolysis is perform ed to dissect free any intra -
abdominal contents from the abdominal wall.   The skin and subcutaneous fat are dissected 
free from the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominal muscle and the external oblique 
muscle.   The external oblique is separated through t he aponeurosis approximately 1 -3 cm 
from the edge of the rectus, or through the muscle.   If the hernia is subxiphoid in position, 
Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 43  release must be done above the rib cage and come across the rectus sheath and muscle at the 
level of where the pectoralis meet s the rectus.   The external oblique muscle is separated from 
the internal oblique muscle, as far laterally as possible (aiming to the anterior axillary line), 
above and below the hernia by approximately 5 cm.     
  
6.2.2.2  Posterior Technique  
 
Posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release (TAR): Starting in the 
upper third of the abdomen, about 0.5 cm medial to the anterior/posterior rectus sheath 
junction (linea semilunaris), the posterior rectus sheath is incised to expose the underlying 
trans versus abdominis muscl e. The muscle is then divided along its entire medial edge using 
electrocautery. The use of a right -angled dissector significantly facilitates this release and 
minimizes injury to the underlying transversalis fascia and peritoneum. Tr ansection of the 
medial edge of the transversus abdominis muscle allows for entrance to the space between 
the transversalis fascia and the lateral edge of the divided transversus abdominis muscle. The 
retromuscular space is bluntly developed further latera lly to as far as the lateral border of the 
psoas muscle to allow for a reinforcement of a visceral sac with a large mesh. Also, if 
needed, this dissection may be extended superiorly above the costal margin and inferiorly to 
expose both myopectineal orifice s. 
 
6.2.2.3  Endoscopic/Minimally Invasive Technique  
  
Make a 2 cm incision in the upper abdomen in a location that is convenient for release (such 
as directly over the costal margin at the level of the mid clavicular line, or at the tip of the 
11th rib). Please no te: this incision may occasionally need to be placed further lateral to 
ensure the incision is lateral to the linea semilunaris.   Dissect down to the level of the 
external oblique muscle.   Separate the external oblique muscular fibers (this allows for 
visualization of the underlying internal oblique aponeurosis below).   Advance a balloon 
dissector between the internal and external oblique muscle down to the level of the inguinal 
ligament.   Insufflate the balloon under endoscopic visualization.   Remove the d issecting 
balloon and replace with a trocar (first port).   Infuse the lateral abdominal cavity with gas, 
such as carbon dioxide. Place a second port into the lateral abdominal cavity to allow for 
dissection.   A third port may be used to facilitate easier a ccess to parts of the anatomy.   If 
performing a minimally invasive technique multiple incisions may be used to visualize and 
release the external oblique under direct visualization.   Use cautery or alternatively ultrasonic 
dissection to divide the external  oblique muscle from the costal margin down to the inguinal 
ligament.   Please note: extending the dissection to the level of Scarpa’s fascia results in even 
greater abdominal wall advancement.   This technique is generally performed bilaterally.  
  
6.2.2.4  Open or E ndoscopic Technique  
  
If necessary, resect/debride the edges of the rectus fascia to ensure apposition of healthy 
well-vascularized tissue as the midline is closed.   Care must be taken not to damage the 
Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 43  blood supply and the nerves that run between the inte rnal oblique and transverse muscle and 
enter the rectus abdominal muscle at the posterior side.  
  
Closure should be performed with permanent or long last ing sutures every 1 -2 cm  between 
sutures, for example with an interrupted Figure -8 closure or running s titch.   The surgeon 
should make every effort to close the fascial edges including the use of the component 
separation technique.   If the fascia cannot be closed, the peritoneum of the hernia sac should 
have been preserved so that this can be closed over th e Phasix ™ to provide vascularized 
tissue.    
  
If a previous scar of skin is present, the scar should be excised.   Scarification products may 
be used to diminish seroma formation.   The fascial and subcutaneous layer should be closed 
with sutures.   The skin should be closed with staples and/or sutures.   When skin closure can’t 
be achieved, a wound vac can be used.    
 
6.2.3 Postoperative Care  
 
Subjects will be discharged when ambulatory and they have satisfied post anesthesia care 
criteria.   Subjects should be inst ructed to avoid lifting in excess of ten pounds for six 
weeks.   Early ambulation should be encouraged.   Postoperative analgesics will be provided 
to all subjects.  Subjects will be given a prescription for hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets 
or an equivalent medication based on local prescribing patterns, medication allergies, and 
subject needs.   Subjects will be instructed to keep the incisions covered and dry for 48 hours 
after which time the dressing may be removed.   Subjects should be instructed to keep th e 
incisions dry except for showers for two weeks.   Subjects should also be instructed to call the 
Investigator for fever in excess of 101° F, redness or swelling at the incisions or surgical site, 
surgical site drainage, or  worsening pain.   
 
If for any reason the mesh is removed and a mesh infection is suspected,  routine culture, at 
the site of the wound, area of contamination, or potential contamination, obtained via each 
site’s normal protocol, should be obtained to determine cell count and type (i.e.,  yeast, gram 
positive or gram negative bacteria, or other).  If genus and species of the culture are 
identified as part of the routine practice at the site, that information should be recorded.   
 
6.2.4 Surgical Details  
 
Surgical details will be recorded and ent ered in the appropriate source documentation and 
eCRF(s).  Details will include but may not be limited to procedure date, start/stop times, 
procedure relate d complications, and AEs.

6.5 Withdrawal and/or Early Termination  
 
Subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, 
without affe cting their future care.  S ubjects may also be discontinued from the study, if the 
Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the subject.   
 
Additionally, s ubjects may be discontinued for reasons including, but not limited to t he 
following:  
 Consent is withdrawn  
 Lost to follow -up (LTF)  
 Death  
 Investigator  withdrawal of subject  
 Other  
 
A subject is considered LTF if the investigational site personnel are unable to locate the 
subject despite two documented attempts to notify the subject via telephone and a third 
attempt by certified mail.  
 
A subject is consi dered an Early Termination  (ET) , if discontinuation occurs after success ful 
implant of the test device.  The site should attempt to bring the subject back to complete all 
ET visit study procedures  (see Table of Study Events ).   
 
Once a subject discontinues  from the study, t he Investigator must complete a Study 
Completion eCRF  and the reason for subject discontinuation must be fully documented.  
 
7 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
This section describes the planned statistical analyses for this study. A detailed Statistica l 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed and placed on file prior to database lock. The SAP 
will contain a comprehensive explanation of the methodology used in the statistical analyses 
described below.  
 
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
 
There is no formal statistical hypo thesis for this observational post -market study .  The study 
will follow eligible, high risk patients implanted with the Phasix ™ M esh for hernia repair in 
order to assess long -term recurrence and surgical site infection rates.

Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 43   
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
 
This study is projected to enroll up to  120 subjects at approximately 16 sites.  The sample 
size of 120 subjects is based on potential adequacy of data to meet the study objectives. It is 
not based on any statistical consideration.  
   
7.3 Data Analysis  
 
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population consists of all enrolled subjects who have signed the 
Informed Consent Form . The modified ITT (mITT) population is defined as those subjects in 
the ITT population in whom Phasix Mesh has been implanted .  A Per -Protocol (PP)  
population may be created if there are subjects who have any major protocol deviations. The 
PP population will consist of any subjects in the mITT population who do not have any major 
protocol deviation. The protocol deviations that are considered to have  a “major” grade will 
be defined a priori in the analysis plan.  All analyses will be primarily based on the mITT 
population.  Primary analyses may be performed for PP population as well.  
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using th e ITT population. 
Summary statistics for categorical variables will include frequency counts and percentages 
and for continuous variables mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum.  
 
The primary endpoints of hernia recurrence rate and surgical s ite infection rate will be 
reported by visit along with their 95% confidence intervals based on the mITT population. 
The calculation of rates at each time point will be based on available data at the time point. 
Missing data will not be imputed. Additional ly, a K aplan -Meier survival analysis will be 
performed.   
 
The secondary endpoints of VAS pain scale , Carolinas Comfort Scale and SF -12® will be 
summarized based on the mITT population with mean, standard deviation, minimum, median 
and maximum presented by visit. Other secondary endpoints will be summarized as 
appropriate.  
 
Subjects who do not have Phasix™ Mesh implanted  will have their AEs summarized 
separately and their outcome data will not be collected or analyzed.  
 
Exploratory analyses on subpopulation s may be performed.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Investigator is responsi ble for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. All AEs that occur 
during the study should be treated with  established standards of care that will protect the life 
and health of the study subjects.   
Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 43   
AEs will be collected from t he time  of enrollment (AE onset after signing ICF) through the 
end of study participation (either study completion or early discontin uation) and will be 
documented in the medical record or source document and on study eCRFs .  All e vents  will 
be followed to satisfactory resolution or stabilization.   
 
8.1 Definition Of Adverse Events  
 
In this study, an AE is defined as any undesirable clinical event occurring in the abdominal  
space including the lower abdominal, inguinal and pubic regions (including the skin), as well 
as any other undesirable clinical events judged to be related to the study device or surgical 
procedure regardless of anatomical region. Abnormal laboratory results are not to be 
considered AEs unless the results are accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms.   The 
Investigator will assess  the relationship of an AE to the study device or procedure as 
described in Section 8. 5. 
 
8.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events   
 
An event will be classified as a serious adverse event (SAE)  if it meets the definition of 
serious injury in the Medical Device Reporting Regulation [21 CFR 803.3] as listed below:  
 
 results in, or contributes to, a death or serious injury;  
 is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); 
 requires in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;  
 results in persistent disability or incapacity (i.e., permanent impairment of 
a body function or permanent damage to a body structure);  
 necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above in this definition (i.e., to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure)  
 
NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to d escribe 
the intensity of an eve nt experienced by the subject.  
 
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Event t o Device/Procedure  
 
Assess each AE for its relationship to the device (Phasix ™) or surgical procedures as 
follows:  
 
 Device:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to 
devices used as part of the study procedure.  
 
Davol Inc.   Version 4.0 
Phasix™  Mesh   October 30, 2017  
Protocol DVL -HE-011 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 43   Procedure:   This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable 
to the study device surgical procedure.  
 
Use the following catego ries for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
 
 Definitely Related:   An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or 
there is little doubt regarding the relationship.  
 
 Possibly Related:   An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being 
related but relatively unlikely.  
 
 Not Related :  An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no 
plausible association.  
 
 
8.4 Severity Of Adverse Events  
 
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by the 
subje ct. 
 
 Mild :  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s 
activity or is transient and is resolved without treatment or sequelae.  
 
 Moderate :  May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional 
intervention and/or treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
 
 Severe :  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s 
activit y.  Additional intervention and/ or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae 
occur.  Severe is used to describe the  intensity of an event experienced by the subject.  
 
8.5 Reporting Of Adverse Events  
 
If an AE occurs, all sections of the appropriate eCRF must be completed.  
 
All Investigator -judged device - or procedure -related AEs that occur (whether serious or not) 
must be reported to Davol Inc. Field Assurance using the contact information provided in 
Section 9, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
 
Additionally, all SAEs (whether device - or procedure -related or not) must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hour s of becoming aware of the event.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 43  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of 
AEs according to IRB requirements . The Sponsor will report to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as appropriate after bec oming aware of a reportable event.  
 
 
9 MECHANICAL FAILURES,  MALFUNCTIONS AND DEF ECTS  
 
The Investigator will record if the surgical mesh device  used in the study procedure failed to 
meet its performance specifications whether due to mechanical failure, malfu nction or 
defects.  This applies to: devices used in the subject, devices in which the package was 
opened but the device was not used for implantation in the subject, or devices with which 
implantation was attempted, but the device did not remain (was not used) in the subject.  
 
A recurrence (unless it is in a different location than the study hernia) is considered a device 
failure if the recurrence is clearly device related, and not procedure related or an issue of 
patient m ismanagement (e.g., use of a Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC)  system for too long ; 
mesh used was too small to adequately cover the defect), as determined by the Investigator.  
 
All mechanical failures, malfunctions, missing components, foreign matter inclusion or any 
other defects of the study device or any components of the device kit that do not perform to 
specifications must be promptly reported to the Davol Field Assurance  Depa rtment :

Superficial Incisional Surgical Site Infections  (SSI)  
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation  and 
Infection involves only the skin o r subcutaneous tissu e around the incision  and at least one of 
the following:  
1. Purulent drainage with or wi thout laboratory confirmation, from the superficial 
incision . 
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the 
superficial incision . 
3. At least one of the following signs or symptoms of i nfection: pain or tenderness, 
localized sw elling, redness or heat and superficial incision is deliberately opened 
by a surgeon, unless the culture is negative.  
4. Diagnosis of superfici al incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician.  
 
NOTE: Do not report the following as SSI:  
1. Stitch abscesses (minimal inflammation and discharge  confin ed to the points of 
suture penetration ) 
2. Infection of the epis iotomy or neonatal circumcision site s 
3. Infected burn wound.  
4. Incisional SSI that extend s into the fascial and muscle layers (see definition for 
Deep Incisional Surgical Site Infections below).  
 
Note: Specific criteria are used f or identifying infected epis iotomy and circumcision sites and 
burn wounds.  
 
Deep Incisional SSI 
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one 
year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation.  
and 
Infection involves deep soft tissues ( e.g., fascia and muscle  layers) of the incision and at least 
one of the following:  
1. Purulent d rainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space of the 
surgical site.  
2. A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon 
when the patient has at least one of the following signs: fever (>38 °C), localized 
pain or tenderness unless the culture is negative.  
3. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on 
direct examination , during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic 
examination . 
4. Diagnosis of a deep SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.    
 
Notes:  
1. Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incision as deep incisional 
SSI. 
2. Report an organ / space SSI that drains throu gh the incisio n as deep incisional SSI.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 43   Class I/Clean: An uninfected operative wound in which  no inflammation is 
encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected  urinary tract is not 
entered. In addition, clean wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary, drained with 
closed drainage. Operative  incisional wounds that follow nonpenetrating (blunt) 
trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria.  
 
 Class II/Clean -Contaminated *: An operative wound in which the respiratory, 
alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are entered under controlled  conditions and 
without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, 
appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are  included in this category, provided no evidence 
of infection or major break in technique is encountered.  
 
 Class III/ Contaminated*: Open, f resh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations with 
major breaks in sterile technique (e.g., open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from 
the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, non -purulent inflammation is 
encountered including necroti c tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (e.g.  
dry gangrene) are included in this category.  
 
 Class IV/Dirty -Infected *: Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and 
those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated  viscera. Thi s definition 
suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the 
operative field before the operation.  
 
* NOTE: In this study, subjects with Class II, Class I II and Class IV  wounds  are to be 
excluded from enrollment .

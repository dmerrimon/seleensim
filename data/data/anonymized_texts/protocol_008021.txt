 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective 
Assess the rate of attainment of a 50% increase in tumor suppressor PAR-4 levels from baseline 
in patients treated with 90-days of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with radiation or 
surgery for recurrent, oligometastatic prostate cancer.  
      We hypothesize the successful attainment of a 50% increase from baseline will occur 
 among 50% or more of study participants within  the three-months administration period of 
 HCQ. 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
- Median Progression-Free Survival (time to clinical progression)  
- 1- and 3-year Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Free Survival - HCQ Treatment toxicity (AEs and SAEs during HCQ administration) and radiation toxicity 
to be assessed and recorded utilizing the CTCAE v5.0. Surgical Complications will be 
scored using the Clavien-Dindo Classification (Appendix F).  
- Immunological effect of HCQ by analyzing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)  at 
 day 0 and Day 30 of treatment, and also, Day 60 (+ 6 weeks) of treatment.   
- Quality of life as measured by  the EORTC QLQ-C30 + QLQ-PR25 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
2.1 Prostate Cancer and its Treatment  
Among men in the U.S., prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common 
cause of cancer mortality.1 In 2018, an estimated 164,960 men will be diagnosed with this disease, 
representing 19% of all new cancer cases and 9% of male cancer-specific mortality.1 The 
prevalence of prostate cancer is projected to rapidl y rise over the next 15 years, stemming from “the 
greying of the U.S. population.”  Given the link between increasing age and cancer, aging baby boomers will significantly increase cancer incidence an d mortality.  For the first time in two decades, 
there was an increase in rates of prostate cancer deaths from 2017 to 2018.
2   
Early stage prostate cancer has few symptoms while men with more advanced disease may experience significant dysfunction, including weak or interrupted urine flow, urinary urgency, 
frequency and pain and bloody urine.
2 Initial treatment options include surgery, external beam 
radiation or brachytherapy.2-4 
2.2 Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer 
Advanced prostate cancer commonly spreads to the bones, which can cause pain in the hips, spine, 
ribs or other areas.2,4-6 For advanced disease (metastases or recurrence), hormonal therapy in 
conjunction with surgery or radiation is used.7-9  Historically, treatment of these patients has 
comprised primarily androgen deprivation therapy (ADT ), guided by the premise that aggressive 
treatment of the primary tumor and metastatic lesions conferred considerable morbidity and was unlikely to result in cure.
4,7-8   The survival benefit of ADT is juxtaposed against significant sequelae 
including cardiovascular morbidity, skeletal fractures, diabetes, sexual dysfunction, and a decrease in cognitive function.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 Advancements in molecular testing have highlighted distinctly different mutations in the lesions of 
patients with limited metastatic prostate disease as compared to those of patients with diffuse 
metastatic disease, possibly explaining the different biologic behavior of these tumors.11-13  Among 
men with limited metastatic disease, there is a potential benefit to treatment of oligometastatic prostate lesions.
14 Previous studies have identified a potentia l delay in the initiation of ADT in men 
treated with stereotactic radiotherapy.15,16 Additionally, a prospective, multicenter trial showed that 
metastasis-directed therapy delayed initiation of  ADT in patients with oligometastatic disease.17  
Given increased rates of metastatic disease and projected increases in incidence and mortality, 
innovative enhancement of current prostate cancer treatment regimens is vital. Novel therapeutic 
approaches for oligometastatic prostate cancer are needed, given ADT-i nduced sequelae such as 
cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes, cognitive deficits and sexual dysfunction.   
 
2.3 Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (PAR-4): tumor suppressor protein 
Prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR-4) is a tumor suppressor protein that facilitates apoptosis in 
numerous types of cancer cells.18 PAR-4 is ubiquitously expressed in normal cells and tissues, but 
it is often inactivated, down-regulated or mutated in several types of cancer cells.18,19 PAR-4 
sensitizes cells to the action of diverse therapeutic agents.18  T h e  l o s s  o f  P A R - 4  i n  t u m o r s  
contributes to recurrence and decreased overall patient survival. The baseline levels of PAR-4 secreted by normal cells are generally inadequate to cause massive apoptosis in cancer cells. Given 
the apoptosis-PAR-4 association, drugs that succes sfully bolster PAR-4 se cretion constitute an 
important therapeutic advance. 
 2.4 Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Chloroquine [CQ; (RS)-N'-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl) -N, N-diethyl-pentane-1, 4-diamine] is an 
antimalarial drug introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria 
and has been repurposed to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. 
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the N-
ethyl substituent is beta-hydroxylated, but has similar pharmacokinetics to CQ, with quick 
gastrointestinal absorption and is eliminated by the kidney with minimal side effects on short term 
treatments.  
Both CQ and HCQ are potent inhibitors of autophagy, a cellular survival process during starvation 
to maintain cellular energy by degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional components through the 
actions of lysosomes. CQ and HCQ are lysosomotr opic agents, which inhibit autophagy by raising 
the lysosomal pH, leading to inhibition of both fusion of autophagosome with lysosome and lysosomal protein degradation. Moreover, by inhibiting autophagy, CQ activates caspases and 
sensitizes the cells to apoptosis. These apoptosis -sensitizing features of HCQ or CQ enhance the 
anti-tumor effects of a broad range of cancer therapeutics.
20,21 Institutional experiences with 
chloroquine administered concurrently with conventional therapy in adjuvant setting provided longer 
survival.22 These studies provide a basis for the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine can elevate 
PAR-4 levels and thus provide tumor suppression systemically. Accordingly, HCQ and CQ are being 
studied either pre-operatively or in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation.23 
Chloroquine has been found to induce PAR-4 expression and subsequently promote apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit metastatic progression.

2.5 Study Rationale  Treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer may be enhanced by the addition of 
hydroxychloroquine to either surgical resection or radiation treatment of metastatic lesions.  
Potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine include delayed disease progression and delayed initiation 
of ADT, lessening morbidity and increasing quality of life in men with oligometastatic prostate 
cancer. Our recent studies identified several small molecules that show robust secretion of PAR-4 
in cell culture and mouse models, and secreted PAR-4 induces apoptosis of cancer cells.
19,24 
However, these small molecules are not FDA-approved for human use. We therefore sought to identify FDA-approved small molecule drugs that show  robust secretion of PAR-4 in normal cells 
and can be repurposed for treatment of cancer. T hese studies (unpublished) identified HCQ as a 
potent inducer of PAR-4 secretion from normal ce lls under conditions that show no normal cell 
death.  
As normal cells in any patient far outnumber cancer cells, FDA-approved PAR-4 secretagogues 
may play a valuable role in elevating systemic and local levels of PAR-4 protein, thereby inducing 
paracrine apoptosis in primary and metastatic prostate tumors. Systemic PAR-4 is also expected to 
induce apoptosis in circulating cancer cells that contribute to metastasis. PAR-4 produces apoptosis 
and HCQ is expected to produce elevated levels of PAR-4 secretion that will prevent the growth of 
tumors.  HCQ has also been reported to both inhibit and enhance immune responses via changes in Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subsets and reduce inflammatory markers.  It also acidifies lysosomes 
that potentially inhibits antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells and can be measured with 
LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 by flow cytometry. HCQ blocks autophagy by preventing the 
fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome, and auto- phagosome cargo protein 
p62/Sequestosome-1 (also known as the ubiquitin-binding protein), and microtubule-associated protein LC-3II levels (analyzed by Western blot analysis or IHC) are elevated in the normal cells, as 
well as tumor cells in the patient.    
 
2.6 Study Hypothesis:  In men who develop recurrent oligom etastatic disease following primary 
treatment of prostate cancer, treatment with surger y or radiation in combination with administration 
of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg per day for a 90-day  period) will induce an elevation of PAR-4 
expression among a majority of participants within three months of HCQ administration.  
We hypothesize successful attainment of a 50% increase in PAR-4 from baseline levels 
among 50% or more of participants within the 90-day administration period of HCQ.

3.3 Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Children 
 
Prostate cancer does not occur in women nor in male children; as such, these groups are 
excluded from this study. No eligible male participants will be excluded from this study on the 
basis of race or ethnicity.  
 
 
4. STUDY REGISTR ATION PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee and Institutional Review Board Review 
 
Before implementing this study, the protocol mu st be reviewed by the Markey Cancer Center’s 
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee.  The protocol, the proposed informed consent form and 
other information to subjects must be reviewed by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review 
Board (IRB). A signed and dated UK IRB initial review approval memo must be maintained in the 
Markey Cancer Center Clinical Research Office  (MCC CRO) regulatory binder. Any amendments 
to the protocol, other than administrative ones, must be reviewed and approved by the PRMC, study 
sponsor, and the UK IRB.   
 
4.2 Enrollment Guidelines 
 
Patients who have received previous treatment for prostate cancer with the intent to cure who have biochemical recurrence will undergo metastatic eval uation with imaging at baseline including 
fluciclovine or prostate-specific membrane anti gen (PSMA) PET scan (preferred), bone scan, 
PET/CT and/or CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as needed to assess for metastatic disease.   
 
Biochemical recurrence for patients who have pr eviously undergone radical prostatectomy is 
defined as D 36$  QJGO  Patients who have biochemical recurrence following radical 
prostatectomy should have received postoperative radiotherapy to the prostate bed if no evidence 
of metastatic disease.   
 
For patients who have previously undergone primary treatment of their prostate cancer with 
radiotherapy, biochemical recurrence is defined as an increase of 2 or more ng/dl above the nadir.   
Patients who have undergone primary radiotherapy will have pelvic MRI to rule out local disease as 
part of the requisite baseline imaging.  Suspicious lesions within prostate bed will be assessed by 
biopsy.  
 
Patients with 1-3 metastatic lesions on metastatic evaluation will be further screened per inclusion 
and exclusion criteria as noted above, Section 3.  In itial localization of metastases will be recorded 
(node vs bone vs visceral).  Eligible patients will be identified by the principa l investigator and co-investigators of this study. 
Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center clinics by the investigators, study personnel, and the Principal Investigator (PI). Upon obtaining 
proper consent, patients will be enrolled into the study.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 4.3 Informed Consent  
The goal of the informed consent process  is to provide people with sufficient information so they 
can make informed choices about whether to begin or continue participation in clinical research.  
The process involves a dynamic and continuing exc hange of information between the research team 
and the participant throughout the research experience.  It includes discussion of the study's purpose, research procedures, risks and potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of participation. 
 
The informed consent document  provides a summary of the clinical study and the individual's rights 
as a research participant.  The document acts as a starting point for the necessary exchange of 
information between the investigator and potential research participant.  Also, research participants 
and their families may use the consent document as an information resource and reference 
throughout participation in the trial.  The informed consent document  is often considered the 
foundation of the informed consent process; it does not, however, represent the entirety of the 
process.  Nor is the informed consent document a risk-management tool for the investigator and/or 
institution. 
 
The investigator must explain to each subject the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures 
involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may 
entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he may 
withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his subsequent 
medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
 
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non-technical language. The subject should read and co nsider the statement before signing and dating 
it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. No patient can enter the study before his 
informed consent has been obtained.  The informed consent form is considered to be part of the 
protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with the protocol at the time of IRB review.  
4.4 Compliance with Laws and Regulations 
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the 
Declaration of Helsinki, any applicable local health authority, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
requirements.  The study PI or designee will be responsible for obtaining continuing and not less 
than annual IRB re-approval throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the Investigator’s 
annual report to the IRB and copies of the IRB continuance of approval must maintained by the 
MCC CRO.  The study PI or designee is also responsible for notifying the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee of the MCC and the UK IRB of any significant adverse events that are serious and/or unexpected, as per SOP’s of those entities. The MCC DSMC will review all adverse events 
of this IIT as per its SOP.

 5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Enrollment and Screening Process 
 
Prior to any study-required tests, subjects must first provide written informed consent to participate  in this study.  
All lab tests, ophthalmologic exam and radiographic studies should be completed within eight 
 weeks prior to initiation of HCQ treatment.  
Complete history, physical examination, and evaluation of performance status will also be  performed during this 8-week timeframe.   
Required lab work will include:  
 complete blood count (CBC); serum chemistry tests to include alkaline phosphatase, 
 glucose, creatinine, electrolytes, AST (SGOT), total testosterone, and total bilirubin.    
 
5.2 Metastatic site-directed treatment and hydroxychloroquine administration 
 
Modality of site-directed treatment of oligometastatic lesions will be decided by multidisciplinary 
team consisting of urologic surgery, radiation on cology, and medical oncology in consultation with 
the patient.   
 
5.3 HCQ Administration 
Hydroxychloroquine will be administered daily on an outpatient basis beginning 2 weeks before 
metastasectomy or initiation of radiation treatment to metastatic lesions.  HCQ administration will 
be held the day of surgery for those patients undergoing surgical resection of their metastatic site(s) 
and will resume on post-operative day 1, and the missed dose will not be made up.  
Hydroxychloroquine will be administered orally at a total daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg BID) for 90-
days. Tablets of HCQ are available in 200 mg strength.  
 
Instructions on taking HCQ (patient version) are located in Appendix C .  
 
To minimize nausea, HCQ is recommended to be administered in divided doses (one 200-
mg tablet twice per day). The divided doses should  be taken with meals, once in the morning and 
once at night. Should a subject have emesis and regurgitate the HCQ within 30 minutes of taking it, 
the dose may be repeated once, but if vomiting occurs longer than 30 minutes after ingestion, the 
dose should not be repeated. 
 
Study participants will be required to keep a medication diary and to present the completed diary at 
the end of the treatment (Appendix D ). Additionally, at the PI’s discretion, study staff will call the 
participants periodically on an as-needed basis to monitor ongoing completion of the pill diaries 
while patient is on-study, e.g., if a patient misses a clinic visit.  
 
Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  
 
Adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Because there is a potential for interaction of hydroxychloroquine with other concomitantly 
administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the 
concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapies. The PI 
should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect 
selected CYP450 isoenzymes. Appendix B  presents guidelines for identifying medications/ 
substances that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine. While not strictly prohibited, 
these medications should be avoided if at all possibl e. Hydroxychloroquine should also be used with 
caution in patients taking medicines that may cause adverse ocular or skin reactions.  
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), hydroxychloroquine treatment will continue for 3 months or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease Progression, assessed by standard of care and defined as either:  
          - PSA progression (an increase in PSA > 25% above baseline at study entry), or           - Symptomatic progression (increasing pain from metastatic lesion), or  
          - Progression of baseline-detec ted lesions (soft-tissue lesions as assessed by 
   RECIST and bone lesions as assessed by the MDA criteria (respectively,    Appendix H.1 and Appendix H.2).  
  Additionally, CT C/A/P and/or fluciclovine or PSMA PET scans may be 
                        performed at the time of either Symptomatic or PSA Progression at  
                        discretion of the treating physician.  - Appearance of new metastatic lesions 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition that render the patient unacceptable  
  for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 
 
5.6 Duration of Follow-up  
 
Patients will be followed for up to three years post-therapy or until death, whichever occurs first. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS – LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and repor ting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The following list 
of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an  observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine if the 
event requires expedited reporting (via Medwatch Forms) in addition to routine reporting. 
 
7.1 Expected Toxicities for Hydroxychloroquine 
 
7.1.1 Precautions 
 
Dermatologic Reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may occur and, therefore, proper 
care should be exercised when they were admini stered to any patient receiving a drug with a 
significant tendency to produce dermatitis. 
 
Hydroxychloroquine Retinitis  is both dose- and duration-dependent with increased risk occurring 
at doses exceeding 5mg/kg of actual body weight and chronic use exceeding 5 years.  This trial 
uses an FDA-approved dos e of hydroxychloroquine and is 90 days in duration. Thus, risks of 
hydroxychloroquine retinitis are small (less than 1%) and will be further minimized by baseline 
screening for retinal abnormalities, (s ee eligibility criteria  3.1.5 and 3.2.2), monthly assessment of 
adverse effects, repeat visual examinations for ocular toxicity and perm anent disconti nuation of 
hydroxychloroquine for any grade 2 or greater ocular toxicity (see 6.1, Visual Changes. The methods recommended for early diagnosis of "chloroquine retinopathy" consist of (1) fundoscopic 
examination of the macula for fine pigmentary dist urbances or loss of the foveal reflex and (2) 
examination of the central visual field with a sm all red test object for pericentral or paracentral 
scotoma or determination of retinal thresholds to red. Any unexplained vis ual symptoms, such as 
light flashes or streaks, should also be regarded with suspici on as possible manifestations of 
retinopathy. 
 
If serious toxic symptoms occur from HCQ Overdosage or Sensitivity , it is suggested that 
ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses) be administered orally three or four days a week for 
several months after therapy has been stopped, as acid ification of the urine increases renal excretion 
of the 4-aminoquinoline compounds by 20-90%. Howe ver, caution must be exercised in patients 
with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis. See Section 8.7 for details.

 7.1.2 Adverse Reactions 
 
 
The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) frequency rating is 
 used as follows, when applicable:  
  
CIOMS Frequency Rating        (expected % of population experiencing adverse reactions)  
Inadequate data Not Known  0.1%  - 0.9%  Uncommon 
10% or greater = Very Common  0.01 – 0.09%  Rare 
1%  – 9%  Common Less than 0.01%  Very Rare  
 
 
Eye Disorders  
 Common: Blurring of vision due to a disturb ance of accommodation, which is dose  
  dependent and reversible. 
 Uncommon:  
 - Maculopathies, which may be irreversible. 
 -Retinopathy with changes in pigmentation and visual field defects. In its early form, it  
    appears reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. If allowed to develop however,           
    there may be a risk of progression even after treatment withdrawal. 
 -Patients with retinal changes may be asymptomatic initially , or may have scotomatous 
    vision with paracentral, pericentral ring types, temporal scotomas, abnormal color    
    visions, reduction in visual acuity, night blindness, difficulty read ing and skipping words. 
 - Corneal changes including edema and opac ities. They are either symptomless or may 
    cause disturbances, i.e., halos around lights es pecially at night, blurring of vision or     
     photophobia. They may be transient or are reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. 
          Not known : Macular degeneration, which may be irreversible. 
 
Gastrointestinal Disorders  
 Very common : Abdominal pain, nausea 
 Common : Diarrhea, vomiting 
         These symptoms usually resolve immediately upon reducing the dose or upon stopping treatment . 
 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
 Common : Skin rash, pruritus 
 Uncommon: Pigmentary changes in skin and mucous membranes, bleaching of hair,  
  alopecia. These usually resolve readily upon cessation of therapy. 
 Not known : Bullous eruptions (including urticarial, morbilliform, lichenoid, maculopapular, 
  purpuric, erythema annularecentrifugum), toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema  
  multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Drug  Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
  Symptoms (DRESS syndrome), photosensitivity, exfoliative dermatitis, acute  
  generalized exanthematouspustulosis (AGEP) 
        AGEP has to be distinguished from  psoriasis, although HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may    
 precipitate attacks of psoriasis. It may be associated with fever and hyperleukocytosis. 
      Outcome is usually favorable after discontinuation of drug. 
 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
 Common : Anorexia (usually resolves immediately upon reducing dose or stopping  
  treatment). 
 Not known : hypoglycemia 
         HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE may exacerbate porphyria.

 7.2   Adverse Event Characteristics 
 
7.2.1 CTCAE v.5.0: For AE reporting, descriptions and grading scales of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized. All appropriate 
treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  
Additionally, a copy of the CTC AE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site   
          http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
 
7.2.2 For expedited reporting purposes only : 
           AEs for HCQ noted in Section 7.1 sh ould be reported only if the adverse event varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from the expect ed toxicity information which is provided.  
 
Other AEs that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in Expedited Adverse Event 
Reporting (Section 7.3). 
 
 
 
7.2.3 Attribution of the Adverse Event (AE):  
 Definite – The AE is clearly related to the HCQ. 
 Probable – The AE is likely related to the HCQ. 
 Possible – The AE may be related to the HCQ. 
 Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the HCQ. 
 Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the HCQ. 
 
 
7.3    Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
7.3.1 For MCC Investigator-Initiated Trials (IITs), study investigators and staff must report to the 
 Overall PI any serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs after the initial dose of HCQ, 
 during the 90-day HCQ administration (study treatment), or within 30 days of the last dose  
 of HCQ on the SAE form.    This applies to the following categories: 
x Grade 2 ocular or visual changes – any changes, regardless of attribution to the HCQ 
x Grade 3 (severe) Medical Events – Only events that are Unexpected and Possibly,  
   Probably or Definitely Related / Associated with the HCQ. 
x ALL Grade 4 (life threatening or disabling) Medical Events – Unless expected AND  
   specifically listed in protocol as not requiring reporting. 
x ALL Grade 5 (fatal) Events regardless of study phase or attribution. 
 
Note: If subject is in Long-Term Follow-Up, death is reported at c ontinuing review.  
 
 Note: Abnormal laboratory values are not considered medical events, unless determined to be          causative of SAE by the investigator or are a grade 5.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 8.2 HCQ Storage Requirements: 
 
 8.2.1  Dispense in a tight, light-resist ant container as defined in the USP/NF. 
 8.2.2   Store at 20° - 25°C (68° - 77°F) excu rsions permitted to 15° - 30°C (59° - 86°F) [See  
  USP Controlled Room Temperature]. 
 8.2.3 Store out of t he reach of children. 
 8.3 HCQ Stability: 
 When stored as listed above and light-resis tant containers, hydroxychloroquine is stable 
 for 3 years from manufacture date.  
8.4  Route of Administration for HCQ: 
 Hydroxychloroquine is taken orally twice a day, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass 
of milk. If patients miss the dose, take if within 2 hour s. Outside of this 2-hour window, just skip the 
dose and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. See Appendix C.   
 
8.5 HCQ Contraindications 
 Use of HCQ is contraindicated in:   (1) presence of retinal or visual field c hanges attributable to any 4-aminoquinoline  
  compound,  
 (2) patients with known hypersensitiv ity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds, and  
 (3) for long-term therapy in children. 
 
 8.6   HCQ Precautions: General 
 
Antimalarial compounds should be used  with caution in patients with hepatic disease or  alcoholism 
or in conjunction with known hepatotox ic drugs. Periodic blood cell co unts should be made if patients 
are given prolonged therapy. If any se vere blood disorder appears whic h is not attributable to the 
disease under treatment, discontinuation of the dr ug should be considered. The drug should be 
administered with caution in patients having G-6-PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) 
deficiency. 
 
 
8.7  HCQ Overdose: Symptoms of Overdose and Treatment for HCQ Overdose 
 Overdose with the 4-aminoquinolines is dangerous particularly in infants, as little as 1-2 
 grams having proved fatal. 
 
 
8.7.1 Symptoms of HCQ Overdose: 
 The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very ra pidly and completely  absorbed following 
 ingestion and in accidental overdosage, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes .  
 These consist of:     headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse,   
  hypokalemia and convulsions, rhythm and  conduction disorders, including QT  
  prolongation, torsade de poin tes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, 
  followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest.  
 Immediate medical attention is required, as effects may appear shortly after overdose.  
 The ECG may reveal atrial standstill, nodal rhythm, prolonged intraventricular conduction 
  time, and progressive bradycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 8.7.2  Treatment of HCQ Overdose: 
 
Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with  immediate evacuation of the stomach by emesis 
(at home, before transportation to the hospital), or  gastric lavage until the stomach is completely 
emptied. If finely powdered activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube, after lavage and 
within 30 minutes after ingestion of th e tablets, it may inhibit further intestinal absorption of the drug. 
To be effective, the dose of activa ted charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of 
ingested hydroxychloroquine. Convulsions, if present, should be controlled before attempting gastric 
lavage. If due to cerebral stimul ation, cautious administration of an  ultrashort-acting barbiturate may 
be tried but, if due to anoxia, convulsions should be corrected by oxygen administration, artificial 
respiration or, in shock with hypotension, by va sopressor therapy. Because of the importance of 
supporting respiration, tracheal intu bation or tracheostomy, followed by gastric lavage, has also been 
advised. Exchange transfusions have been  used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquiolines in the blood. 
Consideration should be given to administering diaz epam parenterally since studies have reported it 
beneficial in reversing chloroquine cardiotoxicity. A patient who survives the acute phase and is 
asymptomatic should be closely obs erved for at least 6 hours. Fluids may be forced, and sufficient 
ammonium chloride may be administered for a few days  to acidify the urine to help promote urinary 
excretion. If serious toxic symptoms occur from over dosage or sensitivity, it is suggested that 
ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) three or four days a week be administered 
for several months after therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases renal 
excretion of the 4-aminoquinoline compounds by 20 to 90 percent. However, caution must be 
exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis. 
 
 9.  IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECT OF HCQ  
To assess the immunological effect of HCQ therapy in patients, we will analyze peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at days 0 and 30 of treatment, and also, Day 60 (+ 6-week study visit 
window) of treatment.  PBMC and plasma separation and storage will be handled by the Biospecimen 
Procurement and Translational Pathology Shared Resource Facility, per their standard processes 
until samples are ready for analysis.  
 
Changes in markers of immune function/activation will be determined by measuring the percentage and absolute number of activated, naïve, and me mory T cell subsets within CD4 helper, CD8 
cytotoxic, and Treg subsets using cell marker antibodies to: CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD25, 
and Foxp3.  Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets will be identified in the CD4 T cell subset by intracellular 
staining for IFN-
 ܵ ,IL-10 and IL-17 in ex vivo activated PBMCs. Markers for systemic inflammation 
(C-reactive protein, IFN-gamma and TNFa) will be quant ified in plasma samples. As a lysomotrophic 
compound, HCQ reduces pH in lysosomes which can promote antigen retention and can promote autophagy.  The pH levels in intracellular vesicles will be evaluated by flow cytometry in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets and in monocytes using LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160.  Induction of 
autophagy will be monitored in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets and in monocytes by evaluating 
expression levels of the autophagy marker, LC3B. 
 
To assess PAR-4 levels we will analyze plasma (or serum) at Day 0, 2 weeks prior to surgery or initiation of radiation treatment (corresponds to roughly Day 14 of HCQ therapy); 30-, 60- and 90-days post-HCQ initiation; and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up timepoints (that correspond to a standard of care clinic visit 6- and 12-months after cessation of HCQ therapy).

 10. Study Calendar / Schedule of Activities   
 
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 8 weeks prior to start of HCQ. Scans and ophthalmologic exam must 
be completed less than 8 weeks prior to the start of HCQ regi men. In the event the patient’s  condition is deteriorating, 
laboratory evaluations should be  repeated more frequently, as clinically indicated and at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  At PSA progression or symp tomatic progression: PSA, history and physica l/toxicity assess ment, CT C/A/P 
and/or fluciclovine or PSMA PET scans to be performed at di scretion of treating physician, per standard of care.

                scan; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; PAR-4, prostate apoptosis response-4; PSMA, prostate-specific membrane antigen P ET scan  
   1: Blood (1 tube) will be drawn at each of the 7 noted timepoints for PSA and PAR-4 levels; plasma is preferred (serum is accepta ble). 
Timepoints may be +/- 72-hour window at Pre-study and Enrollment.  
        For Day 14, Timepoints may be +/- 120-hour window.  
        Timepoints may be +/- 28-day window at the 3-, 6- and 12-month f/u, coinciding with a clinic visit. 
 
2: for collection of PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells): one tube per collection timepoint, slated for Day 0, Day 30 
   and Day 60. Day 0 and Day 30 timepoints have a +/- 14-day window. Day 60 has a +6 week window. This is explicated in 
   greater detail in study lab manual.   
 
3: QOL is assessed via EORTC QLQ-C30 + QLQ-PR25 at 4 timepoints 
       - at a clinic visit prior to initiation of HCQ   
       - at a clinic visit; either the end of HCQ administration OR when HCQ is discontinued (if stop it early)  
      - at 6-mos and 12-mos post-treatment. These final two QOL timepoints can be +/- 8 weeks, and conducted during a regularly  scheduled,  
            standard of care clinic visit.      
 
  4: Requisite pre-study eye exam; Eye exam may be repeated during HCQ administration if vision complaints. 
  5: One tube of blood will be drawn at each of the 6 noted timepoints for serum PSA; this is standard of care for baseline and ev ery 3 months (4 of 
the 6 draws), with two additional draws scheduled. Timepoints may be +/- 72-hour window at screening and enrollment.  
  
 6:  Imaging at baseline, pre-study : Patients who have confirmed recurrent disease of the prostate are deemed ineligible for this trial. As such, all 
eligible patients will undergo standard of care imaging to identify metastases (initial evaluation of status/extent of recurren t disease), including:   
      6a: All eligible patients will undergo standard of care imaging to assess extent of metastatic disease at baseline; fluciclovine o r PSMA PET 
scans are preferred; other scans (PET/CT scan, bone scan and/or CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) may be performed as needed  at 
baseline to assess extent of metastatic disease, per standard of care. 
      6b: Additionally , eligible patients who have undergone radiation prior to study enrollment will have an MRI of pelvis (in addition to previousl y 
named imaging studies) to assess for recurrent local disease. Suspicious lesions of the prostate seen on MRI will be biopsied.  
       
     6c : Imaging on Study as work-up for disease progression : Once a patient is enrolled on-study, imaging to assess disease progression will  
          proceed per standard of care, based on clinical indicators such as rising PSA and/or other clinical symptoms. Per REC IST  
        1.1, tumor re-evaluation scheduled every 6-8 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician based on clinical indica tors. Notably, a rising  
        PSA and/or other clinical symptoms could trigger a scan/imaging in an earlier timeframe.  
  7: Concomitant Medications will be assessed per standard of care at the discretion of the treating physician; during HCQ adminis tration, Con 
Meds will be assessed with a particular focus on medications contraindicated for use with HCQ.  
  8: Height will be evaluated once while on-study. Height can either be assessed via the patient’s medical record, and/or assessed  directly (in  
         conjunction with vital signs during a clinic visit) 
  9: ADT initiation: record date and reason for ADT initiation. Reasons for ADT initiation include: PSA/biochemical progression, Sy mptomatic 
Progression, Local Progression of baseline-detected lesions (either soft-tissue or bone lesions), or Appearance of new metastat ic lesions.

 11. MEASUREMENT OF HCQ EFFECT  
11.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
 To assess the effect of HCQ on PAR-4, first compliance  with HCQ planned dose regimen should be ascertained.  
 HCQ regimen compliance: pill diaries (Appendix D) and/or pati ent-reported HCQ compliance will be 
evaluated to assess participant  adherence to HCQ daily regimen at follow- up clinic visits with study staff. 
Additionally, study staff may institute a telephone check wi th study participants on a PRN basis, should compliance 
to the HCQ regimen need to be monitored outside regular clinic visit schedule.   Participants who completed 80% of the planned HCQ doses wi ll be considered evaluable for the Primary Endpoint, 
PAR-4 increase.    PAR-4 level will be assessed for each par ticipant at the following timepoints:  
 Enrollment/Baseline visit 
 Day 14 post- HCQ initiation  
 Day 30 of HCQ  Day 60 of HCQ   Day 90 of HCQ  6-month follow-up (during a standard of care visit)  12-month follow-up (during a standard of care visit) 
 It is expected that HCQ will induce an elevation of PAR-4 expres sion among 50% of the participants within the 
90-day administration of HCQ. The el evation is expected to be a 50% increase from baseline PAR-4 levels 
among half of the study participants.    
11.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  
 11.2.1 HCQ safety analysis  and Treatment Toxicity : frequency and incidence tables of toxicity and AEs will be 
generated. Toxicity will be assessed using Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events V5.0 (for HCQ and 
for radiation therapy), as well as the Clavien-Dindo classifi cation of surgical complicati ons in the case of patients 
who underwent surgery (Appendix F). All patients will be evaluable for toxicity (HCQ) from the time of their first 
treatment with Hydroxychloroquine.  
 
  11.2.2 HCQ immunologic effect on PAR-4 Levels : as measured by serum (or plasma) blood collected at multiple 
timepoints. PAR-4 secretion is  expected to come primarily from normal ce lls of the patient. T he contribution of the 
tumor cells to serum levels of PAR-4 is expected to be mi nimal, but this has not been di rectly tested. Association 
between PAR-4 levels and clinical stage will be assessed.    
 
11.2.3  Quality of Life : This is assessed by two validated pati ent-reported outcomes measures, the EORTC QLQ-
C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. All items assessing symptoms and functional domains employ a 4-point Likert 
scale, with responses ranging from “Not At All”, “A Little”, “Quite a Bit” and “Very Much.” Study participants will be instructed to choose one response per item. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire assessing multiple 
domains of global health-related quality of life in cancer populations. It  includes one global QOL rating, 5 functioning 
scales (physical, cognitive, emotional , role and social) and 9 symptom-specific  subscales (fatigue, N/V, pain,

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 dyspnea, insomnia, constipation, di arrhea, appetite loss). The EORTC QLQ-PR25 is a prostate cancer module 
meant for use among patients with prostate  cancer in varying in disease stage and treatment modality (i.e., surgery, 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.), which complement s the QLQ-C30. The QLQ-PR25 module comprises 25 items 
assessing disease symptoms, treatment side effects, sexual  functioning and sexual acti vity. The functional scales 
are sexual activity and sexual functi oning; the 4 symptom scales are urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, hormonal 
treatment-related symptoms, and inconti nence aid. All participants will complete items 1-19 as well as items 20-21 
(which query current sexual activity ). Completion of Items 22-25 are condi tional on being sexually active (and 
comprise the Sexual Functioning subsca le), and thus will only be complete d by a subgroup of st udy patients. For 
interpretation of scores on the two EORTC QOL question naires, all of the scales and single-item measures range 
in score from 0 – 100. A high scale score represents a hi gher response level – so that a higher score represents a 
higher (“better”) level of functioning OR a higher (“worse) level of symptoms. See Appendix G  for additional details 
and the patient self-report questionnaires.

11.4.1  ADT-Free Survival 
Indications to start Androgen Deprivation Therapy  include appearance of new metastases (i.e., 
progression to more than the three baseline-detect ed metastases, “distant progression”), or local 
progression of baseline- detected metastases.  
ADT initiation can be considered at Symptomatic Progression or at PSA Progression. Additionally, 
CT C/A/P and/or fluciclovine or PSMA PET scans  may be performed at the time of either 
Symptomatic or PSA Progression at di scretion of the treating physician. 
 
Date of ADT initiation will be recorded for ea ch participant, accompanied by the reason for 
initiation.  
    
ADT-free Survival is defined as the time between study enrollment until the start of ADT or death 
as a result of any cause. Patients who do not st art ADT at the time of last follow-up will be 
censored at that time point.  
- Initiation of ADT will be recorded if it occu rs after initiation of HCQ. This will also be 
recorded for enrolled patients who have ADT in itiation occurring after completion of 
surgery/radiation but prior to HCQ  initiation (as this is exclusio n criterion, the patient will be 
removed from the study).  
- After HCQ administration is comp leted, survival status will be assessed at ongoing clinic 
visits for one year post-enrollment, and afterwards, annually for up to 2 additional years (i.e., 
at Year 2 post-enrollment and at Year 3 post- enrollment).  
 11.4.2  Progression-Free Survival  (time to clinical progression)  
Four types of progression are def ined in 11.3. Progression is ca lculated from time of study 
enrollment until progression (per the 4 specified definitions) or  death. Events for PFS are:  
1. PSA or biochemical progression:  defined as a PSA increase of  25% DQGQJP/LI
36$ZDVQJP/IURPEDVHOLQH ) 
2. Symptomatic progression: increasi ng pain from metastatic lesion  
3. Local progression of baselin e-detected lesions: each metastasis is a target lesion 
  independently assessed as:   - soft-tissue lesions assessed per RECIST v1.1 (Appendix H.1)  
 - bone lesions assessed per MDA bone-specific response criteria  (Appendix H.2) 
4. Distant progression: appearance of new metastatic lesions.  
 
If an event is identified, then the time to the event will be recorded as the first instance where any 
of the above four situations occur.

 12. DATA REPORTING AND RE GULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 
   Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7.  
 
12.1 Method of Data Reporting  
This study will require data submission and reporting via the OnCore Database, which is the official 
database of the MCC CRO. Instructions for submitting data are listed in the Data Management Plan created 
by the Markey Data Management staff in conjunction with the MCC CRO and the QA Office, per their SOPs 
(see S13.4, below).  
 
12.2 Responsibility for Data Submission and Oversight 
Study staff is responsible for submitting study data  and/or data forms to On Core as per the MCC CRO 
SOP’s. This trial will be monitored by the MCC DS MC on a schedule determined by the PRMC at the initial 
PRMC review. The CRO SRF staff is responsible for compiling and submitting data for all participants and 
for providing the data to the PI for review. 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design, Sample Size Considerations and Accrual Rate  
 
13.1.1 Study Design  
 A single-arm, Phase II trial will be employed to obtain initial assessment of the effect of HCQ in 
modulation of PAR4 levels among patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer treated with surgery or radiation.  The primary endpoint is based on obtaining a 50% increase in PAR-4 levels from baseline within the 3-month period of HCQ administration.  
 
13.1.2 Sample size justification   Based on an ongoing Phase I trial of HCQ, we will assume that the proportion of patients who will exhibit a 50% induction in PAR-4 from baseline levels is equal to 0.50 compared to a null hypothesis of 0.20.  
A sample of 18 patients will provide 84% power to detect this hypothesized difference in proportion based on a two-sided test with 5% significance level. Assuming no more than a 10% drop out rate, we will enroll a total 
of 20 patients into the study. No patients dropped out of  our Phase 1 study, which ascertained 200 mg daily 
as the optimal biological dose.
25  
 
13.1.3 Accrual Rate 
 The accrual rate is estimated to be one patient per month. Based on this enrollment rate, we will 
complete the accrual of 20 patients in about 18 months.  
 
13.2 Interim Monitoring for Efficacy 
We propose to assess the proportion of patients who will exhibit induction levels in PAR-4 after half of the 
patients have been enrolled into the trial.  Bayesian interim monitoring methods using posterior probabilities, 
credible intervals and predictive probabilities will be calc ulated based on proportion of patients exhibiting a 
50% induction in PAR-4 levels.  Briefly, a beta distri bution will be assumed for the proportion of PAR-4 
response and uninformative and neutral prior distributions will be utilized.   
After half of the participants are enrolled on-study (n = 10-11), the proportion of patients with PAR-4 induction 
will again be estimated and posterior distributions and predictive posterior distributions will be calculated.  
Accrual will continue during interim analysis.   Based on posterior probabilities and credible intervals from the 
interim analysis, we will then determine whether to continue or stop accrual efforts to attain the planned 
sample size of 20.

     Amendment 4, 16JUN2022 
 13.3 Analysis of Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
To be considered “evaluable” a patient must have completed 80% of the 90-day planned dose of HCQ.   13.3.1 PAR-4 Levels  
Patient compliance with planned HCQ regimen will be assessed by the treating physician and the patient-
reported pill diary will be reviewed. For each evaluable patient, descriptive statistics will be calculated to 
summarize PAR-4 levels at each time point of follow-up.  Percent change from baseline PAR-4 compared to 
each follow-up time point will likewise be calculated.  The proportion of patients who exhibit a 50% induction 
in PAR-4 compared to baseline within the 3-month therapy period will be calculated and a one-sample test 
for proportion will be performed.   
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will also be performed.  Continuous changes in PAR-4 levels will 
also be assessed using paired t-test or nonparametric analog.  Linear mixed models will also be employed to 
analyzed repeatedly measured levels of PAR-4 and association with clinical parameters as well as PSA levels.  
Other secondary analyses will include summary of the PAR-4 induction profile over the 3-month treatment 
period and after end of therapy period.  
 
13.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Clinical Endpoints.  
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimates of median 
PFS and PFS rates at specific time points will be calculated.   
Likewise, median, 1-year and 3-year ADT-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.   
Exploratory analysis for association of PFS and ADT-free su rvival with PAR-4 and PSA levels will be assessed 
using the Cox regression model.  
Correlative and QOL endpoints.  PSA levels will be assessed according to the schedule described by the 
study calendar above and PSA doubling time will be calculated.  Association of PSA levels with PAR-4 levels 
will be determined using Spearman or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Quality of life (QOL) measured by the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 supplemented with QLQ-PR25 will be ev aluated and descriptive statistics of QOL scores 
will be calculated.  Association of QOL with PAR-4, PSA and clinical endpoints will be determined in an 
exploratory manner using correlations and survival analysis models.  
 
Safety analysis.    All patients who received st udy drug will be included in the safety analysis.  Frequency and 
incidence tables of toxicity and AEs will be generated in  the overall patient group. We will generate a safety 
report for review by the Markey Cancer Center’s Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) based on an intent-to-treat population.

 13.4 Data Management  
Data management will be performed by cross-team members at MCC, including members from the Cancer 
Research Informatics (CRI) SRF and BB SRF, who will work\ closely with the MCC CRO. A protocol-specific 
Data Management Plan (DMP) will be authored by a senior data manager in collaboration with the 
biostatistician and CRO, each team will be expected to review and sign off on the DMP prior to finalization. In 
order to maintain best clinical practices in data management, the DMP may include, but not be limited to 
CRF/eCRF design, database build and design, database tr aining, edit check/validation specifications, study 
database testing/ release, data and paper workfl ow, report, metrics, que ry/discrepancy management, 
management of external (including lab) data, medical coding, SAE handling/reconciliation, data transfers and 
database lock. The protocol-specific DM P will additionally define the schedule at which data will be accessed 
by study statisticians to perform statistical programming for conduct of data quality, data control, data 
management, generation of interim reports and statistica l analysis. Furthermore, the CRI will utilize the Labkey 
system to develop a web-based data entry  system for the PAR-4 and other corre lative biomarkers that will be 
evaluated using western blot and ELI SA assays from Dr. Rangnekar’ s laborat ory. The study statistician will 
access to both Oncore clinical databases and Labkey  system. Cross-team members will collaborate to 
establish procedures and timelines for quality contro l, audits, query resolution, interim safety and final data 
analysis.  
 
 
The study statistician and staff from the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BB SRF) of the 
Markey Cancer Center (MCC) will work closely with t he study team, the Clinical Research Office (CRO) at 
MCC and the Cancer Research Informatics (CRI) Shared Resource at MCC to develop the Data Management 
Plan (DMP) for this trial. The DMP will provide details for development of eCRFs in the OnCore system, trial-
specific processes for data entry, generation of reports, data management and statistical analysis. 
Specifically, the statistician will attend several meetings including the eCRF development meeting, Data Management and Development meeting and the Protocol Initiation meeting. Appropriate and accurate 
collection of primary and secondary study endpoints and inclusion of valid values and range checks for data 
fields will be designed for the eCRFs. The OnCore c linical trial management syst em, managed by Markey’s 
CRO and CRI, will be the primary database repository of clinical data from all patients enrolled into this trial. Furthermore, the CRI at MCC has established workflows for receipt, storage and secure access of high-throughput bioinformatics data (next generation sequencing) using the university’s high performance 
computing facility. The study statistician and Dr. Chi Wang from the BB SRF have access to both OnCore 
clinical databases and bioinformatics data. Data will be accessed by the study statistician on a regularly-scheduled basis as defined in the DMP to perform statistical programming for conduct of data quality control, data management, generation of interim reports and statistical analysis. In collaboration with the study team, procedures will be developed for timelines for data quality control, resolution of data queries, interim safety reporting and final data analysis.
 
 
A Data Management Specialist (DMS) from CRI SRF will be assigned to build the study-specific calendar and 
appropriate eCRF for data collection. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be performed and reviewed by 
study team members, Data Management Specialist Sr, (DMSr), CRA, and export files by statistician, to assure 
all data collection tools are appropriate for the study data capture and all data export formatting is appropriate 
for analysis; eCRF’s will be updated and retested as needed. Additional data management study start-up activities, (i.e. writing of Data Management Plan, data validation programs, reporting and review tools) will be 
conducted concurrent to database build and testing.

 Appendix B.  POSSIBLE DRUG INTE RACTIONS WITH HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE 
 
Proper Name  Effect/clinical comment  
Any medication known to cause Adverse ocular reactions  AND/ OR  Adverse skin reactions  
Agalsidase   theoretical risk of inhibition of intra-cellular Į-galactosidase activity when HCQ is 
co-administered with agalsidase. 
 
Amiodarone  There may be an increased risk of inducin g ventricular arrhythmias if HCQ is used 
concomitantly with othe r arrhythmogenic drugs. 
 Antacids  As with chloroquine, antacids may reduce ab sorption of HCQ so it is advised that a 
four-hour interval be observed between HCQ and antacid dosing. 
Anti-diabetics May enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrea se in doses of 
antidiabetic dru gs may be re quired. 
Anti-epileptics  The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be  impaired if co-administered with HCQ. 
Anti-malarials  
known to lower the 
convulsion threshold  HCQ can lower the convulsive  threshold. Co-administr ation of HCQ with other 
anti-malarials known to lo wer the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may 
increase the risk of convulsions. 
 
Mefloquine HCQ can lower the convulsive  threshold. Co-administr ation of HCQ with other 
antimalarials known to lo wer the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may 
increase the risk  of convulsions. 
Arrhythmogenic 
drugs  There may be an increased risk of inducin g ventricular arrhythmias if HCQ is used 
concomitantly with othe r arrhythmogenic drugs. 
Cyclosporine  An increased plasma ciclosporin level was reported when ciclosporin and HCQ 
were co-administered. 
Digoxin  May result in increased serum digoxin levels; serum digoxin levels should be 
closel y monitored in patients receivin g concomitant treatment. 
Insulin  May enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrea se in doses of 
insulin may be required. 
Moxifloxacin  There may be an increased risk of inducin g ventricular arrhythmias if HCQ is used 
concomitantly with othe r arrhythmogenic drugs. 
 
Due to its similarity in structure and pharmacokine tics with chloroquine, a similar effect may be 
expected for HCQ with the following medications  and their derivatives, although specific reports 
have not appeared regarding their use with HCQ  
Praziquantel   Chloroquine has been reported to reduc e the bioavailability of praziquantel. A   
  similar effect may be expected for HCQ. 
Pyridostigmine  Potential antagonism of effect of pyridostigmine. 
Human diploid cell 
rabies vaccine   Reduction of the antibody response to primary immunization with intradermal  
  human diploid cell rabies vaccine. 
Neostigmine  Antagonism of effect of neostigmine. 
Aminoglycoside 
antibiotics  Potentiation of its direct blocking act ion at the neuromuscular junction by  
  aminoglycoside antibiotics. 
 
Cimetidine   Inhibition of its metabolism by cimetidine, which may increase plasma    concentration of the antimalarial.

Immune monitoring procedures and assays to be performed: 
Overview:  Blood from HCQ-treated patients will be drawn into BD Vacutainer® CPT™ Mononuclear Cell 
Preparation Tube ( 8ml ) containing Sodium Heparin at days 0, 30, and 60 of treatment. At each time 
point, de-identified blood samples in CPT tubes will be sent to FCIM for immediate separation of plasma 
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cryopreservation. All cryopreserved blood samples 
will be assayed in bulk following collection of all patient samples. At that time, PBMCs will be assessed for 
immune phenotypes and function as detailed in the following section.  Plasma will be assessed for 
cytokine levels as detailed below.

Grades  Definition  
 
Grade I: Any deviation from the normal posto perative course without the need for 
pharmacolo gical treatment or sur gical, endoscopic and radiolo gical interventions.  
Acceptable therapeutic regimens are: drugs as antiemetics, antipyretics, analgetics, 
diuretics and electrolytes and physiotherapy. This grade also includes wound infections 
opened at the bedside.  
Grade II:  Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for Grade 
I complications. 
Blood transfusions and total parenter al nutrition are also included. 
 
Grade III:  Requirin g surgical, endoscopic or radiolo gical intervention 
Grade III-a : intervention not under general anesthesia 
Grade III-b:  intervention under general anesthesia 
Grade IV:  Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)‡ requiring IC/ICU-
mana gement 
Grade IV-a:  single organ dysfunction (includin g dialysis) 
Grade IV-b:  multi or gan dysfunction 
Grade V:  Death of a patient 
 
Suffix ’d’: If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge (see examples in 
Appendix B, http://Links.Lww-.com/SLA/A3), the suffix “d” (for ‘disability’) is 
added to the respective grade of compli cation. This label indicates the need for 
a follow-up to fully evaluate the complication.

 APPENDIX G.  Quality of Life: EORTC’s Validated, Patient-Report Questionnaires  
Quality of Life : This is assessed by two validated patient-rep orted outcomes measures, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. All items assessing symptoms and fu nctional domains employ a 4-point Likert scale, with 
responses ranging from “Not At All”, “A Little”, “Quite a Bit” and “Very Much.” Study participants will be instructed to 
choose one response per item.  The EORTC QLQ-C30  is a 30-item questionnaire assessing multiple domains of 
global health-related quality of life in cancer populations. It includes one global QOL rating, 5 functioning scales 
(physical, cognitive, emotional, role and social) and 9 symptom-specific subscales (fatigue, N/V, pain, dyspnea, 
insomnia, constipation, diarr hea, appetite loss). The EORTC QLQ-PR25  is a prostate cancer module meant for use 
among patients in varying in disease stage and treatment modal ity (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.), 
which complements the QLQ-C30. The QLQ-PR25 modu le comprises 25 items assessing disease symptoms, 
treatment side effects, sexual function ing and sexual activity. The functional scales are sexual activity and sexual 
functioning; the 4 symptom scales are urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, hormonal treatment-related symptoms, 
and incontinence aid. All participants will complete items 31 -49 as well as items 50-51 (which query current sexual 
activity).  
For interpretation of scores on the two EORTC QOL questionnaires, all of the scales and single-item measures range 
in score from 0 – 100. A high scale scor e represents a higher response level – so that a higher score represents a 
higher (“better”) level of functioning OR a higher (“worse) level of symptoms.

* Completion of Items 52-55 are conditional on being sexually active (and comprise the Sexual Functioning subscale), 
and thus, these 4 items will only be completed by a subgroup of study patients. Response to item #52 keeps original 
scoring, while responses to items 53-55 are reverse-scored. Specifically, for items 53-55, a response of “4” is recoded 
as “1”,  a response of “3” is recoded as “2”, a response of  “2”  is recoded as “3”, and a response of “1” is recoded as 
“4”). This reverse-scoring preserves the Functional scal e property, where a higher response indicates higher 
functioning.

Scope 
The prostate cancer module is meant for use among patients with prostate cancer varying in disease stage 
and treatment modality (i.e. surgery, chemothera py, radiotherapy, etc.). It should always be 
complemented by the QLQ-C30.  
Scoring 
Scale  
name Number 
of items Item 
range QLQ-C30+PR25  
Item numbers QLQ-PR25

Functional scales     
Sexual activity PRSAC 2 3 50, 51 20, 21 
Sexual functioning PRSFU 4 3 52-55 
(reverse code 
responses to 
53-55)  22 – 25 
(reverse code 
responses to 
 23-25)  
Symptom scales     
Urinary symptoms PRURI 8 3 31-37, 39 1 – 7, 9 
Bowel symptoms PRBOW 4 3 40-43 10 – 13 
Hormonal treatment-
related symptoms  PRHTR 6 3 44-49 14 – 19 
Incontinence aid PRAID 1 3 38 8  
Remarks 
 
x Items 20 and 21 can be completed by all patients 
x Items 22-25 are conditional on being sexually active, and thus  will only be completed by a subgroup of patients. This 
will require reversing the response catego ries of questions 23-25 but not of 22. 
x If reporting scale level data, it is highly recommended that some basic psychometric analyses be carried out. Minimally, 
one would want to look at the internal consistency of the scales (using a reliability prog ram of a statistical software 
package that calculates a Cro nbach’s alpha coeffieient). This coefficient should preferably be above 0.70 for purposes 
of group comparisons. You do not need to reco de the items to perform the reliability analysis.

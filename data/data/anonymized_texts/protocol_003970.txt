 3.  GENERAL INFORMATION  
 
Objective  To quantify and provide a normative standard for refractive and 
visual outcomes in eyes with significant corneal astigmatism 
undergoing cataract surgery with the Alcon Toric R eSTOR lens. 
As well as to quantify the postoperative rotational stability of the 
IOL.  
 
The hypot hesis is that the addition of toricity will not affect the 
general performance of the ReSTOR design. As such, it is  
expected that patients with a ReSTOR toric  IOL that achieve a 
correction of their astigmatism will have visual acuity and visual 
quality si milar to patients implanted with the non -toric ReSTOR 
models.  The Toric ReSTOR lenses (+2.5 and +3.0) will result in 
a residual refractive cylinder similar to that observed in patients 
with non -clinically significant astigmatism treated with non -toric 
ReST OR lenses. They will also provide excellent distance and 
near vision in the vast majority of patients; we expect 75% of 
patients will have 20/25 (0.1 logMAR) o r better uncorrected 
visual acuity at distance and near. The Toric -ReSTOR lens will 
demonstrate r otational stability that meets or exceeds the 
recommendations established by the American National 
Standards Institute.

5.  INTRODUCTION  
In the past, patients with significant corneal astigmatism undergoing cataract surgery 
were given only the option of a monofocal astigmatism -correcting intraocul ar lens (IOL).  
Recently, the US FDA has approved intraocular lenses for the correction of astigmatism 
and presbyopia; these include toric -accommodating, toric -extended depth of focus, and 
now toric -multifocal (Tor ic-ReSTOR) IOLs.  Patients implanted with n on-toric ReSTOR 
lenses (2.5 and/or 3.0) have exhibited very good vision and high rates of satisfaction with 
their vision at various distances. Until recently, patients with corneal astigmatism could 
not take advant age of this option without considering a s econdary procedure such as a 
corneal relaxing incision or refractive surgery. (More than 0.50D of expected 
postoperative refractive astigmatism has been suggested to materially affect visual quality 
and satisfactio n after multifocal IOL implantation.) The availability of toric versions of 
the ReSTOR 2.5 and 3.0 lenses now allows for multifocal implantation in eyes with 
corneal astigmatism.  
 
Postoperative rotational stability is an important consideration with any to ric IOL. In 
general, each degree of misali gnment or misorientation of an IOL will decrease the 
intended astigmatic correction by 3.3%, reducing the resultant image quality. The 
American National Standards Institute has established an IOL rotation stability  standard 
requiring at least 90% of lenses  to exhibit less than 5 degrees of rotation.  Recent single -
piece IOL studies have shown the AMO toric monofocal platform exhibits less than 5 
degrees of rotation in 94.1% of eyes at the 6 month period.  Multiple s tudies reviewing 
the Alcon toric -monofocal  platform reveal similar rotational stability, with 95 -96% of 
lenses showing less than 5 degrees of rotation.  
 
The expectation is that the addition of toricity  will not affect the general performance of 
the ReSTOR design. As such, it is  expected that pati ents with a ReSTOR toric IOL that 
achieve a correction of their astigmatism will have visual acuity and visual quality similar 
to patients implanted with the n on-toric ReSTOR models.  
 
6.  OBJECTIVE(S)  
The objective is to provide a normative standard for re fractive and visual outcomes in 
eyes with significant corneal astigmatism undergoing cataract surgery with the Alcon 
Toric ReSTOR lens.  
7.  SUBJECTS  
7.1. Subj ect Population  
Eligible test subjects will be patients presenting for cataract surgery or refrac tive lens 
exchange surgery who are interested in astigmatism reduction and presbyopia correction.

 A total of 3 2 subjects  at one site will be enrolled. Both eyes of a subject will be enrolled. 
Subjects must meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will be provided 
information on the study and asked to sign a patient inf ormation and consent form to 
participate. The patient information and consent form will be approv ed by an appropriate 
ethics committee.

 • Subjects who have an acute or chronic disease or illness that would confound the 
results of this investigation ( e.g., immunocom promised, connective tis sue disease, 
clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other such disease or 
illness), that are known to affect postoperative visual acuity.  
• Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or devi ce trial 
within the previous 30  days prior to the start date of this trial.  
The principal investigator reserves the right to declare a patient ineligible or non -
evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.  
 
Pregna ncy has a known effe ct on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such, 
subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued  but their data 
may be excluded from analyses of effectiveness.  
 
7.4 Exclusion Criteria during surgery  
If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the study eye, the subject 
should not continue in the study.  
  
• If there are complications  related to completion of the surgery . 
• Other procedure, such as pupil stretch, expanders, iris hooks dur ing surgery.    
Note:  Any subject in which surgery has been aborted for either eye should immediately 
be discontinued from the study and an exit form completed for that subject. These 
subjects will be followed up as per the clinic standard of care, monitor ed for safety, and 
their data will be excluded from the study efficacy analysis (obtained from FDA database 
Research Results Feb, 05, 2009). All adverse events will be appropriately documented 
and reported.  
 
Participants who are considered to be a vulnera ble subject population will not be enrolled 
into the study.  Vulnerable populations include, but are not limited to, the following:

8.  STUDY DESIGN  
8.1. Study  Design  
This study is a prospective, single center, open clinical trial to  evaluate visual acuity at 
distance, intermediate and near as well as rotational stability of the Toric -ReSTOR IOL 
for 3 months after cataract surgery. Patients will be bilaterally implanted , with the Toric 
ReSTOR +2.5D model implanted in the domin ant eye and the Toric ReSTOR +3.0D 
model implanted in the non -dominant eye. Patients will self -select for multifocal 
implantation. Toric IOL calculations will be completed with the Alcon Toric calculator, 
including the Barrett adjustment for posterior corn eal asti gmatism. The default 
surgically -induced astigmatism (0.1D) will be used for all calculations.  Results from this 
study will be compared to outcomes data in the literature for the non -toric ReSTOR 
IOLs. Quality of vision will be measured using a vali dated, R asch-scored questionnaire 
and compared to data available in the literature for non -toric ReSTOR lenses.  
 
Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months 
post-operatively.  
 
Clinical evaluations will include measurement of visual acuity, manifest refraction, 
orientation of the toric ReSTOR IOL, defocus curve and quality of vision assessment . 
 
The prim ary outcome measure will be the residual refractive cylinder .  
 
Secondary out come measures are as follows:  
 
• Monocular and b inocular Uncorrected and Best -corrected distance, intermediate 
(60cm) and near (40cm) visual acuity  
 
• Postoperative orientation changes with the Toric ReSTOR IOL up to 3 months 
after surgery.  
 
• Binocular Uncorrec ted and Best -corrected defocus curve (3 month visit).  
 
• Quality of vision, measured with a subjective questionnaire.  
 
8.2. Methods  Used to Minimize Bias  
As a single -arm study there is no expected bias. Patient selection will be based on the 
patient’s interest and the surgeon’s opinion as to whether th ey are a suitable candidate for 
multifocal toric lens implantation . 
 
The measurement of visual acuity will be conducted in a systematic fashion to minimize 
bias. Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will be instructed to perform the 
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 11 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
11 
 same testing i n the same fashion for all subjects, with the same level of encouragement to 
subjects. Questions regarding quality of vision  will be asked in a similar manner to all 
patients.  
 
9.  STUDY PROCEDURE   
9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  
No subject wi ll be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and does not sign the curr ent approved informed consent document. Informed 
consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signed 
documents w ill be maintained by the investigator as a permanent part of the subject's 
medical records. A signed copy w ill be provided to the subject.  
 
Subjects will each receive  a discount on their surgery ($2,000 down to $900) as well as  
$300 if they attend the 3 -month visit.  
 9.2. Surgery Procedures  
Following a full diagnostic examination (history, visual acuity, refraction, slit -lamp 
exam, fundus exam, topography, biometry, OCT of macula), patients who meet criteria 
can be admitted to the study.  Preoperative pho tographs at the Verion will be taken f or 
blood vessel axis alignment indicators.  The patient will be brought the operating room 
where standard phacoemulsification and IOL implantation will be performed.  At the end 
of the procedure, a microscope photograp h will be taken to document the orient ation of 
the IOL.   
9.3. Visits and Examinations  
Subjects will participate in six study visits. Visits will include an uptake visit, two 
operative visit s (one for each eye ), and 6 posto perative visits (Visit numbers 3 , 3A, 4, 4A, 
5 and 6 below).  The visi t schedule, complete with window and associated CRF forms, 
are displayed in Table 9.3 -1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be 
conducted, are provided below.

 All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs). All 
site personnel involved in the study will be trained in regard to conducting study -specific 
procedures . Case report forms will be identified by the subject number assigned at the 
time of randomization.  No protected health information ( PHI) will be included on any 
CRF.  Subject identities will be removed at the initial visit so that there will be  no further 
need to protect or destroy the information.  
 
9.3.1. Preoperative  
 
The subject will complete an information and consent document. Inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be applied to determine  qualification for the stu dy.  
 
A medical history will be taken and exams will include the tests described below:  
▪ manifest refraction,  
▪ visual acuity,  
▪ Preoperative photographs at the Verion  will be taken for blood vessel axis 
alignment indicators  
 
In addition, all site -specific, rou tine preoperative measures will be performed .   
 
Measurements will be made as described in section 9.4  below .  
  
 
The preoperative visit is expected to take about  30-45 minutes.   
 
9.3.2. Op erative ( Surgery ) 
 
The patient will be brought the operating room w here standard  
phacoemulsification and IOL implantation will be performed.  At the end of the 
procedure, a microscope photograph will be taken to document the orie ntation of 
the IOL.   
 
Surgical findings will be recorded and any adverse events/serious adver se events 
(AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any  other 
problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   
Any subject  whose surgery is not completed successfully will be documented. 
These subjects wil l be monitored for safety but clinical performance data may be 
excluded from the analysis.  
All study subjects will be placed on an appropriate antibiotic  (Vigamox)  and 
steroid (Durezol) drop QID for one week. A non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
(Ilevro) drop  will also be applied once a day for the first two weeks.  
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 13 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
13 
 For the following three weeks, the steroid (Durezol) drop will be continued on a 
tapered dose.  
9.3.3. Postoperative 1 Day  
All routine postoperative measures will be taken. In addition, the subject w ill 
undergo VA testing in accordance with the specificatio ns below (Section 9.4).  
Intraocular pressure will also be measured.  Adverse events will be monitored.  
 
This visit is expected to take around 30 minutes to complete.   
 
9.3.4 Postoperative 1 Week  
 
All routine postoperative measures will be t aken. In addition , the subject will 
undergo VA testing in accordance with the specifications below (Section 9.4).  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will also be measured. Adverse events will be 
monitored.  
 
9.3.5. Postoper ative 1 Month

undergo manifest refraction, IOP measurement, VA testing and dilated Verion 
photographs to document the postoperative orientation of the IOL . Adverse events 
will be monitored.  
 
9.3.6. Postoperative 3 Months  
 
All routine postoperative measures will be taken. In addition, the subject will 
undergo manifest refraction, IOP measurement, VA testing and dilated Verion 
photographs to document the postoperative orientation  of the IOL. The patient’s 
quality of vision wi ll be measured using a validated, Rasch -scored questionnaire. 
A defocus curve in accordance with the specifications below (Section 9.4)  will 
also be obtained at this visit. Adverse events will be monitored.  An exit form will 
be completed.  
 
9.3.8. Exit Proc edures  
 
In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations 
should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting 
that the subject did not complete the study an d the reason for premature study 
exit.  If no premature  exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be 
completed at the end of Visit 6 ( Postoperative 3 Months ).

 9.4. Study Methods and Measurements  
All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  
Abnormalities shou ld be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section. Specific study 
examination procedures are outlined below.  
 
 9.4.1. Manifest Refraction  
Perform a manifest refraction with a high contrast logMAR chart unde r photopic 
lighting conditions (>85 cd/m2).  Document refraction results with sphere, 
cylinder and axis readings.  If uncorrected visual acuity is not improved by 
manifest refraction, use zero for sphere and cylinder and draw a line t hrough the 
blank for t he axis.  
 
Note:   Each subject should be manu ally refracted to his/her best correction by an 
ophthalmologist, optometrist, or a skilled technician using a phoropter or trial 
lenses.   
 
 9.4.2. Visual Acuity (VA)  
To obtain logMAR VA, ask subjects to begin r eading the chart at a row where all 
letters a re easily distinguishable.  Have subjects continue to read rows with 
smaller letters and encourage subjects to guess at all letters in a line if at least one 
correct response was given on the previous row.  Requ est subjects read rows until 
no letters on a row are read correctly or until all letters on a row are too 
indistinguishable to even be guessed.  
 
Perform uncorrected and best -distance corrected visual acuity testing monocular 
and binocularly.   
  
Distance V A 
Measure distance visual acuity using the 100% contrast E TDR S chart under 
photopic lighting  at a distance of 4 -6 m.   
 
Intermediate VA  
Have the subject hold  a Logarithmic ETDRS Visual Acuity Chart, “Chart 2”, at 
60cm, using the 60cm cord held at the outer  canthus as a reference . Record and 
score t he subject’s v isual acuity .   
 
Near VA  
Conduct near testing with a Logarithmic ETDRS Visual Acuity Chart , “Chart 1”  
at 40 cm, using the 40cm cord held at the outer canthus as a reference. Visual 
acuity determine d with the chart will be recorded and scored.   
 
9.4.4. Quality of vision  questionnaire  
Have the subject complete the Q of V (Quality of Vision) questionnaire. S coring  
will be through the aggregate spreadsheet provided.  
 
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 15 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
15 
 Note: Avoid interpreting survey qu estions for subjects.  That is, avoid re -phrasing 
questions if a subject asks, “What does this mean?”  
 
9.4.5. Binocular Defocus Curve  
With and without the manifest distance refraction in place in a phoropter, and in 
photopic conditions, perform binocular d efocus curve testing. An over -correction 
starting at +1.0D is placed in the phoropter and binocular VA is recorded. The 
correction is then reduce by 0.5D (i.e. +0.5 over -correction) and retested.  An 
over-correction of -4.0D is then placed in the phoropter  and removed in 0.5D 
increments, testing VA at each step. The procedure ends with VA testing with a 
0.0D over -correction (best -corrected di stance refraction). Testing may be 
conducted using proprietary computer software designed to simplify the 
procedure a nd to record results. LogMAR visual acuity will be recorded for each 
defocus step.  
 
9.5.  Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled exams may be condu cted at the discretion of the Investigator with all 
relevant information from the exam recorded in the source documen ts and on the 
Unscheduled Visit pages within the CRF booklet.  
9.6.  Discontinued Subjects  
Discontinued subjects  are those who do not have a n exit visit or who come into the office 
to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects  may be disco ntinued from 
the study at any time if, in the opinion of the investigator, their continued participation in 
the study poses a risk to their  health. The reasons for discontinuation include:  
a. Adverse event;  
b. Lost to follow -up; 
c. Subject  decision unrelated to an adverse event;  
d. Protocol violation;  
e. Treatment failure;  
f. Other.  
To ensure the safety of all subjects  who discontinue prior to Visit 6, investigators should 
assess each subject  and, if necessary, advise them of any therapies and/or medical 
procedures that migh t be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health 
and/or use of concomitant med ications should also be captured.  
 
10.  ANALYSIS PLAN  
10.1. Analysis Data Sets  
All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety. Efficac y analyses 
will be performed based on data from those eyes where uncomplicated Verion -LenSx 
guide d arcuate incisions were completed.

 10.2. Statistical Methodology  
All data will be collected by the site and entered into a spreadsheet . Subjects will be 
assig ned an ID number. Data analysis will be performed without patient identification. 
Statistical analysis will be performed using standard descriptive statistics and other tests 
as deemed appropriate based on the characteristics of the  data to be analyzed. Al l 
statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance level.   
10.3. General Statistical Considerations  
The statistical analyses will be performed using S tatistica , version 12 or higher. A ny 
statistical tests of  hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05 . 
 
11.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
Data in the literature suggests that the ReSTOR non -toric IOLs (+3.0D and +2.5D) 
implanted in a group of eligible eyes showed a residual refractive cylinder of 0 .40D ± 
0.32D. (Gundersen  KG, Potvin R. Comparison of visual outcomes and subjective visual 
quality after bilateral implantation of a diffractive trifocal intraocular lens and blended 
implantation of apodized diffractive bifocal intraocular lenses. Clin Oph thalmol. 2016 
May 10;10: 805-11). We are looking for the toric IOLs to be non -inferior. We powered 
the study using that mean and SD, a power of 0.9, an alpha of 0.05, and a 0.25D non -
inferiority margin. The mean residual refractive cylinders will be compare d using a t -test 
between  the two groups, with the mean and SD from the literature (blended bifocal 
group) and the mean and SD from the current study. The required sample size is 29 
subjects. Allowing for 10% dropout we will plan to enroll 32 subjects.   
 
12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLIC ATION OF THE STUDY

The de -identified data may be shared w ith other researchers for fut ure analysis.  
 
13.  QUALITY  COMPLAINTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events over the course of the study. A  place to 
record any adverse event is included on each case report form . 
13.1. General I nformation  
An Adverse Event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is 
administered . a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal 
relationship with the  treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended 
sign (including an  abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the study  treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an  untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, 
including run -in or washout pe riods,  even if no study treatment has been administered.  
13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any  
problems, the Investigator should inquire  about AEs by asking if the patient has any 
problems.  
13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs  
Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that 
occur  during the course of the study must be documented o n an Adverse Event Form 
(AEF). A  separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and 
symptoms  indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one 
comprehensive  event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the 
onset date, outcome,  resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (ie, severity), any 
action with study treatment  taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the 
adverse event’s relationship to the  study treatment.  
Nonserious Adve rse Events  
A nonserious AE is define d as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that 
does not  meet serious criteria noted below (eg, is not life -threatening, does not require 
hospitalization,  does not prolong a current hospitalization, is not disabling, etc.). All 
adverse events m ust be  reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study 
treatment.  
 
For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be 
collected  on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the 
study.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 18 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
18 
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the  
following criteria:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
NOTE: Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death  
from the  reaction as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have  caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires inpatient hospita lization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
NOTE: In general, hosp italization signifies that the individual remained at the 
hospital  or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment (usually involving 
an overnight stay)  that would not have been  appropriate in the physician's office 
or an out -patient setting.  Complicati ons that occur during hospitalization are AEs. 
If a complication prolongs  hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the 
event is serious. When in doubt as  to whether “hospitalization” occurred, the 
event should be considered serious.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a  
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
NOTE: The term disabil ity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct  normal l ife functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively  minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  influenza, or accidental trauma (eg, 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent  everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not  
result  in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered 
an SAE  when, ba sed upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the  definiti ons for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or 
the development of drug  dependency or drug abuse.  
All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE,  
if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the 
Medical Monitor  immediately (ie, within one  working day of the Investigator’ s or 
site’s knowledge of the event) as follows:  
o In studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for 
the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC 
system.   
o Additional information for any applicable e vent is to be reported as soon as it  
becomes available.  
 
In addition to the reporting  of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor,  the 
SAE must be  reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  
 
The investigator must document all adverse device events  (serious and nonserious  but 
related ) and all serious adverse event s (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device 
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 19 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
19 
 Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints  will also be 
documen ted.  
 
• Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious 
Adverse Event Form must be faxed immed iately to the study coordinator at  
1-716-442-5110 or emailed to rick@scienceinvision.com .   
• Additional relevant information is to be rep orted as soon as it becomes 
available.

Further, depending upon the nature of the adverse event (serious or nonserious) or quality 
complaint  being reported, the study sponso r may request copies of applicable portions of 
the subject’s medical records.  The investigator must also report all advers e events and 
quality complaints  according to the  relevant  IRB requirements.  
 
12.3.1 Intensity and Causality Assessments  
For every ad verse event and quality complaint , the investigator must assess the 
causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation. An 
assessment of causal ity will also be performed by the Medical Monitor utilizing 
the same definitions, as s hown below:  
 
Causality  
Related  An adverse event or quality complaint  classified as related may be 
either defini tely related or possibly related where a direct cause 
and effect relationship with the medical device has not been 
demonstrated, but there is a r easonable possibility that the adverse 
event or quality complaint  was caused by the medical device.  
 
 
Not Relat ed An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may 
either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., 
there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality 
complaint ). 
 
ReSTOR Toric Protocol  Page 20 of 23 
v 1.0   8/20/2018  
 
20 
 Where appropriate, the investigat or must assess the intensity (severity) of the 
adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with 
consideration of any sub jective symptom(s), as defined below:  
 
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily 
tolerate the sign or symptom.  
Moderate  An adverse event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in 
discomfort significan t enough to cause interference with the 
subject’s usual activities.  
Severe  An adverse event is sev ere if the sign or symptom is incapacitating 
and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their 
usual activities.  
 
The investigator must docume nt any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, 
or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse  event or quality complaint  when 
applicable.  
13.4. Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints  
The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe me dical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevan t follow -up procedures 
are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow -up procedures 
must be documen ted and available to the study coor dinator  who, with the Medical 
Monitor,  will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.  
 
13.5. Safety Analyses  
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be 
tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summ arized for events that were considered  
treatment -related.   
 
14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), 
including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, con sistent with 
the 1996 version of the D eclaration of Helsinki.  In addition, all applicable local, state 
and federal requirements will be adhered to.  
 
This study is to be conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board regulations.  
The investigator  will obtain appropriate IRB /ethics co mmittee  approval prior to initiating 
the study.  
 
The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov .

No protected health  information ( PHI), including the patient’s name and date of birth , 
will be collected;  to ensure this, n o PHI information is permitted to be entered on any of 
the Case Report Forms (CRFs) . Subjects will only be identified by subject IDs and 
identities will  be removed at the initial visit so that there is no further need to protect or 
destroy the information. Collected i nformation will only be used for purposes of this 
study and no information will be sold to third parties. The non -PHI information collected 
may be used for future research, though there is currently no  plan to do so.

 17. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE INFORMATION/STUDY RELATED 
INJURIES  
Every effort to prevent study -related injury will be taken by the Study Doctor and staff. 
In the event a patient is  injured as a direct result of the study while following the  Study 
Doctor’s instructions and the study requirements, the patient will be inst ructed to contact 
his or her doctor immediately . The Study Doctor is to treat the injured subject as needed 
for those injuries caused directly by this research study. In the e vent of injury or illness 
caused by or occurring during a subject’s  participation  in this research study, all charges 
for medical care provided to the subject  will be billed to his or her  insurance company. 
The Study Doctor or Sponsor does not offer to cov er the medical care costs for injuries or 
illnesses that are not caused directly by the research study. The Sponsor does not offer to 
provide any other compensation, unless specifically agreed to elsewhere in this 
document.  This information will be  provide d to each study subject before the start of the 
study  in the consent form . 
 
18. STUDY ENDPOINT CRITERIA  
18.1. Patient Completion of Study  
If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 6) of the study, he/she is considered 
to have completed the s tudy.  
 18.2. Patient Discontinuation  
Each study patient may voluntarily discont inue the study at any time they choose.  Study 
patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., non -compliance, 
failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) w ill be discontinued from the study.  Study patients 
discontinued during the enrol lment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be replaced.  
 18.3. Patient Termination  
A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe adverse event 
that may be related to the study.  A study patient will receive appropriate  treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Notification of termination will be clearly documented.  
These study patients are considered to have completed the study and  will not be replaced.  
  
18.4. Study Termination  
The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, after clinical 
observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he may 
stop the study.  
  
18.5. Study Completion  
The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit 5 or have 
been terminated from the study.

19. SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS  
19.1. Summary of risks  
 
The femtosecond laser system to be used in this study is ap proved for corneal incisions, 
either full thicknes s or partial thickness , at the time of cataract surgery. The current study 
involves creating partial thickness arcuate incisions at a time after cataract surgery.  
The most common side effects of arcuate in cisions  include:  
• Irregular astigmatism  
• Regression, where the effects of the incision(s) are lower over time  
 
19.2. Summary of benefits  
For patients undergoing cataract surgery, they may be offered the option to have a 
femtosecond laser system create arcuat e incisions on the cornea, with the goa l of 
reducing corneal astigmatism (and, by extension, postoperative refractive astigmatism)  at 
the time of surgery .  
It is likely that corneal incisions made with a femtosecond laser system will reduce 
corneal astigma tism, even when applied after successfu l cataract surgery.  
The potential benefit related to the current study is that this procedure could be offered to 
patients who have had cataract surgery in the past and who have residual refractive 
astigmatism  with a  minimal spherical equivalent refractio n after surgery .

2.  ABSTRACT    65 
 66 
Tinnitus and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are two of the most common combat -related disorders. Although the 67 
defining symptoms of tinnitus (an illusory auditory percept) and PTSD (a trauma -related disorder) are clearly different, they 68 
are highly com orbid. Neurobiologically, each disorder has been characterized as functional network dysregulations, applying 69 
functional co -variance (FCov) metrics to resting -state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs -fMRI). In PTSD, network 70 
abnormalities have been r eported in the attention, limbic and default -mode networks. In tinnitus, the same networks have 71 
been reported as abnormal, with the addition of the auditory network. Given the hypothesized shared neurobiological resting 72 
state networks between tinnitus and PTSD, it is anticipated that treatment of PTSD will also help alleviate tinnitus distress.  73 
 74 
The purpose of this study is  to characterize tinnitus and PTSD symptomatically, neurobiologically, and causally, applying 75 
causal modeling to psychometric and neurofunctional data. We will enroll 30 individuals with both tinnitus and PTSD. 76 
Participants will be asked to complete baseli ne assessments of subjective tinnitus distress, PTSD, depression, and resting- 77 
state fMRI at baseline. Individuals with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD who are eligible for the study will receive Cognitive 78 
Processing Therapy (CPT) over a 6-  to 15- week period and a mid -treatment resting- state fMRI (after Session 6 of CPT and 79 
before Session 7 of CPT) . CPT is a trauma -focused treatment for PTSD that guides individuals on how to recognize and 80 
challenge thoughts that are erroneous and dysfunctional. One- month follow -up assessments of tinnitus -related distress, 81 
PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be conducted, along with resting- state fMRI.  82 
 83 
3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS  84 
 85 
Objective:  86 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overlap between tinnitus -related distress and symptoms of PTSD, 87 
identify functional covariance among resting- state networks among individuals with tinnitus and PTSD, and determine 88 
psychometric and neurobiological changes among participants who receive Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT for 89 
PTSD).  90 
 91 
Aim 1 : To identify the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms that are both shared and unique to PTSD and 92 
tinnitus -related distress.  93 
 94 
Hypothesis  1: There will be significant overlap between tinnitus distress and PTSD sympt oms, as measured by the 95 
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS- 5), the PTSD Checklist for DSM -5 (PCL -5), the Tinnitus Functional 96

 Index (TFI), and Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ). Findings will help clinicians’ understanding of the distin ct ways 97 
in which each disorder contributes to functional impairment. Results will substantially improve clinicians’ ability to 98 
conceptualize patients with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD.  99 
 100 
Aim 2 : To identify the functional covariance among resting- state network s, including the limbic, attentional, auditory, and 101 
default -mode networks associated with tinnitus and PTSD. Resting state fMRI techniques will be conducted among 102 
individuals with comorbid PTSD and tinnitus.  103 
 104 
Hypothesis  2: There will be similar neurologic al activity associated with PTSD and tinnitus as measured by resting state 105 
fMRI. Down -regulation and up- regulation of neurobiological connectivity of the networks will be examined within the 106 
auditory, limbic, default -mode, and attentional networks. Results  will provide insight concerning the neurological 107 
maintenance factors for both disorders. Study findings will be utilized to generate new and innovative therapeutic 108 
approaches that target specific brain regions to alleviate tinnitus and PTSD.  109 
 110 
Aim 3 : To determine relationships psychometrically, neurobiologically (as rs -fMRI network differences), and conjointly 111 
(between psychometrics and rs -fMRI). Longitudinal measures will determine both psychometric and neurobiological 112 
changes among participants who comple te Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD (CPT for PTSD) . 113 
 114 
Hypothesis 3 :  115 
 Individuals with tinnitus and PTSD who received Cognitive Processing Therapy will demonstrate significant 116 
reductions in both PTSD symptoms and tinnitus -related distress at a one- month follow -up assessment. This study 117 
will be the first to demonstrate the im portance of addressing PTSD in order to target tinnitus -related distress.  118 
 After one month of completing  CPT for individuals with both PTSD and tinnitus, a decrease in neurobiological 119 
connectivity will be demonstrated between the attention network and limbic network, demonstrating the role of 120 
cognitive control in reducing psychological distress.  121 
 122 
4. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE .   123 
 124 
Tinnitus and PTSD  125 
 126 
The genesis of tinnitus and PTSD can both be potentially associated to the same psychological and acoustic traumatic 127 
event while deployed, with clinical implications concerning the recovery of both auditory and psychological disorders. 128 
Tinnitus can be conceptualized as one such conditioned stimulus, continuing to serve as a reminder of the traumatic event 129 
(Criterion B of PTSD). In a study of Cambodian refugees, significantly more participants with PTSD had tinnitus compared 130 
to participants without tinnitus (Hinton, Chhean, Pich, Hofmann, & Barlow, 2006). Tinnitus patients were significantly more 131 
likely to have P TSD compared to participants without tinnitus. In the same study, most participants with tinnitus indicated 132 
experiencing flashbacks and an overwhelming 91.7% of those flashbacks accompanied tinnitus. Second, symptoms of 133 
avoidance (Criterion C of PTSD) are also demonstrated among individuals with tinnitus. Fagelson (2007) found similarities 134 
in avoidant symptoms between veterans with both tinnitus and PTSD; and those with only tinnitus.  Individuals in both 135 
groups reported similar aversions to loud warning si gnals and a reduction in tolerance to loud noises. Andersson and 136 
Westin (2008) explain that individuals may choose to avoid noise and seek quieter places. Third, negative alterations in 137 
mood and cognition (Criterion D of PTSD) are observed among individual s with tinnitus. Tinnitus -associated trauma recall 138 
and catastrophic cognitions significantly predicted PTSD severity, while controlling for tinnitus severity, among Cambodian 139 
refugees suffering from both tinnitus and PTSD (Hinton et al., 2006). Fourth, individuals with tinnitus demonstrate 140 
emotional reactions that overlap with hypervigilance or hyperarousal (Criterion E of PTSD). Fagelson and Smith (2016) 141 
found that individuals with tinnitus and PTSD had significantly more negative emotional responses compa red to 142 
individuals with tinnitus only and those with tinnitus and other psychological problems. These emotional reactions are 143 
similar to hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., anger, irritability, nervousness). Fagelson (2007) indicated that sleep disturbance 144 
is als o a symptom of hypervigilance observed in tinnitus patients (McKenna, 2000). These studies suggest the synergistic 145 
effects between the audiologic disorder and PTSD, suggesting common etiologies and symptom presentation.  146 
 147 
Few studies have examined the neuro biological contributions of the auditory network among PTSD patients. Researchers 148 
have noticed that PTSD patients are more sensitive to auditory sounds associated with trauma than linguistic associations 149 
(van der Kolk, 1997). Paige et al. (1990) suggested that PTSD patients inhibit stimulation that could overload their 150

 capacity for accurate discrimination, and other studies have shown cortical abnormalities of auditory processing among 151 
patients with PTSD (Lewine, 1997). Overall, it is proposed that individuals with tinnitus and PTSD 1) fail to adequately 152 
distinguish between threat and non- threat sounds, resulting in hyperarousal, hypervigilance, avoidance of activities, and 153 
abnormalities can be observed  within the auditory cortex; 2) fail to accurately interpret their traumatic event and current - 154 
day events, resulting in changes in cognition and mood, feeling distant or cut off from others, lack of ability to find pleas ure 155 
in activities, and reexperiencing symptoms, and decreased activation within the executi ve control network can be 156 
observed; 3) failure to discriminate threat versus non -threat and accurate interpretation of the traumatic event and current 157 
day events will result in an increased activation within the limbic system, resulting in an inability to regulate emotional 158 
experiences, hyperreactivity to non- threat related cues, and lack of experiencing positive emotions.  159 
 160 
Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that individuals with tinnitus show increased activation in brain regions also 161 
common in psychiatric conditions (Bartels et al., 2007; Landgrebe et al., 2009; Møller, 2011). Imaging studies have 162 
implicated the auditory network, limbic network, default mode network, visual network, and dorsal attention and executive 163 
control of attention networks among patients with tinnitus (Figure 4). Similar networks are observed among individuals 164 
with PTSD, including the default mode network and central executive network.  165 
 166 
Treatment of PTSD  167 
 168 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) . CPT is a cognitive behavioral treatment  for PTSD consisting of 12 one- hour 169 
sessions (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 20 17; Resick & Schnicke, 1993). CPT is delivered in three phases: education, 170 
processing, and challenging. The manualized treatment focuses on challenging beliefs and assumptions related to the 171 
trauma, oneself, and the world. Randomized clinical trials conducted by Dr. Resick of our STRONG STAR Consortium 172 
and others support CPT as an effective treatment for PTSD and other comorbid conditions in a variety of civilian trauma 173 
populations. Initial randomized clinical trials using wait -list comparisons found that CPT was effective for treating PTSD in 174 
sexual abuse survivors (Resick & Schnicke, 1992; Chard, 2005) and incarcerated males (Ahrens & Rexford, 2002). A 175 
large randomized controlled trial (N=171) compared CPT, Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, and a minimal -attention 176 
control group (Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002). At post -treatment, 80% of the participants treated with 177 
either CPT or PE achieved remission and no longer met cr iteria for PTSD. These treatment gains were maintained over 178 
the 9- month posttreatment follow -up period. Furthermore, these same participants were again assessed approximately 6 179 
years later, and about 80% of the participants in each group continued to do well and no longer met criteria for PTSD 180 
(Resick et al., 2012). Also, 89% of the patients treated with CPT improved by at least 20 points, a clinically significant 181 
improvement, on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al. 1995).  182 
 183 
Resick and c olleagues also conducted a dismantling study (N=150) comparing the full CPT protocol to a cognitive therapy 184 
only condition (CPT -C) and a condition comprised only of the written accounts of the trauma (Resick, Galovski, et al., 185 
2008). Each condition consist ed of 2 hours of therapy per week for 6 weeks, and blind assessments were conducted 186 
before treatment, 2 weeks following the last session, and 6 months following treatment. Intent -to-treat analyses indicated 187 
that patients in all three treatment conditions i mproved substantially on PTSD and depression. Patients also improved on 188 
other indices of adjustment such as anxiety, anger, shame, guilt, and dysfunctional cognitions. However, there were 189 
significant group differences in symptom reduction during the course of treatment whereby the CPT -C condition reported 190 
greater improvement in PTSD than the written account condition and demonstrated more rapid clinical improvement than 191 
the full CPT condition. The cognitive- only version (CPT -C) was equally effective to the full version of CPT and was 192 
perhaps more efficient. This study will use the CPT -C version of the protocol, now re -branded as CPT (Resick, Monson, & 193 
Chard, 2017).  194 
 195 
Treatment of PTSD and Implications for Tinnitus  196 
This study will be the first to characterize tinnitus and PTSD independently and comorbidly, before and after treatment in 197 
terms of overt cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptom profiles and connectivity between resting- state networks. A 198 
greater understanding of the shared and unique cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms between tinnitus and 199 
PTSD is the first step toward the long- term goal of recognizing the bidirectional relationship between tinnitus and PTSD. 200 
The second long- term goal is to use identify the functional covariance among r esting -state networks, including the limbic, 201 
attentional, auditory, and default mode networks associated with tinnitus and PTSD by using resting -state fMRI 202 
techniques among individuals with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD. This study will be the first to identi fy common functional 203 
covariance among relevant resting -state networks implicated in both tinnitus and PTSD. The third long -term goal is to 204

 determine relationships psychometrically, neurobiologically (pre -post treatment), and conjointly between psychometric s 205 
and rs -fMRI). For co -morbid PTSD/tinnitus, we will use longitudinal measures to examine changes in resting- state 206 
networks. Individuals with both tinnitus and PTSD, who participate in fMRI imaging, will receive Cognitive Processing 207 
Therapy (CPT) for PTSD and post -treatment fMRI imaging will be conducted. It is hypothesized that the attention, default - 208 
mode, and limbic resting- state networks will be altered from participants’ baseline fMRI, decreasing the awareness of 209 
tinnitus sensation, and improving functi onal outcomes.  210 
 211 
 212 
5.  RESEARCH DESIGN   213 
The study will use a one- way experimental design, with one level of intervention: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). 214 
Participants will complete initial baseline assessments to determine eligibility, as well as resting- state fMRI scans. After 215 
completing baseline assessments and fMRI scans, participants will be scheduled 1 therapy session to discuss 216 
psychosocial history, trauma, and current functioning, which will last approximately 1 hour. Afterwards, participants will be 217 
scheduled for 12 50– minute sessions of CPT, either once or twice per week, for 6 to 15 weeks. After completing Session 218 
6 of CPT and before Session 7 of CPT, participants will be scheduled for a mid- treatment fMRI scan. After completing 219 
CPT, participants  will be scheduled for a one-month follow -up assessment, as well as a one-month follow -up fMRI scan.  220

 270 
6.1.4. Description of the Recruitment and Prescreening Process .   271 
 272 
The study will be conducted in collaboration with the STRONG STAR Multidisciplinary PTSD Research Consortium.  273 
Primarily potential participants will self -refer to the study.  General announcements and flyers will be posted on publi c 274 
media and at various community sites that will allow self -referral of Veterans. Potential participants may also self -refer in 275 
response to recruitment information on the STRONG STAR website.  Potential participants may contact STRONG STAR 276 
if they feel tha t they are eligible. In addition to self -referral recruitment study staff will work closely with staff at hospital 277 
clinics (Mental Health Clinics, Substance Abuse Treatment Clinics, Primary Care Clinics, Audiology Clinics) and Veteran 278 
advocacy groups, whic h have been found to be reliable and productive sources of participants.  Referring providers and 279 
staff can give their patients contact information for the study staff so that interested individuals may contact STRONG 280 
STAR directly. Providers can also obtain consent to contact from interested individuals so that study staff can contact 281 
them directly about study participation.  In addition, there may be events where information about STRONG STAR studies 282

 is provided and those interested may fill out a “consen t to contact” form indicating that they would like a member of the 283 
research team to contact them at a later date to learn more about the study and schedule or complete pre- screening.   284 
Under an IRB approved HIPAA Waiver of Authorization, we will also review  the STRONG STAR 285 
records of previous STRONG STAR and CAP study participants who met criteria for PTSD and 286 
indicated they suffered from tinnitus.  Protected health information (PHI) from baseline assessments, 287 
such as scores on the CAPS -5 and Tinnitus Functi onal Index, will be used to determine 288 
appropriateness for the study.  A member of the research team will contact by telephone i ndividuals 289 
who appear to be appropriate for the study . Potential participants who are interested in the study  will 290 
complete a pre- screening questionnaire over the phone.  291 
 292 
Under an IRB approved HIPAA Waiver of Authorization, Alteration of Informed Consent, and Waiver of Documentation of 293 
Informed Consent, study personnel will conduct a brief telephone  pre -screening where the basic st udy inclusion and 294 
exclusion criteria will be reviewed to help the individual determine if he or she meets the study criteria or has obvious 295 
exclusions from the study protocol so as to prevent individuals from making unnecessary travel for consent and more in-depth 296 
screening (see Appendix C).  This information will be entered into a secure database as a phone call to a potential participant 297 
or a phone call from a potential participant: name, phone number, name of study the caller is interested in, referral d ate, 298 
referral source, potential eligibility status, reason if not eligible, and verbal permission to contact the caller in the fut ure for 299 
other studies. We will also record the date and time of the call, outcome of the call, and any notes.  Subjects who pr esent at 300 
the Northwest Center will also be shown a video that explains the step- by-step MRI procedures to ensure that they are 301 
comfortable with scanning (Appendix D is the video to be shown, minutes 2:22 to 3:39). Appendix E is the script of this 302 
segment of the video. Subjects who agree to study participation will sign a consent document before any further screening will 303 
take place.  Any individually identifiable information and Protected Health Information (PHI) collected on individuals who do 304 
not consent to participation will not become part of the research data.  If participants agree to participate in the research, the 305 
identifiable data collected will become part of the participants’ research records and will be stored according to the resear ch 306 
confident iality plan.   307 
   308 
Veterans who phone screen out from other IRB -approved STRONG STAR protocols will be offered the opportunity to be 309 
phone screened for participation in this study.  If interested, a member of the research team will review eligibility with t hese 310 
potential participants (e.g., pre -screen) over the phone.  If the person believes they may qualify for the study, the participant 311 
will be scheduled for an appointment in which consent will be obtained, and if authorized, the baseline assessment will b e 312 
completed. If not interested or Veterans who phone screen out from this study, Veterans will be offered the opportunity to be 313 
phone screened for participation in other IRB -approved STRONG STAR protocols.   314 
 315 
6.1.5. Consent Process .  316 
Potential participants  will have the study explained to them in a safe and private location in person.  The potential 317 
participant will be given a copy of the informed consent document (ICD) to read.  The research team member obtaining 318 
informed consent will then engage the potential participant in an interactive explanation of the study guided by the ICD.  319 
After the subject has read the ICD, he or she will be given the opportunity to consider participation and discuss the 320 
research with family and friends.  The Research Team will be available to answer any questions about the research.  321 
Once the potential participant has reached a decision, the advising staff member will review  the risks and benefits of study 322 
participation and ensure the subject has an understanding of the material  discussed, and the risks and benefits of their 323 
potential involvement in the study.  The advising staff member will have the participant sign the consent form.  A copy of 324 
the signed ICD will be given to the subject.  325 
 326 
6.1.6. Subject Screening Procedures . 327 
Following consent, screening and baseline assessment will take place to determine participant eligibility.  The entire 328 
screening process will take approximately 3 hours.  This will include the completion of the questionnaires and interviews 329 
outlined in the t able in Section 6. 2 below. For individuals not meeting study inclusion criteria, the Study Staff will assist 330 
coordinating appropriate care outside of the study.  331 
 332 
6.1.7. Compensation for participation .   333 
Participants will be compensated $75 for each neuroi maging scan: once prior to enrolling in Cognitive Processing 334 
Therapy, once at mid- treatment (after Session 6 and before Session 7), and once at the one-month follow -up after 335

 receiving Cognitive Processing Therapy.  Payment will be provided via a rechargeable MasterCard® ClinCard. The 336 
MasterCard® ClinCard is a debit card issued to the study participant.  Funds are loaded onto card through the ClinCard 337 
website at www.clincard.com.  Only authorized users will be able to access the ClinCard website to add funds with a 338 
username and password.  The ClinCard funds will be available to recipients within 1 business day and can be used as the 339 
participant chooses.  The participant will be notified that their name, address and dat e of birth will be shared with a third- 340 
party (ClinCard) solely for the purposes of payment processing.  This information will only be used for the administration 341 
of the payment and will be kept strictly confidential.   342 
 343 
6.1.8. Treatment Procedures.    344 
This study will examine the effectiveness of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for the alleviation of PTSD and tinnitus - 345 
related distress among individuals with co- morbid PTSD and tinnitus.  346 
 347 
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).  Prior to engaging in therapy, one session will be devoted to gathering 348 
information regarding psychosocial history, trauma, and current functioning. During the first session, a brief explanation of 349 
the connection between tinnitus and PTSD will be provided for the participants, to inc rease motivation and understanding 350 
of the treatment (Appendix F). The following sessions will follow the standard outpatient CPT protocol. The standard 351 
outpatient CPT (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2017) consists of 12 one- hour sessions conducted over a 6-  to 12- week period 352 
(Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2008). An additional 3 weeks will be provided in case of participant and therapist vacation 353 
and/or sick days. Participants will be considered treatment completers if they attended at least 75% of the full 12- session 354 
protocol (9 sessions). The three phases of CPT include psychoeducation, processing, and challenging beliefs and 355 
assumptions related to the trauma, oneself, and the world. CPT begins with an impact statement in which the patient 356 
describes why he or she thinks the index (worst trauma) happened, the impact of the trauma on his or her perspective of 357 
self, others, and the world. The impact statement helps to identify maladaptive cognitions about the trauma, such as “it’s 358 
all my fault” and “I can’t trust anyone.” These cognitions can emerge when a traumatic experience does not make sense 359 
in the context of previous beliefs. Throughout therapy, problematic cognitions are identified and challenged through 360 
Socratic questioning until more accurate beliefs about self, others, and the world replace any distorted cognitions. The last  361 
five sessions of CPT focus on cognitions related to specific topics that ar e often particularly problematic in PTSD, 362 
including safety, trust, power, esteem, and intimacy. CPT is based on cognitive theory in which traumatic events are 363 
inconsistent with prior positive beliefs or seemingly confirm negative beliefs. Because people tend to hold just world 364 
beliefs, they have difficulty reconciling events that appear to be unfair or random. People also tend to blame themselves 365 
for events or try to mentally “undo” the event and feel guilt, shame or anger, rather than the natural emotions that may 366 
have emanated directly from the event (sadness/grief, fear, horror) (Resick, Galovski, et al., 2008).  All study participants  367 
will receive treatment with CPT, as it is typically conducted in the VA or another clinic, face- to-face. The patient will  be 368 
seen either once or twice a week in the clinic office and the therapist will follow the protocol as specified in the manual.  369 
The patient will be given assignments that will be placed into a patient binder for them to keep.  However, the therapist wil l 370 
also keep a folder with a copy of the stuck point log and extra copies of worksheets in case the patient forgets to bring the 371 
binder to the session.  372 
 373 
Training, Certification, and Supervision of CPT Therapists  374 
A detailed CPT training, certification, and supervision process has been developed to ensure that CPT is delivered 375 
according to protocol and with the highest levels of quality and fidelity. The Principal Investigator (John Moring, PhD) is a 376 
licensed clinical psychologist with extensive training and consultation provided by one of the developers of CPT, Dr. 377 
Patricia Resick. Dr. Resick, Consultant on this research study, will provide consultation on an as -needed basis.   378 
 379 
Treatment Adherence and Competence. The fidelity to the treatment will be closely monitored to ensure that the 380 
therapy is being delivered true to the protocol.  Treatment adherence and competence will be determined by independent 381 
raters who are not otherwise involved in the project. The raters will be affiliated STRONG STAR investigators who have 382 
served on prior CPT studies as adherence and competence raters. In order to ensure that the CPT treatment is 383 
administered in accordance with the manual, all sessions in the study will be audio recorded for fidelity rating. Audio 384 
recordings will be uploaded onto the secure STRONG STAR server so they can be reviewed remotely. The raters will 385 
determine adherence to the CPT therapies and competence in delivering the therapies. Five percent of all audiotapes for 386

6.3.2 Data Collection.   393 
 394 
6.3.2.1 Instrumentation:   395 
See the table at Section 6.2 above for a summary of the assessments and timing of administration.  A description of each of 396 
the assessments can be found at the end of this protocol.  Assessments will be administered in person whenever possible.  397 
However, in order  to accommodate participant schedules and/or instances in which a participant does not reside in the local 398 
area at the time of a follow up assessment, we may collect full or partial assessments in person or via phone.  Reasonable 399 
efforts will be made to collect all data as described in this protocol, but we expect some participants may not be able to 400 
complete part or all of any given follow up assessment.  401 
 402 
6.3.2.2. Resting state fMRI.  403 
Participants who are eligible to continue in the study after consent and screening will undergo a function magnetic resonance 404 
imaging (MRI) session at the Research Imaging Institute (RII) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San 405 
Antonio.  Pa rticipants who cannot tolerate the MRI procedure will be withdrawn from the study.  Participants will receive a mid- 406 
treatment scan (after Session 6 of CPT and before Session 7 of CPT), and a follow -up fMRI scan one month after completing 407 
therapy.  Each MRI  scan may take up to 2 hours.  408 
 409 
6.3.2.3 Data Storage and Access:   410 
Data will be coded using an assigned number. Paper research data will be kept in locked file cabinets in locked offices at 411 
the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA) STRONG STAR offices.  Data collected will be 412 
entered into a spreadsheet located on a secure STRONG STAR server .  Audio -recordings will be uploaded to a secure 413 
STRONG STAR server over an encrypted network connection.  Neuroimaging data will be kept on secur e networks at the 414 
Research Imaging Institute. Every member of the Research Team will be trained and monitored about how to handle and 415 
protect both medical and research records.  Furthermore, the Research Team strictly controls access to study data using 416 
policies and procedures developed specifically for the STRONG STAR Research Consortium.  417

6.4.2 Primary (i.e., primary outcome variables) and secondary endpoints.  434 
 435 
Primary outcomes include changes in scores on measures of PTSD (CAPS -5 and PCL -5) and tinnitus -related distress (TFI 436 
and TAQ). The additional primary outcome is changes in functional activity within resting- state networks, provided by fMRI 437 
scans.  438 
 439 
Secondary outcome variables include changes in scores on measures of depression and suicide (DSSI -SS; PHQ -9), anxiety 440 
(GAD -7), sleep impairment (PROMIS; ISS; STOP), general health and functioning (VR -12; BIPF), and alcohol and substance 441 
use (FTND; FTND -ST; AUDIT).  442 
 443 
 444 
 445 
 446 
6.4.3 Hypotheses and Specific Data A nalysis Plans .  447 
 448 
Hypothesis 1: There will be significant overlap between tinnitus distress and PTSD symptoms, as measured by the 449 
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS- 5), the PTSD Checklist for DSM -5 (PCL -5), the Tinnitus Functional 450 
Index (TFI), and Tinnitus Ac ceptance Questionnaire (TAQ). Findings will help clinicians’ understanding of the distinct ways 451 
in which each disorder contributes to functional impairment. Results will substantially improve clinicians’ ability to 452 
conceptualize patients with comorbid tinn itus and PTSD.  453 
Analysis plan:  Non- inferential statistics will be calculated to include central tendencies, standard deviations, and 454 
alpha coefficients. Unusual distributions, missing data, or outliers will be identified. PTSD symptom cluster 455 
severity (intr usions, avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and hyperarousal) will be calculated 456 
using the data gathered from the CAPS -5. Tinnitus domains of distress will be calculated using the data gathered 457 
from the Tinnitus Functional Index. Pearson product -moment correlation coefficient analyses will be used to 458 
examine the overlap between tinnitus and PTSD.  459 
 460 
Hypothesis 2: There will be similar neurological activity associated with PTSD and tinnitus as measured by resting state 461 
fMRI. Down -regulation and up- regulation of neurobiological connectivity of the networks will be examined within the 462 
auditory, limbic, default -mode, and attentional networks. Results will provide insight concerning the neurological 463 
maintenance factors for both disorders. Study f indings will be utilized to generate new and innovative therapeutic 464 
approaches that target specific brain regions to alleviate tinnitus and PTSD.  465 
Analysis plan:  An inter -regional connectivity mapping using an extended time -series (typically 200- 400 whole- 466 
brain volumes acquired over 8- 15 minutes) of BOLD fMRI images acquired in an unstimulated state (Biswal et al., 467 
1995; Xiong et al., 1999) will be utilized for Aim 2. Inter -connected regions show temporally correlated variations, 468 
allowing connectivity to be detected and quantified. Resting -state networks (RSNs) have been used to map 469 
scores of functional systems. They are now viewed as reflecting the intrinsic architecture of the brain (Smith et al. 470 
2009). Resting -state connectivity analysis of the auditory sy stem in normal subjects demonstrated highly coherent 471 
within -system connectivity, as well as strong projections to the frontal limbic circuitry (Hunter et al., 2006). 472 
Resting -state connectivity analyses will be used to characterize tinnitus -related network abnormalities.  473

  Individuals with tinnitus and PTSD who received Cognitive Processing Therapy will demonstrate significant 476 
reductions in both PTSD symptoms and tinnitus -related distress at a one- month follow -up assessment, AND  477 
 After one month of completing  CPT for individuals with both PTSD and tinnitus, a decrease in neurobiological 478 
connectivity will be demonstrated between the attention network and limbic network, demonstrating the role of 479 
cognitive control in reducing psychological distress . 480 
Analysis plan:  Post-treatment outcome data will be compared to participants’ baseline measures of tinnitus -related 481 
distress and PTSD. Data will be analyzed using a general linear mixed (GLM) model with baseline scores of tinnitus - 482 
related distress used as  a covariate. The analyses will demonstrate whether individuals who received CPT 483 
experienced a reduction in tinnitus -related distress and PTSD symptoms.  484 
 485 
An inter -regional connectivity mapping using an extended time- series (typically 200- 400 whole -brain volumes 486 
acquired over 8- 15 minutes) of BOLD fMRI images acquired in an unstimulated state will be utilized for Aim 3. 487 
Resting -state connectivity analyses will be used to better characterize tinnitus -related network abnormalities using 488 
Independent Components Analysis, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing Baseline versus Posttreatment 489 
factors, while regressing out demographic variables.  The mid -treatment scan will be used to infer causal effects of 490 
Cognitive Processing Therapy by demonstrating the tempo ral changes in resting -state networks.  491 
 492 
Missing data.  If missing data can be assumed to be missing at random, likelihood- based mixed model analysis will 493 
provide valid inferences using data from all cases with any outcome data. The impact of attrition on analyses will be 494 
addressed by comparing those who are available for analysis at each assessment with those who are not using 495 
appropriate data from prior assessments.  496 
 497 
6.7 Confidentiality.   All in -person therapy sessions and interview assessments will be delivered in private offices at the 498 
STRONG STAR Clinic at the UTHSCSA.  Data will be stored by an assigned participant code number.  Digital audio 499 
recordings of assessments and CPT sessions will be labeled with the participant’s study id number and uploaded onto the 500 
secure STRONG STAR server. Encrypted email will be used to securely send recordings to research experts who are part 501 
of the research team for review of fidelity.   Every member of the Research Team will be trained and monitored about how 502 
to handle and protect both medical and research records.  Furthermore, the Research Team strictly controls access to 503 
study data.   504 
 505 
6.7.1 Certificate of Confidentiality.    506 
We are not seeking a Certificate of Confidentiality.  507 
 508 
6.7.2. Data Protection.   Data will be coded using an assigned number. Assessments and data collected during the 509 
treatment sessions will be stored in a locked cabinet at the STRONG STAR Clinic at the UTHSCSA.   Digital audio 510 
recordings of assessments and CPT sessions will be labeled with the participant’s study id number and uploaded onto the 511 
secure STRONG STAR server.   All UTHSCSA STRONG STAR network connectivity is segmented with Access Control 512 
Lists and is not accessible to any other UTHSCSA network segments. STRONG STAR data server is physically located at 513 
the Advanced Data Center (ADC)  has 24x7 onsite security, card key , biometric  access controls and video surveillance. 514 
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Ant onio (UTHSCSA) ADC  facility also maintains Gen 2 firewall devices 515 
to protect and prohibit any unauthorized access to UTHSCSA data. All UTHSCSA network devices are monitored by state 516 
of the art monitoring applications that include configuration audit, manag ement, and availability 24x7.   517

 522 
Risks and Side Effects related to Cognitive Processing Therapy  523 
Likely, but not Serious, expected to occur in more than 20 out of 100 participants:  524 
• Emotional distress or experiencing an initial increase of PTSD symptoms due to the discussion of traumatic 525 
events. However, in past research conducted by STRONG STAR investigators using CPT -C, there have been no 526 
serious adverse events or related difficulties with emotionally up set participants due to the treatments.  527

Page 13 of 22 
 
 
 Rare, but not Serious, expected to occur in less than 5 out of 100 participants:  530 
• Emotional distress due to tinnitus or more attention toward tinnitus sensation may occur; however, since tinnitus is 531 
a chronic and stable condition, it is unlikely that a change will occur because of the assessment procedures  532 
 533 
Risks and Side Effects related to the Resting -State fMRI  534 
Rare, but not Serious, expected to occur in less than 5 out of 100 participants:  535 
• Confinement claustrophobia (fear of tight spaces). During the MRI scan, participants will be asked to remain 536 
perfectly still. The MRI can cause individuals to feel claustrophobic (fear of tight spaces). However, the incidence 537 
of claustrophobia with the MRI is low (approximately 1 per 150 persons).  538 
 539 
Rare and Serious, expected to occur in less than 5 out of 100 participants:  540 
• Foreign bodies which may interact with the magnetic field of the MRI can have risk for persons w ith foreign bodies 541 
implanted in their body. Cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants may cease to function and can be 542 
permanently damaged by the MRI. Surgical clips on aneurysms and intestines may be moved by the magnetic 543 
field. Ferrous metal filings in the eye (e.g., in machinists) can be moved by the magnetic field. Foreign body risk is 544 
minimized by including only volunteers with no known foreign bodies and no exposure to circumstances, which 545 
might predispose to foreign bodies (e.g., metal machine workers ). Before any MRI you receive, we will ask you 546 
about any metal objects that may be in your body in order to ensure your safety.  547 
 548 
Risks of PTSD Di agnosis regardless of Treatment  549 
One of the risks of PTSD both in and out of treatment is attempted suicide, which can result in death.  550 
 551 
Safeguards for Protecting Participants:   During the early sessions of treatment, participants will be provided immediate 552 
coping tools and techniques used to manage distressing emotions by the study therapist.  Distress experienc ed by 553 
participants is expected to be temporary.  Any indication that the participant is considering suicide will be handled using 554 
processes developed by military and civilian Consultants for the STRONG STAR Consortium studies.  Trained clinicians 555 
and evalu ators will assess history of suicide and current suicidal ideation using the following standardized measures: Self - 556 
Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview - Short Form  (SITBI - Short Form ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 557 
(PHQ -9).  For participants identified as having low to moderate risk for suicide based on the assessment results, the 558 
patient will be maintained on protocol and additional risk management procedures will be implemented within the context 559 
of the study treatment.  For participants identified as being at high risk for suicide based on the assessment results, 560 
disenrollment will be considered if it is unlikely that standard treatment plus additional risk management procedures will 561 
maintain safety.  High risk participants who are disenroll ed from the study will be referred for more intensive treatment 562 
(outpatient or inpatient).  563 
 564 
A STRONG STAR Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) has been developed in accordance with the National 565 
Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Human Research Protecti on (OHRP) to assure the appropriate clinical safety and 566 
adverse event monitoring of study subjects participating in STRONG STAR studies.  567 
 568 
7.2 Potential Benefits.    569 
Potential benefits of participation in this study may include a reduction in PTSD symptoms and tinnitus -related distress over 570 
the course of therapy.  Our primary goal is to treat participants to the point of symptom reduction below the level of diagnostic 571 
criteria for PTSD.  In addition, the knowledge gained from this study will serve to inform t he most effective early interventions 572 
for the treatment of co- morbid tinnitus and PTSD in Veterans.  573 
 574 
7.3 Alternatives:  Other treatments for PTSD that are available include the following:  575 
• Various forms of psychotherapy (talk therapy) including CPT for PTSD.  576 
• Various forms of psychotherapy (talk therapy) including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for tinnitus  577 
• Drug treatments for PTSD  578 
• There may be other research studies involving experimental treatments that could be helpful in treating PTSD 579 
and/or tinnitus  580 
 581 
Not participating in this study is an option.  582

 591 
All adverse events, unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, and deviations will be reported 592 
to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with current IRB policy.  UPIRSOs and recurrent non - 593 
compliance with study procedures will  be reported promptly to the IRB.  All adverse events that do not meet 594 
the UPIRSO criteria and deviations that are not non -compliance will be summarized at Continuing Review per 595 
the IRB of record’s policy.   596 
 597 
9.0 WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION.   598 
Participation in the study may be discontinued by the principal investigator if continued participation is considered a 599 
danger to a participant’s welfare. Reasons for discontinuation include: 1) a serious adverse event such that continued 600 
participation would be a danger to the participant; 2) clinical worsening for any reason that is deemed to necessitate non- 601 
study psychological or psychiatric treatment; 3) exacerbation of PTSD, anxiety, or depressive symptoms that the 602 
participant cannot tolerate; 4) inability to tolerate the MRI procedure; or 5) discontinuation would be in the participant's 603 
best interest.  604 
 605 
Participants who are discontinued from the study for any reason will be scheduled for a final evaluation within one week 606 
and given appropriate treatment referrals. If participants are discontinued due to a serious adverse event, they will 607 
continue to be followed clinically by the therapist and/or member of the research staff until the adverse event is resolved 608 
or becomes stable. If participants are discontinued for a medical or psychiatric reason, they will be given the opportunity t o 609 
either complete the balance of their CPT sessions or to receive a full course of CPT after the condition has resolved or 610 
stabilized and the endpoint assessment has been completed.  The reason the participants are discontinued from the study 611 
and any referrals made will be documented.  Participants will be told they will be contacted for follow -up assessments 612 
(excluding fMRI scans) whether or not they complete the treatment  trial.  613

14.0 Description of Assessments:  769 
 770 
Assessments will take place at baseline and one month following treatment.  771 
 772 
Personality & History  773 
1. Demographics and Military Service Characteristics Form . The Demographics Form measures standard 774 
demographics (race, gender, age) and military service information (e.g., rank).   775 
 776 
2. MRI Participant Information and Screening Questionnaire.  The MRI Participant Information and Screening 777 
Questionnaire measures demographics (race, gender, age), as well as information necessary t o evaluate whether 778 
an individual is able to receive an fMRI scan based on medical history (for example, neurostimulators, hearing 779 
aids, any type of coil, filter, or stent, any type of metal object).  780 
 781 
Deployment Stress, Adversity & Trauma  782 
3. Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory (DRRI -2) Combat Experience.   783 
 784 
4. Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory (DRRI -2) Postbattle Experiences . High- and low -intensity deployment 785 
stress exposure will be assessed using scales from the DRRI -2 (Vogt, Smith, King, & King, 20 12). The DRRI -2 is 786 
an update of the original DRRI (King, King, Vogt, Knight, & Samper, 2006), which was developed and tested in 787 
three separate national samples of veterans of the first Gulf War. It has been revised and tested with 788 
OEF/OIF/OND returnees (Vo gt et al., 2008). The DRRI -2 provides an update of the DRRI’s assessment of 789 
deployment -related factors to ensure the instrument’s applicability across a variety of deployment circumstances 790 
(e.g., different eras of service) and military subgroups (e.g., men and women), as well as to validate updated 791 
measures in a contemporary Veteran cohort (Vogt, et al., 2012). High intensity stressor exposures will be 792 
assessed using the DRRI Combat Experiences and Postbattle Experiences  subscales. Responses to these 793 
scales  are on a 6- point Likert scale. The total score is the sum of the item scores, where higher scores signify 794 
greater exposure to combat or exposure to the consequences of combat, respectively. Both subscales have very 795 
good internal consistency (α = .90 to .92) and construct validity (Vogt et al., 2012).  796

 5. Life Events Checklist -5 (LEC -5).  The LEC -5 includes a list of 24 potentially traumatic life events commonly 798 
associated with PTSD symptoms. The instrument was designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD (Weathers, 799 
Blake, Schnurr, Kaloupek, Marx, & Keane, 2013a).). In this study, the LEC -5 will also be used to identify the index 800 
event and focus of the PTSD treatment. For each potentially traumatic life event, respondents rate their 801 
experience of that event on a 5-point nominal scale (1 = happened to me, 2 = witnessed it, 3 = learned about it, 4 802 
=part of my job, 5= not sure, and 6 = does not apply). Each nominal point will be scored separately, as either 0 803 
(=not endorsed by participant) or 1 (=endorsed by partic ipant).  804 
 805 
6. Trauma Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI) . The TRGI was developed to assess guilt feelings and attitudes about a 806 
specific traumatic event (Kubany, Haynes, Abueg, Manke, Brennan, Stahura, 1996).  Often survivors of trauma 807 
experience guilt related to the trauma about things they did or did not do or feelings they had or did not have.  A 808 
combat veteran may experience guilt about having provided first aid to some of his or her wounded colleagues 809 
but not others even though it was not possible to care for ev eryone.  Or, an individual may experience survivor’s 810 
guilt not understanding why he lived while others died.  These feelings of guilt can be important in evaluating the 811 
various treatments for PTSD.  The TRGI is scored into three scales (i. e., 4- item Globa l Guilt Scale, 6- item 812 
Distress Scale, and a 22- item Guilt Cognitions Scale) and 3 subscales (i. e., the Hindsight -Bias / Responsibility 813 
Subscale, the Wrongdoing Subscale, and the Lack of Justification Subscale).  Psychometric testing has been 814 
conducted usi ng almost 600 individuals including 357 university students, 163 women receiving counseling 815 
services in a battered women’s program, and 74 Vietnam veterans.  Internal consistency was high across all the 816 
testing samples.  In the sample of Vietnam veterans t he alpha coefficient ranged from 0.66 to 0.94.  In the 817 
Vietnam veterans, the scores on the various scales and subscales were significantly correlated with the 818 
Posttraumatic CheckList – Military (PCL -M), the Mississippi Scale for Combat -Related Posttraumati c Stress 819 
Disorder, the Zung Self -Rating Depression Scale, the Guilt Inventory, and the Social Avoidance and Distress 820 
Scale with reliability coefficients ranging from 0.36 to 0.77 (p<.05).  In a sample of 32 university students, the test - 821 
retest correlations  after two days ranged from 0.74 to 0.83.  An abbreviated 16 -item version of the TRGI will be 822 
used in the STRONG STAR studies allowing only for the calculation of the three subscale scores.  The Hindsight - 823 
Bias / Responsibility Subscale score = (sum of scor es on Items 1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 23, and 26) divided by 7. The 824 
Wrongdoing Subscale score = (sum of scores on Items 3, 7, 11, 16, and 21) divided by 5. And, the Lack of 825 
Justification Subscale score = [sum of scores on Items 4 (R), 8 (R), 12 (R), and 17 (R)] div ided by 4.  826 
 827 
Psychiatric Status & History  828 
7. Depressive Symptom Index Suicide Subscale (DSI -SS). The DSI -SS (Metalsky & Joiner, 1997) will be used to 829 
assess current suicidal ideation. The DSI -SS is a 4 -item self -report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses  on 830 
ideation, plans, perceived control over ideation, and impulses for suicide. It is being used as a core measure in 831 
the Military Suicide Research Consortium. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3, with higher scores reflecting 832 
greater severity of suicidal ideation. Instructions will instruct the participants to respond based on the past two 833 
weeks (for baseline and follow up visits) or the past week (for interim assessment visits). A systematic review of 834 
measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors found that the DSI -SS had evidence of excellent internal consistency 835 
and concurrent validity (Batterham et al., 2014).  836 
  837 
8. Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD -7). The GAD -7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) will be used to 838 
assess generalized anxiety symptomology. This is a 7 -item measure that asks participants to rate the frequency 839 
with which they have been bothered by anxiety symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 840 
(“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score.  Scores 841 
reflect no significant anxiety symptoms (0- 4), mild anxiety symptoms (5 -9), moderate anxiety symptoms (10- 14), 842 
and severe anxiety symptoms (>15).  Respondents also indicate the degree to which their anxious sympt oms 843 
have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people, from 844 
“not difficult at all” to “extremely difficult.” The GAD -7 has been shown to have high internal consistency (e.g., α = 845 
.89; Lowe et al.,  2008) and has been shown to reliably discriminate between anxious and non- anxious diagnostic 846 
groups (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Lowe, 2010).  847 
 848 
9. Selection of Index Event for CAPS -5.  This form will be used as a supplement to the CAPS -5 interview to help 849 
determine which event to select as the Index Event. This form is standardly used in conjunction with the CAPS -5 850 
and does not represent a separate assessment.  851

10. Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale – 5 (CAPS- 5).  The CAPS- 5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM -5 853 
criteria for PTSD (Weathers et al., 2013). Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 854 
(Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. 855 
Additional items that are not included in the total score evaluate overall symptom duration, distress, impairment, 856 
dissociative symptoms, and global ratings by the interviewer. Validation studies are nearly complete to establish 857 
the psychometric properties of the CAPS -5 and findings will be reported in peer -reviewed publications. This 858 
interview is very similar to its predecessor, the CAPS for DSM -IV, which has been considered the gold standard 859 
for evaluating PTSD and demonstrated good reliability and validity (Weathers, Keane, & Dav idson, 2001). In 860 
addition to reflecting diagnostic changes for PTSD in DSM -5, the CAPS- 5 differs from the CAPS in that frequency 861 
and intensity ratings for each symptom are no longer scored separately, so the severity rating for each item 862 
determines whether  a symptom is present or not. Subscale scores are calculated by summing severity scores for 863 
items in the following PTSD symptom clusters: re -experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and 864 
mood, and hyperarousal. Scores ≥ 25 indicate a prob able diagnosis of PTSD.  865 
 866 
11. PTSD Check List – DSM -5 (PCL -5). The PCL- 5 (Weathers, et al., 2010) is a 20 -item self -report measure 867 
update of the PCL designed to assess PSTSD symptoms as defined by the DSM -5. The PCL- 5 is currently available 868 
and has been shown to have good psychometric properties. The PCL- 5 evaluates how much participants have been 869 
bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month (for baseline and follow up assessments) or the past week (all interim 870 
assessments) as a result of a specific life event.  Each item of the PCL- 5 is scored on a five point scale ran ging from 0 871 
(“not at all”) to 4 (“extremely).  872 
 873 
12. Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview - Short Form  (SITBI - Short Form ). The SITBI -Short Form  (Nock, 874 
Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 2007) is a structured interview assessing the presence, frequency, and 875 
characteristics of self -injurious and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The SITBI -Short Form  will be administered 876 
by an Independent Evaluator, who will instruct the participants to answer the questions based on their entire 877 
lifetime of experience. The SITBI -Short Form  has shown high interrater reliability, test -retest reliability, and 878 
concurrent validity (Nock et al., 2007).  879 
 880 
Functional Impairment  881 
13. Health Questionnaire. The original Health Care Utilization (HCU) is a 16- item questionnaire developed in 2000 f or 882 
Dr. Patricia A. Resick’s NIH grant, “Cognitive Processes in PTSD: Treatment II.” The questionnaire was based on 883 
the 1999 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The version that will be administered as part of the 884 
STRONG STAR Consortium has been modified to be of increased relevance to active- duty service personnel. 885 
The measure includes items regarding use of mental health services, current psychiatric medication, past 886 
psychiatric medication, hospitalization, and outpatient medical services, as well as items intended to assess 887 
changes in participants’ military status.  888 
 889 
14. History of Head Injuries . The History of Head Injuries form was developed from the Defense and Veterans Brain 890 
Injury Center (DVBIC) 3 -Item Screening Tool (Schwab, Baker, Ivins, Sluss -Tiller, Lux & Warden, 2006; Schwab, 891 
Ivins, Cramer, Johnson, Sluss -Tiller, Kiley, Lux & Warden, 2006).  The DVBIC Screening Tool, initially called the 892 
Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen (BTBIS), was used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of TBI in a sample 893 
of soldiers returning from duty in Iraq and/or Afghanistan (Schwab, Ivins, et al., 2006). As recommended by the 894 
DVBIC, the 3 -Question Screen will be considered positive when the participant endorses an injury (question 1) 895 
and altered consciousness (question 2, items A -E) for the worst head injury sustained while deployed. The form 896 
was modified for STRONG STAR and now CAP to capture the number of injuries, and to answer question 2 897 
based on the worst injury; the original form does not recognize the possi bility of multiple head injuries during 898 
deployment. As the 3- Question Screen does not query head injuries prior to deployment, an additional four 899 
questions have been added to solicit information about each head injury sustained outside of deployment.  900 
 901 
15. Veterans Rand 12- Item Health Survey (VR -12). Because a certain level of PTSD symptoms is an occupational 902 
hazard among service members redeployed for combat, it is critical to pay close attention to functional capacities 903 
as an important index of intervention ef ficacy.  The Veterans SF -36 (VR -36) was adapted from the RAND SF -36 904 
Version 1.0 questionnaire, and spans the range of health domains from physical to psychological health status. It 905

 includes two modifications.  The first modification is an increase in the number of response choices for the role 906 
physical (RP) and role emotional (RE) items from a  two point yes/no choice to a five- point likert scale (no, none 907 
of the time, yes, a little of the time, yes, some of the time, yes, most of the time, yes, all of the time).  The second 908 
modification is the use of two items to assess health change, one focusing on physical health and one on 909 
emotional problems, in contrast to the one general change item in the RAND SF -36 (Kazis, Lee et al., 2004; 910 
Kazis, Miller, Clark et al 2004). The VR -36 has been widely used, distributed and documented in the Veterans 911 
Health Administration (VHA) with close to 2 million questionnaires administered nationally in six national surveys 912 
since 1996. The changes to the survey have increased the overall precision of the instrument and the discriminant 913 
validity of the physical and mental component summary scales (Kazis, Nethercot, et al 2006). The VR -36 is 914 
comprised of 37 items and eight scales:  physical functioning, role limitations due to physi cal problems, bodily 915 
pain, general health perceptions, energy/ vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, 916 
and mental health. Also, there are two summary scales:  a physical component summary (PCS) and mental 917 
component summary  (MCS). Higher scores indicate better health. Each summary is expressed as a T score, 918 
which facilitates comparisons between the VA patients and the general U.S. population. The PCS and MCS 919 
scores provide at least 90% of the reliable variance in the eight S F-36 concepts (Kazis & Wilson, 1998; Kazis, 920 
Wilson, et al., 1999). The Veterans SF -12 was developed from the Veterans SF -36 and adapted from the MOS 921 
SF-36. It includes fewer items for seven of the eight scales and provides 90% of the reliable variance in t he two 922 
component summary measures using the Veterans SF -36. Using independent results from the Veterans Health 923 
Study and the 1996 National Survey of Ambulatory Care Patients, the results for the Veterans SF -12 924 
corresponded very closely with the results for  the Veterans SF -36 (average differences of 0.06 points between 925 
them for PCS and 0.31 points for MCS; Kazis et al., 1996; Kazis & Wilson, 1998).  926 
 927 
16. Insomnia Severity Index (IS I). The ISI (Morin, 1993) is a 7- item self -report measure that assesses perceived 928 
severity of insomnia. Each item uses a 4- point Likert type scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 4 (very much 929 
satisfied). The items sum to produce a total score (range 0 – 28). The ISI has an internal consistency alpha 930 
coefficient of 0.74, and has shown convergent validity with other measures such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 931 
Index (r = 0.67), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (r = 0.55), and sleep diaries (r ranges from 932 
0.32- 0.91) (Bastien, Vallieres & Morin, 2001).  933 
  934 
17. PROMIS Sleep -Related Impairment and Sleep Disturbance. The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep -Related 935 
Impairment short forms (Yu, Buysse, & Germain, 2012) are self -report measures of past -week sleep disturbance 936 
and past -week sleep -related impairment, respectively, derived from the larger PROMIS item banks (Buysse et al., 937 
2010). Each short -form measure includes 8 items, with most items (symptoms) scored in intensity from 1 (“not at 938 
all”) to 5 “(very much”). Each measure has shown strong reliability and construct validity (Yu et al., 2012).  939 
 940 
18. Snoring, Tired, Observed, Blood Pressure (STOP) Sleep Apnea Screen. To better understand sleep disturbance 941 
associated with PTSD and PTSD treatment, the STOP screen (Chung et al., 2008) will be administered to screen 942 
for sleep apnea.  The S TOP is a four -item questionnaire developed and validated in 211 pre- operative surgical 943 
patients.  Based on the endorsement of 2 or more questions, the sensitivity of the STOP ranged from 66% to 80% 944 
as compared with the apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) of polysom nography depending upon the AHI cut -off used.  945 
Individuals answering “yes” to 2 or more of the questions will be advised that they may be at risk for having sleep 946 
apnea and advised that they may want to speak with their primary care provider to consider referral for an 947 
overnight sleep evaluation   948 
 949 
19. Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ -9). The PHQ -9 is a widely used and well -validated instrument for 950 
measuring the severity of depressive symptoms (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). It consists of 9 items that 951 
assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders; these 9 items 952 
correspond to the diagnostic criteria for DSM MDD. Respondents rate the frequency with which they have been 953 
bothered by depressive symptoms within the past two weeks (for baseline and follow up visits) or the past week 954 
(for interim assessment visits)on a scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores on all items 955 
are summed to obtain a total severity score. Scores reflect no significant depressive symptoms (0 -4), mild 956 
depressive symptoms (5- 9), moderate depress ive symptoms (10 -14), moderately severe depressive symptoms 957 
(15-19), and severe depressive symptoms (>19). Respondents also indicate the degree to which their depressive 958 
symptoms have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along with other 959

 people, from “not difficult at all” to “extremely difficult.” The PHQ -9 has high internal consistency (e.g., alpha 960 
ranging from .83 to .92; Cameron, Crawford, Lawton, & Reid, 2008), and correlates strongly with other measures 961 
of depression (Kroenke et al., 2001).   962 
 963 
20. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) . The FTND (Heatherton et al., 1991) is a 6 -item self -report 964 
measure that assesses severity of nicotine dependence. Questions probe both quantity of nicotine use (e.g., 965 
number of cigarettes per day) and pattern of use (e.g., time to first cigarette in morning). Respondents choose 966 
among response options, each of which is assigned a numerical value, with higher numbers corresponding to 967 
greater nicotine dependence. Scores on all  items are summed to create a severity index (0- 2 = very low 968 
dependence; 3- 4 = low dependence; 5 = medium dependence; 6- 7 = high dependence; 8- 10 = very high 969 
dependence). The Fagerstrom scale has been shown to have high convergent validity with biochemical  indices of 970 
nicotine use, and the measure has shown acceptable internal consistency (Heatherton et al., 1991). A review of 971 
26 studies of the psychometric characteristics of the Fagerstrom found that it is a reliable instrument for 972 
measuring nicotine dependence in diverse settings and populations (Meneses -Gaya et al., 2009).  973 
 974 
21. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence-  Smokeless Tobacco (FTND -ST). This is a modified version of the 975 
Fagerstrom Test that focuses on smokeless tobacco use, whereas the original Fagerstrom focuses exclusively on 976 
smoking. Like the FTND, the FTND -ST is a 6 -item self -report measure of severity of nicotine dependence that has 977 
demonstrated convergent validity with biochemical indices of nicotine use (Ebbert et al., 2006; Ferketich et al., 978 
2007). As on the original FTND, respondents choose among response options, each of which is assigned a 979 
numerical value, with higher numbers corresponding to greater nicotine dependence. Scores on all items are 980 
summed to create a severity index (range =  0–10). 981 
 982 
22. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) . The AUDIT (Babor et al, 2001) will be used to identify people 983 
with hazardous or harmful patterns of alcohol consumption. The AUDIT is a 10- item screening measure, 984 
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with three subscales (alcohol consumption, drinking 985 
behavior, and alcohol -related problems) that are scored on a 4- point scale for a highest possible total score of 40. 986 
Among those identified as using alcohol in a harmful manner, 92% had s cores of 8 or more, though determining a 987 
cutoff score should be left up to the clinician, depending upon the population being studied. The AUDIT has good 988 
internal consistency (α = .80- .93) as well as sensitivity and specificity (Saunders, Aasland, Babor, D e La Fuente & 989 
Grant, 1993).  990 
 991 
23. Quick Drinking Screen (QDS) . The QDS (Sobell et al., 2003) will be used to measure alcohol consumption. It 992 
consists of 4 items probing frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption. It will be administered in a self -report 993 
form. The QDS has been validated against the Timeline Followback daily estimation measure of alcohol use, and 994 
it shows good psychometric properties (Roy et al., 2008; Sobell et al., 2003). The QDS’s time- frame will be 995 
modified to match the “last two weeks” probed by the mandated depression and anxiety instruments for CAP 996 
studies (PHQ -9 and GAD -7). Like these other measures, the QDS can be administered frequently throughout 997 
CAP trials to track changes in alcohol use.  998 
 999 
24. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-  Manic and Psychosis modules . The MINI 7.0 is a short, 000 
structured clinical diagnostic interview designed to cover the major psychiatric disorders in  DSM -5 and ICD -10. It 001 
is widely used in epidemiological studies and multi -site clinical trials. Re sponses to the interviewer’s questions are 002 
rated as either “yes” or “no.” As is the case on the SCID, there are skip- outs, which saves time.  However, this 003 
means that the MINI cannot be used to index the severity of a given psychiatric problem, only casene ss. When 004 
there are many skip -outs, the MINI takes ~15 minutes to administer. The MINI can be used to assess the full 005 
spectrum of psychiatric problems, or specific modules can be employed (e.g., the schizophrenia module to rule 006 
out thought disorder).  007 
 008 
25. Tinni tus Functional Index (TFI) .  The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was reported by Henry et al (2014). They 009 
report five stages of TFI development through which prototypes were developed, tested, and revised over a four - 010 
year period. The TFI has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the 011 
patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and 012 
emotional distress.  013

26. Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) . The Tinnit us Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) was reported by Westin 015 
et al. (2008). This measure captures the extent to which individuals accept their tinnitus, and attempts to avoid or 016 
control tinnitus, as well as a patient’s ability to pursue valued life activities and meaningful goals regardless of 017 
tinnitus. The TAQ was further validated in an English speaking population (Weise et al., 2012).  018 
 019 
Psychosocial Functioning 020 
27. Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (BIPF) . The Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (Marx et al. 021 
2013) is a 7 -item self -report instrument measuring respondents’ level of functioning in seven life domains: 022 
romantic relationship, relationship with children, family relationships, friendships and socializing, work, training 023 
and education, and activities of daily living. Respondents indicate the degree to which they had trouble in the last 024 
30 days in each area on a 7- point scale ranging from “0 = Not at all” to “6 = Very much.”  025 
 026 
Other Key Mediators & Moderators  027 
28. Homework Compliance . The Homewor k Compliance form asks questions about how often participants used the 028 
worksheets, how many minutes were dedicated toward the practice assignments, and how helpful the practice 029 
assignments were considered.   030 
29. Resting -state fMRI . Resting state fMRI techniques  (Adhikari  et al., 2018) will be conducted among individuals with 031 
comorbid PTSD and tinnitus. Resting -state connectivity will be assessed by mapping inter -regional connectivity 032 
using an extended time series BOLD fMRI images acquired in an unstimulated stat e. Connectivity can be 033 
detected and quantified using inter -connected regions, which show temporally correlated variations and are 034 
analyzed with a data- driven analytic strategy called Independent Components Analysis. Resting- state networks 035 
that will be exam ined include the default -mode network, auditory network, limbic network, and attentional network.  036

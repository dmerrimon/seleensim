Protocol Number  DIAN -TU-001 
Protocol Title  A Phase II/III randomized, doub le-blind, placebo -controlled, cognitive 
endpoint, multicenter study of potential disease modifying therapies in 
individuals at risk for and with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease.  
Clinical Phase  Phase II/III  
Investigators  Investigators will be sel ected based on patient population and clinical 
research competency.  The currently existing DIAN -TU sites will continue to 
be active for new study drug enrollment and new sites will continue to be identified and qualified.  
Study Centers  Approximately 40 s ites globally  
Study Objective To assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker and cognitive efficacy of 
investigational products in subjects who are known to have an Alzheimer’s 
disease -causing mutation by determining if treatment with the study drug 
slows the rate of progression of cognitive impairment and improves 
disease -related biomarkers.   
Study Population Subjects who are either known to have a mutation causing Alzheimer’s 
disease OR who do not know their gene status but are “at- risk” for a 
dominantl y inherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD) mutation AND who are 
either 1) cognitively normal and are between 15 years younger ( -15) to 10 
years older (+10) than their expected age at symptom onset or 2) have mild 
symptoms of dementia (C linical Dementia Rating [CDR]  0.5 or 1) and are 
within 10 years of the onset of symptoms of dementia.   
 
 
Study Design  This study is an adaptive platform -based study, which allows flexibility to add 
a new compound to the same protocol, allowing subjects to be randomized to study  drug arms open to enrollment, and to maintain a cohort of trial ready 
subjects with or at risk for DIAD mutations.  Subjects have been enrolled to the gantenerumab and solanezumab study drug arms, with each enrolled subject randomized to active drug or th e corresponding placebo. Previously, 
DIAN -TU-001 also included an atabecestat arm. For further information 
relevant to the atabecestat arm, see earlier versions of the protocol.   
All subjects enrolled to the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms will 
continue  to be treated with active drug or placebo, while biomarker (e.g., 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, volumetric brain magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and plasma measures), 
clinical, cognitive, and safety assessments  (including safety MRI scans, vital

Page 4 of 265 signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical chemistry, and hematology) are 
monitored throughout the study period.   
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the active drug group will have a 
slower rate of progression on  the DIAN -Multivariate Cognitive Endpoint 
(DIAN -MCE)  compared to the mutation  positive  placebo s (pooled p lacebos for 
both gantenerumab and solanezumab) and the eligible DIAN Observational 
(DIAN -OBS) study  subjects  after treatment for a minimum of 4  years. The 
biomarker and cognitive endpoints may be used to conduct interim analyses in any of the study drug arms; a study drug arm may be stopped early or revised (e.g., dose adjustment or treatment duration) based upon the results of the interim analyses or information from other clinical trials for the same drug, as outlined in each drug-specific appendix.  
Mutat ion positive  subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio for active 
drug:placebo.  Groups enrolled simultaneously will be balanced by a minimization algorithm including clinical state and stage of disease measures (CDR -SB, years from onset) and other factors (gene type [ APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 ] 
years of education, age, presence of an APOE ε4 allele, region, study site and 
gender).  Subjects who are mutation negative will be assigned to one of the placebo groups.  
At the request of participants, mutation  negative su bjects are included to 
maintain blinding as to genetic status for those who do not wish to know their genetic status.  Mutation  negative subjects will not be included in the primary 
efficacy or futility analyses.  Data from mutation negative subjects will be 
used to develop models for longitudinal changes in biomarkers and cognition 
in healthy adult controls.  
Number of Subjects  This study will recruit subjects from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 
Network (DIAN) observational study, a multicenter interna tional study 
supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01- AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trial 
Units (DIAN -TU) sites, DIAN -TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN -
EXR), and families identified by th e sites.  
Recruitment of mutation positive subjects is limited to those with a baseline 
CDR 0 to 1 (inclusive) with no more than 50% CDR >0 enrolled.  Mutation positive  groups (active vs. placebo) will be balanced proportionally as to 
number of asymptomatic  (CDR 0) and symptomatic (CDR>0) subjects.

Page 5 of 265 For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, the recruitment goal was 52 
mutation carriers for each active drug group and 34 mutation carriers for the 
placebo groups combined for a total of 138 mutation carriers.  A n estimated 
72 non -carriers (mutation negative subjects who are unaware of their genetic 
status, estimated to be about 1/3 of total subjects) would also be recruited.  Recruitment was closed once 52 mutation carriers were enrolled in each active drug group  and 34 were enrolled in the placebo groups.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Main Inclusion Criteria  Subjects must meet ALL inclusion criteria  based on estimated years from 
symptom onset (EYO).  The ma in inclusion criteria are as follows:   
• –15 to +10 EYO (secondary prevention population): within −15 to +10 
years of the estimated age at symptom onset, or, if symptomatic, within 10 years of their age at symptom onset, CDR 0 to 1, inclusive, 
known carrier or at 50% risk (affected parent or sibling)  
• Younger than – 15 EYO (primary prevention population): more than 
15 years younger (<  –15) than estimated age at symptom onset, CDR 
0, known carrier or mutation in their family pedigree; if the at -risk 
parent is d eemed a non -carrier at any point, subject will be 
withdrawn from study  
• Are able and willing to complete all study -related testing, evaluations, 
and procedures  
Main Exclusion 
Criteria  Subjects will be excluded if they have a major or unstable illness or a re unable 
to complete all study related testing.  Exclusions include implanted metal that cannot be removed for MR scanning, required anticoagulation therapy and pregnancy.   
Route and Dosage 
Form  Route and dosage forms are included in each drug -specific appendix.   
 
Dosage  Dosage is included in each drug -specific appendix.  
Duration of Treatment  For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, subjects will continue to 
receive blinded study drug until ev ery subject concurrently  randomized to 
any blinded study drug arm has received a minimum of 4 years (208 weeks) of treatment or is withdrawn.  
Based on the recruitment time needed for the gantenerumab and 
solanezumab arms, the total treatment duration for b oth blinded study drug 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 6 of 265 arms is expected not to exceed 81 months (6.75 years), with an average 
duration of 5.3  years.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a study drug arm demonstrates a potential for clinical benefit at the end of 
the double -blind treatment period, subjects may be offered, if eligible, to 
continue or start t reatment, via an open -label extension (OLE) period in which 
all subjects will receive active study drug.  The OLE period may last up to an 
additional 2  years (24 months) or until the treatment becomes commercially 
available in a subject’s country, whicheve r occurs first. 
Primary Outcome Measure The primary efficacy hypothesis of the study is that the active drug group will 
have a slower rate of progression on the DIAN -MCE  compared to the  
mutation  positive  placebo s (pooled placebos for both gantenerumab and  
solanezumab) and the eligible DIAN -OBS subjects  after treatment for a 
minimum of 4 years . 
The DIAN -MCE consists of the following tests :  1) The Delayed Recall score of 
the International Shopping List Test, 2) The Delayed Recall score of the Logical Memory  IIa subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale -Revised, 3) The Digit 
Symbol Substitution Test total score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Revised, and 4) The Mini -Mental State Examination total score.  
Comparisons will be made between each active d rug, mutation positive  
placebo s, and the eligible DIAN -OBS subjects, but not between the active 
drugs.  
Additional Outcome 
Measures  Additional  outcome measures , which will be further categorized as secondary 
or exploratory in the drug -specific statistical analysis plans (SAPs) , include the 
following : 
1. Assess safety and tolerability of each study drug in individuals who have mutations causing dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease.  
2. Biomarker Endpoints used at interim analysis: Assess target engagement of ea ch study drug in individuals who have mutations causing dominantly 
inherited Alzheimer’s disease as measured by the change from baseline to interim analysis for the biomarker measure for each drug.  The biomarker endpoints are specified for each drug based on mechanism of 
action.  Comparisons between the active drug and mutation positive placebo s will be made at each interim for a study drug arm ; however , 
there will be no comparisons between active drugs.

Statistical Considerations   
Descriptive statistics:   Descriptive statistics will be provided for both  safety 
and efficacy variables at each time point collected by treatment groups and across combined placebo groups.  Continuous variables (e.g., biomarker 
values) will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, lower  quartile, median, upper quartile, and the 
maximum.  Categorical variables (e.g., presence or absence of an APOE  ε4 
allele ) will be summarized using the number and percentage in each category.  
 
Safety analyses :  Safety analyses will include all subjects w ho consent to 
participate and are randomized to receive any active study drugs or placebo.  Adverse events will be characterized using standard terminology (adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment- emergent serious adverse events).  
The seriousnes s and causality of adverse events will be summarized.   
Interim analyses for biomarker endpoints:  Interim biomarker analyses will be 
conducted for each study drug arm to assess whether the active study drug is engaging its biological target.  The timing of the interim analyses may vary for each study drug arm.  At each interim, an analysis will be conducted for the biomarker endpoints, comparing the active drug to its own placebo group (direct placebos) or to the mutation positive placebo s.  Pre -specified 
definitions for early termination for futility will be drug -specific and based on 
collection of appropriate biomarker assessments following sufficient drug exposure.  Details about the interim analyses are described in each drug -
specific appendix.  
Interim analyses for cognitive endpoints : Interim cognitive analyses may be 
conducted to assess whether active study drug has achieved significant slowing in cognitive decline.  At each interim, an analysis will be conducted for the DIAN -MCE , comparing the active drug to its own placebo group (direct 
placebo ) or the mutation positive  pooled placebo group.  If the test of the 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 10 of 265 interim analysis is significant, the study drug may be terminated earlier for 
efficacy.  Details about any planned  interim analyses are described in each 
drug- specific appendix.  
All interim analyses will be conducted on the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) 
population , which is defined as all subjects who will be randomized, treated, 
and assessed for their primary cognitive outcomes at least once after the 
baseline assessment.  
Efficacy analyses for the cognitive endpoint :  All efficacy analyses will be 
conducted on the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population.  The primary 
efficacy hypothesis will be tested by comparing the cognitive decline relative 
to estimated years from symptom onset (EYO) between the active drug , the 
mutation positive placebos, and the eligible DIAN -OBS subjects using the 
cognitive multivariate disease progression model ( MDPM ) developed by the 
DIAN -TU.  The MDPM includes two subject -level random effects to account 
for the between -subject variability and a model of the mean rate of decline as 
a function of EYO.  Treatment efficacy will be measured as a proportional 
slowing in decline of the primary cognitive endpoint in active drug compared with the mutation positive placebos and the eligible DIAN -OBS subjects.  
Sample Size Considerations  For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, the recruitment goal was for 
52 mutation positive subjects per active drug group and 34 mutation ca rriers 
for the mutation positive placebo group to allow for 5% annual attrition 
during the minimum 4 -year double -blind treatment period.  Assuming 5% 
annual attrition rate, at the end of the 4 -year study, there will be 
approximately 42 subjects on each act ive treatment and 27 mutation positive 
placebos.  Power analysis for the biomarker endpoints suggests that this sample size will provide over 99% power to detect calculated effect sizes for changes in PiB and CSF total Aβ 1 -42 (Aβ
42).  Power analysis for t he DIAN -MCE  
suggests that 42 mutation positive  subjects in the active drug groups , 27 
mutation positive placebos, and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects will provide over 
90% power to detect a 40% effect size (slowing of decline in cognition for active drug in com parison to placebo) when the last subject randomized to 
the study drug arm reaches the end of the minimum 4 -year double -blind 
treatment period.

 Background  
This study will recruit subjects from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) 
observational study, a multicenter i nternational study supported by the National Institutes of 
Health (Grant Number U01 -AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network 
Trial Units (DIAN -TU) sites, DIAN -TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN -EXR), and 
families identified  by the sites.  As part of the DIAN -TU-001 protocol, subjects undergo 
longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid  
There are DIAN O bservational study sites located in multiple countries including the USA, 
Argentina, Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  Subjects in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD).  The mutations in presenilin 1 
(PSEN1 ), presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) and amyloid precursor protein ( APP) that are associated with 
dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease have very high penetrance (near 100 %).  This study will 
target individuals who are either known to have a disease -causing mutation or who are at risk 
for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status.  Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation ( Ryman, Acosta- Baena et al. 2014 ), an age at onset is 
determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN O bservational (DIAN -OBS) 
study protocol.  This study will enroll subjects who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation or who  have 
symptoms of mild Alzheimer’s disease.  
The ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) within the next 10-15 years with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the 
efficacy of therapies at a symptomatic and very early stages of dementia.  Families with known 
disease -causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the 
world.  These constraints necessitate a specialized study design.  Many of the subjects in this  
study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be “asymptomatic” carriers of mutations that cause dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing.  Imaging an d fluid biomarkers 
will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets.  A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected.  Additionally, becaus e many at -risk individuals decide not to 
know whether they have the disease -associated mutation or not, some of the at- risk individuals 
enrolled in this study will not have the disease -causing mutations; they will be “mutation 
negative”.  It is important t o enroll non -carrier subjects to avoid coercion (e.g., potential subjects 
may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the trial).  These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group  and will not be

Page 25 of 265 included in the primary efficacy or futility analyses.  Subjects and site study staff will remain 
blinded as to these individuals’ active or placebo group assignment and mutation status.  Thus, 
the study will be double blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation 
positive  subjects who are aware of their genetic status.  There may be exceptional circumstances 
when required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers on ly but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by 
the governing regulatory agency and sponsor.  
This study is an adaptive platform- based study (Woodcock, LaVange 2017). Several different 
therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) w ill be tested in order to increase the likelihood 
that an effective treatment will be discovered.  The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile.  The study design includes a pooled  placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) shared by all 
study drug arms.  Mutation positive  subjects will be assigned to a study drug arm and 
subsequently randomized within that arm in an overall 3:1 ratio to active drug:placebo.  Muta tion negative subjects will all receive placebo treatment.  Importantly, subjects and study 
staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each subject has been assigned; they will be 
blinded  as to whether subjects have been randomized to active drug  or placebo.  Biomarker 
endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm.  Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre -
specified endpoints consistent with the drug’s mechanism of action and known effects on the tested biomarkers.  The primary cognitive endp oint will be the same for all study drug arms.  
Interim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study drug engages its biological targets.  This biomarker approach is particularly important in this study as mo st study subjects will be cognitively normal at baseline and most will remain 
cognitively normal during the first 2  years of the study.  The DIAN -Multivariate Cognitive 
Endpoint  (DIAN -MCE) is designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable 
before the onset of dementia.  The cognitive multivariate disease progression model ( MDPM) 
will allow for detection of these subtle cognitive changes.  
After the last subject in a study drug arm completes the 4 -year treatment period, subjects in that 
study drug arm may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open -label extension period 
(section 3.10).

 Drug -specific Background  
Complete drug -specific  information for each study drug used in this trial is included as a drug -
specific appendix to this protocol.  All therapies are currently in clinical trials in individuals with  
or at risk for sporadic AD.  Refer to the respective Investigator’s Brochures (provided separately) 
for additional information.  
Gantenerumab (RO4909832); see Appendix 3.  Gantenerumab is a recombinant human anti -
amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin subclass G1 (IgG1) that 
binds specifically to aggregat ed forms of Aβ  peptide.  In a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose 
(MAD) study, subjects treated with gantenerumab for up to 6 months had a dose dependent 
reduction in brain amyloid, as measured by a reduction in [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B 
([11C]PiB) binding, using a volume -weighted average from 6 cortical areas ( Ostrowitzki, Deptula 
et al. 2012 ). 
Solanezumab (LY2062430); see Appendix 4 .  Solanezumab is humanize d anti -Aβ peptide 
immunoglobulin G -1 (IgG1); solanezumab recognizes an epitope in the middle of the Aβ  peptide 
and binds to soluble Aβ.  In a Phase 2 trial, treatment with solanezumab resulted in a dose -
dependent increase in levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in both  CSF and plasma (Siemers, Friedrich et al. 
2010). 
Drugs that target amyloid beta peptide may be associated with amyloid -related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA), including both vasogenic edema (ARIA- E) and hemorrhages (ARIA- H), 
which are typically microhemorrhages, but larger hemorrhages and frank infarction have also 
been reported ( Sperling, Salloway et al. 2012 ).  Subjects will undergo MRI scans to monitor for 
ARIA.  The schedule is drug arm specific and the frequency reflects the likely risk, based on available safety studies and the mechanism of action of the treatment.  Should new ARIA 
changes be detected, the site PI or designated sub- investigator, DIAN -TU Medical Director 
and/or designee, and Project Arm Leader will review ARIA findings and clinical information and 
will decide on what, if any, actions should be taken.  See the gantenerumab - and solanezumab -
specific appendices (Appendic es 3 and 4) for details of drug -specific dose adjustment strategies.

 Rationale for Biomarkers  
More than half of the mutation positive  subjects in this study will have normal cognition per 
randomization and enrollment criteria and will therefore be “asympto matic” and without clinical 
manifestations of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT).  The pathological processes that 
define AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, start to develop 10 -20 years before 
clinical symptoms ( Price and Morris 1999 ; Price, McKeel et al. 2009 ).  Findings from the DIAN 
observational study ( Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012 ) indicate pathological and biomarker changes 
occur at least 15 years before the first estimated symptom onset in the DIAN cohort.  Fluid and imaging biomarkers such as upt ake of the amyloid -binding dye positron emission tomography 
with [
11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) ([11C]PiB -PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
amyloid beta peptide fragment 1 -42 (Aβ 42), total tau and phosphorylated tau181 (ptau 181) may 
be able to  measure amyloid deposition (CSF Aβ 42 and positron emission tomography (PET) with 
[11C]PiB) and neuronal and synaptic integrity (CSF total tau and ptau 181) in individuals at risk for 
DAT (Mintun, Larossa et al. 2006 ; Fagan, Roe et al. 2007 ; Fagan, Head et al. 2009 ; Morris, Roe et 
al. 2009 ). 
Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is another important marker of  neurodegeneration  in AD. 
Neurofilament light chain is a neuronal cytoplasmic protein ; levels of NfL increase in CSF  and 
blood proportionally to the degree of  axonal damage in neurological disorders .  Evidence that 
both CSF and blood plasma NfL may serve as diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring biomarkers 
in neurological diseases is progressively increasing, and NfL is one of the most promising biomarkers to be  used in clinical and research setting s (Gaetani et al. 2019 ).  Neurofilament light 
chain has previously demonstrated changes in response to therapies in multiple sclerosis  and 
HIV (Varhaug et al.  2019) . Although NfL is non- specific  for AD,  it may allow for a measurement of 
disease modification in response to the active therapies . Further, NfL has demonstrated pre -
symptomatic changes in DIAD 7 to 16 years before symptom onset  (Preische et al. 2019 ). 
Cortical volume loss (as measured by volumetric MRI [vMRI]) and cerebral metabolism (measured by uptake of 2 -[
18F] fluoro -2-deoxy -D-glucose [FDG- PET]) assess anatomic and 
metabolic sequelae of neurodegeneration.  Substan tial literature supports the idea that these 
biomarkers correlate with pathological disease and may be predictive of clinical outcome.  Levels of the CSF biomarkers and [
11C]PiB  binding correlate with risk of developing dementia in 
asymptomatic individuals  and with the risk of developing more severe impairment in those with 
very mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment ( Hansson, Zetterberg et al. 2006 ; Fagan, Roe et 
al. 2007 ; Li, Sokal et al. 2007 ; Morris, Roe et al. 2009 ; Snider, Fagan et al. 2009 ).  In 
asymptomatic older individuals, increased levels of brain amyloid as detected by increased [
11C]PiB -PET binding or reduced CSF Aβ 42 are not benign as they are associated with increased 
rates of brain atrophy (Wang, Fagan et al. 2011 ; Chetelat, Villemagne et al. 2012 ).  
Nondemented individuals with amyloid deposition as detected by the recently approved PET imaging agent florbetapir 
18F have poorer performance on episodic memory testing and are 
more like ly to experience cognitive decline (Doraiswamy, Sperling et al. 2012 ; Sperling, Johnson 
Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 28 of 265 et al. 2012 ), suggesting that florbetapir 18F may also be useful in detecting amyloid pathology in 
asymptomatic individuals.   
In contrast to Aβ accumulation, autopsy studies suggest that the density and distribution of 
phosphorylated tau and of neurofibrillary tangle s increases during the course of dementia, with 
higher levels observed in individual with mild cognitive impairment and at more severe levels of dementia (Braak and Braak 1995 ).  Tau accumulation may correlate with neurodegeneration 
across the entire spectrum of the illness ( Duyckaerts, Brion et al. 1987 ; Nelson, Alafuzoff et al.  
2012) .  Aβ accumulation may serve as a biomarker for the earliest stages of disease, while 
longitudinal and quantitative assessments of the level and extent of tau deposits may better 
reflect the progression of neurodegeneration over time.  Studies of CSF Aβ
42 and tau levels in 
participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease in the Dominantly Inhe rited 
Alzheimer’s Network support this idea ( Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012 ; Benzinger, Blazey et al. 2013 ; 
Fagan, Xiong et al. 2014 ). 
The DIAN -TU-001 trial provides a critical opportunity to investigate the potential for tau imaging 
to enhance basic understanding of the evolution of tau pathology during the A D disease process, 
to understand the relationship between tau imaging and tau measurements in CSF and may 
support a role for tau imaging as a new surrogate biomarker.  
Tau scanning in the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms of this trial will take advantage o f 
the recent developments of a PET tracer ([18F]AV -1451, also known as 18F-T807 and flortaucipir) 
that has high affinity for the human phosphorylated tau deposits in AD brain (Pontecorvo M et 
al. 2015; Schwarz A et al. 2016; Marquié, Marta, et al. 2015; Wang, Liang, et al. 2016; Brier, Matthew R., et al. 2016; Gordon, Brian A., et al. 2016).  This will be the first opportunity to evaluate this imaging agent in the dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease population and to determine whether treatment with an  anti-beta amyloid therapy slows tau deposition over 
time, as measured by sequential PET scans with [
18F]AV -1451 in mutation positive  subjects 
enrolled in the DIAN -TU-001 trial.  To achieve this goal, [18F]AV -1451 PET measurements will be 
conducted up to t hree times for each subject, at baseline, year 1, year 2, and/or year 4  of the 
double -blind period, and potentially at baseline, at year 1 and year 2 of the open -label 
extension period.   Since not all sites in this international study will have access to [18F]AV -1451 
necessary to perform the tau PET scans, this measure wa s included as an addendum rather 
than as part of the main  study protocol  for the double -blind period.   It is included in the drug -
specific appendices for the OLE period when approved by the  sponsor and where the tracer is 
available.

Studies in individuals who carry a mutation linked to early onset AD suggest that these 
biomarker changes are detectable 15 or more years before the anticipated time of disease onset (See Figure 1 and Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012 ; Portelius, Fortea et al. 2012 ; Ringman, Coppola et 
al. 2012 ).  Data from the DIAN observational study suggests that changes in biomarkers begin 
about 20 years before expected age at onset in this cohort, as shown for [
11C]PiB -PET measures 
of amyloid burden in the precuneus ( Figure 1) and changes in CSF total tau, Aβ 42, FDG -PET, and 
cerebral atrophy (Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012 ). 
These studies in the  DIAN cohort, although cross -sectional, suggest that measuring levels of 
these biomarkers could provide insight into whether disease -modifying therapies are altering 
their therapeutic targets (e.g., brain amyloid deposition) in these individuals.  This idea is 
corroborated by the limited available dataset in those who have undergone longitudinal 
assessments.  CSF and imaging biomarkers are likely to provide a measure of target engagement in the preclinical stage.

The clinical and cognitive measures of the CDR -SB (scores range from 0 [cognitive normality] to 18 [maximal cognitive impairment]) (Panel 
A), the Mini– Mental State Examination (scores range from 0 [severe impairment] to 30 [no impairment]) (Panel B), and the Logical Memory 
subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale –Revised (scores range from 0 [no recall] to 25 [complete recall]) (Panel C) showed impaired ratings 
beginning approximately 5 to 10 years before expected symptom onset (EYO is expected year at onset).  MRI measures of hippoca mpal 
volume (Panel D) showed increased brain atrophy approximately 15 years before expected symptom onset.  Decreases in cerebral glucose 
metabolism, as measured by positron -emission tomography (PET) with the use of fluorodeoxyglucose (Panel E), occurred approx imately 10 
years before expected symptom onset, and deposition of amyloid -beta (Aβ) in the precuneus, as measured by PET with the use of Pittsburgh 
compound B (Panel F), began approximately 15 to 20 years before expected symptom onset.  In the cerebrospina l fluid (CSF), levels of tau 
protein (Panel G) increased beginning 10 to 15 years before expected symptom onset, and levels of Aβ 42 (Panel H) decreased at least 15 
years before expected symptom onset.  Plasma Aβ 42 levels were elevated throughout the range of estimated years from expected symptom 
onset (Panel I).  Dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals of the fitted curves.  SUVR denotes standardized uptake val ue ratio.

The imaging and CSF biomarkers measure different aspects of the AD pathogenic cascade and 
are correlated with underlying brain pathology.  There is no data on the effect of therapeutic 
interventions on these biomarkers in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals wit h DIAD but 
there is some evidence to support the idea that therapeutic interventions can produce 
detectable changes in these biomarkers in symptomatic individuals with late onset sporadic dementia of the Alzheimer’s type ( McKhann, Knopman et al. 2011 ).  For example, as noted

Page 31 of 265 above in section  1.2, there was a significant reduction in binding of [11C]PiB in individuals with 
mild to moderate DAT who were treated with the amyloid immunotherapy agent gantenerumab 
(Ostrowitzki, Deptula et al. 2012 ).  A number of other compounds have also shown effects on 
these biomarkers (Chang et al., 2011; DeMattos et al., 2014; Jacobs en et al., 2014).  There was a 
slight reduction in CSF Aβ 42 in individuals treated for 78 weeks with scyllo -inositol (ELND005), a 
compound thought to reduce the formation of amyloid fibrils; the reduction in total tau in the 
treated group did not achieve s ignificance in this very small study ( Salloway, Sperling et al. 
2011) .  A 4 -week dietary intervention (low saturated fat and low glycemic index) caused 
signif icant changes in CSF Aβ 42; interestingly, the direction of the change varied depending on 
the individual’s cognitive status.  CSF Aβ 42 levels were reduced in individuals without cognitive 
impairment and increased in those who had mild cognitive changes; th ere were no changes in 
total tau or ptau 181 (Bayer -Carter, Green et al. 2011) .  A small pilot study showed that patients 
treated with intranasal insulin for 4 months had less reduction in glucose metabolism in frontal cortex as measured by FDG -PET (Craft, Baker et al. 2012 ).  These studies, although small, support 
the idea that successful target engagement by the tested compounds would result in a detectable effect on imaging and fluid biomarkers, allowing the use of the biomarkers as 
potential predictors of treatment efficacy in individuals at risk for dominantly inherited 
Alzheimer’s disease (Strobel, 2015).  The specific biomarker endpoint chosen for each tested study drug will depend on the mechanism of action of the target com pound and on available 
preliminary data on the effects of the therapy on relevant biomarkers (see each drug -specific 
appendix and respective Investigator’s Brochures for additional details).   
CSF levels of tau and ptau will be used as additional endpoints .  These biomarkers may reflect 
neuronal or axonal injury, as evidenced by the correlation of CSF levels of total tau with the amount of tissue damage and poor clinical outcome in acute brain disorders ( Hesse, Rosengren et 
al. 2000 ; Ost, Nylen et al. 2006 ).  Levels of ptau measured in CSF samples obtained during life 
have been shown to correlate with the amount of neocortical tangle pathology at autopsy 
(Buerger, Ewers et al. 2006 ) suggesting it may serve as a marker of tangle pathology.  Some 
studies have shown that ele vated tau and ptau alone predict progression from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to DAT ( Blom, Giedraitis et al. 2009 ), while other studies demonstrate that the 
ratio of tau(s) to Aβ
42 are highly predictive of cognitive decline in cognitively normal cohorts 
(Fagan, Roe et al. 2007 ; Li, Sokal et al. 2007 ; Craig -Schapiro, Perrin et al. 2010 ) as well as 
individuals with MCI or very mild dementia ( Hansson, Zetterberg et al. 2006 ; Snider, Fagan et al. 
2009; Craig -Schapiro, Perrin et al. 2010 ; Landau, Harvey et al. 2010 ; Tarawneh, D'Angelo et al. 
2011; Buchhave, Minthon et al. 2012 ).  Levels of CSF t au and ptau are also elevated in DIAD 
mutation carriers during both the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages ( Moonis, Swearer et 
al. 2005 ; Ringman, Younkin et al. 2008 ; Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012 ; Ringman, Coppola et al. 
2012) .

 Rationale for the DIAN -Multivariate Cognitive Endpoint  
Cognitive endpoints used in most clinical trials in symptomatic sporadic Alzheimer’s dementia 
may not be useful in this study as more than half of the study subjects will be cognitively normal and are likely to show only sub tle changes in cognitive function over the course of the study.  
Available literature from cohort studies in cognitively normal individuals who progressed to 
symptomatic AD suggests that a measure sensitive to preclinical (asymptomatic) and early stage 
symptomatic AD should include assessment of at least three cognitive domains.  Prior studies 
have shown that measures of mental status and episodic memory, including both list learning and narrative recall measures, are sensitive to decline up to 10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of symptoms (Grober, Hall et al. 2008 ; Johnson, Storandt et al. 2008 ; Derby, Burns et al. 2013 ; Vos, 
Xiong et al. 2013 ).  In the DIAN O bservational  (DIAN -OBS) cohort, the group from which many 
subjects in this trial will be drawn, t here are baseline differences in episodic memory and 
executive functions (including working memory and attentional control) between asymptomatic mutation carriers and mutation negative family members ( Storandt, Balota et al. 2014 ). 
Several potential composite measures were examined as candidates for the DIAN -MCE  using 
data from the DIAN -OBS cohort data (Data Freeze 9).  The pattern of deficits was similar to that 
observed in sporadic AD, with decline on global metrics of cognitive function and tests of 
episodic memory and executive function in the early asymptomatic stage, followed by widespread cognitive decline across all cognitive domains when mutation carriers become 
clinically symptomatic (defined as clinical dementia rating [ CDR] > 0). 
The DIAN -MCE  will include 4 measures that have well- demonstrated sensitivity to decline in 
preclinical and early stage symptomatic AD; most importantly, these measures have shown 
sensitivity to changes in the cognitively normal/preclinical stage of domin antly inherited AD in 
the DIAN -OBS cohort.  These 4 measures are:  1) The Delayed Recall score of the International 
Shopping List Test, 2) The Delayed Recall score of the Logical Memory IIa subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale -Revised, 3) The Digit Symbol Substitution Test total score from the 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Revised, and 4) The Mini -Mental State Examination total 
score.  The DIAN -MCE  is unique, but has overlap with composite measures identified for other 
secondary prevention trials in A D, including the Anti -Amyloid in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s (A4) 
trial (Donohue, Sperling et al. 2014 ) and the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative ( API, Langbaum, 
Hendrix et al. 2014 ).

 Rationale for Open -label Extension  
In dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, subjects who carry the disease -associated mutation 
will ultimately develop dementia.  This trial is testing the hypothesis that the study drugs can 
change the course of amyloid injury and delay or prevent dementia.  Assuming that the 
observations of subjects during the trial show that the interventions demonstrate potential clinical benefit and are reasonably safe, an open -label extension for symptomatic subjects, and 
asymptomatic subjects who are confirmed mutation carriers, would allow for treatment at the earliest time point so that symptomatic subjects would be treated, and those with the gene may 
get maximal opportunity to benefit as well.  Thus, at the end of the double -blind treatment 
period, subjects may have the opportunity to receive active drug with appropriate safety 
monitoring; details are provided in section 3.10.

Page 34 of 265 2 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
To assess the safety, tolerabilit y, biomarker and cognitive efficacy of each study drug versus 
mutation positive placebo s in subjects who are known to have an Alzheimer’s disease -causing 
mutations by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of progression of 
cognitive i mpairment and improves disease -related biomarkers.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 Overall Design  
This study is a Phase II/III double -blind placebo -controlled, cognitive endpoint, multicenter study 
of disease modifying therapies in individuals at risk for dominantly inherite d Alzheimer’s disease.  
Individuals who are at risk for dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease (known mutation carriers or those who are blind to their mutation status but have a 50% risk of being mutation carriers) AND who are between 15 years younger ( −15) or 10 years older (+10) than the typical 
age at onset of dementia in their pedigree or gene type ( APP, PSEN1, PSEN2)  AND who are either 
cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating™ [CDR]=0) or have mild symptoms of dementia (CDR 0.5 or 1) will be enr olled.  
Many subjects in this study will choose to remain blind to their genetic status.  These subjects and study staff will remain blind to their genetic status throughout the study.  Mutation negative  
subjects will not receive active study drug , but in o rder to maintain blinding as to genetic status, 
mutation negative subjects will be assigned to the placebo group and will participate in all study 
procedures and assessments.  Placebo PET tracers may be used if required by local regulations, if 
pre-approve d by the sponsor.  Mutation- negative subjects will not be included in the primary 
efficacy or futility analyses.  These subjects will provide valuable biomarker data that will be useful for future studies in both DIAD and sporadic DAT.  Mutation positive  subjects will be 
randomized into actively enrolling study drug arms and within a study drug arm the subject will be randomized at an overall ratio of 3:1 for active drug versus placebo.  Therefore, both mutation positive  and negative subjects will be randomized to receive placebo for each study 
drug arm.  This is needed because the treatment administration routes and safety monitoring may be different for the different study drug arms.  Subjects and study staff will be blinded  as to 
whether subjects are on a ctive drug or placebo but will not be blinded  as to the treatment route 
and interval.   
This study is an adaptive platform- based study, which allows flexibility to add a new compound 
to the same protocol, allowing subjects to be randomized to study drug ar ms open to 
enrollment, and to maintain a cohort of trial ready subjects with or at risk for DIAD mutations.  Subjects have been enrolled to the gantenerumab or solanezumab study drug arms, with each enrolled subject randomized to active drug or the corresponding placebo  (‘direct placebo’) .  
Previously, DIAN -TU-001 also included an atabecestat arm.  For further information relevant to 
this study drug arm, see earlier versions of the protocol.  
Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 35 of 265 All subjects enrolled to the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms will  continue to be treated 
with active drug or placebo, while biomarker (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 
volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and plasma 
measures), clinical, cognitive, and safety as sessments (including safety MRI scans, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical chemistry, and hematology) are monitored throughout the study period.  The active drug group will be given for up to a minimum of 204 weeks through a 
maximum of 364 weeks , based upon when the subject was randomized into the study.  Placebo 
will be given for up to a minimum of 204 weeks through a maximum of 364 weeks, based upon when the subject was randomized into the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy hypothesis of the study is that the study drug group will have a slower rate of progression on the DIAN -MCE  compared to the mutation -carrier placebo group after 
treatment for a minimum of 4 years.  That is, all subjects continue on double -blind treatmen t 
until every subject completes 4 years of treatment resulting in a range of treatment exposure beyond 4 years along with additional cognitive assessments, all of which contribute to the primary endpoint.  The biomarker endpoints and cognitive endpoints may be used to conduct interim analyses in any of the study drug arms.  The design includes the potential to conduct at least one interim analysis of the biomarker endpoints and up to two interim analyses of the cognitive endpoint.  The number and timing of interim analyses may vary for each study drug arm.  Details about the interim analyses are described in each drug -specific appendix.  If a study 
drug fails to demonstrate target engagement, as evidenced by meeting a pre -specified threshold 
at one of the interim analyses, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may recommend that a study drug arm either be stopped early or that the study dose be escalated, if dose escalation is deemed safe.  If a study drug achieved significant slowing of cognitive decline a t the cognitive 
interim analysis, the study drug arm may be terminated early for efficacy.  
Study drug arms that demonstrate a potential clinical benefit  may have an open -label extension 
period.

 Rationale for Study Design  
There are two unusual features of this study population that have influenced the study design.  
First, many individuals who are at risk for dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease do not want to know their mutation status.  The study design allows for enrollment of these individuals as it permits subjects and study staff to remain blinded to mutation status.  Mutation negative 
subjects will not be exposed to active study drug.  Mutation positive  subjects will be randomized 
between study drug arms and placebo.  The placebo group of mutation positive  individuals will 
be pooled among the treatment groups  (‘mutation positive placebos’), increasing the statistical 
power of the study.  This use of a pooled placebo group enables a study of more than one 
therapy to be powered with fewer total subjec ts and allows more than 50% to be on an active 
drug, a feature often requested by potential research subjects.  Further, this platform study design also allows for flexibility and for the application of an “adaptive design” for which study drug is used.  F or example, if a study drug failed early due to adverse events or lack of efficacy, a 
new compound could be added to the same protocol and new subjects could be randomized to the actively enrolling study drug arms . 
Secondly, families with mutations linked to DIAD are rare and subjects typically live at a significant distance from DIAN -TU sites.  Because subjects typically work and have family 
responsibilities, there is increased burden of travel and time spent on stu dy activities.  Further, a 
high level of subject retention is essential for the success of the study.  These considerations play 
a significant role in study design.  Subjects who reside outside a reasonable distance from their 
‘host’ trial site will be ask ed to travel to the site only when needed for highly specialized 
assessments (e.g., PET scans, lumbar puncture (LP), and specialized cognitive testing; these occur at least annually).  Regular visits (e.g., for administration of study drugs) may be performed by trial- designated and GCP trained home health nurses or other trial -identified satellite sites.  For 
relevant study drug arms, the 3T safety MRIs that are not part of an Annual Visit may be performed at either the subject’s host DIAN -TU site or a trial- identified location qualified for the 
study near the subject’s home.  For all study drug arms, the annual MRI session will be performed at the subject’s host DIAN -TU site. 
A more traditional study design with separate biomarker and cognitive endpoint tri als would be 
extremely difficult in this cohort for two reasons:  1)  The subject pool is very limited as families with DIAD causing  mutations are rare and 2) a prolonged treatment period (≥  4 years in this 
study) may be needed to determine if the study drugs can slow or prevent cognitive changes in a cohort where over half of the treated subjects are asymptomatic and may be up to 15 y ears 
younger than their estimated  age at onset.  The inclusion of these cognitively normal subjects is 
very important, as they may be most likely to benefit from amyloid -modifying treatments.  
However, the subtle cognitive change in the asymptomatic mutatio n carriers limits the power 
to detect treatment effects when there are small numbers of subjects enrolled.   One method to 
improve the power to detect treatment effects is to include additional control  subjects.  The 
DIAN Observational study (DIAN -OBS) has been following nearly the same protocol as DIAN -TU-

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 37 of 265 001 in order to study the natural history of disease progression in DIAD.  Given the similarities 
of the protocol and the fact that the DIAN -OBS study has contributed approximately 40% of the 
subjects to t he DIAN -TU-001, data will be used from DIAN -OBS subjects who  meet the inclusion 
criteria for DIAN -TU-001 to track disease progression.  The DIAN -OBS data  will be used as 
additional control subjects and will be combined with the placebo group to improve pow er. 
Rationale for Cognitive Run -in Period to Establish Trial Ready Cohort  
  
 
 
 
To determine the potential benefits for statistical power, a detailed simulation analyses was 
conducted in three study cohorts at risk for AD.  Across all datasets, including slopes and 
intercepts from pre -randomization periods as covariates resulted in the largest increases in 
statistical power for a 4 -year simulated trial.  Statistical power increased by 5 -11% depending 
upon randomization scenarios (3:1, 1:1) and the length of the pre -randomization period.  In 
addition, the use of pre -randomization cognitive testing will align the DIAN -TU with ongoing 
initiatives — the Trial Ready Cohort (TRC) for preclinical/prodromal AD (PAD) trials (TRC -PAD; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and the European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia Longitudinal Cohort Study 
(EPAD LCS; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) — that are developing trial -ready populations for AD prevention 
trials (Aisen et al., 2016).

 Number of Subjects and Sites  
Individuals will be recruited by host DIAN -TU sites and may also come from other sources such 
as referring partner sites, and the DIAN -EXR.  DIAN -TU sit es are located globally.  The number of 
sites and locations may be expanded over the course of the study.  
Recruitment of mutation positive  subjects is with baseline CDR 0 to 1 (inclusive) with no more 
than 50% CDR > 0 enrolled.  Mutation positive  groups (a ctive vs. placebo) will be balanced 
proportionally as to number of asymptomatic (CDR 0) and symptomatic (CDR > 0) subjects.  
For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, the recruitment goal was 52 mutation carriers for 
each study drug arm and 34 mutation carriers for the combined placebo group for a total of 138 mutation carriers.  An estimated 72 non -carriers (mutation negative subjects who are unaware 
of their genetic status, estimated to be about 1/3 of total subjects) would also be recruited and will receive placebo.  Recruitment was closed once 52 mutation carriers were enrolled in each active drug group and 34 were enrolled in the mutation positive placebo group.  
 
 
 
 
 
The number of DIAN -TU sites is estimated to be approximately 40 sites globally.  The  
baseline study visit (V2) and annual visits for the  treatment period will be 
conducted at the DIAN -TU site.  Other visits (e.g., visits for dispensing/administration of study 
drugs and cognitive testing) may be performed at the DIAN -TU site or by trial- design ated and 
GCP trained home health nurses or other trial- identified satellite sites.  For relevant study drug 
arms, regular interval 3T safety MRIs will be performed at either the host DIAN -TU site or a trial-
identified location qualified for the study near the subject’s home.  Whenever possible, satellite 
sites for imaging in the US will be sites in the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and/or Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that have experience with AD imaging, assessment and therapeutic trials, and have been qualified by the trial’s MRI central reader.  Preliminary studies suggest that >70% of potential US subjects live within a 2 -hour drive 
of an ADCS and/or ADNI site, so we anticipate the majority of scans will be performed a t these 
sites.  When other sites are needed, satellite imaging sites that are able to complete and upload safety scans will be individually selected and qualified (see section  6.1.16).

 Subject Enrollment and Randomization  
Subjects will be recruited from or may be referred to a host DIAN -TU site for screening.  The 
complexity of the study and the likelihood that many subjects may live at a distance from the 
DIAN -TU site create additional challenges for enrollment.   Individuals interested in the study 
will be provided with an informed consent form (ICF) for review.  
If more than one study drug arm is enrolling, a main ICF will provide detailed information on study design, number and timing of visits and procedures, and the rationale for use of drugs targeting AD pathology.  The ICF will provide information on the route of administration, potential side effects associated with drugs that target amyloid -beta or tau, and study 
procedures.  The ICF will explain that subjects will be assigned randomly to a study drug arm and if more than one of the study drug arms is recruiting simultaneously, they will not be able to choose a specific study drug arm.  If only one drug is enrolling, one ICF may be utilized in the traditiona l fashion.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects (and their legally acceptable representative if the subject is cognitively impaired) will review  the ICF and discuss with study staff on the phone or in- person.  The subject and/or 
representative will only sign the ICF after all questions have been answered.  The study partner will be provided with information on their role in the study and will sign  the ICF; this may be 
part of the main ICF or a separate ICF, as required by local regulations.  
If enrolling directly into a study drug arm, after informed consent is obtained, each subject will be assigned a unique study number  and screening visit (V1) procedures will be completed 
either in the subject’s home by a home health nurse, other trial -identified satellite site, or at 
the DIAN -TU site.  Appropriate documentation of informed consent and screening assessments 
will be monitored by the sponsor and/or sponsor designee.  The baseline visit (V2) at the DIAN -
TU site will be scheduled 2 -8 weeks after completion of the screening visit procedures, and no 
earlier than 6 weeks after the genetics blood draw .  After all baseline measures have been 
completed, and adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria has been verified, the subject will 
be randomized to a study drug arm via the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS, an interactive voice response system (IVRS) may be used at sites where IWRS is not feasible).   The 
subject and study staff at the site will know which study drug arm the subject was assigned but 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 40 of 265 will not know whether the subject was assigned to active drug or placebo.  If more than one 
study drug arm is enrolling subjects, the subject will review a supplemental drug -specific ICF for 
the assigned study drug arm that provides additional details of the frequency of side effects and risk/benefit information for that specific study drug.  
Subjects will receive their first dose of study drug after all vis it procedures have been 
completed and the subject has been randomized.  If a subject decides not to continue in the assigned study drug arm after randomization but prior to dosing, they will be withdrawn from the study and may not be re -randomized to a different study drug arm.  
See details about subject randomization in each drug -specific appendix.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the DIAN -MCE which consists of 4 cognitive measures :  1) The 
Delayed Recall score of the International Shopping List Test, 2) The Delayed Recall score of the Logical Memory IIa subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale -Revised, 3)  The Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test total score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Revised, and 4) The 
Mini -Mental State Examination total score.   
A mixed -effects cognitive multivariate disease progression model ( MDPM) with a proportional 
treatmen t effect will be used to assess statistical differences in the rate of decline, relative to 
the expected years from symptom onset, of the DIAN -MCE  between each active drug and the 
mutation positive placebo s and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects . 
 Additional  Study Endpoints 
The safety and tolerability of the study drugs in individuals who have mutations causing dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease will be important endpoints throughout the study.

Page 41 of 265 The biomarker endpoints used for the interim biomarker analyses are specific for each drug 
based on mechanism of action.  These are listed in each drug -specific appendix  and/or drug -
specific SAP appendix . 
The ultimate goal of therapeutic interventions in DAT is to ameliorate or prevent the cognitive effects of the disease and to prevent the onset or slow the progression of disease symptoms.  Four cognitive measures will be used in the DIAN -MCE  as the primary endpoint (section 3.5).  
Additional clinical and cognitive measures may be included  as additional endpoints (secondary 
or exploratory)  if not already included in the primary outcome measures.  All measures may be 
included in development of more sensitive endpoints .  Cognitive endpoints  may  include testing 
administered via an  electronic platform (Cogstate) and conventional psychometric testing.  
Additional outcome measures include comparisons between each drug and mutation positive 
placebo s and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects for change in values between baseline and endpoint  
for the clinical and cognitive measures listed below  if/as specified in the drug -specific SAP 
appendix . 
Clinical Measures  
Clinical measures to be obtained at the  baseline (V2), and annual visits for  the 
 treatment period will be administered at a host DIAN -TU site include:  
• Clinical Dementia Rating™ (CDR), including Clinical Dementia Rating  Sum of Boxes™  
(CDR- SB) and clinician’s diagnostic assessment  
• Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)  
• Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI -Q) 
• Functional Assessment Scale (FAS)  
• Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
  
 
Complete Cognitive Battery  
Cognitive measures to be obtained at the baseline (V2) and annual visits for the treatment p
eriod will be administered at a host DIAN -TU site and include the iPad administered and 
conventiona l psychometric (pen/paper) tests listed below.

 Safety Endpoints  
This study will assess safety and tolerability in individuals at risk for dominantly inherited AD.  Safety endpoints used will be the incidence and severity of treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment discontinuations .  Analysis will be on an 
intent -to-treat basis.  Clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sig ns, and 12 -lead ECGs will also be 
measured throughout the study.  
Amyloid -related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are a safety endpoint in studies of DAT.  Based on 
the assigned study drug arm, this study may include MRI scans every few months to assess for 
ARIA changes.  ARIA can occur as either cerebral edema (ARIA- E) or as hemorrhages (ARIA- H), 
typically microhemorrhages, but larger hemorrhages and frank infarction have also been 
reported (Sperling, Salloway et al. 2012 ).  MRI scans  will be analyzed for ARIA changes at the 
Mayo Clinic Aging and Dementia Imaging Research (Mayo -ADIR).  The number of 
microhemorrhages (ARIA- H, including both hemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits) and size of 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 46 of 265 areas of edema (ARIA- E) will be monitored at entry and throughout the trial.  Incidence of ARIA 
and comparison to placebo will be made.  
A report of new ARIA changes in a subject will trigger a review by the DIAN -TU Medical Director 
or designee, Project Arm Leader (PAL), and site principal investigator.   This review will include 
contact with the subject or caregiver to assess for any symptoms associated with the changes 
and discussion with the central readers.  The PAL, as a site independent neurologist, will help ensure consistency of decisions within a  study drug arm across sites during the study.  See each 
drug -specific appendix for drug -specific ARIA algorithms.  The DIAN -TU Medical Director will 
ensure consistency across study drug arms and will have final decision -making authority on 
changes in dosi ng of study drug or safety monitoring; this decision should be received by the 
site within 7  days of the report of the new ARIA changes, but no later than the day prior to the 
planned administration of the next dose of medication.  A similar process will b e followed if a 
follow -up MRI shows worsening of a previously reported ARIA.  
Additional assessments based on drug -specific safety concerns are detailed in each drug -
specific appendix (Appendices 3 and 4).  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will assess safety data periodically 
throughout the study.  The DSMB will have timely access to data, including clinical laboratory 
values, ECGs, MRI results, and clinical and cognitive testing scores; this will include access to unblinded data when reques ted.  The DSMB will monitor the incidence of ARIA and comparison 
to placebo.  See section 7.9 and the DSMB charter for additional information.  
 Study Schedule  
The schedule of visits, including drug -specific testi ng and frequency of safety MRIs, for each 
drug is provided in each drug -specific appendix (Appendices 3 and 4).  
 Total Study Duration and Duration of Treatment  
  The treatment duration of each study drug 
arm may
 vary depending on the enrollment rate, the respective sample size, and the treatment 
time needed for the study drug to achieve its goal.  A study drug arm may be stopped early or revised (e.g., dose adjustment or treatment duration), based upon the res ults of the interim 
analyses or information from other clinical trials for the same drug, as outlined in each drug
-
s
pecific appendix.  
F
or the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, subjects will continue to receive blinded 
treatment until every subject  randomized to either the gantenerumab or solanezumab blinded 
study drug arms has received a minimum of 4 years (208 weeks) of treatment or is withdrawn.  Based on the time that was needed for full recruitment, the total duration of the gantenerumab and solanezuma b arms is expected not to exceed 81 months (6.75 years), which allows 33 
months for enrollment and 48 months for treatment.  For subjects enrolled in the first month, 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 47 of 265 the duration of treatment will be approximately 80 months (32+48); for those enrolled in the 
last month, the duration of treatment will be 48 months; and for those enrolled in- between, 
the duration of treatment will be approximately from 48 months to 80 months.  On average, the duration of treatment per subject is about 64 months (5.3 years).  
The sponsor may choose at any time to limit treatment duration to 4 years (208 weeks) for a study drug arm even if some subjects have exceeded this limit at the time of the decision.  
 
 
After the final analysis is complete for a study drug arm, subjects may be eligible to continue or start treatment in the open -label extension period (section 3.10 ) if the study drug arm 
demonstrates clinical or cognitive benefit.

sub-investigator will be responsible for initial read on ECGs done at  
baseline (V2).  In the event that the central read becomes available after study drug is dispensed/administered and is exclusionary when the local read was not, the site principal investigator or designated sub -investigator, in consultation with the Medical 
Director or designee,  will decide if the subject should continue in the study.  A 
discrepancy between the local and central read will not be considered a protocol deviation.  When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the investigator and the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory, the investigator’s interpretation will be used for study entry and immediate subject management.  Interpretations from the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will be used for data analysis and report writing purposes.

by and/or referred to a host DIAN -TU site for screening.  A list of screening labs and 
assessments for the  
 double -blind treatment period is included in section 6.3.2 . 
 Discontinuation/Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1 Crite ria for Discontinuation  
Subjects could be discontinued from the double -blind period or OLE for any of the following 
reasons:  

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 55 of 265 1. Subjects would be discontinued from this study if they were involved in any other 
clinical trial or other research judged not to be  scientifically or medically compatible 
with this study.  Participation in any other concurrent clinical trial that studies an investigational drug or any procedures to improve cognition is not permitted.  
2. Site principal investigator, Medical Director, PAL,  or Medical Monitor decides subject 
should be discontinued, e.g., after an SAE or other clinically significant event or laboratory finding.  See each drug -specific appendix for any drug -specific 
discontinuation criteria related to adverse events and laboratory findings.  
Decisions regarding subjects who have ARIA AEs will be made based on both imaging and clinical factors; decisions will be made by the Medical Director following discussion between site principal investigator or designated sub- investigator, M edical Director 
and/or designee, and Project Arm Leader using drug -specific guidelines in Appendices  3 
and 4. 
3. Subject or subject research proxy (if subject is cognitively impaired and unable to provide their own consent) decides to withdraw consent, including declining to consent to any protocol amendments.  
4. Subject becomes pregnant.  
5. Subject non -compliance, based on decision of site study staff or Medical Monitor.  For 
parenteral drugs administered every 4 weeks, this includes subjects who fall below 75% com pliance with respect to dosing, e.g., those who miss more than 7 study drug doses 
during the four -year study or who miss more than 3 consecutive doses of study drug.  
For daily oral administration, subject non -compliance is to be determined by the 
principal investigator in collaboration with the study medical staff after review of the subject’s study drugs usage.  Determination of non- compliance would not apply to 
doses that are missed or reduced when the site principal investigator and Medical Director dec ide that changes in study drug dosing are necessary for medical or safety 
reasons.  
 
6. Subject can no longer contribute to the collection of key outcomes data.  Thus, a subject 
who cannot contribute to both the biomarker endpoint and cognitive endpoint during 
the first 2 years of the study or the cognitive endpoint after the first 2  years of the study 
should be discontinued from the double -blind treatment period but is eligible for 
continued clinical and/or cognitive follow -up and/or OLE * (refer to section  6.3.7 ). 
7. Known negative mutatio n carrier status.  For example, if a subject enters the study 
unaware of their mutation status, but later learns that they are mutation negative, they 
would be discontinued from the study.

on their family pedigree, but later learns that the at -risk parent is a non -carrier, they 
would be discontinued from the study.  
9. For subjects administered [18F]AV -1451 tau PET tracer, the following additional 
discontinuation criteria ap ply: 
a. Participants who exhibit hypersensitivity to [18F]AV -1451 or any of its excipients 
are to be discontinued from this protocol addendum and are not to have 
another [18F]AV -1451 dose administered.  
b. Discontinuation or Holding of [18F]AV-1451 dose for parti cipants who take 
medications that prolong QT interval:  
i. Participants who begin taking a medication known to prolong QT interval prior to the baseline [
18F]AV -1451 scan will be discontinued.  
ii. Participants who begin taking a medication known to prolong QT inte rval 
after the baseline scan and continue to take medication at the time of the 
next scheduled [18F]AV -1451 scan will be discontinued.  
iii. If a participant receives a course of a QT prolonging medication and has 
stopped taking the medication prior to a schedul ed [18F]AV -1451  scan, 
the advisability of administering the next scheduled dose of [18F]AV -1451 
and performance of the [18F]AV -1451 PET scan or holding the dose of 
[18F]AV -1451 should be considered by the S ite principal investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor  
 
If a subject discontinues early from the double -blind treatment period, every effort will be 
made to complete all study assessments, as applicable, at an Early Termination visit.  These 
assessments would not be completed for subjects who are withdrawn because they become unblinded to genetic status and are found to be mutation negative. 
 
 
*Any subject that discontinues from treatment due to safety reasons or inability to continue treatment and/or key  study procedures will be encouraged to continue with any clinical or 
cognitive measures able to be performed based upon the a ssessment schedule.  The 
assessments will be determined based on discussion with the site principal investigator and sponsor.  
4.4.2 Replacement of S ubjects  
Enrollment for each study drug arm will be ongoing until all groups within the study drug arm are filled.   Subjects will be replaced only when they withdraw from the study before the first 
dose of study drug is dosed/administered.

 Transfer of Subjects Between Sites  
A subject may request a transfer to a different DIAN -TU site if they relocate or if transfer to a 
new site will enable improved compliance with all study visits and procedures.  Should the trial 
be closed at a DIAN -TU site, subjects from the closing site would be offered the option of 
remaining in the study and transferring to another site to compl ete study procedures.  Subjects 
may have some study procedures performed at other DIAN -TU sites if the procedure cannot be 
performed at the host DIAN -TU site (e.g., due to equipment failure).  These subjects would 
remain enrolled at their host DIAN -TU site . 
 Expectations and Withdrawal of Sites  
Sites are expected to fulfill all study obligations.  DIAN -TU sites that fail to fulfill study 
obligations may be terminated from the study.  While a site is on probationary status or if a site is terminated, subjects  at that site will be offered the option of transferring to a different DIAN -
TU site on a temporary or, if the site is terminated, permanent basis.  After obtaining signed release from subjects, copies of all source documents should be made available to th e new site 
as rapidly as possible and at least within 30 days after probationary status begins.  
5 STUDY DRUGS  
See each drug -specific appendix for drug -specific background, preclinical and clinical data, 
rationale for specific biomarkers endpoints to assess t arget engagement , risks/benefits and 
specifics of drug packaging, preparation, administration, compliance, analysis issues, and drug -
specific adverse events, and schedule of visits.  
The following information on blinding, concomitant medications, and treatm ent compliance 
applies to all drugs.  
 Blinding  
Subjects and study staff will remain blinded as to whether subjects are on active drug or placebo.  Subjects and staff will not be blinded as to the treatment route and interval.  Although it is possible that s tudy staff preparing parenterally administered compounds could be 
inadvertently unblinded, procedures are designed to reduce the risk of inadvertent unblinding and to ensure that study staff who might become unblinded (e.g., pharmacists) have minimal conta ct with other study staff and no direct contact with subjects and do not participate in 
other study assessments.  Research staff that do home or remote visits may have one home health nurse prepare and administer study drug while the other home health nurs e conducts 
the study procedures.  The procedures taken to maintain blinding are detailed in each drug -
specific appendix.  
During double -blind periods, genetic status will not be disclosed  to either the subject or study 
staff.  Mutation positive  subjects may  already be aware of their genetic status and choose to 
Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 58 of 265 disclose this to study staff.  The mutation positive  subjects will be  encouraged not to disclose 
their genetic status to study staff.  For s ubjects who have not been provided with their 
mutation status , the  staff will be encouraged not to make assumptions about genetic status or 
group assignment within a study drug arm when adverse events (AEs) are reported.  Genetic 
status will be confirmed for entry into any OLE period.  
 Breaking the Blind  
With the ex ception of the periodic DSMB data review or required regulatory reporting for 
expedited reports by designated safety personnel who do not have contact with study staff or subjects, the study blind will not be broken until all subjects in a blinded study dr ug arm have 
completed the double -blind treatment period and the database for that study drug arm is 
locked.  Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the immediate clinical management or welfare of a specific subject, may the investigator unblind a subject’s treatment assignment.  
Prior to any unblinding, the investigator is strongly advised to discuss options with the Medical Director or appropriate sponsor study personnel or designee.  As soon as possible, and wit hout 
revealing the subject’s study drug assignment (unless important to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the investigator must notify the sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the investigator was unable to contact the sponsor pr ior to unblinding.  The 
investigator will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded 
treatment assignment for that subject . 
 Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded on the Concomitant 
Medication electronic case report form (eCRF).  Subjects will be instructed to consult the investigator or other appropriate study personnel at the site before initiation of any new medications or supplements and before changing dose(s) of any current concomitant medications or supplements.  
To approximate standard of care for AD, use of approved treatments for AD is permitted in this study, and no AD medications are explicitly excluded from use.  This section provides additional guidance on mana ging concomitant medication use during the trial.  
Allowed Medications.  Use of approved treatments for AD (including donepezil [Aricept
], 
rivastigmine [Exelon ], galantamine [Razadyne , Razadyne ER], tacrine [Cognex ], and 
memantine [Namenda ]) is permitt ed during the study, provided that such medications have 
been given for at least 90 days and the dose has been unchanged for 2 months (60 days) before 
 Visit 2.  Doses of these medications should remain constant throughout the 
study.  

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 59 of 265 If a subj ect has recently stopped acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and/or memantine, he 
or she must have discontinued treatment at least 90 days before  Visit 2.  Other 
vitamins or nutraceuticals given for their possible effects on AD may be co ntinued on stable 
doses beginning 90 days before  Visit 2.  
Starting, stopping, or changing doses of AChEIs and/or memantine during the study could 
interfere with outcome measures and may therefore result in discontinuation of the subject from the study.  
Before a subject starts, stops, or changes doses of AChEIs and/or memantine or other treatments for their AD, the sponsor or designee should be contacted to determine whether or not the subject should continue in the study and whether or not clinical outcome measures should be performed.  If documentation of sponsor discussion and approval in advance of starting, stopping, or changing doses is in place, this will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
If changes are made without prior contact with the sponsor or designee, the principal investigator, once informed of these changes, should contact the sponsor or sponsor’s designee to discuss and jointly determine whether or not the subject should continue in the 
study and whether or not clinical outcome measures should be performed.  It will be 
considered as a protocol deviation if discussion and sponsor approval prior to the start, stop, or modification of such medications were not in place  
Non -medication treatments for AD such as psychotherapy are  permitted but are subject to the 
same restrictions as medication treatment taken for AD.  
Other concomitant medications that affect CNS function may be given if the dose remains unchanged throughout the study.  Doses of these compounds should remain consta nt from 
4 weeks before  before randomization (Visit 2).  
To avoid effects on cognitive measures, subjects should not stop receiving any medications that affect CNS function during the study, add any to the treatment regimen, or change d oses of 
these medications.  If unforeseen starting, stopping, or changing of stable doses of these drugs occurs during the study, the Medical Director or designee must be contacted to determine whether or not the subject should continue in the study and whether or not outcome measures should be performed.  
Use of benzodiazepines for treatment on an as -needed basis for insomnia or daily dosing as 
anxiolytics is permitted.  Use of sedatives or hypnotics should be avoided for 8 hours before administration of th e cognitive tests unless they are given chronically.  
 Treatment Compliance 
Compliance will be monitored for all drugs and recorded on study documents.  See each drug -
specific appendix  for specific compliance monitoring for each study drug.

Page 60 of 265 6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 Procedures  
6.1.1 Subject Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures or study -related activities, an IRB or IEC approved Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) must be signed and dated by the subject (and/or caregiver/legally 
acceptable  representative if the subject is cognitively impaired) and by the study partner (if 
required).  Study staff must document the informed consent process in the subject’s source document.  A copy of the signed and dated ICF will be provided to the subject and study partner.  
Because of the co mplexity of this study design, informed consent may occur in two steps when 
more than one drug is recruiting simultaneously.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For subjects enrolling into a treatment period, a main ICF may be used .  The main ICF will 
include a description of the overall study including an overview of possible side effects of the study drugs and differences between study procedures for the different study drug arms.  Subjects signing the main ICF agree to screening and randomization and indicate their intention to enter the study.  After randomization, a supplemental study drug arm- specific ICF document 
may be reviewed with and signed by the subject (and/or caregiver/legally acceptable representative if the subject is cognitively impaired).  This supplemental ICF will contain additional details about the procedures, risks and benefits of the specific study drug arm.  Subjects and their caregivers will have the opportunity to review the main and all supplemental ICFs before they sign the main study informed consent.  This two -step approach i s needed to 
keep the ICF concise as subjects will only be assigned to one study drug arm, and also keeps confidential drug information in separate documents.  In cases where only one drug is enrolling, one informed consent may be used in a more traditional fashion.  
The ICFs must be written in a language fully understood by the prospective subject, study partner, and caregiver/legally acceptable representative (if the subject is cognitively impaired).  The investigator or designee shall give the subject adequate opportunity to read the ICF before 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 61 of 265 it is signed and dated.  Information will be given in both oral and written form, whenever 
possible, and in the manner deemed appropriate by the IRB/IEC.  Subjects must also be given 
ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study.  
Study drug arms that demonstrate potential clinical benefit  may have an open -label extension 
period.  Eligibility criteria must be met and a new written informed consent form will be 
obtained from the subject, study partner (if appl icable) and/or by the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative accordingly.  
The opportunity to donate post -mortem brain tissue will be discussed.  Interested subjects will 
be provided additional details and a brain donation informed consent will be sign ed.  The DIAN -
TU-Neuropathology Core (DIAN -TU-NPC) will conduct a neuropathologic assessment of each 
subject recruited to the DIAN -TU who consents to a brain donation and comes to autopsy.  Each 
participating DIAN -TU center will coordinate with the DIAN -TU-NPC to ensure that a brain 
donation is successful and that tissue will be preserved (freezing one half of the brain and fixing the other hemisphere in formalin) and subsequently transported to the DIAN -TU-NPC.  To 
ensure standardized methods and uniform a ssessment of tissue across DIAN -TU sites, the DIAN -
TU sites and NPC will undertake a neuropathologic assessment as described in the DIAN -TU-
NPC manual.  
6.1.2 Family History/Age at Onset Assessment/Demographics/Study Partner Information  
Family history, specifics of family mutation and age at onset assessment as well as demographic and study partner information will be collected during the  
treatment screening period (V1) and confirmed at the  baseline visit (V2).  See  the 
Global Manual of Operations  for details of the age at onset assessment and the required 
family/pedigree genetic mutation documentation.  
6.1.3 Medical/Treatment History, Concomitant Medications, Adverse Event Assessment  
At all visits, the subject’s clinically significant medical history and names and dosages of all medications will be reviewed.  Medications taken within 90 days of any screening visit (  
V1) will be obtained at the respective visit ( V1) and reviewed at all 
subsequent visits .  Prior medications taken for dementia and any interval changes in 
medications including over -the-counter medications should be reviewed at every visit.  Use of 
alcohol, caffeine, and abused substances will be reviewed.  Interval history and presence and severity of any adverse events will be documented at follow -up visits.  
6.1.4 Clinical Assessment  
The clinical assessment is performed by interviewing the study partner and subject at  baseline (V2), and annual visits for the  treatment period;  
.  

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 62 of 265 Audio recordings of some assessments will be made for quality control; see Global Manual of 
Operations  for details .  The following test instruments will be administered:  
a. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and calculation of CDR -SB.  CDR -SB includes 
supplemental boxes for language and behavior.  
b. Assessment of clinical diagnosis (Clinician judgment of symptoms)  
NOTE: For each subject, the CDR and assessment of clinical diagnosis should be 
administered by the same experienced clinician at all visits.  Whenever possible, the CDR rater should not be involved in other assessments (e.g., MMSE, FAS, GDS, NPI -Q) or in 
cognitive testing.  
c. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)  
d. Functional Assessment Scale (FAS)  
e. Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI -Q) 
f. Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
See the Global Manual of Opera tions for details of administration.  All staff administering 
these batteries must be appropriately trained and certified as specified in the Global Manual 
of Operations  for the trial . 
6.1.5 Physical and Neurological Examination  
Physical examination will include  skin, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph nodes and musculoskeletal.  
A complete neurological examination will also be completed.  At visits after  
baseline, any clinically significant changes will be documented and reported.  
6.1.6 Vital Signs  
 
 
During the treatment period, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will be collected at all visits.  Height will be measured at baseline and at annual visits only and weight will be measured approximately every 3 months starting at baseline.  Weight may be obtained at a medical facility where subjects receive safety MRIs or at the subjects’ home.  
6.1.7 Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG or a triplicate ECG will be performed at the indicated visits based on the 
 study  drug arm requirements.  Refer to each drug -specific appendix for more 
details.  
 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 63 of 265 For the treatment periods, a central read vendor will be utilized.  The site principal investigator 
or designated sub -investigator will be responsible for initial read on ECGs done at baseline (V2).  
In the event that the central read becomes available after study drug is administered and is 
exclusionary when the local read was not, the site principal investigator or designated sub -
investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor or Medical Director, will decide if the subject should continue in the study .  A discrepancy between the local and central read will not 
be considered a protocol deviation.  When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the investigator and the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory, the investigator’s interpretatio n will be used for study entry and immediate subject management.  
Interpretations from the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will be used for data analysis and report writing purposes.  ECGs done at visits conducted at sites other than the DIAN -TU site 
may be done at a sponsor approved local site or by a home health nurse.  These will be sent to the central reader and will also be available to the host DIAN -TU site.  
6.1.8 C-SSRS  
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be administered at s creening (V1), 
baseline (V2) and approximately every 3 months thereafter for the first 2 years (until V28 
[week  104]) during the treatment period.  The C -SSRS will be administered approximately every 
6 months for years 3 and 4, and then annually for the remaining duration of the study.   
 
6.1.9 Genetic Testing  
Determination of mutation status for DIAD causing variants ( APP, PSEN1 , PSEN2 ) and APOE  
genotype will be performed in the trial -designated  CLIA -approved laboratory at  
screening (V1).  The results from the CLIA- approved laboratory will be used for purposes of 
the DIAN -TU-001 study (e.g., for randomization) but will not be communicated to the subjects 
or sites.  Subjects wh o wish to learn their DIAD mutation status would be referred for genetic 
counseling and testing.  
Blood samples for provenance
3F6 testing will be obtained at the  baseline visit.  
 
For an open -label extension (OLE) period, if the subject does not know their genetic status and 
is interested in joining the OLE , the clinical genetic report generated from th e study ’s genetic 
testing  at trial entry  can be provided to the appropriate party managing the genetic counseling 
and disclosure for the subject , i.e. , the  PI or genetic counselor . 
                                                      
6 Provena nce testing is performed for quality assurance purposes to ensure that genetic blood sample obtained at 
baseline visit is from the same individual as the sample obtained at the screening visit .

Page 64 of 265 6.1.10  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory testing includes hematology with differential, chemistry (including liver 
enzyme tests and electrolytes), and urinalysis (macro and micro).  In addition, TSH, B12 levels, 
hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR are obtained only at the  screening visit (V1).  
Refer to the centr al laboratory manual for a complete list of analytes to be tested.  
Clinical laboratory samples will be obtained and sent to a central laboratory for analysis.  
 
 Laboratory values obtained at screening (V1) must be reviewed prior to 
completion of baseline (V2) biomarker measures (PET imaging, vMRI, LP -CSF).  The site principal 
investigator or designated sub- investigator must review all laboratory  results and document 
any clinically meaningful abnormal results as an AE; see section 7.1.1  for criteria to determine if 
an abnormal result is clinically meaningful.  If results from the central laboratory for coagulation studies are unavailable at the baseline visit, results from a local laboratory may be used to confirm that a subject is able to continue with baseline visit procedures, including randomization and study drug dosing.  Central lab samples should be sent and used for study reporting purposes.  Any clinically meaningful abnormal result that occurs during the course of 
the study (after screening) should be repeated within an appropriate time frame (as 
determined by the site principal investigator or designated sub- investigator and/or Medical 
Director or designee).  
Refer to section  7 (Safety and Adverse Events) for further details regarding adverse events.  
Pregnancy testing – women of childbearing potential only  
 
 uring the treatment period, serum pregnancy testing will be 
performed at screening (V1), V54, and V93 and urine pregnancy testing will be performed at all other visits.  Pregnancy tests must be confirmed as negative prior to dosing with study drug.  Urine pregnancy test must be completed and confirmed as negative either the day of or the day prior to any PET scan.  
NOTE:  Women who have undergone tubal ligation are required to have pregnancy testing performed as scheduled at all treatment visits.  In cases where urine collection proves difficult based on a subject’s symptom progression, e.g., incontinence, alternative methods for 
pregnancy testing may be used with prior sponsor approval.  
6.1.11  Drug- specific Testing  
There will be specific laboratory tests for each study compound (e.g., drug levels for 
pharmacokinet ics [PK], immunological monitoring for immunotherapy including anti- drug 
antibodies  [ADA]) .  Frequency and specific visit requirements will be specified in each drug -
specific appendix.  Refer to the central laboratory manual  and the  Global Manual of Operat ions 
for additional details on specific sample collection and processing procedures.

FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 65 of 265 6.1.12  Stored Samples (Plasma and/or Serum and DNA)  – Treatment Period Only  
Selected samples (e.g., plasma and/or serum and DNA), will be collected and stored for future 
use so t hat testing for as yet undiscovered biomarkers can be performed (including, but not 
limited to, protein biomarker identification, single -gene or genome- wide analyses, epigenetics).  
Stored samples may also be used to address regulatory inquiries or for add itional monitoring of 
anti-drug antibodies or other drug -specific analyses.  
Type of samples to be collected, frequency, and specific visit requirements are specified in the 
drug -specific schedule of visits.  Refer to the central laboratory manual for additional details on 
specific sample collection and processing procedures.  
The biomarkers chosen as endpoints for this study were based on currently available data, but new biomarkers are likely to emerge in the coming years.  These samples will be used for fu ture 
studies on the mechanism of action of Alzheimer’s treatments and other studies related to neurodegenerative disorders under the supervision of Washington University and the DIAN -TU.  
These samples will be stored using the subject identification number ; samples will be stored 
indefinitely unless otherwise specified.  Collection and storage of these samples is mandatory unless prohibited by local laws.  
6.1.13  Study Drug Administration  
For study drugs with parenteral administration (IV or SC), the first dose of study drug will be given at the host DIAN -TU site.  For subjects who live at a distance from the host DIAN -TU site, 
subsequent doses may be administered by the trial -designated home health nurses or at other 
trial- identified locations.  Study staff who adm inister study drugs should have training and 
supplies necessary to treat allergic reactions including anaphylaxis.   
Details of study drug administration or dispensing should be recorded; see Global Manual of Operations  for details.  
Requirements for monito ring subjects after study drug administration are detailed in each drug -
specific appendix.  
For the study drug administration visits following the occurrence of a safety MRI, the site 
principal investigator or designated sub -investigator must review the MRI  central read prior to 
proceeding with the subsequent dose administration for parenterally administered treatments . 
6.1.14  Cognitive Testing  
The Complete Cognitive Battery will be performed annually  at the host DIAN -TU site.  The 
cognitive testing should be perfo rmed early in the day before other invasive or stressful 
procedures.  See DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual for additional details and suggested timing for administration of cognitive testing.  
A subset of the testing battery (the Cognitive Battery Subset) will be performed approximately every 6 months.  See DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual for details of

baseline [V2], and the week 52 [V15], 104 [V28], 156 [V41], 208 [V54], 260 [V67], 312 [V80], 
and 364 [V93] visits, will include structural and functional MRI and other additional MRI 
endpoints in addition to sequences for safety monitoring.  All MRIs, including safety MRI scans performed off site, if applicable (see section 6.1.16  below), will utilize standardized sequences 
that include fluid -attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2* -weighted gradient -recalled -
echo (GRE) sequences.  Additional scheduled safety MRI assessments between annual visits may be scheduled based on study drug arm (see each drug -specific appendix).  
MRIs use a standardized protocol specified by the DIAN -TU Imaging Core (see MR I Technical 
Manual for specific sequences ).  The DIAN -SHORT protocol, a core set of MR sequences 
necessary for safety MR and PET processing, will be used for off- site MRIs and may be used at 
the host site for those whom, in the estimation of the site principal investigator, would not be able to complete the full -length protocol (e.g., subjects who are unable to remain still for the 
full MR session, approximately 45 minutes in duration).  MRI should be perform ed before 
lumbar puncture (if on the same day) or scheduled to be on a different day than the lumbar puncture.  
Scanners will be evaluated and qualified by the Mayo -ADIR Clinic prior to subject scanning, and 
ongoing quality control of the MRI scans will be performed at the Mayo -ADIR Clinic.  
MRIs will be uploaded to the trial -designated imaging data management system (DIAN Central 
Archive [DCA]).

Page 71 of 265 Images should be uploaded within 24 -48 hours of scan completion; failure to upload the images 
within 3 working day s of receipt of the images will be considered a protocol deviation.  Images 
from the  baseline MRI (V2), and all annual visit MRIs should be 
uploaded immediately  after these scans are completed as the findings of these MRIs can  
impact inclusion in the study (  baseline [V2] MRI) and thereafter alter 
dispensing/administration of next dose(s) of study drug.  
Volumetric analysis of the baseline and the annual MRIs will be performed by Washington 
University and will include measures of hippocampal volume,  ventricular volume and whole 
brain volume.  Site investigators will not receive results of the volumetric analysis.  All MRI 
scans will be analyzed for amyloid -related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and for incidental 
findi ngs at the Mayo -ADIR Clinic; this includes safety MRIs (see section 6.1.16  below).  Findings 
on the baseline MRI will determine eligibility; therefore, results of the baseline read will be made available before randomization and first dispensing/administering of study drug.  ARIA findings during the study may result in a change or halting of study drug dosing; see each drug -
specific appendix for additional information.  See Global Manual of Operations  for additio nal 
details and MRI Technical Manual for technical information.  
 
6.1.16  Safety Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
Safety MRIs on 3T scanners will be done primarily to monitor for ARIA.  Safety MRIs may be done at the host DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a distance from the host DIAN -TU site, 
at a site closer to the subject’s home in order to reduce subject travel burden.  When not performed at the DIAN -TU site, sa fety MRIs may be performed at an ADNI/ADCS site if possible 
or at a 3T scanner near the subject’s home.  Local centers not previously qualified as a DIAN, ADCS or ADNI -equivalent site will be pre -qualified for the DIAN -TU trial protocol by the 
Mayo -ADIR Cl inic.  With the exception of the MRIs done at the DIAN -TU site during annual 
visits, safety MRIs should be performed on the same scanner throughout the trial.  
Standardized sequences will be used for these scans and will include fluid -attenuation inversion 
recovery (FLAIR) and T2* -weighted gradient- recalled -echo (GRE) sequences.  See MRI Technical 
Manual  for additional information.  Satellite sites will ship MRI images on CD to the host DIAN -
TU site, preferably within 24 -48 hours and at the most within 3 wor king days.  The host DIAN -
TU site should upload the images to the imaging data management system (DCA) within 2 
working days of receipt.  Satellite sites may directly upload images to  the DCA only by prior 
agreement with Washington University.  Sites must ensure that study visits are scheduled so 
that MRI images are uploaded and available for central read at least 10 working days before next administration of study drug for parenterally administered drugs.  
A central read for safety purposes (e.g., analysis of ARIA) will be completed at the Mayo -ADIR 
Clinic within 1 week (5 working days) of upload for routine exams, for the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms; and within 24 hours for the MRIs done for all drug arms at

The central read results will be communicated to site principal investigators (site PIs) or 
designated sub -investigator, Project Arm Leader (PAL), and Medical Director or designee.  This 
communication will occur at least one week before the next scheduled drug dispensing/administration.  Extent of ARIA -E and presence of definite and possible ARIA -H 
changes will be reported; reports including significant or new definite findings will be flagged for review by site principal investigator or designated sub -investigator, PAL, and sponsor 
Medical Director or designee.  The site principal investigator or designated sub -investigator will 
review the findings and drug -specific guidelines for dosing adjustment (see each  drug -specific 
appendix) with the PAL.  The PAL will confer with the Medical Director or designee who has final authority on dose adjustment decisions (e.g., extra study visit, repeat or more frequent safety MRIs, suspension of study drug administration or  dose adjustment; see each drug -
specific appendix for discussion of ARIA -related interventions).  The Medical Director has the 
final decision on whether a dose is released for treatment.  See Global Manual of Operations  
for further details on communication  between the site principal investigator or designated sub-
investigator, PAL, and Medical Director or designee.  See MR I Technical Manual for technical 
information.  
When an imaging visit precedes a visit where study drug is parenterally administered, it is  the 
responsibility of the DIAN -TU site principal investigator or designated sub -investigator to review 
the central read safety MRI results before study drug administration and communicate any 
changes in study drug administration to the site staff or home health nurse preparing and 
administering the study drug . 
Local read for safety MRIs is not required for purposes of this study but should be performed if needed in accordance with local requirements.  Should a local read be obtained and be different from t he central read, central read has priority for study purposes.  
6.1.17  Lumbar Puncture (LP) – Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)  
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for biomarkers will be performed at baseline (V2) and at week 52 (V15), 104 (V28) and 208 (V54) visits.  CSF will be obtained by lumbar puncture (LP) 
performed at the host DIAN -TU site.

Page 73 of 265 A sample of CSF will be sent to a local lab for cell counts and differential as well as glucose and 
protein measurement; each site should confirm with their local lab the volume of CSF needed 
for these studies.  CSF biomarkers are the biomarker endpoint for some of the study drug a rms.  
At least 15 -20 mL CSF should be sent for biomarker analysis; this is in addition to the CSF 
obtained for the local lab studies.  If less than 15 mL is collected for biomarker analysis at the 
baseline visit, contact the sponsor prior to dispensing/administration of study drug to determine if subject is eligible to remain in the trial.  See central laboratory manual  and the  
Global Manual of Operations for additional details regarding LP and collection, processing and shipping of CSF samples . 
The LP shou ld be performed in the morning, at approximately 8 am local time, under fasting 
conditions (water is allowed and encouraged).  LPs should be conducted as close to the 
baseline collection time as possible at each subsequent visit.  CSF should be collected using the traditional gravity drip method.  Sites should obtain approval from the sponsor, before LP is performed, for the use of alternative methods or needles (e.g., aspiration if using a very small gauge needle, use of a needle type/size other than the sponsor mandated needle outlined in the Global Manual of Operations  and provided to the sites for use).  If LP proves technically 
difficult, early referral for LP under fluoroscopy is expected.  
6.1.18  Positron Emission Tomography  
  
 
For all study drug arms, PET imaging with selected tracers will be performed at baseline (V2), at 
the week 52 (V15), 104 (V28), and 208 (V54) visits  of the double -blind period , and potentiall y at 
baseline and annually during the open -label extension  contingent on results of the double -blind 
period . 
 
 
 
 
The type of PET imaging is drug -specific (see each drug -specific appendix) any may include one 
or more of the following:

Page 74 of 265 Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C]PiB -PET) PET Imaging – Gantenerumab and Solanezumab Arms 
Only  
[11C]PiB -PET imaging will be performed a t the host DIAN -TU site at baseline (V2) and at the 
weeks 52 (V15), 104 (V28), and 208 (V54) visits  of the double -blind period ,  
 
 
  
[11C]PiB -PET imaging may be performed at other trial- qualified sites if the host DIAN -TU site is 
unable to perform PET imaging.  For each subject, the same scanner should be used for all 
[11C]PiB -PET imaging sessions.  See PET Technical Procedures Manual  for addit ional details.  
[11C]PiB -PET manufacturing and imaging protocols will be standardized across all participating 
sites.  Certus International will audit and qualify [11C]PiB manufacturing and conduct ongoing 
QC of PiB batch records.  The University of Michig an will provide quality control on [11C]PiB -PET 
images.  Images will be uploaded the imaging data management system, DCA.  Image 
processing and analyses will be performed by Washington University.  
For women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test must be completed and confirmed 
as negative  before  the first PET scan.  If PET scans are spread over more than one day, a urine 
pregnancy test should be completed either the day of or day prior to any PET scan.  
Scan Acquisition:  Subject preparation consis ts of intravenous catheterization followed by the 
bolus injection (over 10 -60 sec) of [11C]PiB at dosage: 8 -18 mCi.  There are two acceptable 
procedures for obtaining the [11C]PiB -PET scans.  In one approach, a 30 -minute scan will be 
started 40 minutes pos t-[11C]PiB -PET injection.  The other approach involves a 70 -minute 
dynamic scan that is started at the time of PiB injection.  Further details of the PiB -PET scan 
acquisition are outlined in the PET Technical Procedures Manual . 
Subjects should be scanned on the same scanner at weeks 52 (V15), 104 (V28), and 208 (V54) 
visits  as was utilized at the baseline visit, unless the subject changes DIAN -TU sites.  In the event 
an issue arises where a scanner becomes unavailable, a site may get sponsor approval to be scanned on another DIAN -TU approved scanner if there is one available to them and it is 
allowable per IRB/IEC guidelines.  
Florbetapir PET Imaging  – Gantenerumab and Solanezumab Arms Only  
For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms only , PET imaging with flor betapir F18 (an [
18F] 
amyloid imaging agent, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc.) will be performed at baseline, week 104 (V28), and week 208 (V54) visits at the host DIAN -TU site.  Florbetapir PET imaging may be 
performed at other trial- qualified sites if the  host site is unable to perform PET imaging.   
For each subject, the same scanner should be used for all florbetapir- PET imaging sessions.  For 
US sites, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc. will provide florbetapir 
18F and will provide

Page 75 of 265 certification of imaging  centers for performance of florbetapir 18F imaging.  Images will be 
uploaded to the imaging data management system, DCA.  Image analyses will be performed by 
Washington University.   For global sites, florbetapir 18F amyloid imaging will be performed in 
compliance with local regulations.  Florbetapir 18F imaging may be optional for some global 
sites based on its availability at the discretion of the sponsor.  
For women of childbearing potential , a urine pregnancy  test must be completed and confirmed 
as nega tive before  the first PET scan.  If PET scans are spread over more than one day, a urine 
pregnancy test should be completed either the day of or one day prior to any PET scan.  
Scan Acquisition:  See PET Technical Procedures Manual  for additional details.  S ubject 
preparation consists of intravenous catheterization followed by the bolus injection (over 
10-60 sec) of 10 mCi  of florbetapir 18F.  Doses administered that are within 10% of the protocol-
required dose per standard clinical practice will not be considered a protocol deviation.  There are two acceptable procedures for obtaining the florbetapir 
18F PET scans.  In one approach, 
approximately 40 minutes after injection, the subject will be positioned in the scanner to undergo a scan lasting 20 minutes.  The scan will start 50 minutes after injection (note the temporal difference from PiB -PET).  In the second approach, the subject will be positioned in 
the scanner at the time of injection and a 70 -minute scan will be obtained starting at the time 
of injecti on. 
Fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG -PET)  – Gantenerumab and Solanezumab Arms Only  
For the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms only , uptake of 2 -[
18F]fluoro -2-deoxy-D- glucose 
(FDG -PET) will be performed  for subjects enrolled in selected study drug arms at baselin e (V2) 
and at the weeks 52 (V15), 104 (V28), and 208 (V54) visits  of the double -blind period, 
 
  
 
 
FDG -PET will be done at the host DIAN -TU sites using DIAN -TU protocol as specified in the PET 
Technical Procedures Manual .  FDG -PET imaging may be performed at other trial- qualified sites.  
For each subject, the same scanner should be used for all FDG -PET imaging sessions.  Subjects 
should be fasting for 4 hours before the FDG -PET is performed.  The University of Michigan will 
provide quality control on FDG -PET images.  Images will be uploaded to the imaging data 
management system, DCA.  Image analyses will be performed by Washington University.  
For women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test must be completed and confirmed 
as negative  before any PET scan.  If PET scans are spread over more than one day, a urine 
pregnancy test should be completed either the day of or day prior to any PET scan.

Page 76 of 265 Scan Acquisition:  Typically, the PiB -PET scans will precede the FDG scans on the same day; 
however, this arrangement is for convenience to the subject and coordinators but is not a 
requi rement (see Global Manual of Operations  for schema).  After completion of PiB -PET 
scanning, subjects will be moved to a dimly lit, quiet room and 5 mCi  of FDG will be injected as 
a bolus.  Doses administered that are within 10% of the protocol- required dose per standard 
clinical practice will not be considered a protocol deviation.  About 20 minutes later, subjects 
will be repositioned in the PET scanner, and FDG PET scans will be acquired in dynamic, 3D mode beginning 30 min (+/ - 30 seconds) after injectio n of FDG for 30 min (consisting of 6 x 5 
min frames).  Details of the PET scan acquisitions are outlined in the PET Technical Procedures 
Manual . 
Tau PET Imaging  
The DIAN -TU-001 trial provides a critical opportunity to investigate the potential for tau 
imaging to enhance basic understanding of the evolution of tau pathology during the Alzheimer’s disease process, to understand the relationship between tau imaging and tau measurements in CSF and may support a role for tau imaging as a new surrogate biomarker. 
 
Fo
r all study drug arms, tau  scans  will be performed  at the host DIAN -TU site at  baseline (V2 ), 
and week 52 (V15), 104 (V28), and 208 (V54)  visits.  Refer to the below individual tracer details, 
drug -specific appendices, and any active protocol addenda  for the individual tracer to be used 
and schedule to be followed.  
 
 
 
[18F]AV-1451 PET – Gantenerumab and Solanezumab Arms Only  
The gantenerumab and solanezumab arms utilize the [18F]AV -1451 tracer (Avid 
Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc.).  Since not all sites have access to [18F]AV -1451 necessary to 
perform the tau PET scan, this measure is included as an addendum for the double -blind period 
rather than as part of the main  study protocol.  
Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc. will provide [18F]AV -1451 and will provide certification of 
imaging centers for performance of [18F]AV -1451 imaging.  Images will be uploaded to th e 
imaging data management system, DCA.  Image analyses will be performed by Washington University.  Specific imaging acquisition protocols designed to ensure consistency across sites will be provided in a technical manual.  The scanning technologist will b e blinded to the

Page 77 of 265 subject’s treatment assignment (e.g., whether subject is on active or placebo treatment in the 
DIAN -TU-001 study).  
Women of childbearing potential are to have a confirmed negative pregnancy test (HCG) on the day of [
18F]AV -1451 PET imaging  session, before [18F]AV -1451 dose administration. If PET scans 
are spread over more than one day, a pregnancy test should be completed either the day of or one day prior to any PET scan.  
Scan Acquisition:  See PET Technical Procedures Manual  for additional details. PET/CT is the 
preferred imaging modality for [
18F]AV -1451 imaging.  In the event an issue arises where a 
scanner becomes unavailable, a site may get sponsor approval to be scanned on another DIAN -
TU approved scanner if there is one available to them and it is allowable per IRB/IEC guidelines.   
There are two acceptable procedures for obtaining the [18F]AV -1451 PET scans:  
1. The preferred option will be for subjects to receive a single IV bolus injection of approximately (240 MBq) 6.5 mCi  of [
18F]AV -1451 injection followed by a saline flush.  
Scanning will start at the same time as the injection and continue for a total of 105 minutes.  If needed, the subject may take up to a 15 -minute break after the first 60 
minutes of scanning, and scanning should re sume immediately after the break.  
2. For subjects that are not able to tolerate or who do not wish to undergo the full -length 
scan, a continuous 30 -minute brain scan (6 acquisitions of 5 -minute duration) should be 
performed with scanning to start approximatel y 75 minutes following injection.  
3. DOSE PREP ARATION: To allow for a convenient injection volume of greater than 1  mL, 
[
18F]AV -1451 may be diluted aseptically with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection to a maximum dilution of 1:5 by the end- user.  Diluted product should be 
used within 3 hours of dilution.  
The injection site will be observed for evidence of inflammation or damage to the surrounding tissue where the dose was injected and the subject will be requested to void after completion of the PET scans.  Subjects will be observed continuously for signs of adverse events (AE) or 
serious adverse events (SAE).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Information on the tau PET tracer and additional details regarding tau PET scanning, including pre- and post -imaging procedures, will be included in the PET Technical Procedures  Manual .

Note that  the figure does not contain all assessments to be performed during the study but is 
intended to present an overview of the study chronology.  Figure 3 shows the visit flow for 
subjects who live at a distance from a DIAN -TU site and have many study visits performed at 
home.  These visits can be performed at the host DIAN -TU site for subjects who live nearby or, 
for subjects who live at a distance from the host DIAN -TU site, in the  subject’s home or another 
trial- identified location more convenient for the subject.  Visits performed in the home or other 
sites will be performed by a GCP trained home health nurse who has been trained in DIAN -TU 
procedures.

6.3.2 Screening  (Visit 1)  
The screening period that immediately precedes enrollment into a study drug arm may last up 
to 8 weeks, starting at the collection of the first screening procedure (e.g., clinical laborat ory, 
cognitive testing).  
 
 
 
 
 
Location:  Visit 1 procedures may be accomplished at the DIAN -TU site or at the subject’s home 
or other tr ial-identified location with the trial- designated home health nurse.  This visit also 
includes telephone calls with the DIAN -TU site staff.  The subject may be contacted by their 
host DIAN -TU site by telephone or during a regular DIAN Observational study v isit.  The subject 
is given the opportunity to review the informed consent form(s), ask question and obtain answers, and sign the main ICF (if multiple drug arms are enrolling) or the stand -alone ICF.  
Time/Timing:   Informed consent must be obtained before any other study procedures.  
Informed consent, family history, demographic information and medical and treatment history may be obtained before the 8 -week screening period begins.  Informed consent should be 
obtained from both subject and study partner.  U nless otherwise specified, all other Visit 1 
procedures may occur throughout the screening period (2 -8 weeks before baseline [V2]).  
IMPORTANT: Results from screening clinical laboratory tests and genetic testing must be 
available before baseline (V2); blo od draw for genetic testing must be completed at least 6 
weeks before V2 to ensure genetic results are available for baseline randomization .   
  The screening visit in the home ensures 
s
ubject eligibility before travel (if applicable) to the DIAN -TU site for baseline testing and 
randomization.  
Procedures  (all can be performed by DIAN -TU site staff or trial -designated and trained home 
health nurse or other staff except as noted- see Global Manual of Operations  and DIAN Trials

procedures):  
• Obtain informed consent (DIAN -TU site staff should be available to answer questions)  
• Obtain or confirm family history and determine parental estimated age at onset or subject’s actual age at onset (DIAN -TU site staff), .  
Estimated age at onset should be determined as outlined in the Global Manual of Operations . 
• Verify documentation of subject’s trial eli gible mutation status OR confirm via family 
pedigree and mutation documentation (proband) that the subject is at 50% risk for a trial- eligible mutation,  
• Collect demographic information and study partner information,  
 
• Obtain medical and treatment history, i ncluding assessment/recording of pre -existing 
conditions or adverse events;  
. 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature).  Weight is 
not required at this visit but the subject’s self- reported weight may be noted if required 
for laboratory tests.  
• Blood draw:  
o genetic testing ( NOTE : genetic testing blood sample must be obtained at least 
6 weeks prior to Visit 2 to ensure availability for baseline randomization;  
.) 
o clinical laboratory tests, including TSH, B12, hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR  
o serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  
• Urine collection for urinalysis  
• Administration of C -SSRS  
• Cognitive testing (Screening Cognitive Battery),   
See section  6.1.14  
• 
  
 
A study -s pecific subject identification number is assigned to the subject by the interactive web response syste m (IWRS),  
.  Visit 2 is not scheduled to occur until the results of the clinical 
laboratory tests are available and the results of genetic testing are entered in IWRS.   
  Results of genotyping of APOE  and DIAD -
associated genes ( APP, PSEN1 , and PSEN2 ) are not sent to the site to ensure genetic blinding is 
maintained  during double -blind treatment period s, however may be provided for OLE 
qualification as specified in section 6.1.9 .

Page 84 of 265 6.3.3 Baseline (Visit 2/First Dose)  
Location:  Host DIAN -TU site. 
Time/Timing:   Approximately a 3 -4 day visit that is scheduled 2 -8 weeks after the screening visit 
and at least 6 weeks after the genetic sample draw ,  
.  This visit can only take place after results from safety screening labs are 
documented as consistent with inclusion/exclusion criteria before Visit 2  occurs.  Genotyping 
results will need to be confirmed as received and having completed analysis but no results will 
be provided or reviewed by site staff.  The study partner participates in some of the procedures at Visit 2 and other annual visits at the DIAN -TU site.  If possible, the study partner should 
accompany the subject to the DIAN -TU site for these visits.  If this is not possible, the study 
partner procedures can be completed via telephone.  The sequence and timing of visit procedures is very imp ortant.  Detailed requirements and suggested timing of events at Visit 2 
and at subsequent annual visits (V15, V28, V41, V54, V67, V80, and V93) are detailed in the Global Manual of Operations .  Baseline visit procedures may be scheduled over a longer time  
period of up to 2 weeks for subjects who live near the study site or in the event that some study procedures (e.g., PET imaging) are done at a different DIAN -TU site.  
Notes : Although participating in the DIAN -TU study does not require that subjects know 
whether they have a mutation associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, it will 
be recommended that all subjects undergo genetic counseling prior to starting assigned study drug.  Subjects in the study might guess (correctly or incorrectly) w hether they are on active 
drug because specific side -effects may occur more often with the active drug compared to the 
placebo therapy, therefore disclosing mutation status.  
The date during Visit 2 when the first dose of study drug is dosed/administered should be used for determining the timing of all subsequent visits.  
Procedures:  
• In-person review of informed consent for subjects who provided consent over the 
telephone  
• Medical/treatment history, including:  
o Concomitant medications  
o Assessment /recording of p re-existing conditions or adverse events  
• Urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential  
• Blood draw  for the following :  
o provenance
F7 testing of Screening genetic sample [to confirm specimen identity]; 
 
o clinical laboratory tests  (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis)  
o pharmacokinetic (PK) samples  
                                                      
7 Provenance testing is performed for quality assurance purposes to ensure that blood sample obtained at baseline 
visit is from same individual as sample obtained at screening visit.

confirm eligibility  (if required for specific study drug, e.g., number of microhemorrhages), 
pregnancy test is confirmed negative, and any other drug -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria 
have been verified.  
6.3.4 Double -blind Treatment Period  
The double -blind treatment period for each study  drug arm will vary based on when the subject 
was enrolled and may last from 4 up to 7 years (364  weeks [V93]) or until early termination, 
whichever is sooner.  Subjects will continue treatment with the assigned study drug until every 
subject randomized to  that study drug arm has received a minimum of 4 years (208 weeks) of 
treatment or is withdrawn.  After the double -blind treatment period is completed, subjects may 
be eligible to continue treatment in an open- label extension if the study drug arm 
demonstr ates a potential for clinical benefit.  
Location:  Monthly procedures/contacts may be accomplished at/by the DIAN -TU site, at the 
subject’s home, or other trial- identified location with the trial -designated home health nurse.  
Annual visits will take place at the host DIAN -TU site.  
Time/Timing:  Every 4 weeks (+/ - allowed visit window) until the last subject in a study drug arm 
has completed their year 4 visit, or the study drug arm has been terminated.   Refer to the drug -
specific appendices for allowable v isit windows.  
Visit duration depends on specific visit and study drug (e.g., infusion time, observation time after infusion).  Note that annual visits may take place over 3 -4 days.  For subjects who live near 
the study site, these visit procedures may be s cheduled over a longer time period of up to 2 
weeks.  
Procedures: See each drug -specific appendix for the specific assessments that are required at 
each visit.  Procedures may  include any of the following:  
• Medical/treatment history, including:  
o Concomitant m edications  
o Assessment /recording of adverse events  
• Urine pregnancy testing, if applicable  
• Laboratory sample collection (e.g., drug -specific tests, stored plasma and/or serum, and 
clinical safety assessment as outlined in the drug -specific appendices)  
• Admin istration of C -SSRS  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, weight and height)  
• Physical and neurological examinations

should contact the subject 24 -48 hours after the LP to assess for adverse effects of the 
LP. 
• PET imaging  
• Study drug  administration  
• Site phone call (not required after all off- site visits but direct site -subject contact should 
occur at least once every 3 months throughout the study): the DIAN -TU site coordinator 
calls subject and addresses any concerns, discusses scheduling of safety MRI and/or next 
visits, and encourages compliance.  
6.3.5 End-of-Treatment / Safety Follow -up Visit  
The double -blind treatment period for each subject may vary based on when the subject was 
enrolled and may last from 4 (208 weeks [V54]) up to 7 years (364 weeks [V93]) or until early 
termination, whichever is sooner.  Subjects will continue treatment with the assigned study 
drug un til every subject randomized to the study drug arm has received a minimum of 4 years 
(208 weeks) of treatment or is withdrawn, a t which time study treatment will be discontinued 
for all subjects in the study drug arm and all subjects should be scheduled fo r an end -of-
treatment/safety follow -up visit.   Based on the date of the last subject randomization 
(December 2015), the last subject will have received 4 years treatment and all double -blind 
treatment visits will be concluded  by November 2019.  Any visits scheduled to occur on or 
before the sponsor -specified cut -off date (November 2019) should be conducted as usual and 
will be the final dosing visits for all subjects.  All subjects will then be scheduled for their 
respective end -of-study or safety follow -up visit relative to the subject’s last dose within the ir 
drug -specific visit window.  
Location:  Procedures/contacts may be accomplished at the DIAN -TU site or subject’s home or 
other trial- identified location with the trial- designated home health nurse.

6.3.7 Early Termination/Post -treatment Follow -up 
If a subject withdraws, is terminated from the study prior to completion of the double- blind 
treatmen t period, or is in a study drug arm that is stopped prior to the end of the double -blind 
treatment period, every effort should be made to schedule an early termination visit.  PET 
imaging studies may be omitted if early termination occurs less than 6 month s after the 
previous PET imaging or if precluded by local regulations/dosimetry limits.  Other procedures may also be eliminated on a case -by-case basis, as determined by the sponsor or if not required 
based on the study drug arm procedures or study  period . 
Any subject that meets study drug discontinuation criteria per section 4.4.1 (excluding subjects 
who are known mutation negative) will be encouraged to continue participation in any of the scheduled clinical, cognitive, and/or biomarker assessments that are able to be performed even though dosing has concluded.  The determination of which assessments to be attempted/completed will be decided with the site principal investigator and sponsor based on the subject’s capabilities, the benefit to the study, and the risk associated with continued participation at the time of study drug discontinuation.  The level of continued participation may change if/as the subject’s status changes.  
Location:  DIAN -TU site or at the  subject’s home or other trial -identified location with the trial -
designated home health nurse  
Time/Timing:  The early termination visit may occur at any time during the study.  Approximately a 3 -4 day visit.  For subjects who live near the study site, the se visit procedures 
may be scheduled over a longer time period of up to 2 weeks.  
Procedures: See each drug -specific appendix for the specific assessments that are required at 
each visit.  Procedures may include any of the following:  
• Medical/treatment histo ry, including:  
o Concomitant medications

 Termination of the Study  
The sponsor may terminate the study or study -drug arm,  at any time.  
Furthermore, if it becomes apparent that subject enrollment is unsatisfactory with respect to quantity or quality, or that data recording is inaccurate or incomplete on a chronic basis, the sponsor has the right to terminate the study and remove all study materials from the investigational site.  A written statement will be provided to the investigator, IRB/IEC, and regulatory authorities, if required.  If any SAEs are reported as part of the reason for early 
termination of the study, all documentation relating to the event(s) reported to regulatory authorities must be obtained and filed appropriately.  The DSMB may recommend termination of the study or study drug arm but final decisions will be made by the sponsor.

Page 92 of 265 7 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered 
study drug, whether or not consider ed drug related.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug.  An adverse e vent can arise from any use of the drug and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose including an overdose.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time the subject is consented but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it deteriorates or worsens significantly at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE.  
Clinically meaningful (for a given subject) changes in physical examination findings and abnormal objective test findings (e.g., laboratory, vital signs, ECG, imaging (e.g., definite new 
ARIA changes) should also be recorded as AEs.  The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  
1. Test result is associated with accompanying sym ptoms or is of clinical concern  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
3. Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other  therapy  
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
meet criteria 2 above for reporting as an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is  determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
NOTE: The following are not considered AEs or SAEs:  
• Preplanned surgeries or procedures:  Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) 
that were scheduled prior to signing of informed consent are not considered AEs.  
However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (e.g., as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -existing condition, the worsening of the condition should be 
captured appropriately as an AE.  Complications resulting fro m any planned surgery 
should be reported as AEs . 
 
• Elective surgeries or procedures:  Elective procedures performed where there is no 
change in the subject’s medical condition should not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source documents.  Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs or SAEs (depending on the severity).  
Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 93 of 265 • Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or 
pharmacologic action, should NOT be recorded as an AE.  The principal investigator 
must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre -existing illness and lack of 
therapeutic efficacy.  
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
If any adverse event meets any of the following criteria in the view of either th e investigator or 
sponsor, it is to be reported to the safety group as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of occurrence or notification of the site:  
• Death of subject.  An event that results in the death of a subject.  
• Life-Threatening.  An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted 
in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
• Inpatient Hospitalization.  An event that results in the admission to the hospital for any 
length of time.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility . 
• Prolongation of existing hospitalization.  An event that occurs while the study subject i s 
hospitalized and prolongs the subject’s hospital stay . 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  An event that results in a condition 
that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not inten ded to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., 
sprained ankle) . 
• Important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious  
outcome.  An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcom es listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y 
anomaly that results in fetal loss . 
• Suspected Hy’s law case (should be reported as serious unexpected adverse event) . 
 Adverse Event (AE) Severity  
The intensity of the AE will be rated by the investigator as mild, moderate or severe using the following criteria:  
Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Amendment 10  
FINAL  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 94 of 265 Mild:   an event that is transient and easily tolerated by the subject; requires minimal or no 
treatment and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Moderate:   an event that causes the subject discomfort and may cause some interference 
in the subject’s usual activities.  
Severe:   an event that causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities, 
may require drug therapy or other treatment, and may be incapacitating or life -
threatening.  
 Relationship to Study Drug  
The re lationship of an AE to study drug, imaging agents (e.g., [11C]PiB and  18F tracers) and  or 
study procedures should be assessed by the principal investigator using the following guidance:  
Definite.  An event, including laboratory test abnormality, which:  
a. Occurs within a reasonable temporal sequence to administration of study drug,  
b. Cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals  
c. Improves or disappears on stopping or reducing study drug (dechallenge)  
d. Reappears on repeated exposure to study  drug (rechallenge)   
e. Is an unusual event that is known to be associated with the drug or this class of 
compound, and cannot be explained by other therapy or the subject’s physical condition.  
Probable/Likely.  An event, including laboratory test abnormalit y, which:  
a. Occurs within a reasonable temporal sequence to administration of study drug,  
b. Unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge)  
c. Rechallenge was not attempted.  
Possible.   An event, including laboratory test abnormality, which:  
a. Occurs within a reasonable temporal sequence to administration of study drug, but  
b. Could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemical 
 
c. Information on drug withdrawal may be lack ing or unclear.  
Unlikely.  An event, including laboratory test abnormality, which:  
a. Occurs with a temporal relationship to administration of study drug which makes a causal relationship improbable, and  
b. In which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Definitely Not.  An event, including laboratory test abnormality, which is known to be 
associated with the subject’s clinical condition, or with other medication taken by the subject.

Page 95 of 265 
 Adverse Event Collection Period  
All AEs reported from the time that informed consent is obtained until 30 days following the 
last dose of study drug will be collected, 
whether elicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  Adverse events should be collected at End of Study and Early Termination visits even if these visits occur more than 30 days after 
last dose of study drug.  Serious adverse events considered related to study drug or procedures 
should be reported even if they occur  more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug.   
At every study visit, subjects will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being.  They will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, had any 
accidents , used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over- the-counter medications).  
 Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study.  Conditions present at baseline will be documented.  Deterioration or worsening of conditions present at baseline should be reported as an AE.  All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in the AE eCRF.  Information  to be 
collected includes the type of event, date of onset, investigator -specified assessment of severity 
and relationship to study drug, date of resolution of the event, and seriousness.  Treatments for AEs will be recorded on the concomitant medication e CRF.  AEs resulting from concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported.  All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, should be 
followed to resolution or unt il the AE is determined by the investigator not to be clinically 
significant or to be chronic or stable.  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) will be used to code all AEs.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The principal investigator must r eport to Safety (formerly known as ) any AE 
considered serious by the investigator, or which meets any of the specified criteria in section 7.1.2 .  Refer to each drug -specific appendix for drug -specific AE and SAE reporting.  The initial 
report must be submitted within 24  hours from the time site personnel first learn about the 
event by entry in inform (EDC); in cases where a back -up submission method is needed the site 
must submit SAE documentatio n to the project mailbox:

Additional contact information is detailed in the Global Manual of Operations . 
The reporting should include completion of the eCRF Adverse Event Form with Serious event 
indicated as Yes, and verification of current data entry in the eCRFs or de -identifi ed source 
documents for the demographics page(s), medical history page(s), AE page(s) and concomitant medication page(s).  If the subject is hospitalized because of or during the course of an SAE, then a copy of the hospital discharge summary should be faxed to Safety as soon as it becomes available.  Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measures will be at the discretion of the investigator unless the event meets a protocol -specified discontinuation 
criterion.  All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject to be stable.  
The sponsor or its designee will be responsible for reporting SAEs to FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other relevant regulatory authorities accordingly to local regulatory requirements.  Sites are responsible for reporting to their local ethics committees /IRBs per their reporting requirements and/or local laws.  
 Pregnancy Reporting  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug or within 16 weeks following last dose of study drug should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast-feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Sites should report pregnancies to  Safety i n the same manner and timing as for Serious Adverse Events 
specified in section 7.6. 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Refer to the drug -specific appendices for drug -specific reporting for adverse events of special 
interest (A ESI).  Sites should report an AESI to  Safety in the same manner and timing as 
for Serious Adverse Events specified in section 7.6 .

 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
Unblinded data from study drug arms on safety -related endpoints (clinical laboratory test 
results, ECGs, MRI findings, cognitive and clinical endpoint results) and SAEs will be reviewed 
quarterly by the DSMB.  Complete details are available in the DSMB charter.   
8 STATISTICAL PLAN  
  
 All statistical analyses described are related to the 
study drug arms that are included in this protocol.  
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be used for interim and final efficacy analyses and for the biomarker interim analyses.  
 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for safety and efficacy variables at each time point collected by treatment groups and across combined  placebo groups.  Continuous variables 
(e.g., biomarker values) will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and the maximum.  These statistics will be provided by PROC  UNIVARIATE/SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 2009).  Categorical 
variables (e.g., presence of absence of an APOE  ε4 allele) will be summarized using the number 
and percentage in each category.  
 Safety Analysis  
Safety analysis will include all subjects who consent to participate and are randomized to receive any study -related drugs or placebo and will be reported to an independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for regular reviews.  The following are major safety endpoints that will be analyzed: treatment -emergent adverse events (AE), serious treatment -emergent AEs, 
serious drug -related treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -emergent AEs that lead to 
discontinuation of the study, treatment- emergent AEs resulting in death, safety MRIs, 
laboratory parameters, vital signs and physical examinations.  Adverse event reporting will include the severity, onset, duration, relief measures, outcome, and relationship to study drug.  Adverse events will be classified using MedDRA preferred terms.  Adverse events noted on MRI scans, including ARIA, will be analyzed as will adverse events noted as significant changes or new abnormalitie s in vital signs, clinical laboratory test  values or ECGs.  
 Biomarker Endpoint Statistical Analysis, Power and Sample Size Justification  
Each drug that enters the DIAN -TU platform trial will have biomarker defined interim analyses.  
The goal of the interim analyses is to stop or adjust a treatment that is not demonstrating

target biomarker analysis, and a remediation plan should the biomarker analysis demonstrat e 
lack of success.  The remediation plan will include dose -adjustment strategies, if appropriate, to 
maximize the efficacy, if the tolerability and safety profile is acceptable.  If no adjustments are possible , then failing the biomarker interim will lead to stopping the regimen for futility.  Each 
drug -specific appendix will detail the biomarker interim analysis.  The biomarker interim 
analyses will only be used for dose -adjustment, remediation, or stopping a study drug arm for 
futility and will not be use d for any conclusion of success or efficacy on the primary cognitive 
endpoint.  
Interim biomarker analyses will be conducted for each study drug arm to assess whether the active study drug is engaging its biological target.  The timing of the interim biomarker analyses may vary for each study drug arm.  At each interim, an analysis will be conducted for the biomarker endpoints, comparing the active drug to its own (direct) placebo group or to a 
pooled placebo group (mutation positive placebos) .  Pre -specifie d definitions for early 
termination for futility will be drug -specific and based on collection of appropriate biomarker 
assessments following sufficient drug exposure.  Details about the interim biomarker analyses 
are described in each drug -specific appendix.  
 Cognitive Endpoint Statistical Analysis, Power and Sample Size Justification  
8.4.1 Cognitive Analysis Populations and Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population is defined as all subjects who will be 
randomized, treated, and ass essed for their primary cognitive outcomes at least once after the 
baseline assessment.  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on t he mITT population and the eligible DIAN -OBS 
subjects.  
The primary efficacy outcome ( DIAN -MCE ) is defined in section 3.5 . The primary efficacy 
hypothesis will be tested by comparing the relative rate of cognitive decline between the active 
drug and the mutation positive placebos  and the eligible DIAN -OBS subjects  using the M DPM 
devel oped by the DIAN -TU.  The M DPM includes 2  subject- level random effects to account for 
the between -subject variability and a model of the mean rate of decline as a function of 
expected years from symptom onset (EYO) to estimate a proportional slowing of dec line of the 
primary endpoint in active drug compared with the mutation positive placebos and the eligible 
DIAN -OBS subjects .  This model was developed using Data Freeze 13  from the DIAN -OBS study.  
To test the hypothesis of a disease progression benefit we  calculate the posterior probability of 
superiority in cognitive slowing and if it is above a pre -specified threshold (which controls the 
experiment wise type I error at 2.5%) then a claim of cognitive slowing will be made.  The pre -
specified threshold may  vary from study drug to study drug depending on the drug -specific 
sample size or the interim analysis plan.  All these analyses will be implemented using SAS or validated MDPM software .

Footnotes:  
1. Visits (designated as occurring at home[H]) may occur at the DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a distance from 
the DIAN -TU site, these visits may be conducted by a home health nurse at the subject’s home or other trial -identified 
location.  These visits may include phone calls from the host DIAN -TU site staff.  
2. The specific date during the baseline visit  (V2) when the first dose of study drug is adminis tered should be used to 
determine timing of subsequent visits and for calculating time between screening visit (V1)  and baseline visit  (V2). 
3. Informed consent may be obtained in two steps if more than one drug is enrolling concurrently.  Subjects will have the 
opportunity to review the main  informed consent form  (ICF) and, if applicable, the supplemental drug -specific ICF and 
to discuss with DIAN -TU site study staff on the phone or in -person.  They can sign the main ICF at home or at the DIAN -
TU site.  The m ain ICF must be signed before any study procedures are performed.  After screening labs are obtained 
and the subject is randomized to a specific study drug arm at V2, the subject will review and sign a supplemental study drug -specific consent that details specific risks/benefits and procedures for the study drug arm to which they were 
assigned, when applicable.  If only one study drug arm is enrolling, one consent may be used in the same fashion as the

Page 122 of 265  ‘main consent’ is referenced within.  
4. If applicable, study drug -specific supplemental consent should be reviewed and signed after randomization.  
5. Family history/age at onset and demographic information for subject and study partner will be collected during the 
screening period and confirmed at the baseline visit, .  
This information will not be collected at subsequent visits unless the subject or study partner becomes aware of new information or the study partner changes during the study.  
6. Home health nurses will have specific scripts or forms to prompt assessment and collection of medical treatment history, health changes or complaints (for assessment of adverse events by the site) and concomitant medications.  
 
7. Preexisting conditions will be documented at screening visit and reviewed at baseline visit (V2) prior to study drug administration.  
  
9. Provenance testing to confirm specimen identity will be performed at baseline visit only (V2),  
 
10. Includes TSH, B12, hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR are drawn at Visit 1 only  
11. Serum pr egnancy testing will be performed at screening (V1).  Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at V2 .  
Pregnancy tests must be confirmed as negative prior to dosing with study drug.  Urine pregnancy test must be 
completed and confirmed as negative either the day of or the day prior to any PET scan; if PET scans occur on more 
than 2 consecutive days during annual visits more than one urine pregnancy test will be required.  Women who have undergone tubal ligation are required to have pregnancy tests performed.  Alternate tests may be used if urine 
collection is not feasible but must be approved by the sponsor in advance.  
12. Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained before study drug administration.  Time of collection and timing of drug administration will be recorded.  
13. See each drug-specific appendix for additional details.  
14. For future studies, including future regulatory inquiries or additional monitoring of anti -drug antibodies or other drug-
specific tests.  See main protocol section 6.1.12. 
15. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be collected at all visits.  Height will be 
measured at baseline.  Weight will be collected at baseline (V2). 
16. Clinical assessments: DIAN -TU clinical assessment battery includes: study partner interview and administration of 
Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR) and supplemental CDR; clinician assessment of symptoms and diagnosis; Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Assessment Scale (FAS), Neuropsychi atric Inventory (NPI -Q), and Mini Mental State 
Evaluation ( MMSE ). 
17. The Cognitive testing battery will include both iPad administered and conventional psychometric (pen/paper)  cognitive 
testing.  See section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual for additional 
information.  The full battery will be administered at baseline ( V2) and at annual visits.  A subset of the full battery (see 
section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual) will be administered by the 
home health nurse in the home, if applicable, as a practice battery at the screening visit  (V1),  
.  Cognitive testing should be completed before study drug infusion or injection.  
18. Lumbar puncture (LP)  should be performed after magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), if on the same date.  Lumbar 
punctures should be performed at approximately 8  am local t ime under fasting conditions (water is allowed and 
encouraged).  Cerebrospinal fluid (C SF) will be sent to a local laboratory for cell count and differential, glucose and 
protein as well as to central lab for sample management, including Washington Univers ity Biomarker Core lab and 
designated research/referral labs for biomarker and drug -specific analyses.  Site staff should contact the subject 24 -48 
hours after the LP to assess for adverse effects of the LP.  
19. See details in each drug- specific appendix.  
20. Prior to randomization, verify that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, including ARIA findings on baseline MRI.

Page 129 of 265  1 DRUG -SPECIFIC INTRODUCTION  
 Background  
Both active and passive immunization strategies directed against amyloid beta peptides are 
currently under investigation.  The first preclinical studies demonstrating reduction in amyloid burden were performed in APP
V717F (“PDAPP”) transgenic mice over 12 years ago ( Schenk et al., 
1999; Bard et al., 200 0).  The PDAPP mouse and all other genetic mouse models of AD are 
based on the mutations in APP , PSEN1  and PSEN2  that underlie the dominantly inherited forms 
of AD represented in the DIAN cohort.  The preclinical studies in these mouse models are even more relevant to these individuals than to those with sporadic AD.  
 Study Drug  
Gantenerumab is a fully human IgG1  antibody which binds specifically to aggregated forms of 
Aβ (including oligomers, fibrils, and plaques ) and  targets the amyloid pathology associat ed with 
AD. Because Aβ  accumulation is believed  to begin well before the onset of AD dementia, early 
intervention is expected to provide the greatest benefit to patients . 
 Preclinical Data  
Gantenerumab is a recombinant, completely human, monoclonal antibody  of the IgG1 subclass 
directed against the Aβ peptide.  It is a novel type of antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope of Aβ and binds to both major types of Aβ (Aβ
40/42).  Binding characteristics for 
gantenerumab were engineered to achieve specific and highly sensitive recognition of aggregated Aβ, like the fibrillar assembly structure of the human Aβ peptide, which is the predominant component in Aβ plaques.  Gantenerumab recognizes aggregated Aβ with high affinity  as determined in vitro.  Specificity was demonstrated for native human Aβ 
plaques on brain sections.   
In functional assays gantenerumab induced cellular phagocytosis of human amyloid -β deposits 
in AD brain slices when co -cultured with primary human macrophages and neutralized 
oligomeric Aβ42 -mediated inhibitory effects on long -term potentiation in rat brain.  In 
APP751swedishxPS2N141I transgenic mice, gantenerumab s howed sustained binding to 
cerebral Aβ and, upon chronic treatment, significantly reduced small Aβ plaques by recruiting microglia and prevented new plaque formation.  Unlike other Aβ antibodies, gantenerumab did not alter plasma Aβ suggesting undisturbed systemic clearance of soluble Aβ.  Overall, gantenerumab preferentially interacts with aggregated Aβ in the brain and lowers Aβ  by 
eliciting effector cell- mediated clearance ( Bohrmann et al., 2012 ; Ostrowitzki et al., 2012 ). 
Effective brain penetration and binding to Aβ plaques was demonstrated in a double -transgene 
mouse model expressing AD -related mutations that display a pronounced amyloidosis

that there is no requirement for continuous high peripheral levels to achieve a sustained 
binding of gantenerumab to amyloid plaques.  
 Clinical Data  
Gantenerumab has been investigated in seven completed Phase 1 clinical trials.  A brief summary of the results of these studies follows.  For a more thorough description, refer to the 
IB. 
BN18726  
A total of 30 patients (16 males, 14 females) diagnosed with mild to moderate probable AD participated in a single ascending dose (SAD) study (BN18726) which was completed in August 2008.  Patients received a single IV (intravenous) dose of gantenerumab (doses ranging from 6 mg to 400 mg) or placebo.  All patients completed the S AD study and gantenerumab was well 
tolerated.  
WP22461  
WP22461 was a bioavailability study conducted in 42 healthy male subjects . The study  
evaluated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gantenerumab following a single IV 
infusion or subcutaneous ( SC) injection .  In this study, subjects received a single dose of 
gantenerumab at the following doses and routes: 60 mg by IV infusion, 75 mg SC injection, or 150 mg SC injection.  Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated when administered SC.  
JP22474  
Study JP22474 was a Phase I  SAD study designed to investigate safety, tolerability, PK and PD 
after IV infusion of gantenerumab in Japanese AD patients.  The results showed that single IV doses of up to 200 mg gantenerumab were well tolerated.  
NN19866  
In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study (NN19866), a total of 60 patients (34 males and 26 females) diagnosed with mild to moderate probable AD received multiple IV doses of 
gantenerumab (doses of 6 mg, 20 mg, 60 mg, and 200 mg) or placebo on an every 4 -week 
(q-4-wk) schedule for up to 7 months.  Due to findings of “vasogenic edema” and “microbleeds” 
on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (amyloid -related imaging abnormalities or 
ARIA) which occurred in some patients in cohort 4 (gantenerumab 200 mg or  placebo), it was 
decided to terminate dosing for all patients on June 9, 2008.  At that time, 16 patients were receiving 200 mg of gantenerumab, and 4 patients were receiving placebo.  These patients had received between 2 to 5 doses each.  When the patie nts were then genotyped for APOE , APOE4  
carrier status emerged as a risk factor for the occurrence of these MRI findings, as has been

gantenerumab was well tolerated in N N19866.  
NN19866 Pharmacodynamics  
In a substudy of NN19866 (NN19866- PET), the protocol was amended in order to evaluate the 
effect of gantenerumab on amyloid load in the brain (defined as standardized uptake value ratio of a cortical composite volume of interest over cerebellar cortex and using [
11C]PiB -PET) in 
18 patients (4 in the placebo group, 8 in the 60 -mg dose group and 6 in the 200 -mg dose 
group).  A median decrease from baseline  was seen in the gantenerumab 200 mg dose group while an increase was seen in the placebo group  and relative stability 
compared to baseline in the 60 -mg group  
NN19866 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
The multiple ascending dose ( MAD ) study NN19866 was prematurely terminated (after patients 
in the 200 -mg group had received 2 to 5 doses) due to ARIA -E seen after 2 to 4 doses of 
gantenerumab 200 mg.  Notably, the findings, best seen on the Fluid Attenuated Inversion 
Recovery (FLAIR) sequences, were only reported in carriers of APOE -4 and seemed more 
prominent in patients who were homozygous for APOE -4 (E4/E4).  Concomitant ARIA -H 
microbleeds were only observed in the two carrier patients homozygous for APOE4  (E4/E4).  No 
patient required treatment and the ARIA -E findings spontaneously resolved 1 -4 months after 
discontinuation of gantenerumab.  
JP22431  
In a MAD  study (JP22431), a total of 29 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate probable AD 
received multiple SC doses of gantenerumab (doses of 75 mg, 105  mg, and 225 mg) or placebo 
on q -4-wk schedu le for up to 7 months.  Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated when 
administered SC.  
WP27951  
A study comparing lyophilized (Lyo -F) and high -concentration liquid formulations (HCLF) 
included a total of 120 healthy subjects.  Subjects were randomized to r eceive single SC doses 
of either 105 or 225 mg of the Lyo- F formulation or 105, 225, or 300 mg of the HCLF 
formulation.  Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated when administered SC.  
BP29113  
A study comparing Lyo -F and HCLF formulations included a total of 48 healthy subjects.  
Subjects were randomized to receive single SC dose of 225 mg in a pre -filled syringe or as a 
lyophilized formulation.  Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated when administered SC.

A study assessing the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of SC gantenerumab 
included a total of 38 healthy male subjects (32 on gantenerumab and 6 on placebo). Subjects 
were randomized to receive single doses of 450 mg, 900 mg or 1500 mg. Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated up to the highest tested dose when administered SC.  
WP39322  
A study comparing pain of a single dose of gantenerumab administered SC in the abdomen included a total of 50 subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 300 mg in the abdomen i n 5 or 15 seconds followed by 2 SC administrations of a placebo solution (one in 
abdomen and one in the thigh). Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated.  
WP40052  
A study comparing the relative bioavailability, safety and tolerability following single dose  SC 
administration of 600 mg of gantenerumab produced with the G3 (Reference) or G4 (Test) process included a total of 114 healthy subjects.  The plasma exposure in terms of AUCInf was approximately 1.18 fold higher after SC administration of 600 mg gantenerumab G4 compared to 600 mg gantenerumab G3, whereas Cmax were similar. Gantenerumab produced with either 
process was generally well tolerated.  
Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of gantenerumab after intravenous administration were investigated in Caucasia n 
patients with mild to moderate AD after single (Study BN18726) and multiple doses (Study 
NN19866) , after single dose in Japanese patients with mild to moderate AD (Study JP22474) , 
and after single dose in healthy volunteers (Study WP22461).  
 
 Plasma concentrations of 
gantenerumab appeared to increase dose -proportionally after intravenous dosing.  
 
  
T
he PK of gantenerumab following a single SC dose was assessed in 6 studies in healthy 
volunteers (WP22461, WP27951, BP29113, BP30042, WP39322 and WP40052).

Phase III Studies  
Global Phase III studies investigating the effect of SC gantenerumab on cognition and function 
include two multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled Phase III studies, 
WN29922 (Graduate 1)  and WN39658 (Graduate 2), in patie nts with early (prodromal to mild) 
AD, the ongoing open- label extension of Study  WN25203 in subjects with prodromal AD, and 
ongoing open -label extension of S tudy  WN28745 in subjects with mild AD.  
The double -blind phase of ongoing S tudy  WN28745 was unblinde d to selected Roche personnel 
as of 3  March 2016.  Upon review of the unblinded data, the I ndependent  Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) recommended the continued implementation of the open -label extension.  
Further details  from each study are summarized below.

Page 134 of 265 weeks [Q2W], which is equivalent to 1020 mg SC Q4W) has been adjusted to account for the 
difference in bioavailability betw een the newly -developed gantenerumab drug substance (G4) 
and the drug substance used in S tudies WN25203 and WN28745 (G3).  
WN25203  
WN25203 is a Phase III study investigating the effect of SC gantenerumab on cognition and 
function in prodromal AD with futili ty analysis conducted when 50% of the subjects completed 
treatments for 2 years.  The doses in the study were 105 mg and 225 mg SC every 4  weeks for 
4 years (including a 2 -year double blind placebo -controlled extension).  Because ARIA findings 
seemed to be  more frequent in carriers of APOE ε4  in the earlier MAD study, subjects who were 
homozygous for this gene initially did not receive the dose of 225 mg SC in S tudy WN25203 but 
an amendment later allowed for full dose regardless of APOE ε4 .  This futility analysis took 
place in December  2014 and led to the study being declared futile and suspension of dosing.  
No safety issues were identified in the futility analysis.  Subsequently, the trial has continued as an open -label extension utilizing doses of up to 1200  mg. 
WN25203- PET 
Study WN2 5203 includes a substudy, WN25203 -PET, designed to assess changes in amyloid 
load over time in a subset of patients with prodromal AD by PET imaging using the amyloid tracer Florbetapir 18F ( 18F-AV-45; AMYViD). Results from amyloid PET assessments show cle ar 
dose - and time -dependent reductions in cortical to cerebellum standard uptake value ratios 
(SUVr), with greater reduction over longer periods of exposure to gantenerumab. This reduction was present regardless of the reference region utilized for the analysis. Patients in the 225 mg gantenerumab arm showed consistent and potentially cumulative SUVr reduction 
of 5 to 10% over a period of 2 to 3 years. In an analysis of the concentration dependence of the SUVr reductions, patients with greater concentrations of gantenerumab experienced greater reductions in SUVr.  
WN28745  
Study WN28745 was initially designed as a 2 -year, double -blind, placebo -controlled, efficacy 
and safety study of gantenerumab in approximately 1000 patients with mild AD, and was initiated in the first quarter of 2014.  Patients with probable mild AD were identified based on established NINCDS/ADRDA clinical criteria, low CSF Aβ42, and cognitive decline.  The co-primary efficacy endpoints included measures of cognition (Alzheimer's Disease As sessment 
Scale - Cognitive Subscale [ADAS- Cog]) and function (Alzheimer's Disease Co -operative Study -  
Activities of Daily Living Inventory [ADCS- ADL]).  Based on the initial design of WN28745, all 
patients were to follow a slow titration scheme independen t of the  ApoE  ε4 genotype, starting 
gantenerumab at 105 mg SC Q4W (every 4 weeks) for seven doses, with progression to 225 mg, based on acceptable MRI findings.  The study enrolled 389 patients.  Analysis of  the WN25203 
results, and data from other AD studies, indicate d that efficacy would likely be apparent at 
much higher doses than originally tested in the Phase III Studies.  As a result, enrollment in the

Page 135 of 265  double -blind phase of the WN28745 study was halted in November 2015.  T he study was 
amended into an open -label ex tension evaluating the safety and tolerability of gantenerumab 
at higher doses (up to 1200 mg) using different titration schemes.  
Dosing of Gantenerumab up to 1200 mg Q4W: Open- label Extension of WN25203 and Study 
WN28745  
Both protocols for Studies WN25203  and WN28745 were amended to convert the studies into 
open label extensions to evaluate SC dosing of gantenerumab up to target dose of 1200 mg 
Q4W.  Enrollment into the WN25203 OLE was closed on 30 June 2017; overall 154 of the 799 
patients originally rand omized into the study entered the OLE.  Enrol lment into the WN28745 
OLE was closed on 31 July 2017; overall, 230 of 389 patients originally randomized into the study entered the OLE . 
Eighty -nine patients were initially enrolled in the OLE PET substudies, o f whom 67 patients 
received follow -up scans at OLE week 52, 40 received scans at OLE week 104, and 23 received 
scans at OLE week 156 by the cutoff date of 31 May 2019.   Patients were divided into three 
analysis cohorts due to heterogeneous baseline characteristics, time off -dose before OLE 
dosing, and OLE titration schedules: 1) MR -DBP: patients in the placebo arm of WN28745 
Marguerite RoAD, 2) MR -DBA: patients in the active treatment arms of WN28745, and 3) SR: a 
combined cohort of all patients from the WN 25203 Scarlet RoAD study.  SR patients were 
combined into a single cohort since all patients were off dose for 16 -19 months prior to OLE 
dosing. 
 
  Amyloid reductions are consistently seen in 
nearly all patients of the three analyzed subgroups.  
The study showed higher reductions of amyloid plaque over a shorter time period with the 1200 mg dosing regimen of gantenerumab compared to 105 or 225 mg dosing.

Page 137 of 265  of 100.   Beyond ARIA events, injection site reactions were the most common event occurring 
more frequently with gantenerumab than with placebo; these events were also mild, non -
serious,   No drug -effect on 
white blood cells or neutrophils was observed.  
Summary  
Early evidence with anti -amyloid monoclonal antibodies revealed dose -dependent ARIA, small 
effects on clinical outcomes, and a mixed impact on biomarkers, namely, an association 
between clinical and biomarker (PET) outcomes with solanezumab but no such association with bapineuzumab (Salloway et al.  2014, Sperling et al.  2012, and Doody e t al.  2014).  Evidence 
from two clinical trials with highly similar antibodies against aggregated Aβ including plaques (i.e., gantenerumab and aducanumab) provide new insights into the biological mechanism of aggregated amyloid removal, and the doses requ ired to potentially achieve a therapeutic effect.  
This new evidence also indicates that ARIAs are predictable and manageable events, and that higher dosing for gantenerumab may be needed to achieve clinical efficacy.  New gantenerumab data also suggest  that beneficial impact on target and downstream biomarkers 
effects are measurable and reproducible (gantenerumab WN25203 positron emission 
tomography [PET] and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] data).  
ARIAs and injection site reactions are the dominating safety events that have emerged as of 
today, under the treatment of gantenerumab.  Overall, gantenerumab up -titration reduces the 
risk of ARIA- E; ARIA -E incidence observed in the open -label extensions has been in the expected 
range and in alignment with the ARIA- E PK -PD model.  ARIAs are clinically manageable by 
protocol -defined MRI monitoring and dose intervention algorithms.  
A dedicated risk management for ARIA has been implemented.  It appears that appropriate MRI monitoring associated with drop -out criteria provides a sufficient risk minimization.   
No other clinical safety liabilities of major relevance have emerged.  
 Dose Selection/Rationale  in Double -Blind Period  
The initial dose in the DIAN -TU-001 study is 225 mg gantenerumab, administered 
subcutaneously (SC), ev ery 4 weeks.  
This dosing regimen was investigated in heterozygous and non- carriers of ApoE4  in the 
WN25203 trial with an apparently acceptable safety profile.  In this study (WN25203), the dose administered to homozygous ApoE4  carriers is 105 mg Q4W SC.  
The starting dose of 225 mg in the DIAN -TU-001 study, including in subjects homozygous for the 
ApoE4  allele is justified based on the following considerations:  
• The DIAN -TU-001 study will apply a similar MRI monitoring scheme to WN25203 and 
WN28745 with a pre defined ARIA related intervention algorithm  

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 138 of 265  • All new ARIA findings will be reviewed by the Project Arm Leader (PAL) who will advise 
the site on whether a more conservative approach should be considered than defined in 
the ARIA related intervention algorith m (see section 1.14) 
• Subjects recruited into the trial are generally at an early stage of the disease, i.e., at an earlier clinical stage or a similar stage as requested for prodromal and mild (sporadic) AD patients in the ongoing WN25203 and WN28745 trials  
• The dominantly inherited mutation carrier status (rather than APOE  genotype) is the 
predominant risk for AD and for amyloid deposition in the DIAN -TU population  
• Given the PET data obtained in the MAD study whe re decreases in the amyloid plaque 
burden were observed, the dosage selected based on systemic overall exposure is expected to reduce the plaque burden relative to placebo  
Following the approval of Amendment 5, all subjects will initiate up  titration.  The  proposed 
dose escalation in the DIAN -TU-001 study will begin at 450 mg, administered subcutaneously 
(SC) , every 4 weeks.  The titration 
schedule is prov ided in Table 5. 
Escalation of the initial dose of 225 mg in the DIAN -TU-001 study is justified based on the 
following considerations:  
1) The futility Analyses of trial WN25203 which revealed:  
a) Patient Disposition: Par ticipant attrition rates were not associated with higher doses 
and were nearly identical in the three doses under investigation (placebo, 105  mg, 
and 225 mg),  
 
b) Safety:  Ganteneruma b was safe and well tolerated by patients in this study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The majority of 
ARIA events were asymptomatic.  
c) Biomarker outcome: Results from [AV -45] amyloid PET assessments showed clear 
time -dependent reductions in SUVR, with greater reduction over longer periods of 
exposure to gantenerumab  
Overall, these analyses indicated a signal of serum concentration -dependent clinical 
activity and clear evidence of dose -dependent biological activity, suggesting under -
dosing as a potential explanation for the negative outcome of WN25203.  With this

CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 139 of 265  conclusion of the need to expand the dose range of gantenerumab, uncertainty 
remained around which ‘higher’ dose to target to achieve clinical efficacy.  
2) The safety reviews of the ongoing DIAN -TU-001 study indicated no clear imaging -related 
serious adverse events and further verified the dose of 225 mg was well tolerated.  I n 
the blinded gantenerumab arm of the trial , there were  4 cases of mild symptoms 
associated wit h ARIA .  Further, the rate of incident microhemorrhage is consistent with 
the current rates in the DIAN observational (DIAN -OBS) study indicating no clear 
differences from the natural history in those exposed to gantenerumab.  Compared to the WN25203 ARIA rates reported, the DIAN -TU-001 study has far fewer events.  The 
reason for these differences could in part be due to less vascular risks in the younger DIAN -TU population, as well as lower prevalence of APOE  ε4 in the DIAN -TU population.  
Together, the excellent safety of gantenerumab 225 mg in the DIAN -TU-001 and the 
need for a higher pharmacodynamics effect strongly supports the decision of increasing the dose of gantenerumab.

 Risks/Benefits  
Plaque removal e ffect was demonstrated in the prodromal study WN25203 with the higher 
225 mg dose showing a stronger effect of removal.  These results for the first time showed the 
effect of immunotherapies against Aβ in early (prodromal) AD.  In dominantly inherited 
Alzh eimer’s disease (DIAD), amyloid deposition is present at early stages of the disease when 
no memory impairment is present (Bateman et al., 2012).  Thus, the current dose and the higher doses to be administered are expected to be effective in DIAD.  
The mutations in presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ), presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) and amyloid precursor protein ( APP) 
that are associated with DIAD and which subjects in this study who receive active study drug will have tested positive for, have very high penetrance (near 100%).  AD is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease and no disease modifying treatment is available to date.  
Besides injection site reactions which, however appear of mild intensity in most subjects and not limiting the maintenance of subjects in the long -term treatment trial, ARIAs represent a 
side effect of concern in the development of immune -therapeutics targeting Aβ in the brain 
 
(Sperling et al., 2012 ).  These changes may include micro -hemorrhage, vasogenic 
edema/effusion and infarction; they are most often asymptomatic, but symptoms have been reported in some cases.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 142 of 265 Therefore, dedicated monitoring and action plans for ARIAs are implemented in respective 
multiple dose clinical trials of gantenerumab including the DIAN -TU-001 study.  Given the 
experiences made with gantenerumab thus far, the proposed risk minimization plan including frequent MRI monitoring and reads by independent experts together with an ARIA based dose intervention algorithm appears to be effective in preventing clinical sequelae to the subjects treated with gantenerumab.  
 Drug -specific Study Design  
Drug -specific study design features include the use of [11C]PiB -PET as the biomarker endpoint.  
In addition, there is an increased frequency of safety MRI scans during the dose esc alation 
period , and then every 3 to 6 months thereafter, based on available clinical safety data from 
treatment trials with gantenerumab.  Specific action plans that include dose modification should ARIA occur are provided (for details, see section 1.14).  
 Rationale for Biomarker Endpoint  
Rationale for change in amyloid load as measured by [11C]PiB -PET composite standardized 
uptake value (C -SUVR) as biomarker endpoint for DIAN -TU Gantenerumab Arm  
Preliminary stud ies show that mutation carriers eligible for enrollment in this study are likely to 
have abnormal levels of brain amyloid as measured by [11C]PiB binding ( Bateman et al., 2012 ).  
Statistically significant reductions in [11C]PiB binding were observed in patients treated with 
gantenerumab as compared to controls in a recentl y completed multiple ascending dose study 
of gantenerumab in which patients with mild to moderate (sporadic) Alzheimer’s disease received up to 7 monthly doses ( Ostrowitzki et al., 2012 ). 
 Primary Study Endpoint  
A multivariate  disease progression model ( MDPM) for repeated measures with a proportional 
treatment effect will be used to assess statistical differences in the rate of decline, relative to the expe cted years from symptom onset, of the DIAN -MCE  between the active drug and the 
mutation positive placebos and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects.   See section 3.5  of the main 
protocol for more details.
 
 Additional  Study Endpoints and Bio marker Endpoint for Interim Analyses  
Additional  study endpoints are described in the main study protocol  and will be specified as 
secondary and/or exploratory in the g antenerumab -specific SAP .  Refer to the final SAP for 
drug -specific differentiation of endpoint classification based on the respective drug’s target and 
mechanism of action.

Page 143 of 265  The following will be used as the biomarker endpoint for interim analysis as well as an 
additional  endpoint for the gantenerumab drug arm  as specified in the gantenerumab -specific 
SAP appendix : 
Cerebral amyloid imaging using [11C]PiB -PET:  Change in the amount of fibrillar amyloid 
deposition as measured by [11C]PiB -PET scans is the biomarker endpoint for gantenerumab.  
Most mutation carriers who are in the range of -15 to + 10 years of dementia onset have 
increased [11C]PiB -PET signal in some brain regions (Figure 1 in main protocol and Bateman et 
al., 2012).  The composite PiB standardized uptake value ratio (C -SUVR, the composite SUVR of 
precuneus, caudate, gyrus rectus, oc cipital cortex, parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex and 
temporal cortex) is used as the biomarker endpoint.  
 Primary Safety Endpoints  
This study will assess safety and tolerability of treatment with gantenerumab in individuals at 
risk for and with DIAD.  Th e primary safety endpoints are identical for all study compounds and 
are listed in the main study protocol.  
Particular safety focus in the gantenerumab arm will be given to ARIA and injection site reactions.  However, given the still limited data base available today, safety monitoring includes all general safety monitoring parameters, including those for vital signs and ECGs, clinical chemistry and hematology, urinalysis and any AEs .

 Drug -specific Safety Concerns  
1.13.1  Amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)  
As outlined above (section 1.4 ), ARIAs are a special safety endpoint in studies of Alzheimer’s 
immunotherapies, including both active and passive immunization.  This st udy includes 
frequent MRI scans to assess for ARIA changes.  ARIA can occur as either cerebral 
edema/effusion (ARIA -E) or as hemorrhages (ARIA- H), typically microhemorrhages, but possibly 
larger hemorrhages or infarction ( Sperling et al., 2 012). 
Time points for Safety MRI at the 225 mg dose level were originally scheduled for: before the first dose (baseline scan for safety reads done at V2) and then about 1 week after dose 2; dose 4; dose 6; dose 9; dose 17 and dose 22.  Additional safety  MRIs were scheduled as part of the 
volumetric MRI at the annual assessments before dose 14 (V15, week 52), dose 27 (V28, week 104), dose 40 (V41, week 156), and V54 (week 208).  
Following the approval of Amendment 5, all subjects will sign the new ICF and initiate  up 
titration starting at the 450 mg dose level.  Subjects may be at different time points in the schedule of visits when initiating titration, therefore safety MRIs will be scheduled based on the DIAN -TU-001 Gantenerumab Titration Safety MRI Sched ule ( Table 5).  A safety MRI will be 
scheduled 1  week after the second dose of each titration step, unless otherwise indicated by 
the ARIA -E and ARIA -H management algorithms (section 1.15).  If an annual visit follows the 
second dose of a titration step, the annual MRI assessment can fulfill this requirement as long as the MRI reading is reviewed prior to dosing at that visit.  Although the titration schema was designed to reach the target dose of 1200 mg administered every 4 weeks, the target dose may not be achieved as otherwise dictated by the ARIA -related intervention algorithms or more 
conservative action by the site/sponsor.  The stable dose is defined as the maximum  dose the 
subject will remain at for the duration of the trial based on safety.  Once a subject reaches their stable dose, safety MRIs will be scheduled to follow every third dose (or approximately every 3 months).  Additional safety MRIs are done as part of the volumetric MRI at the annual 
assessments: Visit 15 (week 52), Visit 28 (week 104), Visit 41 (week 156), Visit 54 (week 208), 
Visit 67 (week 260), Visit 80 (week 312), and Visit 93 (week 364).  
Amendment 8 includes a revised safety MRI schedule.   A safety MRI will be scheduled 1 week (± 
4 days) after the second dose of each titration step (225 mg, 450 mg, 675 mg, 900 mg), unless 
otherwise indicated by the ARIA -E and ARIA- H management algorithms (section  1.14) .  Subjects

CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 146 of 265 may be at different titration steps and time points in the schedule of visits at the time of this 
amendment and should be scheduled based upon their current titration step/stable dose at the 
time of the amendment.  For titration step #4, the final titration step (1200 mg), safety MRIs 
will be scheduled 1  week (± 4 days) after every third dose (or approximately every 3 months) 
for the next 6  doses unless otherwise indicated by the algorithm ARIA- E and ARIA -H 
management algorithms.  Although the titration schema was designed to reach the target dose of 1200 mg administered every 4 weeks, the target dose may not be achieved as otherwise dictated by the ARIA -related management algorithms or more conservative action by the site 
principal investigator/sponsor.  The st able dose is defined as the maximum dose the subject will 
remain at for the duration of the trial based on safety.  Once a subject reaches their stable dose, safety MRIs will be scheduled after every 6 doses (or approximately every 6 months) for the remain der of the trial unless otherwise indicated by the algorithm (i.e., 6 doses, MRI, 6 
doses, MRI, etc.).  The annual MRI assessment can fulfill these requirements as long as the MRI reading is reviewed prior to dosing at that visit; however, the safety MRIs following every sixth 
dose of 1200 mg must occur regardless of when the annual MRI is scheduled.  
Safety MRIs will be performed at the same field strength throughout the study, and if possible 
on the same scanner.  All MRIs will be centrally read.  
The MRI s chedule may be changed according to the ARIA -related dosing intervention algorithm 
(see tables in section 1.14 ) or per individual request by the site principal investigator or 
delegated sub -investigator, Project Arm Leader  (PAL) , or Medical Director or designee.  
1.13.2  Injection site reactions  
Injection site reactions after subcutaneous administration have been observed in up to one -
third of subjects.  These reactions are mainly characterized as injection site erythema and rash.  
It is likely that the injection site reactions may be at least partly related to the injection volume.  The large majority of events have been mild.  
 ARIA -Related Interventions Including Dose Changes and Discontinuation  
See main protocol sections 1.2, 3.8, 6.1.15  and 6.1.16 for details of MRI reading and reporting.  
The Mayo -ADIR Clinic will review MRIs and provide a report on ARIA- E and ARIA -H.  This report 
will include both definite and possible findings.  A report of new definite ARIA changes in a subject will trigger a review by the Medical Director or designee, Project Arm Leader (PAL), and 
site principal investigator or delegated sub -investigator.  The site principal investigator  or 
designated sub -investigator, in conjunction with the appropriate P AL and the DIAN -TU Medical 
Director or designee, will review new ARIA findings and apply the intervention algorithms 
below using best clinical judgment to weigh the data available to decide whether changes in drug treatment are indicated.

APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 147 of 265 ARIA -related intervention al gorithm  
The tables below detail the ARIA- E linked intervention algorithm based on these scores ( Table 1 
and Table 2) and the intervention algorithm for ARIA -H microhemorrhage ( Table 3) and 
superficial siderosis ( Table 4).  Algorithms are based on definite ARIA findings only.  For ARIA- E, 
the algorithm relies on measures of the largest diamete r of any ARIA -E.  For ARIA- H, areas of 
microhemorrhage are counted and larger areas of hemorrhage (macrohemorrhage) are noted.  
Should both, ARIA -E and ARIA- H be present in the same subject, the more conservative 
procedure should be followed.  
For ARIA case s where there are symptoms that are possibly related to the ARIA findings, more 
stringent procedures should be considered (e.g., withhold treatment for symptomatic cases even if the procedures in the table would not require it).

2 STUDY DRUG  
 Double -blind Period  
2.1.1 Drug Description  
Gantenerumab (RO4909832) is a recombinant human anti -Aβ monoclonal antibody of the 
immunoglobulin subclass G1 (IgG1) that binds specifically to aggregated Aβ.  
 
  
Following the approval of Amendment 5, study drug  is provided as sterile , preservative -free 
high -concentration liquid formulation

APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 150 of 265 2.1.2 Drug Treatment Regimen  
All subjects start at a dose of 225 mg of study drug administered SC approximately every 
4 weeks.  
Following the approval of  Protocol  Amendment 5, all subjects will sign the new ICF and initiate 
up titration starting at the 450 mg dose level.  Subjects should receive at least two doses at 
each titration step, 4 weeks (± 4 days) apart, before proceeding to the next titration step.  
Advancement to the next titration step is guided by the ARIA related intervention algorithm for dose titration (see tables in section 1.14).  The dos e titration and safety MRI schedule is 
provided in Table 5. 
Subjects will continue dosing up to a minimum of 204 weeks and a maximum of 360 weeks based upon when the subject was randomized into the study.  
Table 5 DIAN -TU-001 Gantenerumab Titration Safety MRI Schedule  
 
a Up through Amendment 4, safety MRIs will be scheduled before the first dose (baseline scan for safety reads done at V2) 
and then about 1 week (± 4 days) after dose 2; dose 4; dose 6; dose 9; dose 17 and dose 22.  Additional safety MRIs are 
done as part of the volumetric MRI at the annual assessments before dose 14 (V15, week 52), dose 27 (V28, week 104), 
dose 40 (V41, week  156), and V54 (week 208).  This schedule will be fol lowed until up titration is initiated.  
b Amendment 8 includes a revised safety MRI schedule.  A safety MRI will be scheduled 1 week (± 4 days) after the second 
dose of each titration step (225 mg, 450 mg, 675 mg, 900 mg), unless otherwise indicated by the ARIA -E and ARIA -H 
management algorithms (section 1.15).  Subjects may be at different titration steps and time points in the schedule of visits at the time of this amendment and should be scheduled based upon their current titration step/stable dose at the 
time of the amendment.  If an annual visit follows the second dose of a titration step, the annual MRI assessment can fulfill this requirement as long as the MRI reading is reviewed prior to dosing at that visit.  
c For the titration step #4, the final titration step (1200 mg), safety MRIs will be scheduled 1 week (± 4 days) after every 
third dose (or approximately every 3 months) for the next 6 doses unless otherwise indicated by the ARIA -E and ARIA -H 
management algorithms (section 1.15).  If an annual vis it follows the third dose, the annual MRI assessment can fulfill 
this requirement as long as the MRI reading is reviewed prior to dosing at that visit.  
d The titration schema was designed to reach the target dose of 1200 mg administered every 4 weeks; howe ver, the target 
dose may not be achieved as otherwise dictated by ARIA -E and ARIA -H management algorithms (section 1.15) or more 
conservative action by the site principal investigator/sponsor.  Once a subject re aches their stable dose (defined as the 
maximum dose the subject will remain at for the duration of the trial) safety MRIs will follow every 6 doses (or 
approximately every 6 months) unless otherwise indicated by the algorithm.  The safety MRIs following e very sixth dose 
of 1200 mg must occur regardless of when the annual MRI is scheduled.  INITIAL

Clinical study materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.  
Site staff preparing and administering the study drug should contact the trial sponsor or designee as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or problem with the stu dy drug so that 
the situation can be assessed.  
2.1.4 Blinding of Study Drug  
Subjects will be randomized to receive gantenerumab or placebo by the IWRS in order to maintain blinding.  All treatment kits will be supplied in numbered kits.  The subject, study nurse s, and DIAN -TU site staff will be blinded as to treatment assignment (active or placebo) 
but not study drug arm.  
In the double -blind period  of the study, personnel involved in preparing and filling syringes with 
study drug must not be involved with subject care in the study nor communicate any 
observations made during the study drug preparation to any personnel involved in the care of the subject.  Personnel who reconstitute and/or fill syringes may also give the injections but must observe the rules above for those involved in study drug preparation.  
The study drug administered for subjects that may enter OLE will not be blinded.  
2.1.5 Dispensing of Study Drug  
Upon approval of Amendment 5, the study drug for doses of 225 mg and above will be administered subcutaneously (SC)

Strict adherence to the planned dose regimen is require d.  However, a single missed dose may 
not automatically result in study withdrawal.  Site staff or designee will document completion 
of injection on study documents.  Because all dosing is supervised by trained healthcare providers, subjects who successful ly receive at least 70% of a dose (e.g., complete dose not 
administered due to technical complications) are automatically compliant with treatment.

3 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 Enrollment 
See details in section 3.4  of the main protocol.   
 Randomization  
From the  perspective of the subjects and site study staff, subjects were randomized to one of 
two study drug arms (gantenerumab or solanezumab).  Within each study drug arm, subjects 
were further divided into those who receive active drug or placebo ( Figure 2).   
Subject randomization was performed separately for mutation positive and mutation negative 
subjects.  Mutation positive subjects were randomized using a minimization strategy.  Groups 
were balanced as to the predetermined number of asymptomatic (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]=0) and symptomatic (CDR>0) subjects based on power calculations for the primary outcome of each individual study drug arm in the DIAN -TU platform.  Other factors such as 
Clinical Dementia Ratin g Sum of Boxes (CDR- SB), years to estimated age at onset, and the 
presence or absence an apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) ε4 allele were included as minimization factors 
designed to ensure optimal balance between arms on potentially important characteristics.  The minimization strategy did not differentiate between those who have one (heterozygous) or 
two (homozygous) APOE ε4  alleles.  APOE  ε4 was included in the minimization strategy because 
preliminary data suggests the presence of an APOE ε4  allele increases the risk of amyloid -
related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in sporadic DAT.  It is not known whether the presence of an APOE ε4  allele affects the risk of ARIA in the DIAD population.   
Mutation positive subjects (mc+) were randomized to active drug or placebo i n a 3:1 ratio 
(Figure 3) while subjects who did not carry a mutation linked to DIAD (mc -) were assigned to 
placebo.  Subjects and site study staff continue to be blinded as to subject’s genetic status (mc+ or mc -), unless the subject is aware of their genetic status and chooses to disclose it.   
Mutation negative subjects participate in all study procedures and assessments to maintain blinding as to genetic status for those who do not wish to know their genetic status.  Mutation negative subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy or futility analyses, as they will not

The frequency for safety MRIs is provided in Table 5. 
3.3.1 Visit 1 ( screening visit)  
Location:  Visit 1 procedures may be accomplished at the DIAN -TU site or at the subject’s home 
or other trial- identified location with the trial- designated home health nurse.  This visit also 
includes telephone calls with the DIAN -TU site s taff.  The subject is contacted by their host 
DIAN -TU site by telephone or during a regular DIAN observational (DIAN -OBS) study visit.  The 
subject is given the opportunity to review the main and drug -specific supplemental ICFs, ask 
questions and obtain answers, and sign the main ICF.  
Time:   Informed consent must be obtained before any other study procedures.  Informed 
consent,  family history, demographic information and medical and treatment history may be 
obtained before the 8 -week screening period begins .  Informed consent should be obtained 
from both subject and study partner.  Unless otherwise specified, all other Visit 1 procedures 
may occur throughout the screening period (2 -8 weeks before V2).  IMPORTANT:  Results from 
screening clinical laboratory te sts and genetic testing must be available before V2; blood draw 
for genetic testing must be completed at least 6 weeks before V2  to ensure genetic results are 
available for baseline randomization .  The screening visit in the home ensures subject eligibilit y 
before travel (if applicable) to the DIAN -TU site for baseline testing and randomization.  
Procedures (all can be performed by DIAN -TU site staff or trial -designated and trained home 
health nurse or other staff except as noted- see Global Manual of Operati ons and DIAN Trials 
Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual for additional details on order and timing of procedures) : 
• Obtain informed consent (DIAN -TU site staff should be available to answer questions)  
• Obtain or confirm family history and determine parental estimated age at onset or subject’s actual age at onset (DIAN -TU site staff).  Estimated age at onset should be 
determined as outlined in the Global Manual of Operations    
• Verify documentation of subject’s trial eligible mutation status OR  confirm via family 
pedigree and mutation documentation (proband) that the subject is at 50% risk for a trial- eligible mutation  
• Collect demographic information and study partner information  
• Obtain medical and treatment history  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, res piratory rate, body temperature).  Weight is 
not required at this visit but subject’s self- reported weight may be noted if required for 
laboratory tests

Page 161 of 265 • Blood draw:  
o Genetic testing (NOTE: genetic testing blood sample must be obtained at least 
6 weeks prior  to Visit 2)  
o Clinical laboratory tests, including TSH, B12, hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR  
o Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  
• Urine collection for urinalysis  
• Administration of Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• Screening cognitive battery (subset of testing serves as practice test; takes about 30 minutes).  See section 6.1.14  of main protocol  
A study -specific subject identification number is assigned to the subject by the interactive web 
resp onse system (IWRS).  Visit 2 is not scheduled to occur until the results of clinical laboratory 
test are available and results of genetic testing are entered in IWRS.  Results of genotyping of 
APOE  and DIAD- associated genes ( APP, PSEN1 , and PSEN2 ) will not be sent to the site to ensure 
genetic blinding is maintained  during double -blind treatment periods, but they may be 
provided as specified in section 6.1.9  of the main protocol.  
3.3.2 Visit 2 (baseline/first dose)  
Location:  Host DIAN -TU site. 
Time/Timing:   Approximately a 3 -4 day visit that is scheduled 2 -8 weeks after the screening visit 
and at least 6 weeks after the genetic sample draw .  This visit can only take place after results 
from screening clinical laboratory tests are docume nted as consistent with inclusion/exclusion 
criteria before Visit 2 occurs.  Genotyping results will need to be confirmed as received and 
having completed analysis but no results will be provided or reviewed by site staff.  The study 
partner participates in some of the procedures at Visit 2 and other annual visits at the DIAN -TU 
site.  If possible, the study partner should accompany the subject to the DIAN -TU site for these 
visits.  If this is not possible, the study partner procedures can be completed via telephone.  The 
sequence and timing of visit procedures is very important.  Requirements and suggested timing of visit procedures  are detailed in the Global Manual of Operations .  Baseline visit procedures 
may be scheduled over a longer period of up to 2 weeks for subjects who live near the study site or in the event that some study procedures (e.g., PET imaging) are done at a different DIAN -TU site.   
Note: The date during Visit 2 when the first dose of study drug is administered should be used 
for determining the timing of all subsequent visits.  
Procedures:  
• In-person review of informed consent for subjects who provided consent over the 
telephone  
• Medical/treatment history, including:  
o Concomitant medications  
o Assessment /recording of pre -existing conditions o r adverse events

If a subject withdraws, is terminated from the study prior to completion, or is in a study drug 
arm that is stopped prior to the end of the double -blind treatment period, every effort should 
be made to schedule an early termination visit that will include all procedures done at Visit 54 for those not yet having completed that visit, or Visit 93 for those beyond V54.  Drug -specific 
testing should also be obtained at early termination vi sit only if prior to completion of V54, 
week 208 (see section 1.12).  PET imaging studies may be omitted if early termination occurs less than 6 months after the previous PET imaging or if precluded by local regulations/dosimetry limits.  Other procedures may also be eliminated on a case -by-case basis, 
as determined by the sponsor.  
Per the main protocol section 6.3.7, any subject meeting study drug discontinuation criteria per main protocol section 4.4.1 due to s afety reasons, inability to continue treatment 
administration/dosing, or perform study procedures, will be encouraged to continue participation in any of the scheduled clinical, cognitive, and/or biomarker assessments that they are able to perform, even th ough dosing has concluded.  The determination of which 
assessments are to be attempted/completed will be decided by the site principal investigator and sponsor and will be based on the subject’s capabilities, the benefit to the study, and the risk associat ed with continued participation at the time of study drug discontinuation.  The level 
of continued participation may change if/as the subject’s status changes.

4 DRUG -SPECIFIC ANALYSIS PLAN  
 DIAN -Multivariate Cognitive Endpoint Power Analysis and Sample Size 
Determination  
The power was estimated based on the multivariate disease progression model (MDPM) and 
the DIAN -MCE primary endpoint with four arms: t he gantenerumab active drug arm, the 
solanezumab active drug arm, the mutation  positive placebos , and the eligible DIAN -OBS 
subjects.  For details, refer to the SAP and gantenerumab -specific SAP appendix.  
 Biomarker Endpoint Statistical Analysis, Power and Sample Size Justification  
4.2.1 Biomarker Endpoint Power Analysis  
Power analysis for the biomarker endpoints suggests 42 mutation positive subjects in the gantenerumab arm along with 27 mutation carriers in the pooled placebo group will provide 

Washington University in St . Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 182 of 265 over 99% power to  detect the projected effect size for changes in [11C]PiB -PET.  Recruitment 
goal is for 69 mutation positive subjects; 52 on gantenerumab and 17 on placebo, for a total of 
34 in the pooled placebo group.  These recruitment goals will allow for 5% annual at trition rate.  
4.2.2 Biomarker Endpoint Sample Size Justification  
Table 9 summarizes the power analysis by presenting the estimated SD from the DIAN cohort 
and the effect size on the annual rate of change for [11C]PiB -PET C -SUVR that can  be detected 
by 42 subjects in the active drug group (52 subjects enrolled, assumes 5% annual dropout rate during the trial) and 27 subjects in the pooled placebo group (34 subjects enrolled; assumes a 
5% annual dropout) with at least 80% power.  For comparison, Table 9 also lists the effect size 
on the rate of change for the same biomarkers reported by recently published clinical trials.  
The projected effect size is smaller than all reported effect size for C -SUVR , demonstrating that 
the proposed sample size provides adequate statistical power to detect reasonable effect sizes.  In fact, for the biomarker endpoint used at the interim analysis, the proposed sample size (i.e., 52 in the active drug group and 34 in the pooled placebo group) provides more  than 99%  
statistical power to detect two -thirds of the reported effect size in the literature or through 
personal communications and at least 80% power even for some other additional endpoints.  
Also provided are the e stimated powers for 12 months of exposure of 675 mg, 900  mg, and 
1200 mg ( Table 10). 
In summary, recruitment of 52 mutation positive subjects to the active drug group (at least 42 completers assuming 5% annual attrition during the study period) and 34 mutation positive 
subjects to the pooled placebo group (at least 27 completers assuming 5% annual attrition 
during the study period) would provide statistical power to test the biomarker engagement 
hypotheses.

Effect Size = difference between active drug and placebo on the annual rate of change for the co rresponding efficacy 
endpoint that can be detected by 52 subjects in the active drug group (42 after 5% annual attrition) and 34 subjects in the mutation positive ( pooled ) placebo group (27 after 5% annual attrition)
  
1 Taking a conservative manner, the pl anned reduction in PiB C -SUVR for dose 450 mg is assumed to be 0.096/year, which is 
the same as the planned reduction for the current dose 225 mg.

900 mg  0.192 (0.137)  >99%  
1200 mg  0.256 (0.137)  >99%  
1 Assuming that the reduction in PiB C -SUVR for dose 450 mg is 0.096/year, the change/year for dose 675 is 0.144 
(= 675/450*0.096), for dose 900 mg is 0.192 (=  900/450*0.096), and for  1200 mg is 0.256 (=  1200/450*0.096).  A 
linear relationship between change/year and dose as well as a consistent standard deviation (SD) is assumed.  
4.2.3 Interim Analysis  
As a result of including dose titration in the study design, subjects will be starting ti tration at 
different times in relation to their initial enrollment and the titration itself may occur at a 
different rate for each subject.  Therefore, the three  interim analyses previously scheduled will 
not be conducted.  Instead, a single biomarker inte rim analysis will be done when 100% of the 
active subjects have completed 2 years of randomized treatment (Visit 28).

CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final  Amendment 10  
APPENDIX 3: Gantenerumab  Version Date:  20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 184 of 265 At this interim analysis, the pre -specified biomarker endpoint will be examined.  If the drug 
does not meet any of the pre -specified crite ria for stopping or modification (as detailed in the 
DSMB Charter or as defined in the gantenerumab- specific SAP appendix), the DIAN -TU 
Coordinating Center and/or DSMB may recommend that the study drug arm continue until the 
pre-planned trial duration is c ompleted.  
 Other Drug -Specific Analyses  
With the dose escalation in the trial, the primary outcome will be analyzed based on the randomized population of active vs. mutation carrier placebo  and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects , as 
specified in section 8.4 of the main protocol, and the SAP . 
 Changes to the Data Analysis  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other change to th e data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the final SAP  and clinical study report (CSR).  Additional analyses of the data will be 
conducted as deemed appropriate.  
5 DRUG -SPECIFIC ADVE RSE EVENTS AND REPORTING  
No adverse events of special interest are defined.  
ARIAs may  be reported as an AE  per MedDRA -preferred term based upon investigator’s 
discretion upon review of the MRI finding, assessment of clinical symptoms, and adverse event definitions as outlined in section 7.1.1 .

Footnotes:  
1. Annual visits will be conducted at the host DIAN -TU site (DIAN -TU).  For subjects who live at a distance from the DIAN -TU site, other visits may be co nducted at a site 
nearer to their home (H); safety magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) may be performed at a study -approved facility nearer to their home.  See next two footnotes for 
additional detail.  
2. Infusions/injections and safety visits (designated as occ urring at home[H]) may occur at the DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a distance from the DIAN -TU site, 
these visits may be conducted by a trial -designated home health nurse at the subject’s home or other trial -identified location.  These visits ma y include phone calls from 
the host DIAN -TU site staff.  
3. The specific date during the baseline visit  (V2) when the first dose of study drug is administered should be used to determine timing of all subsequent visits.  
4. Informed consent will be obtained in two  steps.  Subjects will have the opportunity to review the main  informed consent form  (ICF) and the supplemental drug -specific 
ICFs and to discuss with DIAN -TU site study staff on the phone or in- person.  They can sign the main ICF at home or at the DIAN -TU site.  The main ICF must be signed 
before any study procedures are performed.  After screening labs are obtained and the subject is randomized to a specific study drug arm at baseline visit ( V2), subject 
will review and sign a supplemental study drug -spec ific consent that details specific risks/benefits and procedures for the study drug arm to which they were assigned.

Page 190 of 265 5. Study drug -specific supplemental consent should be reviewed and signed after randomization prior to first dose.  
6. Family history/age at onset  and demographic information for subject and study partner will be collected during the screening period and confirmed at the baseline visit  
(V2).  This information will not be collected at subsequent visits unless the subject or study partner becomes awar e of new information or the study partner changes 
during the study.  
7. Home health nurses will have specific scripts or forms to prompt assessment and collection of medical treatment history, heal th changes or complaints (for assessment 
of adverse events by t he site) and concomitant medications.  
8. Preexisting conditions will be documented at screening visit  (V1) and reviewed at baseline visit (V2) prior to study drug administration.  
9. Provenance testing to confirm specimen identity will be performed at baseline vi sit only (V2).  
10. Includes TSH, B12, Hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR at Screening Visit (V1) only.  
11. Serum pregnancy testing will be performed at screening visit  (V1), V54 and V93 and at the E nd-of-Study (EOS) visit .  Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at all 
other visits.  Pregnancy tests will be confirmed as negative prior to dosing with study drug.  Urine pregnancy test must be c ompleted and confirmed as negative either 
the day of or the day prior to any PET scan; if PET scans occur on more than 2 consecutive days during annual visits more than one urine pregnancy test will be required.  
Women who have undergone tubal ligation are also required to have pregnancy tests performed.  Alternate tests may be used if urine collection is not feasible but must 
be approved by the sponsor in advance.  
12. Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples should be obtained before study drug administration at the indicated visits.  Time of coll ection and timing of drug administration 
should be recorded.  
13. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) sample s should be obtained at the indicated visits.  These should be drawn before study drug administration.  Time of collection and timing of 
drug administration should be recorded.  
14. For future studies, including future regulatory inquiries or additional monitor ing of anti -drug antibodies or other drug -specific tests.  See main protocol section  6.1.12.  
15. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be collected at all visits.  Height will be measured at baselin e (V2) and annual visits only; weight 
will be measured approximately every 3 months.  
16. Clinical assessments: DIAN -TU clinical assessment battery includes: study partner interview and administration of clinical dementia rating ( CDR) and supplemental CDR; 
clinician assessment of symptoms and diagnosis; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Assessment Scale (FAS), Neuropsychia tric Inventory (NPI -Q) and M ini-
Mental State Exam ination (MMSE ). 
17. The Cognitive testing battery will include both computer -administe red and conventional testing.  See section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition 
Core Procedures Manual for additional information.  The full battery will be administered at baseline visit ( V2) and at annual  visits.  A subset of the full battery (see 
section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual will be administered by the home health nurse in the home as a practice 
battery at the screeni ng visit (V1) and at the 6 -month visits, for visits not occurring at the DIAN -TU site.  Cognitive testing should be completed as early in the day as 
possible, and before study drug infusion or injection.  
18. Lumbar puncture ( LP) should be performed after MRI, if on the same date.  LPs  should be conducted as close to the baseline (V2) collection time as possible at each 
subsequent visit and under fasting conditions (water is allowed and encouraged).  Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF)  will be sent to  a local laboratory f or cell count and 
differential, glucose and protein as well as to central lab for sample management, including Washington University Biomarker Core lab and designated research/referral 
labs for biomarker and drug -specific analysis.  Site staff should conta ct the subject with a follow -up phone call or brief visit within 24 hours after LP, and no longer than 
48 hours later, to review any adverse events.  
19. Only for subjects participating in the tau PET imaging addendum.  Participating subjects may have no more t han three (3) scans at any of the indicated visits (refer to the 
tau protocol addendum).  
20. Safety MRIs (SM) visits will be done at the DIAN -TU site or a qualified imaging center in reasonable proximity to the subject’s home  for subjects  not close to their DI AN-
TU site .  When possible, these will be done at an ADNI and/or ADCS site qualified imaging center.   
21. Prior to randomization, verify that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, including ARIA findings on baseline (V2) MRI.  
22. Site study coordinators shoul d call subjects either during or within two weeks after V3, V4 and V5.  For V6 and subsequent home visits, coordinator calls can be made 
with less frequency at the discretion of the principal investigator  or designee, and/or coordinator, and subject, but s hould occur at least every 3 months.  
23. PET imaging studies may be omitted if early termination (ET) occurs less than 6 months after the previous PET imaging or if p recluded by local regulations/dosimetry 
limits.  Other procedures may also be eliminated on a case -by-case basis, as determined by the sponsor.

Page 207 of 265 1 DRUG -SPECIFIC INTRODUCTION  
 Background  
Both ac tive and passive immunization strategies directed against amyloid beta peptides are 
currently under investigation.  The first preclinical studies demonstrating reduction in amyloid 
burden were performed in APPV717F (“PDAPP”) transgenic mice over 15 years ago (Schenk et al., 
1999; Bard et al., 2000 ).  The PDAPP mouse and all other genetic mouse models of AD are  
based on the mutations in APP , PSEN1  and PSEN2  that underlie the autosomal dominant forms 
of AD represented in the DIAN cohort.  The preclinical studies in these mouse models are even 
more relevant to these individuals than to those with sporadic AD.  
 Study Drug  
Solanezumab/LY2062430 is a humanized anti-  Aβ peptide immunoglobulin G -1 (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody that recognizes a mid- domain epitope of the Aβ peptide (amino acid 
residues 13 -28).  Preclinical data (see below) suggest that solanezumab binds to s oluble but not 
aggregated Aβ peptides.  Approximately 0.1% of solanezumab crosses the blood –brain barrier 
and binds selectively to soluble monomeric Aβ in the central compartment.  This binding may 
alter equilibria between soluble monomers and other aggreg ated forms of Aβ.  Nonclinical 
evidence in transgenic mice suggests that the altered equilibria may slow plaque accrual.  
 Preclinical Data  
The first passive immunization studies used antibodies targeted to the N -terminal region of the 
Aβ peptide (e.g., Bard et al., 2000 ); this region of the peptide is accessible in both aggregated 
and soluble forms of Aβ .  Antibodies that bind to the mid- domain of Aβ  such as m266.2 also 
slowed accumulation of amyloid plaque burden in APPV717F (“PDAPP”) mice ( DeMattos et al., 
2001)  and increased plasma Aβ  levels proportionally to the brain amyloid burden ( DeMattos et 
al., 2002 ).  Subsequent studies in PDAPP mice demonstrated that treatment with m266.2 
reversed the cholinergic and cognitive deficits in these mice ( Dodart et al., 2002 ; Bales et al., 
2006) . 
In APPV717F transgenic mice, a dosing regimen of 360 µg/week of m266.2 was fo und to result in 
a significant slowing of amyloid plaque deposition.  Using a mechanistic pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that used equilibrium binding equations to account for the binding between solanezumab and Aβ in the plasma compartm ent, this dose regimen in mice 
was estimated to produce a time -averaged reduction of unbound plasma Aβ of 67% at steady 
state.  Using the same mechanistic PK/PD model and preliminary solanezumab and Aβ data from clinical Study H8A- MC-LZAJ, a simulation was  performed to project the time -averaged 
reduction of unbound plasma Aβ for the clinical dose regimen of 400 mg intravenously given every 4 weeks.  This regimen was estimated to produce a time -averaged reduction of 93% at 
steady state.  Reductions in unbound plasma Aβ
42 are expected to be similar.  This reduction in 
unbound plasma Aβ is greater than the 67% reduction that was associated with biochemical

Page 208 of 265 efficacy in APPV717F mice and was in part used to justify the dose regimen to explore in Phase 3 
clinical trials.  
 Clinical Data  
Lilly is conducting 1 ongoing solanezumab clinical trial, in addition to DIAN -TU 001, with  3 
concluded Phase 3 trials.  
As of 13 October 2016, there were 9 solanezumab studies completed or with interim database 
locks (Studies LZAH, LZAI, LZAJ, LZAK, LZAM, LZAN, LZAO, LZAT, and LZAX).  One or more infusions of solanezumab were administered to approximately 3725 subjects.  See most current Investigator’s Brochure.  
 Dose Selection/Rationale  
The DIAN -TU study was initiated with solanezumab 4 00 mg administered intravenously every 
4 weeks (400 mg Q4W).  Selection of the 400 mg Q4W dose was based largely, but not entirely, 
on the peripheral sink hypothesis, which held that maximizing peripheral target engagement would change Aβ equilibria, resul ting in altered amyloid deposition in the central compartment, 
ultimately leading to a slowing of disease progression.  The 400 mg Q4W dose was selected to lower free plasma Aβ concentrations by at least 90%, a level that exceeded what had been associated with slowing of amyloid plaque deposition in transgenic rodent species.  
The negative primary outcome of Study LZAX, which did not demonstrate statistically significant slowing of progression in the population of patients treated with solanezumab 400 mg Q4W  
who were amyloid -positive and who had mild dementia due to AD, suggests that the peripheral 
sink hypothesis for target engagement to determine dose selection may not predict clinical efficacy in Phase 3 trials.  Thus, central  target engagement based on bi omarkers may provide 
better predictive value for Phase 3 dose selection.  
Phase 2 solanezumab data suggest that greater central target engagement is likely to be 
achieved with dosing greater than 400  mg Q4W ( Figure 1).  Whether suc h an increase in target 
engagement will result in improved clinical efficacy remains unknown.  A dose of 400 mg every week (400 mg QW), which is equivalent to 1600 mg over a 4 -week period, was assessed in 
Phase 2 Studies LZAJ and LZAK , and showed increased  CSF Aβ concentrations and an acceptable 
safety profile.  
Based on the safety profile observed with solanezumab at all doses tested in clinical studies (section 1.6), and based on the goal of increasing central t arget engagement, the dose given in 
the DIAN -TU study was increased to 1600 mg Q4W.  
 Risks/Benefits  
A potential side effect of concern for treatments that target Aβ is the development of amyloid -
related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), as reported in studies o f passive immunization therapies 
directed against the N -terminal portion of the Aβ peptide (Sperling et al., 2012 ).  These changes

Page 209 of 265 include microhemorrhage, vasogenic edema and infarction; they are most often asymptomatic, 
but symptoms ha ve been reported.  
The safety profile of solanezumab as observed among patients with mild AD who were randomized to and received at least 1 dose of placebo (N=1727) or solanezumab (N=1708) for up to 18 months in Phase 3 Studies LZAM, LZAN, and LZAX is described below.  
The frequency of ARIA -E in solanezumab treated patients was greater than in patients treated 
with placebo; however, this AE was seen in only 0.6% of solanezumab treated patients and 0.3% of placebo treated patients and the difference was not statistically significant.  ARIA- E was 
not clearly related to symptoms in any patient.  More solanezumab - than placebo -treated 
patients had an increase in size of pre -existing ARIA- H or number of ARIA -H (6.1% and 5.2%, 
respectively), although this did not ha ve apparent clinical implications.  
None of the cases of ARIA were accompanied by concurrent symptoms in except for 1 patient who displayed symptoms during the open -label period in Study LZAX.  For this patient, 
symptoms of dizziness, balance disorder, tran sient paresthesia, and hemiparesis of the left arm 
were considered possibly related to a right frontal superficial siderosis (a type of ARIA- H) and 
mild right frontal ARIA- E. 
Infusion site reactions (local reactions) were seen in 2.1% and 2.0% of the solanezumab-  and 
placebo -treated patients, respectively.  
Treatment -emergent anti -drug antibodies (ADA) developed in 2.7% of patients exposed to 
solanezumab at any time during the placebo -controlled period (1.7% treatment induced, 
1% treatment boosted, and 0.5% neutralizing).  Among placebo -treated patients,  3.2% 
developed treatment -emergent ADA (2.1% treatment induced, 1.1% treatment boosted, and 
0.8% neutralizing).  No TEAEs appeared to be associated with ADA.  Based on completed analyses of Studies LZAM and LZ AN, these laboratory findings were generally transient and low 
titer and solanezumab treatment -emergent immunogenicity did not appear to impact the PK of 
solanezumab or the PD response.  Analyses of Study LZAX are ongoing.  Thus, the concluded 
Phase 3 stud ies demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for solanezumab 400 mg Q4W.  
Solanezumab has also been tested in higher doses than 400 mg QW in prior early phase studies.  
Phase 1 Studies LZAH (N=4) and LZAI (N=4) investigated the safety and tolerability of solanezumab in AD patients at single doses up to 10 mg/kg, which is approximately equivalent 
to 700 mg.  Of the 8 subjects receiving 10 mg/kg, 3 had apparent mild and self- limited infusion 
reactions.  Phase 2  Studies LZAJ (12 -week treatment duration) and LZ AK (8 -week treatment 
duration) included doses of 400 mg weekly (N=11 in each study), which is the equivalent of 1600  mg of solanezumab in each 4 -week period.  The first 3 of these studies were conducted 
before ARIA- H and ARIA -E were understood as potential  risks for anti- amyloid therapies, and 
thus ARIA -H and ARIA -E were not specifically assessed on MRI.  However, no changes in MRIs 
were observed as safety concerns at any of the doses given.  Study LZAK was the first solanezumab study to assess for ARIA and  no ARIA -E or ARIA -H were reported in this study at 
any of the doses given.  While limited in sample size, these studies suggested an acceptable 
safety profile for solanezumab at these exposures.

 Drug -specific Study Design  
Drug -specific study design featur es include the use of CSF Aβ 42 as the biomarker endpoint for 
target engagement.  In addition, anti -solanezumab antibodies will be assessed.  A dose 
escalation period was added in Amendment 7; additional safety assessments are implemented 
during the dose es calation period, as described in the dose escalation study schedule 
(section  2.2).  Specific action plans that include dose modification should ARIA occur are 
provided in section 1.14.  
 Rationale for Biomarker Endpoint  
Rationale for use of CSF Aβ isoforms as target engagement biomarker for DIAN -TU 
Solanezumab Arm  
Although the precise dynamics of Aβ  homeostasis in the brain parenchyma and CSF are not fully 
understood, it is likely that levels of free Aβ species (not boun d to solanezumab) in the CSF 
reflect levels in brain interstitial fluid.  Emerging evidence suggests that amyloid plaques are not static, but rather that Aβ
 species in plaques also equilibrate with parenchymal Aβ  and ultimately 
with CSF.  Because solanezumab binds to soluble Aβ isoforms, free CSF Aβ may serve indirectly as a biomarker of target engagement.  Conversely, solubilization of Aβ in plaque might confound the use of free CSF Aβ as a biomarker of target engagement.  Solanezumab treatment was variably associated with increased, unchanged, or decreased CSF free Aβ
42 in studies LZAJ, 
LZAM, LZAN, and LZAX, respectively.  In each of these analyses, CSF free Aβ 40 was nominally 
decreased.  Importantly, in all solanezumab trials, a dose dependent increase in  total  
(bound+unbound) Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 was found, suggesting increased target engagement.  
Eli Lilly & Co mpany (Lilly)  first developed methods to measure free CSF Aβ  species (not bound to 
solanezumab) prior to study LZAJ and demonstrated a nominal decrease in  free CSF Aβ 40 in CSF 
in the groups treated with 100 mg QW, 100 mg Q4W, 400 mg Q4W and 100 mg QW relative to the placebo -treated group, although this only reached significance ( P < 0.01 compared to 
placebo) in the 400 mg QW group.  In contrast to the decre ase in unbound CSF Aβ
40, there was 
an increase in free (unbound) CSF Aβ 42.  While opposing effects on free CSF Aβ 42 and free CSF 
Aβ40 occurred in LZAJ, significant increases in both total CSF Aβ 42 and total CSF Aβ 40 were 
associated with solanezumab treatme nt.  The dose -dependent increase in total CSF Aβ in study 
LZAJ support the contention of dose -dependent increases in target engagement.  
Concentrations in treated groups as compared to placebo are represented in Figure 1 below.   
This contrasts with preclinical studies (in rats without amyloid plaques) where administration of 
the antibody m266.2 results in decreases in both free CSF Aβ 40 and Aβ 42.  The patients in the 
LZAJ study, unlike the rats, likely had substantial amyloid plaque  burden in the CNS before 
initiating treatment.

 Primary Study Endpoint  
A multivariate  mixed effects cognitive disease progression model ( MDPM) for repeated 
measures with a pro portional treatment effect will be used to assess statistical differences in 
the rate of decline, relative to the expected years from symptom onset, of the DIAN -MCE  scores 
between the active drug and the mutation positive placebos and eligible DIAN -OBS sub jects.   
See section 3.5 of the main protocol for more details.

 Additional  Study Endpoints and Biomarker Endpoint for Interim Analyses  
Additional  study endpoints are described in the main study protocol  and will be specified as 
secondary or exploratory in the solanezumab -specific SAP  appendix .  Refer to the final drug -
specific SAP for differentiation of endpoint classification based on the respective drug’s target 
and mechanism of action . 
Change in total amyloid -beta 1 -42 (Aβ 42) in CSF  will be used as the biomarker of interest for 
interim analysis as well as biomarker endpoint for the solanezumab dru g arm as specified in the 
solan ezumab -specific SAP appendix .  An increase in total CSF Aβ 42 concentrations is consistent 
with target e ngagement in the central compartment ( Siemers et al., 2010 ). 
 Primary Safety Endpoints  
This study will assess safety and tolerability of treatment with solane zumab in individuals at risk 
for dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease.  The primary safety endpoints are identical for all 
study compounds.  Only drug -specific safety endpoints are included here.

• Dose 2 of 1600 mg (12 weeks after dose 1 of 800 mg dose)  
• Dose 4 of 1600 mg (20 weeks after dose 1 of 800 mg dose)  
During the dose escalation period, samples for plasma solanezumab levels should be collected 
before infusion and within 30 min utes  after completion of infusion for post -dose levels.  
1.12.2  Plasma and Serum Collection and Retention Procedures  
Venous blood will be drawn into sodium ethylene diamine tetra- acetic acid (EDTA) tubes  for the 
determination of plasma concentrations of solanezumab  and Aβ, at the times indicated in the 
Study Schedule (see above).  Serum will be collected for anti -solanezumab antibody titers.  A 
saline well or heparin lock may be used to facilitate blood c ollection.  On the dosing day, the 
blood will be collected from the arm that did not receive the infusion of study drug.  
It is critical that the date and time of sample acquisition, and date and time of administration of study drug are accurately recorded for each blood sample.  Only samples from subjects dosed 
with solanezumab will be assayed for solanezumab.    
Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory will occur per instructions given to the investigative study site.  
Bioanalytical samples col lected to measure study drug concentrations will be retained for a 
maximum of one ( 1) year following last subject visit.  
Plasma and CSF used for the assessment of Aβ may be stored for a maximum of 15 years following last subject visit.  
Samples collected to  assess anti -solanezumab titers will be retained for a maximum of 15 years 
following last subject visit for the study.  
1.12.3  Technique Used for Evaluation of Plasma  
Plasma concentrations of solanezumab and Aβ for pharmacodynamic analysis will be determined from processed blood samples using validated enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) methods.  Accurate plasma Aβs analyses can only be achieved using ELISA designed to be tolerant to solanezumab as this anti -Aβ drug candidate produces concentration-
dependent interference in traditional immunoassays for analysis of Aβ isoforms.  
Results of solanezumab and Aβ analyses that could unblind the study will not be provided to investigators or other blinded personnel.

Page 214 of 265 1.12.4  Technique Used for Evaluation of Cerebrospinal Flui d  
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of solanezumab and Aβ for pharmacodynamic analysis 
will be determined using validated immunoassay methods.  Accurate CSF Aβ analyses can only be achieved using immunoassays designed to be tolerant to solanezumab as described above.  
CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau) will also be determined using validated immunoassay methods.  Samples from placebo -treated subjects will not be assayed 
for solanezumab.  Amyloid β peptide, tau, and drug con centration measurements that could 
unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or other blinded personnel.  
1.12.5  Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Plasma Solanezumab  
PK data analysis for solanezumab will be conducted by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) , and will be 
conducted according to an analysis plan currently being developed by Lilly.  In general, the 
planned process used to evaluate the PK data will be as follows: The plasma solanezumab 
concentration data collected in the DIAN -TU study will be gra phically compared to predictions 
generated from the population PK model developed with data pooled from previous Phase 3  
trials sponsored by Lilly.  
If it is determined that the population PK model adequately predicts the concentration data from DIAN -TU, th e model will be used to estimate individual exposure parameters (e.g., AUC) 
for the subjects in the DIAN -TU trial.  If it is determined that the model does not adequately 
predict observed plasma concentrations in the DIAN -TU trial, the model may be updated  using 
the data from the DIAN -TU trial.  Specifically, modeling will be conducted using nonlinear mixed 
effects modeling (NONMEM) or other appropriate software.  This model may incorporate 
information from the Phase 3 trials in order to better estimate exp osure parameters, as 
warranted.  AUC and C
max estimates will be generated for both the 400  mg and 1600  mg dose 
levels for each patient.   
Graphical analyses will be conducted to summarize the effect of post hoc AUC and/or C max 
estimates on CSF and/or plasma biomarkers using the exposure estimate consistent with the 
dose level administered prior to the collection of the biomarkers.  These exposure estimates may be used in correlation analyses with various biomarkers, including plasma Aβ concentrations.  A population PK/PD model previously developed by Lilly to estimate time -
averaged reduction in free plasma Aβ
40 may be used with these data, if appropriate.  If 
warranted, additional modeling may be performed based on the results of these analyses.  
 Drug -specific  Safety Concerns 
1.13.1  Amyloid -related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA)  
Amyloid -related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are a special safety endpoint in studies of 
Alzheimer’s immunotherapies, including both active and passive immunization.  Since compounds studied in DIAN -TU are investigational, this study includes frequent MRI scans to 
assess for ARIA changes.  ARIA can occur as either cerebral edema (ARIA- E) or as hemorrhages 
Washington University in St. Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final Amendm ent 10  
APPENDIX 4:  Solanezumab  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 215 of 265 (ARIA -H), typically microhemorrhages, but larger hemorrhages and frank infarction have also 
been reported ( Sperling et al., 2012 ).  The number of microhemorrhages will be monitored at 
entry and throughout the trial.  
The frequency of MRI monitoring will be reduced to annually after the first two years of the 
study.  Results from  two large Phase 3 trials in mild -to-moderate AD (LZAM and LZAN) and one 
Phase 3 trial in mild AD (LZAX) have been analyzed and have shown no statistically significant differences between solanezumab and placebo on safety MRI parameters.  The reduced frequ ency of MRI monitoring here will closely match extension studies (LZAO and open -label 
extension period of LZAX) with solanezumab.  
Following the approval of Amendment 7, the dose escalation process will begin.  Subjects may be at different time points in the schedule of visits when initiating dose escalation, but all must 
have had at least 2 doses at 400  mg.  Prior to escalation to the 800  mg dose level, subjects will 
sign a new ICF.  
With other investigational anti- Aβ antibodies, most cases of dose -related ARIA- E have occurred 
after 2 doses of an increased dose (Sperling et al.  2012).  Therefore, an additional safety MRI 
will be conducted before the first dose of 1600 mg ( approximately 1 week after the second 
dose of 800 mg) .  The annual MRI assessment can fulfill this requirement.  The safety MRI must 
be reviewed prior to dose escalation to 1600 mg.  
Although the dose escalation schema was designed to reach the target dose of 1600 mg e very 
4 weeks, the target dose may not be achieved as otherwise dictated by the ARIA -related 
intervention algorithms or more conservative action to be discussed by the site and the sponsor.  The MRI schedule may be changed according to the ARIA related dosi ng intervention 
algorithm (see tables in section 1.15) or per individual request by the site principal investigator or delegated sub -investigator, Project Arm Leader (PAL), or Medical Director or designee.  
Safety MRIs will be performed at the same field st rength throughout the study, and if possible 
on the same scanner.  All MRIs will be centrally read.  
If any clinical concern arises, unscheduled MRIs can be conducted at any point during the DIAN -TU trial.  
1.13.2  Other Drug -specific Safety Concerns  
In addition to ARIA, acute infusion reactions may occur with any agent that may cause cytokine 
release, including monoclonal antibodies such as solanezumab.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours 
of infusion.  Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/ hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia, bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia, nausea, pruritus, rash, rigors/chills , sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, 
urticaria, and vomiting.

 ARIA -related Interventions Including Dose Changes and Discontinuation  
See main protocol sections 1.2 , 3.8, 6.1.15  and 6.1.16 for details of MRI reading and reporting.  
The Mayo -ADIR Clinic will review MRIs and provide a report on ARIA- E and ARIA -H.  This report 
will include both definite and possible findings.  A report of new defi nite ARIA -H or ARIA -E 
changes in a subject will trigger a review by the Medical Director or designee, Project Arm 
Leader  (PAL), and site principal investigator or delegated sub- investigator.  The site principal 
investigator  or designated sub- investigator, in conjunction with the appropriate PAL  and the 
DIAN -TU Medical Director or designee , will review new ARIA findings and apply the intervention 
algorithms below using best clinical judgment to weigh the data available to decide whether 
changes in drug treatment are indicated.  
ARIA related intervention algorithm  
The tables below detail the ARIA- E linked intervention algorithm based on these scores ( Table  1 
and Table 2) and the  intervention algorithm for ARIA- H microhemorrhage ( Table 3) and 
superficial siderosis ( Table 4).  Algorithms are based on definite ARIA findings only.  For ARIA- E, 
the alg orithm relies on measures of the largest diameter of any ARIA- E.  For ARIA- H, areas of 
microhemorrhage are counted and larger areas of hemorrhage (macrohemorrhage) are noted.  
Should both, ARIA -E and ARIA- H be present in the same subject, the more conservative 
procedure should be followed.  
For ARIA cases where there are symptoms that are possibly related to the ARIA findings, more stringent procedures should be considered (e.g., withhold treatment for symptomatic cases even if the procedures in the table wo uld not require it).

 Drug -specific Discontinuations or Withdrawal  
Subjects will be discontinued from the study if they had a prolonged acute infusion reaction 
that was not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication such as antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and/or narcotics and/or brief interruption of infusion.  
Mild infusion reactions r esponding to treatment or requiring pretreatment before subsequent 
infusions would not require discontinuation, unless discontinuation was considered appropriate based on medical judgment of the principal investigator or Medical Director.  
Following the app roval of Amendment 7, the dose escalation process will begin.  If the 
investigator considers that a subject may not be a candidate for dose escalation for any reason, the investigator should contact the sponsor to discuss whether to discontinue the subject.

Page 219 of 265 2 STUDY DRUG  
 Drug Description  
The active product or placebo will be supplied in a 20 mL vials for preparation with the 
appropriate diluent for intravenous infusion.  Details for supplies will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual . 
 Drug Treatment Regimen  
This study was initiated as a comparison of solanezumab (400 mg administered as an 
intravenous infusion of approximately 70 mL)  compared to placebo.  The active drug group was 
given an intravenous infusion of solanezumab 400  mg Q4W .   
The study protocol was ame nded to increase the dose administered up to 1600 mg Q4W; 
following approval of Amendment 7, the dose -escalation process will begin (which includes 
signing a new ICF).  After receiving at least two doses at the 400  mg level, 4 weeks (± 4 days) 
apart, subje cts should receive at least two doses at the 800  mg dose level, 4 weeks (± 4 days) 
apart, before proceeding to the 1600  mg dose level.  Changes in dosage may be made in the 
event of ARIA as described in section 1.14 or for other safety reasons at the investigator’s 
discretion with notification of a Medical Director, PAL, or designee.  
In addition to the Solanezumab Schedule of Visits, additional assessments during the dose 
escalation period are required, as described in the dose escalation study schedule.  The first 
doses of 800 mg will be given at the DIAN -TU site  or a medically qualified facility, such as an 
infusion clinic, until blinded safety results are evaluated for the first 20 subjects (active or placebo) to receive an 800  mg dose infusion ( Table  5); subsequent doses may be given by a 
home health nurse.  After the safety evaluation, first doses of 800  mg for the remaining 
subjects may be given by a home health nurse , if deemed appropriate ( Table  6). 
Similarly, the first doses of 1600 mg will be given at the DIAN -TU site  or a medically qualified 
facility such as an infusion clinic until blinded safety results are evaluated for  the first 20 
subjects (active or placebo) to receive a 1600 mg dose infusion ( Table  5).  After this evaluation, 
first doses of 1600 mg for the remaining subjects may be given by a home health nurse, if 
deemed appr opriate ( Table  6). 
All subjects will have a 1 -hour post dose monitoring period after their first 800 mg and first 
1600 mg doses.  
Subjects will continue dosing for up to a minimum of 204 weeks and a maximum of 360 w eeks 
based upon when the subject was randomized into the study.

e Infusion occurs after all other procedures at each visit.  
f Dosing at 1600 mg every 4 weeks to continue through the duration of the study.  
Study drug arms that demonstrate a  potential clinical benefit  may have an open -label extension 
period.  Eligible subjects may be offered the opportunity to receive active drug for up to 2 years 
in an open -label extension.  During OLE , subjects could receive an i ntravenous infusion of 
solanezumab 400 mg up to 1600 mg once every 4  weeks.  
All subjects enrolled in the open- label extension for solanezumab will start at the 400  mg dose 
level.  After receiving 400  mg every 4 weeks (± 4 days) for at least 2 infusions, su bjects will be 
titrated to the 800  mg dose level.  After receiving 800  mg every 4 weeks (± 4 days) for at least 2 
infusions, subjects will be titrated to the 1600  mg dose level.  After 2 doses at the 1600  mg dose 
level, a safety MRI will be performed.  If MRI findings prior to dosing in the OLE warrant more 
frequent MRIs during the dose escalation period of the open -label extension, the PI may 
request for review and approval by the sponsor medical monitoring team.  Please refer to Table 7 for a detailed schedule of dose -titration in OLE.

Before infusion, the diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter or 
discoloration.  If particulate matter or discoloration are present, the solution should NOT be used and new product should be dispensed for use via IWRS.  A product complaint form should be completed and submitted to the sponsor and the concerning vial quarantined pending further instruction.  Refer to t he Pharmacy Manual and Global Manual of Operations  for 
procedures for reporting problems with drug preparation and for requesting a replacement dose.  After each intravenous bag is prepared, it will be identified as a dose of study drug without identification of the drug or dose.  Once prepared, the infusate solution should be stored at room temperature for a total of no more than 6 hours.  
Clinical study materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.  
All study staff will be in structed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a 
complaint or problem with the study drug so that the situation can be assessed.  If particulate matter is seen in the vial or the prepared solution, a product complaint form needs to be 
completed and submitted to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours.  The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of the product complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study ( see the Pharmacy Manual  
or Global Manual of Operations  for additional details):  
• Recording a complete description of the product complaint reported and any associated AEs using the study -specific complaint forms provided for this purpose  
• Faxing the complete d product complaint form within 24 hours to the sponsor or its 
designee  
• If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a 
copy of the product complaint form with the product  
 Blinding of Study Drug  
Study drug will be  supplied in numbered vials.  Subject, home health nurses, and DIAN -TU site 
staff will be blinded as to whether the subject has been assigned to active drug or placebo.   
For subjects that may enter the open -label extension (OLE), study drug will not be bl inded.  
 Dispensing of Study Drug  
The dose will be dependent on where the subject is in the dose escalation schedule ( Table  5 or 
Table  6).  Infusions of 400 mg of study drug should be given by IV over a period of 30 minutes.  
Infusions of 800 mg and 1600 mg of study drug should be given by IV over a period of 
approximately 1 hour which may be adjusted as needed.  Refer to the Pharmacy Manual  for full 
dose preparation and admin istration instructions.  
If a subject demonstrates an infusion reaction to the study drug, the subject may be 
premedicated with antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine HCl, 50 mg orally or

Page 224 of 265 intravenously), and the infusion time may be extended for the remaining infusions.  An attempt 
should be made to complete the infusion within 2 hours of when first started.  
For the double -blind period,  t he subject should be observed for approximately 1 hour following 
the first infusion of study drug (V2) and after the fir st dose of each dose escalation step (i.e., 
after first 800  mg dose and after first 1600  mg dose).    
For the OLE period, no post -dose observation period is required.  The dose escalation schedule 
for OLE is outlined in  Table  7 DIAN -TU-001 Solanezumab Schedule of Visits: Dose Escalation 
Period  in the Open- label Extension Period . 
Note that all cognitive scales are to be administered before infusions.  
 Assessing Compliance with Study Drug  
DIAN -TU site staff or trial -designated home heal th nurse should document completion of 
infusion on study source documents.  Because dosing occurs at study visits, subjects who attend all visits and successfully receive infusions are automatically compliant with treatment.  Any infusion at which 75% (approximately 52.5 mL for 400  mg doses, 180 mL for 800 mg doses, and 
210 mL for 1600  mg doses) or more of the infusate is given will be considered a complete 
infusion.  
If a subject attends a visit but does not receive a complete infusion (for example, due to technical complications), every effort should be made to reschedule the infusion within 24 hours if possible.  If less than 75% of the infusate is given, this must be recorded as an 
incomplete infusion in the study source documents.  
Missed infusions should  be recorded on the study source documents.  Subjects who miss 
3 consecutive infusions or 7 overall may be discontinued from the study unless infusions are 
intentionally held due to ARIA or other AE. 
3 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 Enrollment  
See details in section 3.4  of the main protocol.  
 Randomization  
From the perspective of the subjects and site study staff, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment arms (gantenerumab or solanezumab).  Within each treatment arm, subjects were further  divided into those who receive active drug or placebo ( Figure 2). 
Subject randomization was performed separately for mutation positive and mutation negative subjects.  Mutation positive subjects were randomized us ing a minimization strategy.  Groups 
were balanced as to the predetermined number of asymptomatic (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]  = 0) and symptomatic (CDR>0) subjects based on power calculations for the primary 
outcome of each individual study drug arm in  the DIAN -TU platform.  Other factors such as

APPENDIX 4:  Solanezumab  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 225 of 265 Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR -SB), years to estimated age at onset, and the 
presence or absence an apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) ε4 allele were included as minimization factors 
designed to ensure optimal  balance between arms on potentially important characteristics.  
The minimization strategy did not differentiate between those who have one (heterozygous) or 
two (homozygous) APOE ε4  alleles.  APOE ε4  was included in the minimization strategy because 
preliminary data suggests the presence of an APOE ε4  allele increases the risk of amyloid -
related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in sporadic DAT.  It is not known whether the presence of an APOE ε4  allele affects the risk of ARIA in the DIAD population.  
Mutation positive subjects (mc+) were randomized to active drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio 
(Figure 3) while subjects who did not carry a mutation linked to DIAD (mc -) were assigned to 
placebo.  Subjects and site study staff continue to be blinded as to subject’s genetic status (mc+ 
or mc -, unless the subject is aware of their genetic status and chooses to disclose it) and 
whether they are on active drug or placebo.  
Mutation negative subjects participate in all study procedure s and assessments to maintain 
blinding as to genetic status for those who do not wish to know their genetic status.  Mutation 
negative subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy or futility analyses, as they will not be exposed to study drug; sa fety data will be reported separately for mutation positive and 
negative subjects.

 Specific Study Visits –  Double -blind Treatment Period  
The procedures to take place at each study visit during the double -blind treatment period are 
listed below.  All information on timing of visits refers to calendar days.  The specific date 
during the baseline visit (V2) when the first dose of study drug is administered should be used to determine timing of subsequent visits and for determining time between the screening and baseline visits.  
The sch edule of visits, including drug -specific tests and frequency of safety MRIs, is provided in 
the schedule of visit tables at the end of this appendix:  
• Solanezumab Schedule of Visits: 4 Year Double -blind Treatment Period  
• Solanezumab Schedule of visits: Doubl e-blind Treatment Beyond Year 4  
Following the approval of Amendment 7, the dose -escalation process will begin.  During the 
dose escalation period, procedures outlined in section 2.2  should be completed in additi on to  
the procedures for the scheduled visit.  These additional safety assessments include vital signs, safety laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), drug -specific monitoring, and 
ECGs (Table 5 and Table 6).  When the additional assessment  is part of the regularly scheduled 
visit, it does not need to be repeated.  
Upon completion of the double -blind treatment period for each study drug arm (i.e., last 
enrolled subject has completed 4 years [208 weeks] of treatment), subjects may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open- label extension period for up to an additional 2 years 
(24 months).  Eligible subjects may start treatment in the open -label extension period only after 
the final analysis of the double -blind treatment period has been completed and the study drug 
arm has demonstrated a potential clinical ben efit.  See section 3.4 for more details.  
A study drug arm may be stopped early or revised (e.g. dose adjustment or treatment duration), based upon the results of the interim analyses or information from other cl inical

years (208 weeks) for a study drug arm even if some subjects have exceeded this limit at the time of the decision.  
3.3.1 Visit 1 (screening visit)  
Location:  Visit 1 procedures may be accomplished at the DIAN -TU site or at the subject’s home 
or other trial- identified location with the trial- designated home health nurse.  This visit also 
includes telephone calls with the DIAN -TU site staff.  The subject is contacte d by their host 
DIAN -TU site by telephone or during a regular DIAN O bservational (DIAN -OBS) study visit.  The 
subject is given the opportunity to review the main and drug -specific supplemental ICFs, ask 
questions and obtain answers, and sign the main ICF.  
Time:   Informed consent must be obtained before any other study procedures.  Informed 
consent,  family history, demographic information and medical and treatment history may be 
obtained before the 8 -week screening period begins.  Informed consent should be obtained 
from both subject and study partner.  Unless otherwise specified, all other Visit 1 procedures may occur throughout the screening period (2 -8 weeks before V2).  IMPORTANT:  Results from 
screening clinical laboratory tests and genetic testing must b e available before V2; blood draw 
for genetic testing must be completed at least 6 weeks before V2  to ensure genetic results are 
available for baseline randomization .  The screening visit in the home ensures subject eligibility 
before travel (if applicable ) to the DIAN -TU site for baseline testing and randomization.  
Procedures (all can be performed by DIAN -TU site staff or trial -designated and trained home 
health nurse or other staff except as noted— see Global Manual of Operations  and DIAN Trials 
Unit Cogni tion Core Procedures Manual for additional details on order and timing of 
procedures) : 
• Obtain informed consent (DIAN -TU site staff should be available to answer questions)  
• Obtain or confirm family history and determine parental estimated age at onset or subject’s actual age at onset (DIAN -TU site staff).  Estimated age at onset should be 
determined as outlined in the Global Manual of Operations    
• Verify documentation of subject’s trial eligible mutation status OR  confirm via family 
pedigree and mutation doc umentation (proband) that the subject is at 50% risk for a 
trial- eligible mutation  
• Collect demographic information and study partner information  
• Obtain medical and treatment history  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature).  Weight is not required at this visit but subject’s self- reported weight may be noted if required for 
laboratory tests  
• Screening cognitive battery (subset of testing serves as practice test; takes about 
30 minutes).  See section 6.1.14 of main protocol

o Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potenti al 
• Urine collection for urinalysis  
• Administration of Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
A study -specific subject identification number is assigned to the subject by the interactive web 
response system (IWRS).  Visit 2 is not scheduled to occur  until the results of clinical laboratory 
tests are available and results of genetic testing are entered in IWRS.  Results of genotyping of APOE  and DIAD- associated genes ( APP, PSEN1 , and PSEN2 ) are not sent to the site to ensure 
genetic blinding is mainta ined.  
3.3.2 Visit 2 (baseline/first dose)  
Location:  Host DIAN -TU site. 
Time/Timing:   Approximately a 3 -4 day visit that is scheduled 2 -8 weeks after the screening visit 
and at least 6 weeks after the genetic sample draw .  This visit can only take place after res ults 
from screening clinical laboratory tests are documented as consistent with inclusion/exclusion criteria before Visit 2 occurs.  Genotyping results will need to be confirmed as received and having completed analysis but no results will be provided or reviewed by site staff.  The study partner participates in some of the procedures at Visit 2 and other annual visits at the DIAN -TU 
site.  If possible, the study partner should accompany the subject to the DIAN -TU site for these 
visits.  If this is not poss ible, the study partner procedures can be completed via telephone.  The 
sequence and timing of visit procedures is very important.  Requirements and suggested timing of visit procedures are detailed in the Global Manual of Operations .  Baseline visit proce dures 
may be scheduled over a longer time period of up to 2 weeks for subjects who live near the study site or in the event that some study procedures (e.g., PET imaging) are done at a different 
DIAN -TU site.  
Note : The date during Visit 2 when the first do se of study drug is administered should be used 
for determining the timing of all subsequent visits.  
Procedures:  
• In-person review of informed consent for subjects who provided consent over the 
telephone  
• Medical/treatment history, including:  
o Concomitant medications  
o Assessment /recording of pre -existing conditions or adverse events  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, weight and 
height)

safety follow -up visit.  
Location:  Procedures/contacts may be accomplished at the DIAN -TU site or subject’s home or 
other trial- identified location with the trial- designated home health nurse.  
Timing:   The end -of-treatment safety foll ow-up visit should be performed 4 to 8 weeks (+/ - 7 
days) after the subject’s last dose of double -blind treatment.   
Procedures*:  
• Concomitant Medications

3.3.17  Early Termination Visit/Post- treatment Follow -up 
If a subject withdraws, is terminated from the study prior to completion, or is in a study drug 
arm that is stopped prior to the end of the double -blind treatment period, every effort should 
be made to schedule an early termination visit t hat will include all procedures done at Visit 54 
for those not yet having completed that visit, or Visit 93 for those beyond V54.  End of study drug -specific tests should also be obtained (see section 1.12).   PET imaging studies  may be 
omitted if early termination occurs less than 6 months after the previous PET imaging or if 
precluded by local regulations/dosimetry limits.  Other procedures may also be eliminated on a 
case -by-case basis, as determined by the sponsor.  
Per the main protocol section 6.3.7 , any subject meeting study drug discontinuation criteria per 
main protocol section 4.4.1 due to safety reasons, inability to continue treatment 
administration/dosing, or perf orm study procedures, will be encouraged to continue 
participation in any of the scheduled clinical, cognitive, and/or biomarker assessments that they are able to perform, even though dosing has concluded.  The determination of which assessments are to be attempted/completed will be decided by the site principal investigator 
and sponsor and will be based on the subject’s capabilities, the benefit to the study, and the risk associated with continued participation at the time of study drug discontinuation.  T he level 
of continued participation may change if/as the subject’s status changes.

Page 242 of 265 3.3.18  Safety Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) 
A series of 6 safety MRI visits will be scheduled over the first 2 years of the double -blind 
treatment period.  Safety MRIs on 3T sca nners will be done primarily to monitor for ARIA.  
Location : Safety MRIs may be done at the host DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a 
distance from the host DIAN -TU site, safety MRIs may be performed at an ADNI/ADCS site if 
possible or at a 3T scanne r near the subject’s home.  
Timing :  13, 25, 37, 65, 77, and 89 weeks +/ - 7 days from Visit 2 (calculated from day of first 
dose).  Sites must ensure that study visits are scheduled so that MRI images are uploaded and 
available for central read at least 10 working days before next administration of study drug for parenterally administered drugs.  
Procedures :  Safety MRIs on 3T scanners will be done primarily to monitor for ARIA.  See 
section  6.1.16  of the main protocol for more in formation.  Detailed requirements are provided 
in the MRI Technical Manual . 
 Specific Study Visits –  Open-label Extension Period  
Upon completion of the double -blind treatment period (i.e., last enrolled subject has 
completed 4 years [208 weeks] of treatment), subjects may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open- label extension period for up to an additional 2 years (24  months).  Eligible 
subjects may start treatment in the open- label extension (OLE) period only after the final 
analysis of the double -blind treatment period has been completed and the study drug arm has 
demonstrated potential clinical benefit.  
If/when the OL E period is offered/opened, the procedures to take place at each study visit are 
listed below.  All OLE subjects and study sites will be kept blinded to prior drug assignment until 
the end of OLE to protect study integrity.  
Biomarker testing (PET imaging, C SF biomarkers , etc.) and cognitive batteries will be performed 
at the discretion of the sponsor and pharma partner contingent upon the individual biomarker 
or outcome measure demonstrating continued utility in OLE based on the results of the double -
blind p eriod of the study.  
For the OLE period , the specific date during the first visit (OLE V1) when the first dose of open-
label study drug is administered should be used to determine the timing of all subsequent visits.  The dose and treatment regimen are deta iled in section 2.2 . 
The schedule of visits for  the OLE period  is provided in the series of tables “Solanezumab 
Schedule of Visits: Open -label Extension ” at the end of this appendix.  
Subjects interested in joining the OLE period may sign consent once a decision regarding OLE 
has been communicated by the sponsor, and an approved OLE ICF is available at the site.  Subjects are encouraged to proceed with genetic counseling, at a minimum, in preparation for genetic t esting and disclosure for DIAD mutations, before the end of the double -blind 
treatment period  to enable more rapid entry into the OLE.

Page 243 of 265 All subjects enrolled in the solanezumab OLE will start at the 400  mg dose level and titrate 
based on safety evaluations to a target dose of 1600 mg as specified in section 2.2 for the OLE 
period . 
3.4.1 OLE Visit 1 (baseline/first dose)  
Location:  Host DIAN -TU site. 
Time/Timing:   Approximately a 2 -3 day visit that is scheduled after the decision is made to 
continue the drug arm in an open- label extension.  If possible, the study partner should 
accompany the subject to the DIAN -TU site for this visit.  If this is not possible, the study 
partner procedures can be completed via telephone.  T he sequence and timing of visit 
procedures is very important.  Detailed requirements and suggested timing of events at 
OLE Visit 1 and at subsequent annual visits (OLE V14, and OLE V27) are detailed in the Global 
Manual of Operations . 
Note : The date during  OLE Visit 1 when the first dose of study drug is administered should be 
used for determining timing of all subsequent visits.  If the OLE V1 is scheduled to occur after a prior annual visit, the Medical Director or designee may review the timing and waive  the 
requirement to complete assessments; results from annual visit may be used.  
Biomarker  collection  and cognitive batteries will be performed at the discretion of the 
sponsor and pharma partner contingent upon the results of the double -blind period of th e 
study.  
 Procedures:  
• Obtain informed consent.  Subjects who wish to join the OLE may  sign informed consent 
once a decision regarding OLE has been communicated by the sponsor and an approved 
OLE ICF is available at the site.  This will enable ample time fo r review and consideration 
of the consent, and genetic counseling prior to dosing in the OLE  period  
• The following must be confirmed for the subject to be eligible for the OLE period:  
(i) participated in the double -blind period,  
(ii) has a confirmed trial -eligible  pathogenic DIAD variant,  
(iii) in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, treatment is not contraindicated for safety,  
(iv) is capable of receiving drug and appropriate clinical safety assessments , and  
(v) if the sponsor indicates that [
18F]AV -1451 tau PET is to be performed, confirm the 
subject is not taking any medications on the [18F]AV -1451 DIAN -TU Restricted 
Medications List, and does not have a history of hypersensitivity to [18F]AV -1451 or 
any of its excipients

Location:  Host DIAN -TU site  
Timing:  104 weeks +/ - 7 days from day of first dose at OLE Visit 1.  Approximately a 2 -3 day visit.  
The sequence and timing of visit procedures is very important.  Requirements and suggested 
timing of events are detailed in the Global Manual of Operations .  For subjects who live near 
the study site, these visit procedures may be scheduled o ver a longer time period of up to 2 
weeks.  
Procedures:  
• Concomitant Medications  
• Adverse Event Assessment  
• Administration of C -SSRS  
• Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  
• Neurological examination  
• Clinical assessments:   
o Clinical Dementia Rat ing (CDR) including calculation of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum 
of Boxes (CDR- SB) Assessment of clinical diagnosis and clinician judgment of 
symptoms  
o Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI -Q) 
o Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)  
o Functional Assessment S cale (FAS)  
o Mini -Mental State Exam (MMSE)  
NOTE: For each subject, the CDR and assessment of clinical diagnosis should be 
administered by the same experienced clinician at all visits.  Whenever possible, the CDR 
rater should not be involved in other clinical  assessments (e.g., MMSE, FAS, GDS, NPI -Q) 
or in cognitive testing.  
• Complete cognitive battery (per section 6.1.14 of main protocol)  
• Annual MRI (including structural and functional MRI), which should be uploaded immediately to ensure reading obtained prior to dosing.  This MRI includes safety MRI 
sequences.  MRI should be performed before LP, if on the same date  
• PET imaging:  
o [
11C]PiB-PET scan  
o FDG -PET (subject should be fasting 4 hours prior to FDG -PET)  
o [18F]AV-1451 tau PET scan  
• Blood draw (serum and plasma) for biomarker analyses  
• Lumbar Puncture (LP) should be conducted as close to the subject’s double -blind Visit 2 
(Baseline) collection time as possible and under fasting conditions (water is allowed and 
encouraged) . LP should be performed as specified in the main protocol, section 6.1.17.  
• Follow -up phone call or brief visit within 24 hours after LP, and no longer than 48 hours 
later, to review any adverse events

Page 248 of 265 3.4.6 Early Termination Visit  
If a subject withdraws or is terminated fro m the OLE  period prior to completion every effort 
should be made to schedule an early termination visit that will include all procedures done at 
OLE visit 27.  Procedures may also be eliminated on a case -by-case basis, as determined by the 
sponsor.  
3.4.7 Safety Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI  
A safety MRI (SM) visit will be scheduled approximately 1 week after 2 doses of 1600 mg have been administered.  Safety MRIs on 3T scanners will be done primarily to monitor for ARIA.  
Location : Safety MRIs may be done at the host DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a 
distance from the host DIAN -TU site, safety MRIs may be performed at an ADNI/ADCS site if 
possible or at a 3T scanner near the subject’s home.  
Timing :  OLE V1 (baseline) and 21 weeks +/ - 4 days from OLE V1 ( calculated from day of first 
dose).  Sites must ensure that study visits are scheduled so that MRI images are uploaded and available  for central read at least 10 working days before next administration of study drug for 
parenterally administered drugs.   If MRI findings prior to dosing warrant more frequent MRIs 
during the dose escalation period of the open- label extension, the PI may request for review 
and approval by the sponsor medical monitoring team.  
Procedures :  Safety MRIs on 3T scanners will be done primarily to monitor for ARIA.  See 
section  6.1.16 of the main protocol for more information.  Detailed requirements are provided 
in the MRI Technical Manual . 
4 DRUG -SPECIFIC ANALYSIS PLAN  
 Cognitive Endpoint (DIAN -MCE) Power Analysis and Sample Size Determin ation  
The power was estimated based on the multivariate disease progression model (MDPM) and the DIAN -MCE primary endpoint with four arms: the gantenerumab active drug arm, the 
solanezumab active drug arm, the mutation  positive placebos  and the eligible DI AN-OBS 
subjects.  For details, refer to the SAP and solanezumab- specific SAP appendix.  
 Biomarker Endpoint Statistical Analysis, Power and Sample Size Justification  
4.2.1 Biomarker Endpoint Power Analysis  
Power analysis for the biomarker endpoints suggests 42 mut ation positive subjects in the 
solanezumab group along with 27 mutation carriers in the pooled placebo group will provide 
over 99% power to detect the projected effect size for changes in total CSF Aβ 42.  Recruitment 
goal is for 69 mutation positive subjec ts; 52 on solanezumab and 17 on placebo, for a total of 
34 in the pooled placebo group.  These recruitment goals will allow for 5% annual attrition rate.

APPENDIX 4:  Solanezumab  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 249 of 265 4.2.2 Biomarker Endpoint Sample Size Justification  
Table 8 summari zes the power analysis by presenting the estimated SD from the DIAN cohort 
and the effect size on the annual rate of change for the CSF biomarker that can be detected by 
42 subjects in the active drug group (52 subjects enrolled, assumes 5% annual dropout rate 
during the trial) and 27 subjects in the pooled placebo group (34 subjects enrolled; assumes a 5% annual dropout) with at least 80% power.  For comparison, Table 8 also lists the effect size 
on the rate of cha nge reported in a prior study.  The projected effect size for 400 mg Q4W is 
conservatively estimated and is smaller than the reported effect size in the prior study.  Therefore, the proposed sample size should provide adequate statistical power to detect t he 
projected effect size.  For example, for the biomarker endpoint used at the interim analysis, the proposed sample size (i.e., 52 in the active drug group and 34 in the pooled placebo group) 
provides more than 99% statistical power to detect two -thirds o f the reported effect size in the 
prior study.  The projected effect size is expected to be larger after dose escalation to 
1600  mg Q4W, thus the proposed sample size will provide more power to detect the treatment 
effect after dose escalation.  
In summary,  recruitment of 52 mutation positive subjects to the active drug group (at least 
42 completers assuming 5% annual attrition during the study period) and 34 mutation positive 
subjects to the pooled placebo group (at least 27 completers assuming 5% annual attrition during the study period) would provide adequate statistical power both before and after dose escalation to test the biomarker engagement hypotheses.

4.2.3 Interim Analysis  
One interim biomarker analysis will be conducted to assess whether this study drug is engaging 
its biological target.  The analysis will be conducted when 100% of active subjects complete 2 years of randomized treatment (Visit 28). 
Washington University in St. Louis  Protocol #: DIAN -TU-001 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version: Final Amendm ent 10  
APPENDIX 4:  Solanezumab  Version Date: 20 Dec 2019  
 
Page 250 of 265 At this interim analysis, the pre -specified biomarker of interest will be examined.  If the drug 
does not meet any of the pre -specified criteria for stopping or modification  (as detailed in the 
DSMB Charter or as defined in the solanezumab- specific SAP appendix ), the DIAN -TU 
Coordinating Center and/or DSMB may recommend that the study drug arm continue until the 
pre-planned trial duration is completed . 
 Other Drug -specific Analyses  
The biomarker endpoint used at the interim analysis  will be analyzed based on the randomized 
population of active vs. placebo, as specified in section 8.3 of the main protocol.  The biomarker 
analysis endpoint may include baseline total CSF Aβ 42 levels as a covariate.   
To evaluate the changes in i mmunogenicity data (Anti -LY) after treatment, 2 separate analyses 
will be done.  The first analysis will compare the proportion of positive results with proportion 
of negative results between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test.  This analysis will be 
done at each of the time points (12, 28, 52, 80 and 104 weeks after randomization and at the end of treatment safety follow- up) separately for each immunogenicity analyte.  
For the second analysis, treatment emergence of immunogenicity will be compared b etween 
treatment groups.  Treatment emergence will be defined as any of the following:  
i. negative baseline result and a positive post- baseline result with a titer >10  
ii. positive baseline result and a positive post- baseline result with a greater than a 
2-fold i ncrease in titers (for example, baseline titer of 10 increasing to >20 post -
baseline)  
The treatment -emergent analysis will be done at each visit post -baseline and also at any time 
post -baseline.  
In addition, samples for immunogenicity analysis will be collected at each of the 2 visits of the 
double -blind period  at which subjects receive 800 mg and at the first, second, and fourth visits 
at which subjects receive 1600 mg during the dose escalation period.  These data will be 
summarized by treatment group at the visits at which they were collected.  
Although dose escalation will have occurred in the trial, the primary outcome will still be 
analyzed based on the randomized population of active vs. mutation positive placebos and eligible DIAN -OBS subjects , as spe cified in section 8.4  of the main protocol.  
 Changes to the Data Analysis  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any ot her change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the final SAP and clinical study report (CSR).  Additional analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.

1. Annual visits will be conducted at the host DIAN -TU site (DIA N-TU).  For subjects who live at a distance from the DIAN -TU site, other visits may be conducted at a 
site nearer to their home (H); safety magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) may be performed at a study -approved facility nearer to their home.  See next two 
footnotes for additional detail.  
2. Safety MRI will be done at the DIAN -TU site or at a qualified imaging center in reasonable proximity to the subject’s home  for those not close to their DIAN -TU site.  
When possible, these will be done at an ADNI and/or ADCS site qualified imaging center.

Page 257 of 265 3. Infusions and safety visits (designated as occurring at home [H]) may occur at the DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a distance from the DIAN -TU site, these 
visits may be conducted by a trial -designated home health nurse at the subject’s home or other trial- identified location.  These visits may include phone calls from 
the host DIAN -TU site staff.  
4. The specific date during the baseline visit  (V2) when the first dose of study drug is administered should be used to deter mine timing of subsequent visits and for 
determining time between screening and baseline visits.  
5. Informed consent will be obtained in two steps.  Subjects will have the opportunity to review the main informed consent form  (ICF) and the supplemental drug -
specific ICFs and to discuss with DIAN -TU site study staff on the phone or in -person.  They can sign the main ICF at home or at the DIAN -TU site.  The main ICF must 
be signed before any study procedures are performed.  After screening, clinical laboratory tests are obtained and the subject is randomized to a specific study drug 
arm at baseline ( V2), subject will review and sign a supplemental study drug -specific consent that details specific risks/benefits and procedures for the study drug 
arm to which they w ere assigned.  
6. Study drug -specific supplemental consent should be reviewed and signed after randomization.   
7. Family history/age at onset and demographic information for subject and study partner will be collected during the screening period (V1) and confirm ed at the 
baseline visit  (V2).  This information will not be collected at subsequent visits unless the subject or study partner becomes aware of new informat ion or the study 
partner changes during the study.  
8. Home health nurses will have specific scripts or  forms to prompt assessment and collection of medical treatment history, health changes or complaints (for 
assessment of adverse events by the site) and concomitant medications.  
9. Preexisting conditions will be documented at screening visit (V1) and reviewed  at baseline visit (V2) prior to study drug administration.  
10. Provenance testing to confirm specimen identity will be performed at baseline visit only (V2).  
11. Includes TSH, B12, Hemoglobin A1c, PT, PTT, and INR at screening ( V1) only.  
12. Serum pregnancy testing w ill be performed at screening visit  (V1), V54, V93, and at the safety follow -up.  Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at all other 
visits.  Pregnancy tests will be confirmed as negative prior to dosing with study drug.  Urine pregnancy test must be c ompleted and confirmed as negative either the 
day of or the day prior to any PET scan; if PET scans occur on more than 2 consecutive days during annual visits more than one urine pregnancy test will be required.  
Women who have undergone tubal ligation are also required to have pregnancy tests performed.  Alternate tests may be used if urine collection is not feasible but 
must be approved by the sponsor in advance.  
13. Drug -specific te sts include testing for plasma Aβ and other biomarkers, solanezumab levels and anti -solanezumab antibodies.  These labs may be drawn more 
frequently if treatment emergence of immunogenicity is detected.  See section 1.12.   Samples for plasma Aβ and biomarker storage should be collected before 
beginning infusion.  Samples for plasma solanezumab levels should be collected before infusion and within 30 minutes  after completion of infusion for post -dose 
levels.  
14. For f uture studies, including future regulatory inquiries or additional monitoring of anti -drug antibodies or other drug -specific tests.  See main protocol 
section  6.1.12.  
15. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be collected at all visits.  Height will be measured at baseline  (V2) and annual visits only; 
weight will be measured approximately every 3 months starting at baseline  (V2). 
16. Clinical assessments: DIAN -TU clinical assessment battery includes: study partner interview and administration of CDR and supplemental CDR; clinician assessment 
of symptoms and diagnosis; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Assessment Scale (FAS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (N PI-Q) and Mini -Mental State 
Exam ination  (MMSE ). 
17. The cognitive testing will include both computer -administered and conventional testing.  See section 6.1.14  of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition 
Core Procedures Manual for additional information.  The compl ete cognitive battery will be administered at baseline (V2), and at annual visits.  A cognitive battery

Page 258 of 265 subset (see section 6.1.14  of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual)  will be administered by the home health nurse in the home 
at screening visit (V1), and at the 6 -month visits, for visits not occurring at the DIAN -TU site.  Cognitive testing should be completed as early in the day as possible, 
before study drug infusion.  
18. Lumbar puncture (L P) should be performed after MRI, if on the same date.  Lumbar punctures should be conducted as close to the baseline (V2) collection time as 
possible at each subsequent visit and under fasting conditions (water is allowed and encouraged).  CSF will be sent t o local laboratory for cell count and differential, 
glucose and protein as well as to central lab for sample management, including distribution to Washington University Core lab and designated research labs for 
biomarker and drug -specific analysis.  Site staff should contact the subject with a follow -up phone call or brief visit within 24 hours after LP, and no longer than 48 
hours later, to review any adverse events.  
19. Only for subjects participating in the tau PET imaging addendum.  Participating subjects m ay have no more than three (3) scans at any of the indicated visits (refer 
to the tau protocol addendum).  
20. Safety MRIs will be done at the DIAN -TU site or at a qualified imaging center in reasonable proximity to the subject’s home (MRI) for those not close to their DIAN -
TU site.  When possible, these will be done at an ADNI and/or ADCS site qualified imaging center.  
21. Prior to randomization, verify that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, including ARIA findings on baseline  (V2) MRI.  
22. The first dose of 80 0 mg and the first dose of 1600 mg for each subject will be given at the DIAN -TU site  or a medically qualified facility such as an infusion clinic 
until blinded safety results are evaluated for the first 20 subjects (active or placebo) to receive escalated  dose infusions.  After this evaluation, first doses of 800 mg 
and 1600 mg may be given by a home health nurse, if deemed appropriate.  
23. Site study coordinators should call subjects either during or within two weeks after V3, V4 and V5.  For V6 and subsequent home visits, coordinator calls can be 
made with less frequency at the discretion of the PI or designee, and/or coordinator, and subject, but should occur at least every 3 months.   
24. PET imaging studies may be omitted if visit due to early termination (ET)  and occurs less than 6 months after the previous PET imaging or if precluded by local 
regulations/dosimetry limits.  In the event of ET , other procedures may also be eliminated on a case -by-case basis, as determined by the sponsor.  
25. See section 1.12 for details of drug -specific test samples at the ET visit. 
26. Study drug administration only if subject is continuing double- blind treatment beyond year 4.

Footnotes:  
1. Annual visits will be conducted at the host DIAN -TU site (DIAN -TU).  For subjects who live at a distance  from the DIAN -TU site, other visits may be conducted at a site 
nearer to their home (H).  Safety magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) (OSM visits) will be done at the DIAN -TU site or a qualified imaging center in reasonable proximity to 
the subject’s home for  those not close to their DIAN -TU site.  When possible, these will be done at an ADNI and/or ADCS site qualified imaging center.  See next two 
footnotes for additional detail.  
2. Infusions and safety visits (designated as occurring at home [H ]) may occur at t he DIAN -TU site or, for subjects who live at a distance from the DIAN -TU site, these visits 
may be conducted by a trial -designated home health nurse at the subject’s home or other trial -identified location.  These visits may include phone calls from the ho st 
DIAN -TU site staff.  
3. The specific date during OLE V1 when the first dose of study drug is administered for the open -label treatment period should be used to determine timing of subsequent 
visits.  
4. The informed consent form ( ICF) for the OLE  period must be signed before any study procedures are performed.   This can be done once an approved OLE consent is 
available at the site, i.e., prior to this visit to enable time for consideration and review of the details.  
5. Subjects must be mutation positive.

ligation are also required to have pregnancy tests performed.  Alternate tests may be used if urine co llection is not feasible but must be approved by the sponsor in 
advance  
7. Clinical assessments: DIAN -TU clinical assessment battery includes: study partner interview and administration of CDR and supplemental CDR; clinician as sessment of 
symptoms and diagnos is; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Assessment Scale (FAS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI -Q) and Mini -Mental State Examination 
(MMSE ). Clinical assessment: MMSE only will be performed at 24 weeks (OLE V7) and 76 weeks (OLE V20).  
8. The cognitiv e testing may  include both computer -administered and conventional testing.  See section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core 
Procedures Manual for additional information.  The complete cognitive batter y will be administered at Baseline (OLE V1), week 52 (OLE V14), and week 104 (OLE V27).  A 
cognitive battery subset (see section 6.1.14 of the main protocol and DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manual ) will be administ ered by the home health nurse 
in the home at week 24 (OLE V7), and week 76 (OLE V20), visits not occurring at the DIAN -TU site.  Cognitive testing should be completed as early in the day as possible, 
and before study drug infusion or injection.  
9. If MRI find ings prior to dosing warrant more frequent MRIs during the dose escalation period of the OLE period , the PI may request for review and approval by the 
sponsor medical monitoring team.  
10. [11C] Pi B-PET, FDG -PET,  and AV -1451 tau PET scans should be performed unless the subject had these procedures performed in the prior 6 months  preceding OLE V1 . 
11. Drug -specific tests include testing for plasma Aβ and other biomarkers  for future studies.  Samples should be collected before infusion of study drug administration. See 
main protocol section  6.1.12.  
12. Lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed unless the subject had this procedure done in the 6 months  preceding OLE V1 . Lumbar puncture should be performed after 
MRI, if on the same date.  Lumbar punctures should be conducted as close to the baseline collection time as possible at each subsequent visit and under fasting 
conditions (water is allowed and encouraged).  Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF)  will be sent to local laboratory for cell count and differential, glucose and protein as well as to 
central lab for sample management, including distribution to Washington University Core lab an d designated research labs for biomarker and drug -specific analysis.  Site 
staff should contact the subject with a follow -up phone call or brief visit within 24 hours after LP, and no longer than 48 hours later, to review any adverse events.  
13. All subjects enrolled in the OLE period  for solanezumab will start at the 400 mg dose level.  After receiving 400  mg every 4 weeks (± 4 days) for at least 2 infusions, 
subjects will be titrated to 800 mg dose level.  After receiving 800  mg every 4 weeks (± 4 days) for a t least 2 infusions, subjects will be titrated to the 1600  mg dose level.  
Changes in dosage may be made in the event of ARIA as described in section 1.14 or for other safety reasons at the investigator’s discre tion with notification of a 
Medical Director or designee.  If needed, the schedule of assessments will be adjusted.  Vital signs will be assessed per sta ndard of care when administering IV product, 
however the data will not be collected.  
14. Site study coordinators should call subjects either during or within two weeks after OLE V2, OLE V3 , OLE V4 and OLE V5.  For OLE V6 and subsequent home visits, 
coordinator calls can be made with less frequency at the discretion of the PI or designee, and/or coordinator, and subject, but should occur at least every 3 months.

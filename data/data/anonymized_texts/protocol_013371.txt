PROTOCOL TITLE:  The Effect of a Pain Medication Educational Approach before Spinal Surgery on 6-11 month Post-Operative Use of Opioid Medication: A Randomized Clinical Trial 12  13 2.  ABSTRACT   14 Background:  Opioid-based pain medication use and prescription has increased dramatically in the last two decades, 15 leading to high rates of overdose and utilization for patients with chronic non-cancer pain, despite lack of evidence 16 to support its use.  Very little research has looked at educational strategies to help address this problem. 17 Design:  Randomized clinical trial 18 Methods:  Subjects will be recruited from the pool of patients coming in for the pre-operative appointment prior to 19 spine surgery.  Patients that consent and enroll will be randomized to receive either a brief educational video at this 20 appointment or usual care.  Patients will be followed after surgery weekly for the first month, and then again at 6 21 months to determine their self reported opioid medication utilization patterns. Pain medication prescription and 22 healthcare utilization will also be abstracted from the MDR healthcare database. 23 Summary:  The results from this study will help inform and develop best practice for managing patients taking 24 opioid medication for surgical pain. 25  26 3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS.  27 This study is a continued project in a line of research aimed at improving the quality of spinal pain 28 management. The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of an educational tool that addresses the latest 29 evidence regarding the use of opioid medication in a patient-centric fashion.  We will assess the impact this 30 shared-decision making educational tool has on 12 month health care utilization post operatively and the self 31 reported use of narcotic pain medication usage for the 6 months following lumbar spine surgery. 32  33 Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the differences in opioid medication use for the 12-month period after surgery in 34 subjects that received the education prior to surgery compared to those that received usual care education. 35  36 Specific Aim 2: Compare the changes in self-reported outcome measures (pain, disability, and sleep) between 37 groups over the 6-month period after surgery. 38  39 Specific Aim 3: Describe the sociodemographic factors and healthcare utilization in enrolled subjects for the 12 40 months leading up to a surgical procedure for the lumbar spine. Identify factors that could account for 41 differences in opioid medication, and any potential interaction effect between intervention, opioid use, and 42 clinical outcomes following surgery. 43 Regional Health Command-Central (RHC-C) Institutional Review Board  HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH   PROTOCOL APPLICATION – Part B

MILITARY RELEVANCE  47 The U.S. Armed Forces are experiencing alarming rates of post-war chronic pain related to musculoskeletal 48 disorders.1  Pain is reported by 40% of OIF/OEF/OND veterans.2 Chronic pain after musculoskeletal injury is 49 the leading cause of medical discharge from service3 and a primary source of disability in the U.S. 50 Military.4,5  The costs of chronic pain related disability to the Department of Defense exceed $1.5 billion 51 annually.6 In 2007, musculoskeletal injuries resulted in approximately 2.4 million medical visits to military 52 treatment facilities and accounted for $548 million dollars in direct patient care costs.7 The cumulative 53 incidence of injuries requiring an outpatient visit in U.S. Army entry-level training is about 25% for men and 54 55% for women.8,9 Physical training and sports-related activities account for up to 90% of all injuries8,10 and 55 80% of these injuries are considered overuse in nature.11,12 56  57 Military personnel are especially susceptible to the burden of chronic pain. Higher rates of chronic pain are 58 observed in veterans compared to the general population.13 Nearly 1 million veterans are prescribed opioids for 59 musculoskeletal conditions, and over half of these individuals chronically use opioids.14,15 Military personnel in 60 combat settings are expected to perform duties in extreme operational environments that require very intense 61 physical demands. The body armor and full combat load can be in excess of 120 pounds, which increases the 62 physical demands even further and leaves military personnel at greater risk for back injury and other 63 musculoskeletal disorders.16 In a survey by Konitzer et al., U.S. Army soldiers reported an increase in the 64 incidence of back, neck, and upper extremity pain during deployment.16 Considering the demands of a combat 65 load, the incidence of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury is also common among soldiers, which results in 66 significant lost workdays.17 67  68 The U.S. Military faces a post-war chronic pain epidemic. Chronic pain after musculoskeletal injury is the 69 leading cause of medical discharge and related to a growing rate of opioid addiction.18-22 Traditional medical 70 management has failed to correct this chronic pain epidemic. 71  72 5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE.  73 Historical Perspective: 74 Initial estimates of addiction risk based on data in the 1980s appear to have been very underinflated, and 75 therefore the risk to benefit ratio for prescribing opioids for chronic non-cancer pain seemed acceptable.23 76 Initially it was thought that less than 1% of patients would develop a dependency, but recent research shows 77 that the actual number may be as high as 35%24. This has also led to a 10-fold increase in prescription of opioids 78 in the last 2 decades, and the drug overdose death rates have tripled since 1990.25 In fact, drug overdose is the 79 2nd highest cause of accidental death in North America after motor vehicle accidents.25 80  81 Economical Impact of Opioid Abuse: 82 The impact of opioid abuse is felt in various ways.  While the effectiveness of opioids for chronic non-cancer 83 pain is questionable, and not recommended for routine use in various clinical guidelines26,27, prescription rates 84 continue to rise,28 at an alarming rate of 300-600% over the last 10-20 years.  Despite there being almost 15,000 85 deaths due to prescription pain killer abuse in the U.S. in 200825, this only represents a fraction of the problem.  86 For every one death, there are 10 treatment admissions for abuse,29 32 emergency department visits,30 130 87 people who abuse pain killers31, and 825 non-medical users of opioids.31 The chronic pain epidemic in the U.S. 88 costs can also be measured indirectly by looking at the excess of $560 billion annually in healthcare expenses, 89

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 3 of 18  and lost productivity.32 This epidemic is punctuated by escalating use of opioids leading to a reported 22.6 90 million addicted users.26  91 Musculoskeletal injury and disorders are the leading cause of chronic pain in the U.S.32   Back pain is the most 92 common of all of these musculoskeletal disorders.33  In fact an increase of 423% in expenditures related to 93 opioids for back pain has been recently seen.33 Because of these factors, the costs associated with chronic pain 94 disability continue to rise.33  95  96 Spine Surgery: 97 Data suggest that the rate of lumbar spine surgery in the United States has continually increased through the 98 1980’s and 1990’s 34,35.  Furthermore, there is significant geographic variation in rates of spine surgery within 99 the United States 36 and between the United States and other developed countries 37. Consistent with this, the 100 postoperative recommendations provided to these patients vary widely and may not be based upon the best 101 available evidence 38.  The observed variation in geographic differences in surgical rates and postoperative 102 recommendations may adversely affect the clinical outcomes associated with lumbar spine surgery.  Previous 103 research has demonstrated that the clinical outcomes following lumbar disc surgery are suboptimal with many 104 patients experiencing recalcitrant pain, disability and reduced quality of life 39-43.  Prolonged opiate use after 105 cercvial surgery is also s problem.75  Indeed, unsuccessful spine surgery has been described as a major health-106 care problem 44.   107  108 Opioid-based drugs are often used to help manage pain after spinal surgery.19,45,46 However, it is also used often 109 to manage spine pain in general, even prior to surgical interventions.33 This is despite a recent systematic review 110 that found only a very modest affect, and that was in the short term.47 The outcomes for chronic pain, greater 111 than 4 months, were not available.47  Even the Cochrane collaboration back group has stated that “the benefit of 112 opioids in clinical practice for the long-term management of chronic [low back pain] remains questionable.”48  113 Other studies show that when patients receive opioids for treatment of non-cancer pain, high levels of pain 114 remain persistent and their quality of life decreases.49 115  116 Ironically, pre-operative use of opioid medications is actually a predictor of worse outcome after spine 117 surgery.50  Another study found that 1/3 of patients were still using opioid pain medication one year after their 118 spine surgery.51 119  120  121 Opioid Abuse in the Military 122 Abuse of opioid pain medication may be even higher in the military.18,20,21 The U.S. Military faces a post-war 123 chronic pain epidemic. Chronic pain after musculoskeletal injury is the leading cause of medical discharge and 124 related to a growing rate of opioid addiction. Traditional medical management has failed to correct this chronic 125 pain epidemic. 126  127 Education Initiatives/Intervention 128 Most clinical guidelines recommend an informed decision process between the provider and the patient.  Deyo 129 and colleagues argue that patients need to be better social support and honest preparation to deal with their 130 circumstances:  “Patients need realistic expectations despite product marketing, media reports, and medical 131 rhetoric that promise a pain-free life.”33 132  133 The American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians has provided guidance on prescription of 134 opioid therapy in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.52 They strongly recommend an educational approach, 135

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 4 of 18  with continuing discussion that should include goals, expectations, potential risks, and alternatives to an opioid 136 trial. 52  In fact one of the critical research gaps identified by a panel of experts was further evidence on the 137 utility and value of the informed consent process with patients.53  This includes improving educational strategies 138 and processes that can better inform patients about the true risks and dangers of opioid medication use. 139  140 Dr. Mike Evans is a physician-professor at the University of Toronto in Canada, and chaired the patient 141 education committee for the College of Family Physicians of Canada.  He runs the Evans Health Lab 142 (evanshealthlab.com) which “fuses clinicians and creatives, filmmakers and patients, social entrepreneurs and 143 best evidence to create "edutaining" healthcare information.”  His lab has developed an educational video titled 144 “Best Advice for People Taking Opioid Medication” which is available open source on youtube.com.  The 145 video can be found at this link: 146 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Na2m7lx-hU 147  148 This particular video has been endorsed by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Canada Health 149 Infoway.  It summarizes the state of the evidence, balancing the benefits and the dangers of opioid use, in a very 150 user friendly and patient-centric manner.  These types of educational tools have the potential to improve the 151 shared decision making process between patients and providers about to prescribe a trial of opioid medications.   152  153 To date NO randomized clinical trials have specifically evaluated the effect of patient education on outcomes or 154 modification of opioid usage post surgery. 155  156 6.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.        170  171 Inclusion criteria (all of the following) 172 (a) Any patient currently scheduled for a pre-operative appointment with an orthopaedic spine surgeon or 173 neurosurgeon specifically for a lumbar or cervical procedure. 174 (b) Surgery is taking place for a condition that has been ongoing for 6 months or longer (chronic) 175 (c) Between the age of 18 - 65 years 176 (d) Read and speak English well enough to understand the education, provide informed consent and follow 177 study instructions (the surgeon, associate investigator, or research assistants will make this 178 determination.  Any patient that needs an interpreter will not be allowed to enroll). 179  180 Exclusion criteria (any of the following) 181 (a) Known aversion or allergy that would prevent the patient from taking any opioid-based pain medication 182  183  184 7.1.4. Description of the Recruitment and Prescreening Process.  As we are targeting patients that have already 185 made a decision to have surgery, they will already have been scheduled for a pre-operative visit that typically takes 186 place 1-2 days before their surgical procedure.  Before coming to this appointment, patients are typically told to set 187 aside the entire morning (4-5) hours for the pre-operative planning procedures as standard of care.  When they 188 come in for this visit, the nurse or a research assistant will ask them if they would be interested in participating in 189 the study. The current nurse that works in this department is not on active duty, and if any research assistants or 190 investigators assist in this process, they will be in civilian clothing so their rank is unknown.  Each week, the MSA 191 in neurosurgery has a list of patients that are coming in for pre-operative appointments and she knows the 192 procedures that they are scheduled to have.  She will identify those that are having the procedure of interest, and 193 remind the nurse seeing these patients to ask the patient if they would be interested in participating.  Patients are 194 always told to reserve the entire morning for pre-op as it can take several hours.  Each patient will be told that this 195 will add 20-30 minutes to their appointment.  The MSA will also be able to notify a research assisting or associate 196 investigator the week before of the days where there may be eligible patients coming in for a pre-operative 197 appointments.  These individuals will be available in the clinic on those days where a potential subject is coming in 198 for a pre-operative appointment. As part of the pre-operative appointment that is usually taken care of by the nurse 199 or physician’s assistant, they will ask the patient if they are interested in participating and if they would like to 200 know more about the study. . If they agree, they will be consented and if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 201 they will be enrolled in the study.    202  203

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 6 of 18  7.1.5. Subject Screening Procedures.  Screening will be performed by clinical members of the neurosurgery 204 department, associate investigators, or research assistants listed on this protocol. In some cases it may be one of the 205 surgeons if they are listed as an AI on this study.  After providing informed consent, screening will occur by a brief 206 interview and medical records review as a part of the patients normal pre-operative appointment.  Essentially they 207 will make sure that the patient meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and that they are scheduled for the surgical 208 procedure of interest. 209  210 7.1.6. Consent Process. An investigator or research assistant will conduct the consent process for participation in 211 this study, in the presence of a witness with the subject utilizing the approved informed consent and HIPAA 212 documents in a private setting.  The investigator will inform the subject that the study involves research and explain 213 the purpose and procedures entailed in this study. Furthermore, the subjects will be informed of the approximate 214 amount of subjects involved in the study. In addition, any foreseeable risks, discomforts, and benefits will be 215 explained.  The voluntary nature of the participation will be stressed, and subjects will be reminded by study 216 personnel throughout their participation that they may elect to withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects will be 217 assured that a decision not to participate will have no effect on their military status or ability to access health care; 218 yet, if the subject chooses to participate he/she will be informed that all records identifying the subject are 219 maintained confidentially by the PI in a password protected electronic file and all hard copies are maintained in a 220 locked file cabinet that only the PI and study team have access to. Subjects electing to withdraw from the study will 221 not participate in any data collection or other procedures associated with this study. The investigative team may 222 terminate a subject’s participation in the study at any time he/she feels this to be in the subject’s best interest (i.e., 223 safety, health, etc). Moreover, subjects will be provided with the appropriate contact information of whom to speak 224 to about their rights and whom to speak with should the subject have any questions.  225  226 Subjects will be given ample time to ask questions, read and understand the consent form and take it home (if 227 he/she chooses) so the research can be discussed with friends and family prior to participation.  Upon completion of 228 the informed consent process and after all concerns have been addressed the subject, the individual obtaining 229 consent along with an impartial witness will sign the approved Institutional Review Board consent and HIPAA 230 forms. A copy of the signed documents will be offered to the subject, and the original signed document will be 231 placed in the subject’s study record. The informed consent process will occur and the informed consent document 232 will be signed by all parties prior to any/all study related procedures performed. 233  234 APRIL 2018:  As part of an amendment extending collection of health care utilization to one year after study enrollment, we 235 are requesting to collect this additional data under a waiver of informed consent and a waiver of HIPAA authorization.  At the 236 time of this amendment, all follow up with enrolled subjects has been completed and we are no longer in contact with 237 participants.  The research remains minimal risk to subjects and their privacy.  The amendment does not adversely affect their 238 rights and welfare since it is merely an extension of the healthcare utilization review for which they have already provided 239 consent and authorized for collection of PHI.  It is not practicable to contact all of the subjects and have them re-consent in 240 order to obtain HIPAA authorization for this minor change in data collection (12 instead of 6 months). 241  242  243 7.1.7.

Study Procedures/Research Interventions.  253 After consenting, meeting inclusion criteria, and enrollment, all participants will complete several standard self-254 report questionnaires related to medical history, social demographic, and psychosocial variables that are related 255 to low back pain, and often used in clinics as standard care in managing patients with spinal pain. Patients 256 undergoing lumbar spine surgery will fill out the OSW and patients undergoing cervical spine surgery will fill 257 out the NDI. They will then be randomized to either receive the education, or only usual care (which is the 258 typical information the surgeon provides the patient verbally).  All patients will receive the usual care education 259 from their surgeon.   260  261 Randomization: 262           Subjects will then be randomized into one of two arms (Group I = Educational Video, Group II= Usual 263 Care Education).  The method of group assignment will be sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes 264 (SNOSE). To minimize the risk of predicting the treatment assignment of the next eligible patient, 265 randomization will be performed in permuted blocks of two or four with random variation of the blocking 266 number. 267  268 Education Group: 269 The educational video chosen for this education is one created by Dr. Mike Evans, a physician and associate 270 professor of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto, CA, with a strong research focus on 271 patient engagement. He runs the Health Design Lab which has produced several dozen patient engagement 272 videos on a variety of public health topics.  They are well-vetted, strongly based on evidence, and have been 273 profiled by organizations such as the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). 274  275 The video we are choosing for the educational intervention is titled: Best Advice for People Taking Opioid 276 Medication and is available at the URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Na2m7lx-hU 277  278 The content of the education focus on providing a historical perspective for opioid prescription from the time 279 when the risk of dependence was highly underestimated.  The video discusses the current evidence for the effect 280 of opioid medications in non-cancer non-acute pain. It also discusses some of the dangers of long-term opioid 281 usage.  The video is 11 and ½ minutes long. 282  283 The consent, enrollment, and video education will take about 20-30 minutes for patients in this group, and occur 284 at the end of their pre-operative visit.  The patient will watch the video on a portable Tablet computer. 285  286 Usual Care Group:  Patients that are randomized to usual care will only receive the regular instructions about 287 opioid usage they typically receive from their surgeon. After they consent and are enrolled, they will fill out the 288 questionnaires and then be done with the 1st visit of the study. 289  290 All Subjects: 291 All subjects will receive the usual care education that is typically given by their surgeon.  That will be left up to 292 the discretion of each surgeon.  The screening and enrollment should take no more than 5-10 minutes, and then 293 the filling out of self-report questionnaires should take approximately 5-7 minutes.  Subjects in the group that is 294 randomized to the education will take an additional 11 minutes to view the educational content. 295  296

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 8 of 18  All patients will proceed with the surgical procedure as planned. Each week during the 1-month period after the 297 surgery, patients will be contacted (phone call, email, and text message - depending on what they consented to). 298 They will be reached out to daily until contact is made.  A voicemail will be left stating that “This is [name of 299 person] from Brooke Army Medical Center calling in regards to a research study that an individual at this 300 number is participating in.  Please call us back at [number] at your convenience.” They will be asked the 301 following 6 questions: 302  303 1) “On a scale from 1 or 10, what has your average pain been like over the past week?” 304  305 2) 1) “On a scale from 1 or 10, what has your least and worst pain been like over the past week?” 306  307 3) “Approximately how many times have you taken opioid medication for pain (**Include types) over the past 308 week?” [days, times per day] 309  310 4) “Approximately how many times have you taken other medication for pain (aspirin, Tylenol, ibuprofen) over 311 the past week?” 312  313 5) How many days of narcotics pain medication were you prescribed?  (# of days or unknown) 314  315 6) How much of that original prescription do you have remaining at this point? (estimate # of days or % left) 316  317  318 At the 1-month and 6-month time points they will be asked to fill out the additional clinical outcomes measures 319 detailed below (ODI, PCS, PSQI, NPRS).  These can be done in person with a visit to the clinic, over the 320 telephone, or by email – depending on what they consented to.  They will be reached out to daily until contact is 321 made. 322

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 10 of 18  Oswestry Disability Index (OSW):  The Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, originally described by Fairbank 335 et al54 as a condition-specific measure of functional status for patients with LBP. The OSW is a 10-item scale 336 with higher numbers indicating greater disability. We will use the modified version that replaces the sex life 337 item with an employment/ homemaking item due to poor compliance with the former.55,56  The OSW is widely 338 used in research on non-operative management of patients with LBP.57  Our previous research has found the 339 modified OSW to be used in this study to have high levels of test-retest reliability among stable patients (ICC = 340 0.90), good construct validity, and responsiveness to change for patients with acute LBP, with a minimum 341 clinically important difference of 6 points for patients with acute LBP receiving physical therapy.55 It is a form 342 often used as standard of care in physical therapy clinics.   343  344 Neck Disability Index(NDI):   345 The NDI was created to measure pain related disability associated with activities of daily living in people with 346 neck pain.76 The NDI contains ten focused sections. Seven items focus on activities of daily living. These 347 sections include statements related to personal care, lifting, recreational activities, work, driving, and sleeping. 348 Two items focus on the patient’s pain. There is one section that evaluates pain directly. The NDI is easy to 349 complete and score. Each item is scored on a 6-point scale and can reach a maximum score of 5; therefore, the 350 maximum score is 50. Higher scores indicating higher levels of disability. Content, construct validity and 351 reliability of the NDI has been previously shown in patients with neck pain.76, 77 The MCID has been established 352 as a change of 13% (or 6.5 points).78 353  354  355 The Opioid Risk Tool:  The Opioid Risk Tool is a validated tool to assess the risk of narcotic abuse in patients 356 with chronic pain.  It stratifies risk based on age, gender, history of abuse, and psychological disease.  A score 357 of 3 or lower indicates low risk for future opioid abuse, a score of 4 to 7 indicates moderate risk for opioid 358 abuse, and a score of 8 or higher indicates a high risk for opioid abuse.58    This tool, based on the way that the 359 questions are asked, cannot imply whether the subject currently has a substance abuse issue or a history of one.  360 Therefore, utilizing it as an outcome measure does not alter the current course of treatment from the 361 neurosurgery staff.  However, because the Army values the ability for service members to seek care for 362 substance abuse, all subjects will be reminded that the army does have help for substance abuse with the Fort 363 Sam Houston Alcohol and Drug Control Officer (ADCO): 210-295-6345 or Military OneSource at 1-800-342-364 9647.  365  366 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): A 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (‘0’ indicating no pain, and ‘10’ worst 367 imaginable pain) will be used to assess LBP intensity.  Numeric pain scales are known to have excellent test-368 retest reliability.56  Our previous research has found the NPRS to be responsive to change, with a minimum 369 clinically important difference of two points among patients with acute LBP receiving physical therapy.9 It is a 370 standard of care measurement taken in physical therapy clinics.   371  372 Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS): The PCS is a 13-item patient-report scale developed to measure the extent 373 to which people catastrophize in response to pain.60  Each item is scored from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘all the 374 time’).  The PCS is reported as a total score, with higher scores indicating greater catastrophizing, and is 375 composed of three sub-scales: Rumination (four items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I keep thinking about how 376 badly I want the pain to stop’), Magnification (three items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I become afraid that the 377 pain will get worse’), and Helplessness (six items; e.g. ‘When I am in pain, I feel I can’t go on’)  The PCS has 378 been shown to have high levels of internal consistency and construct validity.61  Pain catastrophizing has also 379

Clinical properties provide utility in both psychiatric clinical 384 pratices and research activities.  Seven “component” scores including: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, 385 sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction 386 are generated from 19 individual items.63   Sleep quality may have a significant role in affecting outcomes of 387 patients with low back pain as several studies have shown correlation between chronic back pain and quality of 388 sleep.70, 71 389  390 Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ): The 72  will be used to measure patients’ beliefs about how 391 physical activity and work may affect their pain and perceived risk for re-injury. The FABQ contains two 392 subscales; a 7-item work subscale (FABQW), and 4-item physical activity subscale (FABQPA).  Test-retest 393 reliability of the FABQ subscales is high,72,73  and validity is supported by associations with disability and work 394 loss in patients with acute and chronic LBP,74,75 Heightened fear-avoidance beliefs have been shown to be a risk 395 factor for the development of chronic LBP following an acute episode.62,76 Other research suggests it may be 396 appropriate for other body regions, specifically evaluating its use in lower extremity injuries within a physical 397 therapy setting.77   398  399 Healthcare Utilization 400 Finally, healthcare utilization data will be collected from the MHS Data Repository (MDR) database and will be 401 confirmed via AHLTA. Healthcare utilization data will be used to determine any opioid medication use along 402 with any subsequent medical utilization related to low back or neck pain. In order to collect this information a 403 DUA will be completed between the researcher team and Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics 404 Activity (PASBA) and the Tricare Management Agency (TMA). Both of these agencies require a signed 405 completed IRB protocol prior to submitting the DUA. However, this should not impact the timing of this study; 406 as the data pull will be completed no sooner than December 2015. This will provide more than enough time to 407 complete the DUA with both agencies and submit the signed DUA to the BAMC IRB prior to performing this 408 analysis. Details for the determining healthcare utilization are outlined below: 409  410 The goal of the MDR database will be to determine the medication utilization for each of these subjects, as well 411 as any other healthcare related to low back pain sought in the 12-month period after treatment in this study. This 412 data (type, location, number of clinic visits, types of specialty clinic visits, imaging, and associated medication) 413 will allow us to determine the extent of low back pain related healthcare utilization for each subject. 414  415 • Recording of Extracted Data with Identifiers:  416 The data will be provided in a de-identified manner from PASBA.  As they have done before with members of our 417 team on prior project, they extract all the required data along with name, age and social security number in order to 418 identify the correct subjects that were in our study.  They will then assign a pseudo identification number and match 419 that with the list of our subject identification numbers that we provide.  Therefore, the final working set they provide 420 us for analysis will not have any identifying PHI/PII associated with it.  If additional follow-up is needed to clarify a 421 healthcare utilization event in AHLTA, the research team can check the master subject record (stored on an 422 encrypted government computer) in order to link the subject ID to SSN.  Therefore, prior to analysis occurring, the 423 identifiers will be eliminated. Confidentiality of protected health information will be maintained by the research staff at 424 all times, however it should be minimal at this time. The final working database to be used in the data analysis will 425 not include PHI information. 426  427

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 12 of 18  • Location of Extracted and Recorded Data:  428 The healthcare utilization data will be primarily extracted from the MDR database and through AHLTA. Even though 429 the data is now de-identified, the extracted data will still be maintained in an encrypted, password protected file kept 430 at the Physical Therapy Clinic, Brooke Army Medical Center.   431  432 • Nature of Identifying Data 433 Timeframes will be requested in reference to the baseline enrollment date rather than the actual date.  For example, 434 the date of appointment will be required initially to determine when the healthcare visit associated with the back pain 435 occurred. However, this data will be coded differently in the working spreadsheet. The initial appointment will be 436 recorded in weeks from the baseline date of enrollment. If multiple appointments exist, the range of dates will be 437 recorded in the final spreadsheet (e.g. the patient was seen over a 4 week window) and the exact appointment days 438 will not be included in the master spreadsheet. Analysis of the data will only occur in the de-identified spreadsheet.  439  440 • Status of the extracted data after completion of the research study:  441 The de-identified spreadsheet outlined above will be stored indefinitely on a password-protected computer at the 442 Physical Therapy Clinic, Brooke Army Medical Center. 443  444 • Redundancy: 445 In addition to searching the MDR database, at each follow-up visit we will ask subjects if they have utilized 446 healthcare resources since the last follow-up (4 and 26 weeks), specifically related to their LBP in 4 categories: visits 447 to providers (traditional or complementary/alternative), medications (prescription or over-the-counter), interventions 448 (injections, surgery, etc.), or testing (x-rays, MRI, etc.).  449  450  451 7.3.3. Human Biological Specimens/Tissue/Data Banking.  452 N/A  453  454  Statistical Consideration  455  456 7.4  457 7.4.1 Sample Size Estimation.  Collection of healthcare utilization will occur in 100% of the subjects as no 458 follow-up is required, and therefore no opportunities to collect data from a follow-up visit will be lost.  459 Therefore the sample size estimation is based on the secondary outcome variable of self-reported pain and 460 function (OSW).  Assuming at least 85% of patients complete the OSW at 6 months, enrollment of 60 subjects 461 per group (total sample size 120 subjects) will provide at least 84% power to detect a difference of 12 points (2 462 X MCID) on the change in OSW to 26 weeks, assuming a standard deviation in the change in OSW of 16 points 463 (treatment effect = 43.8% of one standard deviation). The MCID for both the OSW and NDI has been estimated 464 at 6 points.55 Previous work with patients with acute LBP indicate that these estimates of anticipated effect size 465 and standard deviation are realistic,78-80 and would be consistent with detecting an effect that is at least slightly 466 in excess of the threshold for seeing significant change. The NDI and OSW are similar in length and answer-467 type, and as we are expecting a higher number of lumbar patients, we will use the OSW to power this study. 468  469  470 Estimate Required Sample Size 101 Estimate Participant Drop Out / Withdrawal 19 Total Enrollment Requirement 120  471 Enrollment at Each Site

This will include a comparison of imaging orders and types, specialty 476 referrals, and medication use (pain and narcotics). 477  478 The self-reported outcome measures will also be taken at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months.  479  480 7.4.3 Data analysis.  481 All data will be analysed in IBM SPSS 21 (Chicago, IL).  Descriptive statistics will be performed to describe 482 the sociodemographic (age, sex, race, etc.) and health characteristics (disability, pain intensity, psychosocial 483 factors, etc.) of the entire sample, and comparisons made between groups.  Means and standard deviations will 484 be computed for continuous data and frequency distributions will be analysed for categorical data.  485  486 Specific Aim #1 will be evaluated by determining the RR (risk ratio) for opioid medication use during the 1 487 year following surgery between both groups.  Utilization reports will be broken down into the 1st week 488 (expected to be the highest), 1st month, and then from 2 through 1 year.  We will also look at all healthcare 489 utilization events between patients associated with lumbar ICD-9 codes (Appendix A) in those randomized to 490 also view the educational video. 491  492 Comparison of self-report outcomes between groups at baseline and 6 months will be performed using a linear 493 mixed-effects model, which is flexible in accommodating data assumed to be missing at random (Specific Aim 494 #2). The time points will be baseline, 1 month, and 6 months for the measures collected from the patient (self-495 report questionnaires).  Significance is set at 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals will be reported for all relevant 496 data.  Sensitivity analysis will be run adjusting for other demographic and/or prognostic variables (PCS, pain 497 intensity, ESS, etc) that may affect the outcome. 498  499 Specific Aim #3 will be determined by comparing the variables between each group and introducing them as 500 covariates into the linear mixed-effects model to see if the adjustment influences the differences between each 501 group. 502 Point estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals will be reported.  503  504 7.7 Confidentiality.  The only document that will link the subject to the data indirectly is the master patient list.  505 This document will have the patients name, social security number, and assigned subject ID number.  This 506 document will be encrypted, password protected, and kept on a CAC-enabled government computer in the BAMC 507 physical therapy section, where only approved study personnel will have access to it.  Each subject that consents to 508 participate in the study, will also fill out a contact form that will have their name, email address, and phone number.  509 These documents will be kept in a binder, locked in a research cabinet in a locked office.  The master patient list 510 will be referenced when a research team member needs to contact a subject to coordinate follow-up appointment, 511 and needs to correlate the subject ID number with an actual patient.  The master list is also needed for when 512 healthcare utilization data is requested from PASBA. At that time, the encrypted file will be emailed to the analyst 513 assigned to work on this project using a government email address, that is digitally signed and encrypted in order to 514 be HIPAA compliance.  In essence it will be an encrypted document, that is also being sent via encrypted email.  515 When PASBA returns the healthcare utilization dataset, they will de-identify the data and it will only have a 516 pseudo-ID assigned by the system, along with the subject ID that we had provided. The analysis of the data will 517

The master patient list will be kept for 3 years after the study has been closed 518 out, and then destroyed.  The de-identified data will be kept indefinitely for any potential future secondary analysis.   519  520 7.7.1 Certificate of Confidentiality.  N/A 521  522 8.0  RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT 523  524 8.1 Risks.  Risks are unknown, but none are anticipated 525  526 There is always a potential risk for loss of confidentiality, but that risk is minimized because we are  limiting 527 access to to only members of the research team, and have protections in place as we have already outlines, to 528 protect the information. 529  530  531 8.2 Potential Benefits.  There are no direct benefits to the patient. 532  533 9.0  ADVERSE EVENTS, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, AND DEVIATIONS 534  535 9.1 No adverse events are anticipated for this study as it is employing educational material, which is often used in 536 some clinics, but using a novel deployment approach.  There is the possibility that the screen from the tablet may 537 be too bright and cause the patient to have to look away, although this would likely be very unlikely and the 538 research assistant can step in and help dim the screen with the appropriate settings.  There is also a very minor 539 possibility that the patient may drop the tablet and the screen would shatter, sending sharp glass particles around.  540 However, the tempered glass on the tablets makes this less likely, and the tablets will have cases which should 541 protect them.  None of these potential adverse events are serious, and have a very low likelihood of occurring.  542  543 In addition, a regular computer can be used to show the video if the tablet becomes a problem. 544  545 If an injury does occur, aid will be provided and the patient will be escorted to receive further medical care.  The 546 research assistant will help coordinate this with their PCP.   547  548 Deviations: 549 Minor protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB during annual review using the protocol deviation tracking 550 log P53.  Major deviations will be reported to the IRB within 48 hours by the primary investigator, in accordance 551 with HRPP policy memo 5.4 on protocol deviations . 552  553 9.2  Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others, Serious Adverse Events and 554 Deaths to the RHC-C IRB Office.  555  556 All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, unexpected serious adverse 557 events, and all subject deaths related or possibly related to the study will be reported 558 promptly providing initial notification of the event as quickly as possible after the research 559 team’s knowledge of the event, but within five (5) business days of identification by phone, 560 by e-mail, by facsimile (210-916-1650) or via letter addressed to IRB Administrator). A 561 complete written report will follow the initial notification within 10 working days. 562  563  564  565  566

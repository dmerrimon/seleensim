 LDL -C levels at Day  510 
 Time adjusted percent change in LDL -C levels from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 
levels  
 
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are t o evaluate  the effect of inclisiran on : 
 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK 9), total cholesterol, ApoB , and non -high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL -C) at Day 510  
 LDL -C and PCSK9 levels over time  to Day 540  
 Mean maximum reduction in LDL -C levels  
 LDL -C and PCSK9 levels over time in individual subjects  
 Other lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins

The Medicines Company  Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4 
Confidential   4 Methodology: This study is a Phase III, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized study  in 
400 subjects  with HeFH and elevated LDL -C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL -C lowering 
therapies to evaluate the efficac y, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous inclisiran injection(s).  
Subjects will be screened and approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized: 200 subjects will 
be randomized to inclisiran  sodium 300 mg  and 200 subjects  randomized  to placebo. Due to faster than 
expected enrol lment, actual enrol lment was 482 subjects. Treatment allocation will be stratified by 
country and by current use of statins or other lipid -modifying therapies. Each subject will receive four 
subcutaneous  injection s of blind ed inclisiran or placebo on Day 1 , Day 90 , Day 270 , and Day 450 .  
On Day 1, all eligible subjects will be randomized and will receive the first subcutaneous ( SC) injection 
of investigational product  (inclisiran or placebo ). After the first SC injection , the subject will be 
observed in the clinic for at least 4  hours post injection in order to have additional laboratory  
assessments  and vital signs  completed before being discharged. Subjects will return on Day 90, Day 270 , 
and Day 450  to receive additiona l investigational product . During these subsequent dosing visits, 
subjects will be observed in the clinic for at least 30  minutes after administration of each  injection and 
have additional laboratory  assessments completed  if needed . Subject s will also have  in-clinic visits on 
Day 30, Day 150, Day  330, and Day 510 for follow -up and limited laboratory  assessments.  The end of 
study (EOS) visit will be conducted on Day 540.  
Pharmacodynamic  assessments  will be collected at various visits and  include LDL -C levels  as well as 
other  lipids and lipoproteins (eg, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL -C, non -HDL -C, very low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol [VLDL -C], apolipoprotein A1 [Apo-A1], apolipoprotein B [ApoB ], 
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], high sensitivity C -reactive protein [hsCRP ], and PCSK9 ). 
All subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetic analyses, unless underlying causal mutations 
of HeFH are well documented by a validated specialized laboratory. A blood sample will be collected, 
preferably during screening, only from subjects who sign a separate consent for pharmacogenetics.  
Safety assessments including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ), concomitant medic ations, and safety laborator y parameters will also be collected during the 
study.  In addition,  formation of anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) and further characterization of ADA will be 
evaluated . 
End of study evaluations will be conducted at the Day 540  visit. 
Subjects who have completed the study to Day 540 will be given the opportunity to enroll in a separate 
open -label long-term extension study to collect long -term safety and efficacy data for inclisiran .  
The independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will  review safety data after the first 40  subjects 
receive the first SC injection of inclisiran or placebo  and have completed 1 month follow -up. Thereafter 
the IDMC will review safety data every 3 months until the end of study ( EOS ) unless requested 
otherwise  by the IDMC . A recommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these 
reviews.

Confidential   7 Key Secondary Endpoints:  
 Absolute change in LDL -C from baseline to Day 510  
 Time adjusted absolute change in LDL -C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540  
 Percentage change from baseline to Day 510 in PCSK 9 , total cholesterol , ApoB, and non -
HDL -C 
 
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
 Mean maximum percentage change in LDL -C 
 Absolute c hange from baseline to Day 510 in PCSK9, total cholesterol, ApoB and non -HDL -C 
 Absolute c hange and  percentage change in LDL -C from baseline to each assessment time up to 
Day 540 
 Individual responsiveness defined  as the number of subjects reaching on treatment LDL -C 
levels of <25  mg/dL, <50  mg/dL, <70  mg/dL, and <100  mg/dL at Day 510  
 Proportion of subjects in each group with greater or equal to 50% LDL -C reduction from 
baseline  
 Absolute c hange and percentage chan ge in other lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and 
PCSK9 from baseline at each subsequent visit to Day 540  
 Proportion of subjects in each group who attain global lipid targets for their level of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  (ASCVD ) risk 
 
Expl oratory Endpoints : 
 Incidence of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest , non-fatal MI, and non -fatal stroke (ischemic 
and hemorrhagic)  
 Response of LDL -C reduction by underlying causal mutations of HeFH  
Safety:  Adverse event , SAEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory values (hematology, coagulation testing, 
chemistry, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected at specified visits through 
the EOS visit (Day  540). Cardiovascular events will be reported as A Es for the compilation of 
information on CV events such as CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, and non -fatal 
stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic). In addition , formation of ADA and subsequent characterization of 
ADA will be evaluated for the investigational product . 
Statistical Methods : 
Sample Size and Power  
The sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which was based on the observed 
results from a Phase II study ) that the difference in change from baseline between the active dose group 
and the placebo group for LDL -C will be no less than 30 mg/dL, with a standard deviation of 20 mg /dL.  
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately 380 subjects that are  
evaluable for efficacy across the placebo and inclisiran dose groups. This sample size of at least 380 
evaluable subjects, will provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction of LDL -C levels in the 
inclisiran group compared to the placebo group at one -sided significance level of 0 .025. Due to faster 
than expected enrol lment, actual enro llment was 482 subjects. This increased sample size will contribute 
additional safety data and not appreciably affect power calculations.  
Primary End point Analysis:  
The family -wise type I error rate is controlled at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025  by using a 
nested testing procedure. The percentage change in LDL -C from baseline to Day 510  will be tested first. 
If the null hypothesis is rejected at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025 and superiority of 
inclisiran over placebo is claimed, then the time adjusted percentage change in LDL -C from baseline 
after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be tested, also at one -sided significance level o f alpha=0.025. 
Mixed -effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be performed on the percent change in

The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4 
Confidential   8 LDL-C from baseline to Day 510 to test the superiority of inclisiran over placebo. Missing data will be 
imputed using a multiple imputation washout model. Results will be combined using Rubin’s method. 
Time adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be 
calculated 
from the MMRM with imputed data discussed above. Linear combinations of the estimated 
means after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be used to compare treatments. Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s method.
Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis : 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will not be tested if either one of the co-primary efficacy endpoints’  
null hypothesis failed to be rejected. 
The Hochberg procedure  will be applied to control the family -wise type I error rate at one-sided 
significance level of alpha=0.025  for the key secondary endpoint s. The key secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed using the same methods  as in the primary efficacy analysis.  
Other Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Analysis:  
The analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will include descriptive and graphical 
summaries by treatment group . Least squares  means (95% Confidence Intervals) will be provided for 
continuous variables. Nominal p -values will be provided when applicable.  
Interim Analysis:  
No interim analysis will be performed in this study.

The Medicines Company is developing a novel synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference 
(RNAi) therapeutic, Inclisiran for Injection (subcutaneous [SC] use) for the treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia. This protocol describes a study to evaluate the effect  of inclisiran  
treatment on low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) levels at Day  510. This study will 
be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) including the Declaration of 
Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
1.1. Backg round  
1.1.1.  Disease Overview  
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death  
worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually [ WHO , 2016 ]. Eighty percent of all  
CVD deaths are due to coronary heart disease (CHD) o r strokes. Elevated low -density  
lipoprotein associated cholesterol (LDL -C) is a major risk factor for the development of 
CVD  [Grundy et al, 2004; Go et al, 2014 ]. Lowering LDL -C has been shown to reduce the 
risk of  death or heart attack and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk 
reduction is  linearly proportional to the absolute LDL -C reduction [ Baigent et al 2005 ]. 
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies,  
predominantly statins, to red uce LDL -C and the associated risk of death nonfatal myocardial  
infarction (MI) and nonfatal stroke or associated events [ Decision Resources Group, 2015 ]. 
Yet residual risk for cardiovascular (CV) events remains and statins are associated with well -
known  limitations. First, not all patients reach LDL -C levels associated with optimal 
protection against  clinical events [ Davidson et al, 2005; Foley et al, 2003; CTT Collaborators 
et al, 2008; Foody et al, 2010; Baigent et al 2005 ]. Second, not all patients toler ate statins or 
are able to take statins at  sufficiently intensive doses. And third, observational studies have 
demonstrated that >50% of  patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than 6 months 
[Mann et al, 2010; Poluzzi et al, 2008 ]. 
There is an un met need for additional treatment options beyond currently available 
treatments for lowering of the LDL -C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.  
Despite statins alone or in combination with other lipid lowering medications, current 
therapies for the manageme nt of elevated LDL -C remain insufficient in some patients 
[Fitzgerald et al, 2017; Barkas et al 2015; Jameson et al, 2014; Jones et al, 2012 ]. This is 
particularly true in patients with pre -existing CHD and/or diabetes or a history of familial 
hypercholest erolemia (FH), who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive 
management [ Davidson et al, 2005 ]. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9  (PCSK9 ), a member of the serine protease 
family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of low -density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) 
on the surface of hepatocytes [ Khorova, 2017 ]. PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the 
bloodstream predominantly by the liver, binds LDLR both intracellularly and extracellularly 
and promotes the lysosomal degradation of  these receptors in hepatocytes, [ Lakoski et al, 
2009; Mousavi et al, 2009 ] thereby increasing the circulating LDL -C levels. Loss of function 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  19 mutations in PCSK9 have been found to lead to increased LDLR in liver, reduced serum 
LDL -C, and a lower risk for C HD [ Berge et al, 2006; Cohen et al, 2006; Kotowski et al, 
2006; Zhao et al, 2006 ] with no apparent negative health consequences. [ Zhao et al, 2006; 
Hooper et al, 2007; Horton et al, 2009 ]. 
Recently developed and approved PCSK9 -blocking monoclonal antibodie s reduce circulating 
PCSK9 levels and lower LDL -C levels. Preliminary reports indicate that treatment with such 
antibodies can lead to reduction of cardiovascular events compared with placebo [ Hooper et 
al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015; Zhang et al, 2015; Ro binson et al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2015 ]. 
Results from  the first completed  large CV outcomes trial (FOURIER) were  reported in 
March 2017. Repatha® (evolocumab) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. 
The study in approximately 27,000 pati ents with clinically evident atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary 
revascularization) and the key secondary com posite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal 
MI or nonfatal stroke) [ Sabatine et al, 2015 ]. 
The data from PCSK9 blocking antibodies such as Repatha® (evolocumab) and Praluent® 
(arilocumab) are very encouraging. However, these products are dosed SC every  2 to 4 
weeks necessitating up to 26 injections per year [ Hooper et al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015; 
Zhang et al, 2015 ]. In contrast, one injection of inclisiran is anticipated to be given three 
times in the first year and every 6 months thereafter.  
1.1.2.  PCSK9 B iology and Target Rationale  
PCSK9 is a membe r of the subtilisin serine prote ase family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin 
kexin type 9 is predominantly expressed by the liver and is critical for the down regulation of 
hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression [ Mousavi et al, 2009 ]. 
LDL-C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in humans with gain of function mutations in 
PCSK9, classifying them as having severe familial hypercholesterolemia [Abifadel et al, 
2003]. Data f rom genetic association studies have identified loss of function alleles in human 
PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein levels and lowe r LDL-C levels [Zhao et al, 2006 ; 
Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009 ]. In one publi shed study, heterozygous individuals 
(carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) had significantly lower LDL- C 
with median levels of approximately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) [ Cohen et al, 2006] . Over a 
15-year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering in LDL-C levels 
translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow-up publications describe two adult 
individuals that are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of PCSK9. These 
individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL -C levels ≤20 m g/dL, and yet  
are otherwise healthy [ Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007 ]. Additionally, recent human 
clinical trials with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of LDL-C in 
healthy volunteers and across a range of high cardiovascular (CV)-risk populations and with 
elevated LDL-C both with and without statins [ Banerjee et al, 2012 ; Dias et al, 2012 ; Milazzo 
et al, 2012;  Raal et al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 2012 ; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012; Hooper 
et al, 2013 ]. Two monoclonal agents to inhibit PCSK9 are currently approved in Europe and 
North America.  Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials have further confirmed that PCSK9 is 
a validated drug target whose inhibition results in LDL-C lowering and

Confidential  20 significant outcomes benefit without ot herwise negatively impacting overall health  [Ridker et 
al, 2017; Sabatine et al, 2017 ]. 
1.1.3.  Mechanism of RNA Interference  
Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulating 
gene expression that is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Typically, synthetic 
siRNAs are 19-base to 25-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex 
with a two- to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’ ends. Such siRNAs can be 
designed to target an endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When 
introduced into cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme 
complex called the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently 
binds to its complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the 
suppression of the target protein encoded by the mRNA [Elbashir et al, 2001].  
Since unmodified siRNAs are rapidly eliminated and do not achieve significant tissue 
distribution upon systemic adm inistration [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ], various formulations are 
currently used to target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into 
the relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal 
models (in cluding in rodents and nonhuman primates) and humans employs intravenous 
delivery of siRNA in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ; 
Morrissey et al, 2005 ; Geisbert et al, 2006 ; Judge et al, 2006 ; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; 
Coelho et al , 2013 ; Tabernero et al, 2013 ]. Another approach for liver -specific gene silencing 
is subcutaneously administered siRNA conjugated to a N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
carbohydrate ligand [ Ashwell and Morell, 1974 ]. Conjugation of a triantennary GalNAc 
ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and down 
regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple doses of subcutaneously administered 
siRN A-GalNAc conjugates have been used to target transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the 
treatment of TTR -mediated amyloidosis. ALN -TTRCSC has been found to be generally safe 
and well tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over 40 healthy volunteers and  
18 subjects with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy and senile systemic amyloidosis 
[ALN -TTRSC -001; EudraCT 2012 -004203 -12; and ALN -TTRSC -002; EudraCT 
2013 -002856 -33]. 
1.2. Inclisiran, an siRNA Therapeutic for Hypercholesterolemia
Inclisiran sodium is a chemically synthesized small  interfering RNA (siRNA) 
double -stranded oligonucleotide, covalently linked  to a ligand containing three 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues.  
Inclisiran is a long -acting, subcutaneously delivered, synthetic siRNA directed ag ainst 
PCSK9 that is conjugated to triantennary GalNAc carbohydrates. These carbohydrates bind 
to abundant liver -expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), leading to inclisiran 
uptake specifically into hepatocytes.  
When introduced into the hepatocyte, inclisiran engages the natural pathway of RNAi by 
binding intracellularly to the RNA -induced silencing complex (RISC), enabling it to cleave 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  21 messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules encoding PCSK9 specifically. The cleaved PCSK9 
mRNA is degraded and thus unavailable  for protein translation, which results in decreased 
levels of the PCSK9 protein. A single siRNA -bound RISC is catalytic and cleaves many 
transcripts and the duration of action is anticipated to be longer than other mechanisms.  
1.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
Inclisiran was specifically designed with molecular and biochemical characteristics to 
minimize untowa rd side effects whic h are reflected by the absence of dose limiting toxicities 
in preclinical models. For example, GalNAc ligands were added to the RNA strands in order 
to target inclisiran to receptors on hepatocytes, thereby greatly reducing uptake by 
heterologous tissue. This is highlighted by tissue distribution studies in ra ts showing that 
compared to liver, inclisiran exposure in other tissues was 36- to 1076-fold lower than liver. 
In addition, once inclis ira n is inside the cell, there is a low likelihood of off-target binding 
because inclisiran is sequestered within RISC and guided to its complementary PC SK9 
mRNA sequence which is highly conserved across diverse ethnic and geographical 
populations. The spe
cificity of the active antisense strand of inclis iran wa s determined by 
performing a comprehensive search against the human transcriptome using an exhaustive 
“brute-force” algorithm implemented in the python script ‘BruteForce.py’. The search  
revealed 20 possible off-target transcripts, two of which are not normally expressed in liver 
cells. The other 18 transcripts were subsequently assayed in an in vitro study to 
experimentally assess their response to inclisiran. The 18 gene transcripts were transfected 
into liver cells along with inclisiran and expression analysis indicated a ≥45-fold difference 
between the “on target” suppression of PCSK9 and the suppression of any of the “off-target”  
transcripts. 
Inclisir an was well tolerated in all studies. The most common findings were related to the 
expected pharmacological effects of inclisiran on lipid profiles and histopathological findings 
of vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys a nd the 
presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These 
microscopic findings are not considered adverse because they are not associated with 
changes in clinical pathology parameters. Liver function enzymes were only mini mally to 
mildly increased, and were reversible following treatment -free periods, and there were no 
changes in urinalysis or urine chemistry parameters.   
Additional non -clinical studies are ongoing or planned.  
1.2.2.  Clinical Studies  
1.2.2.1.  Clinical pharmacology  
Inclisiran is inactive in plasma and acts directly in the hepatocytes leading to inhibition of 
PCSK9 protein synthesis. After SC administration of inclisiran, peak plasma concentrations 
were observed by 4 hours and became undetectable in plasma in 24 to 48  hours with a fast 
elimination half -life (t 1/2) of 7.3 hours and dose -proportional increase in exposure parameters 
of maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the curve (AUC). There was no 
accumulation of inclisiran plasma concentrations following  multiple weekly, biweekly or 
monthly dosing. Mean fraction excreted unchanged in the urine was around 25%. In vitro 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  22 studies using hepatic P450 metabolic enzymes showed that inclisiran neither inhibited nor 
induced common hepatic metabolic pathways.  
Addit ional clinical pharmacology studies are ongoing or planned . 
1.2.2.2.  Clinical  
Inclisiran has been studied in one completed Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001) study (N=69) and 
one Phase II (ORION -1) study (N=501); dosing has completed in ORION -1 and the extended 
follow -up is o ngoing.  
ALN -PCSSC -001: Doses up to 800 mg as a single dose and two doses or more doses up to 
500 mg were administered . 
ORION -1: Up to 500 mg as a single dose on Day 1 or two doses on Day 1 and Day 90 (100 
mg, 200 mg or 300 mg) were administered . 
The effic acy data generated in these two studies show robust and prolonged reductions in 
PCSK9 and LDL -C levels in plasma. PCSK9 was reduced from baseline by around 75%. 
Mean LDL -C was reduced by around 50% with one dose of 300 mg and 55% with two doses 
of 300 mg g iven 30 or 90 days apart in both the Phase I and the ORION -1 study, 
respectively. This effect is still significant 210 days after a single dose and remains at around 
a mean of 50% when measured 120 days after the second dose given at Day 90 in the 
ORION -1 study. Other lipids and lipoproteins are also modified as would be expected from a 
drug acting on PCSK9 with a potentially beneficial modification of the overall atherogenic 
lipid profile  [Ray et al, 2017 ]. 
To date, no clinically relevant safety concerns have arisen in these studies of inclisiran; 
collection and analysis of data up to Day 360 is ongoing in the ORION -1 (Phase II) study.  
Based on these efficacy and safety data, 300 mg has been selected as the dose for subsequent 
clinical studies with a dosin g at Day 1, Day 90, and every 6 months subsequently .  
Safety:  
In the ongoing Phase II (ORION -1) study with a follow up of more than 210 days, single 
doses of up to 500 mg on Day 1 or two doses (100 mg, 200 mg or 300 mg) (given 90 days 
apart) were also gene rally well tolerated and the majority of adverse events (AEs) in 
inclisiran -treated subjects with ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents were mild or moderate 
in intensity. Injection site reactions have been reported in around 5% of subjects receiving 
either one  or two doses of inclisiran  [Ray et al, 2017 ]. The emerging safety profile will be 
further evaluated in the ongoing Phase II (ORION 1) study and the subsequent planned 
studies.  
Efficacy:  
In the ongoing Phase II (ORION -1) study, in all single dose groups, m aximal LDL -C 
reduction was observed between Day 30 and Day 60. At Day 30 the mean LDL -C reduction 
from baseline was approximately 45% to 55% and at Day 60 was 44% to 51% in a dose 
dependent fashion with doses of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. Mean LDL -C remain ed 
significantly reduced from baseline over the course of the study in all inclisiran groups to 
Day 210.

The Medicines Company Study Protocol - Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  23 In all groups, maximal reduction is PCSK9 levels was observed at Day 30 and the mean 
reduction from baseline was 66%, 71% and 74% in the 200 mg, 300 m g and 500 mg groups 
respectively.  
In all double dose groups, maximal LDL -C reduction was observed after the second dose 
given at Day 90. At Day 120 the mean LDL -C reduction from baseline was 41% to 55% in a 
dose dependent fashion with doses of 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg.  
At Day 180, the mean LDL -C reduction was between 35% and 53% in a dose dependent 
fashion across the dose range.  
For subjects treated on Day 1 and Day 90, maximal reduction in PCSK9 levels was observed 
at Day 120 and the mean reduction from baseline was 60%, 73% and 75% with the 100 mg, 
200 mg and 300 mg dose groups respectively. PCSK9 levels remained significantly reduced 
compared to baseline over the course of the study to Day 210 in all groups.  
1.3. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Subjec ts taking part in this clinical study will receive guideline recommended standard of 
care as background therapy (including maximally -tolerated statin therapy and/or other 
LDL -C lowering therapies) when administered inclisiran or placebo . Reduction of LDL -C 
has been associated with reduced CV risk both by epidemiology and in controlled clinical 
trials. Injection site reaction is the only event known to be attributed to inclisiran treatment. 
The safety profile of inclisiran observed to date is considered acce ptable for this clinical trial.  
An expanded risk -benefit summary is provided in the IB  [Investigator ’s Brochure ].
1.4. Study Rationale  
1.4.1.  Study Rationale  
The overall safety data from inclisiran in nonclinical studies a nd clinical data from the 
Phase  I and Phase II  study  (ORION -1), and multiple PCSK9 antibody studies demonstrated 
that potent lowering of PCSK9 is well  tolerated in human subjects  and support the dose and 
dosing schedule proposed in this Phase III study .  
1.4.2.  Dose Rationale  
Previous s tudies have shown that  a 300 mg dose of inclisiran sodium is well tolerated and 
provides maximum efficacy (ie, doses higher than 300 mg did not provide additional efficacy 
in LDL -C lowering). The 300 mg dose of inclisiran will be administered on Day 1, Day 90, 
Day 270 and Day 4 50. Modelling and simulation has demonstrated that this regimen will 
allow for the necessary robust and sustained reduction in PCSK9 (and LDL -C) and has the 
potential to tackle the lack of adherence generally seen in the chronic management of 
subjects with  hypercholesterolemia.  The 300 mg dose of inclisiran will be used for the entire 
duration of this study for subjects receiving inclisiran.  
1.5. Study Population 
This study will include male or female subjects ≥18 years of age with a history 
of Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeF H) and elevated LDL-C.

3.1. Type/Design of Study  
This study will be a Phase III, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized study  in 
400 subjects with HeFH and elevated LDL -C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL -C 
lowering therapies to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous inclisiran 
injection(s). The study will be a multicenter , international  study . Informed consent will be 
obtain ed from subjects before the initiation of any study -specific procedures.  
Subjects will be screened and approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized: 
200 subjects will be randomized to inclisiran sodium 300 mg and 200 subjects randomized to 
placeb o. Due to faster than expected enrol lment, a ctual enrol lment was 482 subjects . 
Treatment allocation will be stratified by country and by current use of statins or other lipid -
modifying therapies. Enrollment of statin intolerant subjects will be capped at  15% of total 
study enrollment. Each subject will receive an injection on Day 1 of blinded inclisiran or 
placebo, a second injection on Day 90 and  subsequent injections on Day 270 a nd Day 450 . 
Subjects who have completed the study to Day 540 will be given th e opportunity to enroll in 
a separate long -term extension study to collect long -term efficacy and safety data.

The unblinding of investigational product  during the study  can only be performed via the 
IRT. The Principal Investigators/designee will have authorization to unblind a subject via the 
IRT. 
In the event of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ), The Medicines 
Company Global Pharmacovigilance (MDCO GPV) Department  may be required to unblind 
a subject to meet reporting requirements  per country specific regulations . In this case, a 
designated member will have authorization to unblind via the IR T. 
5.6.1.  In the Event of an Emergency: Unblinding a Code  
Unblinding by request of an Investigator should occur only in the event of an emergency or 
AE for which it is necessary to know the investigational product to determine an appropriate 
course of therapy for th e subject. If the Investigator must identify the treatment assignment to 
an individual subject, an Investigator or qualified designee should request the medication 
information from the IRT. The documentation received from the IRT indicating the code 
break must be retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner so as not to 
unblind the treatment assignment to other site or Sponsor personnel. The Investigator is also 
advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to other site or Sponsor  personnel .

8.1. Definitions  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient o r clinical trial subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with this 
treatment . An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or  disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening, ie , the subject w as, in the opinion of the investigator, at immediate  
risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death),  
 Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life, 
 Requires in -subject hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is another medically significan t event where medical and scientific judgement should 
be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered  serious 
reactions, such as important medical e vents that might not be immediately life 
threatening or result in  death or hospitaliz ation but might jeopardize the patient or 
might require intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospitalization or development of  dependency or abuse . Any suspected transmission 
via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse  
reaction.  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and sever e AEs. Severity is an estimate or 
measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of 
adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not 
necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE n eed not be considered severe. For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an 
SAE. On the other hand, a MI that may be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged 
hospitalization.

Examples include, but are not limited to, reports of  pregnancy/lactation exposures with or 
without any AEs related to the parent or child ; medication errors – actual and potential ; 
accidental exposure ; suspected transmission via an investigational product  of an infectious 
agent ; drug interaction.  
8.2. Collection and Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Pre-existing Conditions  
Planned hospital admissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease that existed at 
baseline and did not aggravate during the study should not be reported as AEs.  
8.2.2.  Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed by the Investigator using the 3 -point scale below:  
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal  daily activity.  
8.2.3.  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship between the AE and the investigational product  will be assessed by using a 
binary assessment. The investigator should determine whether there is a ‘ Reasonable 
possibility’ or ‘No re asonable possibility’ that the investigational product  caused the event  
based on the definitions below . 
Reasonable possibility  - There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
investigational product  caused the AE. There is evidence to su ggest a causal relationship 
between the investigational product  and the AE.  
No reasonable possibility  - There is no reasonable possibility that the administration of 
the investigational product  caused the AE. There is no temporal relationship between the 
investigational product  and event onset, or an alternative etiology has been established.  
8.3. Requirements For Additional Safety Data  Collection

8.4. Procedure for Adverse Event Reporting  
8.4.1.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs that occur during the designated study period from consent through EOS must be 
reported to MDCO GPV  Department within 24 hours of awareness of the event using the 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4
Confidential  54 provided study specific SAE Report Form. E ach SAE must also be recorded on the source 
documents and on the appropriate page of the eCRF .  
The Investigator should provide any follow -up informat ion for the event to the Sponsor on an 
updated SAE Report Form  as soon as it becomes available. The Sponsor will contact the 
Investigator, if necessary, to clarify  any of the event information or request additional 
information.  
If the I nvestigator is notif ied of a SAE  that occurs post -study  period,  that he or she wishes to  
report to the Sponsor (eg , an event suspected to be causally related to investigational 
product ), the event should be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate , if required by local regulations or procedures, the I nvestigator should 
report these events to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)  and/or 
national regulatory authority  in addition to the Sponsor .  
8.4.2.  Non-Serious AEs 
All non -serious AEs that occur during the designated study period from consent through EOS 
must be assessed and recorded on the source documents and eCRF, regardless of causal 
relationship to the investigational product .  
8.4.3.  Special situations  
8.4.3.1.  Medication Errors  
Medication errors with or without an associated AE should be recorded as medication errors 
in the eCRF.  
Medication errors and an associated SAE should be recorded in the eCRF and also reported 
to MDCO  GPV Department as described in Section  8.4.1 . 
Medication errors and an associated non -serious AE should be recorded in the eCRF as 
described in Section  8.4.2 . 
A mis-dosing protocol deviation ( Section 12.3)  should be reported as a medication error if 
it was an “unintended error”.
8.4.3.2.  Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure  
Occurrences of pregnancy/lactation exposure  in a study subject or study subject’s partner  
from the time of Day 1 through EOS must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours using 
the Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure Report Form.  
In cases where a pregnancy /lactation exposure  occurs with a SAE, the SA E Report  Form 
should be used to report the SAE  and the Pregnancy /Lactation Exposure  Report Form should 
be used to report the pregnancy /lactation exposure .  
When a pregnancy /lactation exp osure  occurs without any concurrent SAE, the 
Pregnancy /Lactation Exposure  Report Form must  be submitted alone.

8.5.1.  Expectedness Determination  
MDCO GPV Department will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected for the purpose of SUSAR reporting . An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
na
ture, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the safety information 
previously described for the investigational product in the current/approved version of the 
Inclisiran  Investigator’s Brochure.
8.6. Study Stopping Criteria  
8.6.1.  Independent Data Monitoring  Committee ( IDM C) Stopping Rules  
The IDMC will use all available evidence and its collective judgment in making a 
recommendation to stop or modify the ORION-9 study for safety. Any statistical 
considerations are not a substitute for the committee’s medical, scientific, or statistical  
expertise. Details will be provided in the IDMC charter. 
8.6.2.  Sponsor Discontinuation Stopping Criteria  
The Sponsor will review data on an ongoing basis and may, on discussion with the  IDM C, 
terminate the study for any clinically significant drug related safety signal (eg. serious 
hypersensitivity reactions or drug induced liver injury, etc).  
Premature termination of a study may also occur be cause of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of MDCO. In 
addition, MDCO retains the right to discontinue development of inclisiran at any time.  
If a study is prematurely terminated o r discontinued, MDCO will promptly notify the 
investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the 
hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 30 days of the notification. Final study visits should 
occur within 30  days of subject contact. As directed by MDCO, all study materials must be 
collected and all eCRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.  
The Sponsor will inform the health authorities and the IRBs/EC that the study has been 
stopped and the reasons for  doing so, within the locally applicable timelines.

Confidential  56 9. DATA COLLECTION
An electronic data capture (EDC) system which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant will be used for 
this study . All users will be trained on the technical features of the EDC as well as the 
content  of the eCRF  by qualified personnel prior to gaining access to the EDC . A 
UserID/Password will be granted after training . This ID is not to be shared amongst the study 
staff. All users must have a unique account to enter or review data . The eCRF should be 
filled out by the site 3 days after each visit. It is not expected that the eCRF will serve as 
source for any data collected in this study . If there is a reason for a site to do so, it must be 
approved by Sponsor and documented in the si te files.  
Prior to the database being locked, the investigator or designee will review, approve and 
sign/date each completed eCRF. This signature serves as attestation of the Investigator’s  
responsibility for ensuring that all data entered into the eCRF are complete, accurate and 
authentic . After the end of the study , a copy of the data will be provided to the site . This copy 
will contain the final data, an audit trail of activity on the data, and any queries and answers 
that were  posted for data clarificat ion. For this study, the EOS  will be defined as the last visit 
of the last subject .

Confidential  57 10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This study will be a Phase III, placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized study  in 
400 subjects with HeFH and elevated LDL -C despite maximum tolerated d ose of LDL -C 
lowering therapies to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran injection(s). 
The study will be a m ulticenter , international  study . A separate Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) document will provide more detailed specifications in data analysis and presentation . 
10.1. Sample Size  
The sample size calculation was performed with the assumption (which was based on the 
observed results from a Phase II study ) that the difference in change f rom baseline between 
the active dose group and the placebo group for LDL -C will be no less than 30  mg/dL, with a 
standard deviation of 20 mg/dL.  
Assuming about a 5% drop out rate, the sample size will be approximately 380 subjects that 
are evaluable for efficacy  across the placebo and inclisiran dose groups. This sample size of 
at least 380 evaluable subjects, will provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% reduction 
of LDL -C levels in the inclisiran group  compared to the placebo group at one -sided 
signif icance level of 0.025 . Due to faster than expected enrol lment, actual enrol lment was 
482 subjects. This increased  sample size will contribute additional safety data  and not 
appreciably affect power calculations . 
10.2. RANDOMIZATION  
Subjects will be screened and approximately 400 eligible subjects will be randomized  by the 
IRT system: 200 subjects will be randomized to inclisiran  sodium  300 mg and 200 subjects 
randomized to placebo. Due to faster than expected enrol lment, actual enrol lment was 482 
subjects. Treatment allocation will be stratified by country and by current use of statins or  
other lipid -modifying therapies. Each subject will receive four subcutaneous (SC) injection s 
of blinded inclisiran or placebo on Day 1, Day 90 , Day 270, and Day 450 . 
10.3. General Statistical Considerations and Definitions  
10.3.1.  General Statistical Methods  
All study -collected data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics, 
graphs, and/or raw data listings. Descriptive statistics for conti nuous variables will include 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), 
minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. Analysis of categorical variables will include 
frequency and percentage . 
10.3.2.  Analysis Population  
The foll owing populations will be used for data analyses and/or presentation.  
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4  
Confidential  58 10.3.2.1.  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
All subjects randomized into the study  will comprise the intent -to-treat (ITT) population . 
Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The ITT population will 
be used for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
10.3.2.2.  Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All subjects who are randomized into the study, take any study medication and  have at least 
one post treatment lipid data measured. Treatment classification will be based on the 
randomized treatment.  
10.3.2.3.  Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of investigational product  and have 
both the baseline and the 510 day follow -up LDL -C assessment  will comprise the modified 
intent -to-treat (mITT) population . Treatment classification will be based on the randomized 
treatment.  
10.3.2.4.  Safety Population  
All subjects who received at least one dose of  investigational product . Treatment 
classification will be based on the actual treatment received. This will be primary population 
for the safety analyses . 
10.3.3.  Analysis Windows and Baseline  
The observational period for the study includes  the screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), the 
treatment period (Day 1 to Day 510), and the EOS visit (Day 540) . Any event occurring 
beyond the defined observational period, even if collected on the eCRF , will not be included 
in the planned statistical ana lysis. However, all data, including that reported after the defined 
observational period, will be included in the subject data listings . 
Analysis windows will be defined to maximize the amount of data that are included in the 
analysis models. Full details will be provided in the SAP.  
Unless otherwise specified, for evaluations that are collected at multiple occasions prior to 
initiation of investigational product  administration , the latest evaluation will be considered 
the "Baseline" evaluation for analysis . 
10.3.4.  Missing Data Handling  
Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will have missing data imputed using multiple 
imputation techniques (a primary method and sensitivity/exploratory methods). The primary 
imputation method will utilize a washout model for subjects in the inclisiran arm where it 
will be assumed that early terminating inclisiran sodium  300 mg subjects have missing data 
after their last observed assessment (monotone missing data) return to baseline values. The 
baseline values will be randomly sampled from a population estimated using baseline data 
from all subjects. One sensitivity technique includes control -based pattern mixture models 
which utilize placebo data for monotone missing inclisiran sodium  300 mg treatment data. 
Additional sensitivi ty data imputation techniques will be utilized. Retrieved data will be 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4
Confidential  59 utilized in all analyses where possible. Full details, including how intermittent missing data 
and missing placebo data will be handled, will be provided in the SAP.  
Unless otherwise sp ecified, other missing data will not be imputed . 
10.4. Statistical Analyses  
10.4.1.  Demographic and Background Characteristics  
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics (including medical history) will be 
summarized by treatment group using the ITT, FAS, mITT, a nd safety populations.  
10.4.2.  Investigational Product  and Concomitant Medications  
Summaries of investigational product and each prior (pre -baseline) medication and 
concomitant (baseline or later) medication will be provided by treatment. Separate 
summaries will b e provided for prior  medication use. Medications will be coded using the 
World Health Organization ( WHO ) drug dictionary. Subjects will be counted only once 
within each period by medication.  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
The ITT population will be the primary population for the efficacy analysis. Efficacy analysis 
will also be performed for the FAS and mITT population s as supportive analysis . 
10.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoint s are described in Section 3.3. 
The family -wise type  I error rate is controlled at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025 
by using a nested testing procedure. The percentage change in LDL -C from baseline to Day 
510 will be tested first. If the null hypothesis is rejected at one -sided significance level of 
alpha=0.025 and superiority of inclisiran over placebo is claimed, then the time adjusted 
percentage change in LDL -C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be tested, 
also at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025.  
Mixed-effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be performed on the percent 
change in LDL -C from baseline to Day 510 to test the superiority of inclisiran over placebo. 
The model will include fixed effect for treatment, visits, baseline value, interac tion between 
treatment and visits, and current use of statins or other lipid -modifying therapies. The 
Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation approach will be used with covariance 
structure set as “Unstructured”.  Missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation  
washout 
model as noted in Section  10.3.4. A total of 100 imputed datasets will be created 
and results will be combined using Rubin’s method. Full details on the model and 
imputation  will be provided in the SAP. 
The time adjusted percen tage change in LDL -C from baseline after Day 90 and up to Day 
540 will be calculated from the MMRM with imputed data discussed above. Linear 
combi nations of the estimated means after Day 90 and up to Day 540 will be used to

provided in the SAP. 
10.4.3.1.1.  Sensitivity Analysis for Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
As noted in Secti on 10.3.4 , additional methods to impute and analyze data will be utilized as 
sensitivity/exploratory analyses for the co -primary endpoints. A MMRM wi thout any 
imputation (assuming data are missing at random) will also be performed.  
10.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will not be tested if either one of the co-primary efficacy 
endpoints’ null hypothesis failed to be rejected.
Key secondary and other efficacy endpoints are described in Section  3.4. 
Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis:  The Hochberg procedure will be applied to control the 
family -wise type I error rate at one -sided significance level of alpha=0.025 for the key 
secondary endp oints. The key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methods  
as in the primary efficacy analysis.  
The two -sided 95% confidence interval for least squares means  will be provided  for 
continuous variables . Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio will be 
provided for binary variables. Nominal p -values will be provided when applicable.  
Descrip tive and graphical summaries  by treatment group  will also be presented.  
10.4.3.3.  Exploratory  Endpoints  
The exploratory  objectives are described in Section  3.5. 
The analysis of the exploratory  endpoints will be similar to that of the secondary endpoints . 
10.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
The safety objectives  of this study are to evaluate t he safety and tolerability profile of 
inclisiran.  
10.4.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) dictionary will be used for 
coding AEs . An AE (classified by preferred term) occurring during the investigational 
product  treatment p eriod will be counted as a treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it is 
not present at baseline or if it is present at baseline but increased in severity during the 
treatment period.  
The number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each preferred te rm will be 
tabulated by system -organ class, by system -organ class and severity, and by system -organ 
class and relationship to investigational product . If more than one event occurred with the 
same preferred term for the same subject, the subject will be co unted only once for that 
preferred term using the most severe or related occurrence for the summary by severity, or 
relationship to investigational product , respectively.

Laboratory values will be summarized by treatment group, including c hanges and percent 
changes from baseline at each time point. Analyses will also be performed for each 
laboratory  parameter by treatment group for incidence rates of both potentially clinical 
significant (PCS) /clinically significant (CS) values for subjects  without PCS /CS value at 
baseline.  
Numerical values of laboratory parameters from different local laboratories with different 
units and normal ranges will be converted to the conventional units and normalized to a 
standard set of reference/normal ranges. T he normalization process will be performed and 
separated by each of the laboratory parameters.  A shift analysis by normal range will be done 
which counts the number of patients with a low, normal or high value at baseline and a low, 
normal or high value po st baseline.  
10.4.4.3.  Vital Signs  
Change and percent change from baseline in vital signs will be summarized descriptively at 
each scheduled time point by treatment group.  
10.4.4.4.  Neurological Examinations  
The percentage of subjects with a treatment -emergent abnormal neurol ogical examination 
and the specific abnormality reported will be summarized by treatment group.  
10.4.4.5.  Pharmacodynamic Parameters  
Pharmacodynamic biomarker samples will be collected and stored for up to 1 year following 
the completion of the last subject for rese arch purposes to identify and/or verify biomarkers 
that are predictive of response to inclisiran treatment (in terms of efficacy, safety and 
tolerability).  
10.5. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be performed in this study.  
10.5.1.  Interim Safety Reviews  
The ind ependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review safety data 90 days after 
the first 40  subjects receive the first injection of inclisiran or placebo. Thereafter the IDMC 
will review safety data every 3 months until the EOS unless requested otherwise by the 
IDMC. A recommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these reviews.

accordance with e stablished research principles and applicable regulations . The investigator, 
as part of his responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with the Sponsor in ensuring that the 
study adheres to the protocol and GCP requirements .  
As part of a concerted effort to fulfill these obligations, the Sponsor's monitor will visit the 
center(s) during the study in accordance with the Monitoring Plan set forth for this study . The 
investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed 
necessar y and provide access to medical records/source documents to ensure that data are 
being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory .  
12.2. Auditing  
The Sponsor may conduct audits at the study center(s) . Audits will i nclude, but not be limited 
to, investigational product  supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent 
process, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents . The investigator agrees to permit 
audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasona ble manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also inspect the investigator during or after the study . 
The investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must permit 
regulatory authority inspections.  
12.3. Protocol Deviations  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation 
in which the prote ction, safety, a nd well-being of the subje ct requires immediate 
intervention, based on the judgment of the investi gator (or a responsible, appropriately 
trained professional designated by the investigator) . In the event of a sig nificant deviation 
from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake, the investigator or designee 
must contact the Sponsor, or their agent, at the earliest possible time by telephone. This will 
allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. The  
investigator and the Sponsor will document this decision. The IRB/EC will be informed of

Confidential  73 APPENDIX B: REQUIREMENTS FOR BAC KGROUND LIPID 
LOWERING TREATMENT  
There should be no plans at the time of screening and randomization to modify the dose of 
statin or other lipid lowering medication such as ezetimibe for the duration of the trial. 
Unless the background lipid lowering treatment exceptions described below are met, subjects 
must have been treated with one of th e following highly effective statins at the specified 
daily doses and at a stable dose, preferably for 6 weeks but for at least 30 days, prior to 
screening for the study:  
 
1. atorvastatin, 40 or 80 milligrams (mg) once a day;  
2. rosuvastatin, 20 or 40 mg, once a  day; 
3. simvastatin 40 mg, once a day or, if a subject has been on that dose for >1 year,  
80 mg, once a day.  
 
Combination medications that contain atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin components 
described at the aforementioned doses will be permitted.  
 
Background lipid lowering treatment exceptions  
 
The following background lipid lowering treatment exceptions are permitted:  
 
1. Lower doses of statins due to partial statin intolerance:  
Subjects may be on a lower dose of one of the highly effective statins d escribed above if 
there is documented intolerance to any one of them (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or 
simvastatin) at the aforementioned doses. Intolerance to any dose of any statin must be 
documented as historical adverse events attributed to the statin in  question, in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
 
2. Regulatory limitations:  
Subjects may be on a lower dose of one of the highly effective statins described above if the 
highest locally approved dose for one of the stated statin s is lower than those doses shown 
above (eg, in some countries, atorvastatin 20 mg, once a day, is the highest locally approved 
dose).  
 
3. Alternative statins:  
Subjects may be treated with other statins (pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, or 
lovastatin), different from the highly effective statins listed above, if there is documented 
intolerance to any two different highly effective statins (atorvastatin, ro suvastatin, 
simvastatin) at the lowest available daily dose for at least one of those highly effective 
statins. Intolerance to any statin must be documented as historical adverse events attributed to 
the statin in question, in the source documentation and eCRF.

4. No background statin therapy:  
Subjects may be enrolled who are only on non -statin lipid lowering therapy, if complete 
statin intolerance has been documented. Subjects with complete statin intolerance must be 
unable to tolerate at least two stati ns: one statin at the lowest available daily dose AND 
another statin at any dose. Intolerance to any statin must be documented as historical adverse 
events attributed to the statin in question, in the source documentation and eCRF. The sole 
exception, for which a subject may participate in the study with documentation of intolerance 
to only one statin, is a documented history of rhabdomyolysis attributed to that statin .

Confidential  75 APPENDIX C: GENETIC INFORMED CON SENT  
Purpose and Selection of subjects:  
The purpose of the genetic test is to confirm the subject’s diagnosis of HeFH and to assess  
the response of inclisiran on LDL-C reduction by underlying causal mutations of HeFH. 
The 
genetic research analysis is an optional test that will be offered to all patients. 
Speci men collection:  
For subjects that agree to participate, a blood sample will be taken at any visit throughout the 
study and the Central lab will utilize a validated, next generation sequencing pipeline to 
analyze DNA for variants in four genes (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1) that are 
associated with familial hypercholesterolemia to confirm the subject has HeFH.   
Blood samples taken for this optional research will not be used for any additional study or 
purpose and be destroyed one year after the main study  is complete. A single -coded system 
will be used for all blood samples during the study and will be taken without using names of 
the subjects, medical record numbers, or other common identifiers that would allow for the 
linking of the code to the subject’s  identity.   The blood sample for the genetic research
analysis will be labeled with the same code number.  
Results:  
Currently, the information obtained from the genetic testing does not contain clinical or 
therapeutic implications for the individual subjec t.  Results will only be reported to the 
attending physician, Sponsor, and patient (if requested). No additional follow up beyond 
what is required in the main study is required.  
Withdraw of consent:  
A subject can withdraw their consent for participation in  this optional portion of the study at 
any time.  If consent is withdrawn when the blood sample has been taken but before it is sent 
for genetic research analysis, the study doctor will arrange to have it destroyed.   If consent is 
withdrawn after the blood  sample has been sent for genetic research analysis, The Medicines 
Company and the study doctor will ensure that the blood sample and any DNA that has been 
extracted from it are destroyed.   If consent is withdrawn after the genetic research analysis 
has al ready been performed, The Medicines Company is not obliged to destroy the results of 
this research.   In this case only the blood sample and any DNA extracted will be destroyed.

Confidential  76 APPENDIX D: RECOMMENDED NEUROLOG ICAL EXAMINATION  
MOTOR FUNCTION  
When assessing motor function, from a neurological perspective, the assessment should 
focus on arm and leg movement. You should consider the following:  
1. Muscle size  
2. Muscle tone  
3. Muscle strength  
4. Involuntary movements  
5. Posture, gait  
Symmetry is the most i mportant consideration when identifying focal findings. Compare one 
side of the body to the other when performing your assessment.  
Assessment of a Conscious Patient  
Limb assessment of a conscious patient usually involves a grading of strength.  
Grade Str ength  
Grade 
strength  Description  
5 Full range of motion against gravity and resistance; normal muscle 
strength  
4 Full range of motion against gravity and a moderate amount of 
resistance; slight weakness  
3 Full range of motion against gravity only, moderate muscle weakness  
2 Full range of motion when gravity is eliminated, severe weakness  
1 A weak muscle contraction is palpated, but no movement is noted, very 
severe weakness  
0 Complete paralysis  
NB: In a conscious patient, the single best test to quickly identify motor weakness is the 
“drift test”. Have the patient hold their arms outward at 90 degrees from the body. 
With palms up, have the patient close their eyes and hold the arms for a couple o f 
minutes. “Drifting” will occur if one side is weak.  
Lower Extremities  
Assess the patient in a supine position. Ask him/her to separate both legs to test for hip 
abduction. Then ask the patient to bring the legs back together to test for hip adduction. Sit 
the patient on the side of the bed to assess knee flexion and extension. Ask the patient to flex 
and extend the knee. If able to do this, apply resistance as these movements are repeated. 
Test plantar and dorsiflexion by having the patient push down ag ainst your hand with their 
foot and then pull up against your hand with their foot. Remember to compare  the left side to 
the right side.  
 
Inclisiran  ORION -9 (MDCO -PCS-17-03) 
The Medicines Company  Study Protocol  – Global Amendment 4
Confidential  77 Upper Extremities 
Assess ability to flex elbow (biceps) and straighten (triceps). Assess ability to raise shoulders 
and return to a resting position. Assess wrist flexion and extension. Test each function with 
resistance. For focused upper extremity assessment, assess each digit for flexion, extension 
and lateral movement.  
Assessment of an Unconscious Patient 
Upper Extremities 
1.Observe the patient for spontaneous/involuntary movement .
2.Apply painful stimuli to elicit a motor response (start with central pain; move to
peripheral pain if no response occurs).
3.Assess for paralysis of the limb by lifting both arms and releasing them  together. If
one limb is paralysed it will fall more rapidly than the non paralysed arm.
Lower Extremities 
1.Observe for spontaneous/involuntary movement .
2.Apply painful stimuli to elicit a motor response. Begin with central pain. Nailbed or  
peripheral pain can be attempted if the patient doesn’t respond to central pain (caution 
needs to be used when interpreting peripheral pain as it may stimulate spinal reflex  
responses vs withdrawal or other more deliberate responses).
3.To assess for p aralysis of the one limb you can position the patient on their back and
flex the knees so that both feet are flat on the bed. Release the knees simultaneously.
If the leg falls to an extended position with the hip externally rotated, paralysis is
present. The normal leg should stay in the flexed position for a few seconds and then
gradually assume its previous position.
SENSORY FUNCTION  
When assessing sensory function remember that there are three main pathways for sensation 
and they should be compared bi laterally:  
1.Pain and temperature sensation .
2.Position sense (proprioception) .
3.Light touch .
Pain can be assessed using a sterile pin. Light touch can be assessed with a cotton wisp. To 
test proprioception, grasp the patient's index finger from the middle joint and move it side to 
side and up and down. Have the patient identify the direction of movement. Repeat this using 
the great toe.

Confidential  78 Sensory Tests:  
A number of tests for lesions of the sensory cortex can be done. Examples include  the 
following :  
Stereognosis : The ability to recognize an object by feel. Place a common object in
the persons hand and ask them to identify the  object.
Graphesthesis: “Draw” a number in the palm of the person’s hand and ask  them to  
identify 
the number.
Two -Point Discrimi nation: Simultaneously apply two pin pricks to the skin surface.
Continually repeat the test while bringing the two pins closer together, until the
individual can no longer identify two separate stimuli. The finger tips are the most
sensitive location for recognizing two point differences while the upper arms, thighs
and back are the least sensitive.
Extinction: Touch the same spot on both sides of the body at the same time (eg,  the
left and right forearms. Ask the individual to describe how many spots are being
touched. Normally, both sides are felt; with sensory lesions the individual will sense
only one.
Point Locations: Touch the surface of the skin and remove the stimulus quickly. Ask
the individual to touch the spot where the sensation was felt. Sensor y lesions can
impair accurate identification, even if they retain their sensation of light touch.
TONE and REFLEXES  
Upper motor neuron problems (brain and spinal cord) are associated with increased tone. 
Lower motor neuron problems are associated with decr eased tone.  
Look at the muscles on each side of the body in pairs. Assess for symmetry of bulk.  
Evaluation of the stretch reflexes assesses the intactness of the spinal reflex arc at various 
spinal cord levels. The limb should be relaxed while applying a short and snappy blow with a 
reflex hammer. Hold the hammer loosely in a relaxed manner, making a wrist action. Allow 
the hammer to bounce.  
Reflex responses:  
0 No response  
1+ Diminished, low normal  
2+ Average, normal  
3+ Brisker than normal  
4+ Very brisk, hyperactive  
Lower motor neuron disease is associated with 0 or 1+, upper motor neuron disease is 
associated with 3+ or 4+.

Confidential  79 Biceps Reflex (C5 – C6):
Support the forearm on the examiners forearm. Place your thumb on the bicep tendon 
(located in the f ront of the bend of the elbow; midline to the anticubital fossa). Tap on your 
thumb to stimulate a response.  
Triceps Reflex (C7 -C8): 
Have the individual bend their elbow while pointing their arm downward at 90 degrees. 
Support the upper arm so that the arm hangs loosely and “goes dead”. Tap on the triceps  
tendon located just above the elbow bend (funny bone).  
Brachioradialis Reflex (C5 -C6):  
Hold the person’s thumb so that the forearm relaxes. Strike the forearm about 2-3 cm above 
the radial styloid process (located along the thumb side of the wrist, about 2-3 cm above the 
round bone at the bend of the wrist). Normally, the forearm with flex and supinate.  
Quadriceps Reflex (Knee jerk) L2 – L4:
Allow the lower legs to dangle freely. Place one hand on the quadriceps. Strike just below the 
knee cap. The lower leg normally will extend  and the quadriceps will contract.  
If the patient is supi ne: Stand on one side of the bed. Place the examiners forearm under the 
thigh closest to the examiner, lifting the leg up. Reach under the thigh and place the hand on 
the thigh of the opposite leg, just above the knee cap. Tap the knee closest to the exami ner, 
(the one that has been lifted up with the examiners forearm).  
Achilles Reflex (ankle jerks) L5 – S2:
Flex the knee and externally rotate the hip. Dorsiflex the foot and strike the Achilles tendon 
of the heel. In conscious patients, kneeling on a chai r can help to relax the foot.  
Heel Lift : 
While the patient is supine, bend the knee and support the leg under the thigh. Have the leg 
“go dead”. Briskly jerk the leg to lift the heel of the bed. Normally, the leg will remain  
relaxed and the heel will slide upward; increased tone will cause the heel and leg to stiffen 
and lift off the bed.  
Babinski Response:  
Dorsiflexion of the great toe with fanning of remaining toes is a positive Babinski response. 
This indicates upper motor neuron disease. It is normal  in infants.  
CEREBELLAR FUNCTION  
The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and balance on the same side. To test 
cerebellar function use the following tests:  
1.Finger to finger test: have the patient touch their index finger to your index fin ger
(repeat several times).
2.Finger to nose test: perform with eyes open and then eyes closed.
3.Tandem walking: heel to toe on a straight line .

Confidential  80 4.Romberg test: stand with feet together and arms at their sides. Have patient close  his/
her eyes and maintain this position for 10 seconds. 
If the patient begins to sway, have 
them open their eyes. If swaying continues, the test is “positive” or suggestive of 
cerebellum problems.
Dizziness that occurs in response to position changes is usually blood pressure initia ted. If 
the patient sways during a Romberg test, but stops when the eyes are opened, the problem is 
probably visual or CN VIII (vestibular ).

Confidential  81 APPENDIX E: SAMPSON CRITERIA FOR  DIAGNOSING  
ANAPHYLAXIS  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:  
1.Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin,
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
a.Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratory flow [PEF] , hypoxemia)
b.Reduced blood pressure  or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg,
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2.Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for
that patient (minutes to several hours):
a.Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen
lips-tongue -uvula)
b.Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze , bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
PEF, hypoxemia )
c.Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,
incontinence)
d.Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, painful abdominal cramps, vomiting)
3.Reduced blood pressure after exposure to a kn own allergen for that patient (minutes
to several hours):
a.Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or >30% decrease
in systolic blood pressure*
b.Adults: systolic blood pressure <90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or >30%

*Low systolic blood pressure for children is age specific and defined as: <70 mmHg from
age 1 month to 1 year; <70 mmHg + [2 x age] for age 1 to 10 years; <90 mmHg from age 11 
to 17 years.

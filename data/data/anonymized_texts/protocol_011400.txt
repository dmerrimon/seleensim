Title of study: Comparative cardiovascular and renal effectiveness and safety of 
Empagliflozin and other sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in 
patients with type 2 diabetes with and without baseline kidney disease 
in the United States
Rationale and background:While clear renal and cardiovascular (CV) benefits of empagliflozin 
have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials [
P15-09840 ], the 
effectiveness of this therapy in direct comparison to other anti-
hyperglycemic therapies has not been shown among patients with 
diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Understanding the real-world clinical impact of empagliflozin in this high-risk population is critical to 
elucidate this medication’s effect on clinical care and outcomes.
Overall, we aim to use a large, national network of electronic health 
record (EHR) data to determine the following in a real-world 
population:
1) Characteristics of patients with T2D, both with and without DKD, 
who have been initiated on empagliflozin or any sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) compared to those who have been 
initiated on dipeptidyl peptidate-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) or glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists
1(GLP1RA)
2) Renal and CV effectiveness of empagliflozin compared with DPP4i 
and SGLT2i compared with GLP1RA evaluated up to 24 months after treatment initiation
3) Safety of empagliflozin compared with DPP4i and any SGLT2i 
compared to GLP1RA evaluated up to 24 months after treatment 
initiation
Research question and 
objectives:The primary objective of this research study is to determine the 
cardiovascular and renal effectiveness and safety up to 24 months after 
initiation of empagliflozin compared to DPP4i in patients with T2D in the 
1. Overall cohort,
2. Patients with established kidney disease (DKD cohort) at 
baseline, and
3. Patients without established kidney disease at baseline (non-

DKD cohort).
Study design: This will be a non-interventional study (NIS) using existing data from 
20+ US health systems that have mapped their EHR data to the 
PCORnet Common Data Model [ R21-4494 ]. The study period will be 
from 1 Jan 2014 through 31 December 2021, which includes data after 
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be an assessment of 
COVID-era data for quality purposes and a sensitivity analysis 
excluding data from March 2020 (the assumed beginning of COVID in 
the US) to the end of study period will be performed. 
The primary aim of the study will include patients with T2D who 
initiate use of empagliflozin or DPP4i without prior use of either drug 
[class]. The analyses of all outcomes will compare patients with T2D 
initiating empagliflozin to patients with T2D initiating DPP4i.
The secondary aim of the study will be to examine cardiovascular and 
renal effectiveness and safety associated with initiation of any SGLT2i
compared to GLP1RA in patients with T2D who initiate treatment 
without prior use of either drug class.
Population: The analysis will include adults ( ≥18 years) with T2D with or without 
kidney disease in the US. To study real-world treatment patterns, the 
study population will include a broad spectrum of patients initiatingempagliflozin or any SGLT2i, DPP4i or GLP1RA. The following 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used for each two-arm 
comparison: 
Inclusion criteria:
- Patients ≥18 years old,
- Having a diagnosis of T2D within 12 months prior to the index 
date based on ICD-9 and -10 codes and other available data,
- Record of 1+ prescription for empagliflozin, any SGLT2i, any 
DPP4 inhibitor, or any GLP1RA use between 1 January 2015
and 31 December 2020, and
- No record of any prescription for the drugs being compared

health systems in the US that have mapped their data to the PCORnet 
Common Data Model (CDM). Sites meeting PCORnet data curation 
quality checks will be eligible to participate in this study. Sites will be 
approached for participation in this study based on an initial feasibility 
assessment to determine the extent and completeness of key data 
elements (renal laboratory data, prescription data, relevant medical 
diagnoses, and data from both inpatient and outpatient encounters).Death data will be ascertained from site records and augmented with de-
identified encrypted linkage to external sources, which includes 
reported deaths from the government and commercial obituaries using 
Datavant Software
.
Study size: A sample size of N=7,600 per group with median follow-up duration of 
18 months will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.80, 
assuming an incidence rate of 30 per 1,000 patient years for the primary 
composite renal outcome in the reference cohort.     
Data analysis: The index date in this study is defined as the date of the first recorded 
order for a qualifying prescription as a new user. Patients are required to 
have at least 1 ambulatory visit and at least 1 medication prescription in 
the 12 months prior to initiation of empagliflozin or a comparator drug 
(the look-back period). The look-back period includes the index date. 
The main analyses of this study will utilize a modified As-Treated (AT) approach and an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) approach will be used as a 
sensitivity analysis for the primary and secondary comparisons of the 
primary outcome.
Follow-up starts from the day after the index date until the first 
qualifying event has been met:
!First occurrence of outcome of interest
!Death
!2 years following the index prescription
!End of query specific study period (December 31, 2021)
!Empagliflozin user starts a DPP4i or other type of SGLT2i, or if a 
DPP4i user starts any SGLT2i
oSGLT2i user starts a GLP1RA, or a GLP1RA user starts 
any SGLT2i

The primary analysis will be performed using overlap weighting to 
balance covariates across the two treatment arms (empagliflozin vs
DPP4i) and Cox proportional hazards modelling to determine the effect 
of drug on outcomes. To create the overlap weights, the following will 
be performed:
For each two-arm study comparison and within the DKD and non-DKD 
subgroups separately, propensity score models will be built using a 
logistic LASSO model with the covariates of interest and all subgroup
by covariate pairwise interactions. The outcome of interest is treatment group, with empagliflozin [or any SGT2i] as the treatment of interest 
and DPP4i [or GLP1RA] as the reference group. The 
variables/interactions that are remaining in the LASSO model are refit 
to a standard logistic regression and the resulting predicted probability 
for each patient is considered the PS. For patients on the reference treatment, the overlap weight is the same as the PS. For patients on the 
treatment of interest, the overlap weight is 1-PS. No trimming is 
required due to the PS weights being bounded between 0 and 1. 
Distributions of covariates in the DKD and non- DKD groups and 
further within subgroups of interest will be assessed using standardized mean differences. Absolute standardized mean differences will be 
visually depicted using the CONNECT-S plot.
For each outcome, incidence rates (number of events per 1000 PY of 
follow-up), hazard ratios, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals(CI) will be presented. Hazard ratios and CI will be calculated using 
weighted Cox proportional hazards models. For the AT analysis, if an 
empagliflozin or DPP4i user initiates a GLP1RA during the follow-up
period, this will be adjusted for in the comparison of empagliflozin and 
DPP4i (and similarly for users initiating a DPP4i).
Analyses will be performed overall and within DKD subgroups. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using propensity score

matching in place of overlap weighting. 
Another sensitivity analysis will be performed excluding data available 
from March 2020 to the end of the study period to reduce the impact of 
the pandemic. 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy comparison will be 
performed where eGFR decline requires >1 measurement during 
follow-up (instead of >2).
Given this is a retrospective study utilizing EHR data from multiple 
sites, the protocol-specified analyses may need to be modified based on 
overall data collection completeness (data latency) and final cohort 
sample sizes.

7. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
The global prevalence of diabetes has increased nearly 4-fold in the last forty years and this 
increase is projected to continue [ R21-4492 ]. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) affects 30-40% 
of persons with diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the 
Unites States [ P18-00615 , R19-1661 ].] The development of DKD substantially increases the 
risk of mortality for persons with diabetes [ R13-0685 ].] Empagliflozin and other sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as the first promising advance in 
the care of DKD for nearly two decades. While kidney and cardiovascular outcomes trials have demonstrated clear cardiorenal benefit for empagliflozin and SGLT2i above standard care and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis blockade [ P15-09840 , P16-06807 , R19-1356 , 
R21-1080 ],] no definitive study has compared the effectiveness of empagliflozin to other 
anti-hyperglyemic therapies. Since some of these therapies have putative cardiorenal benefits 
and risks [ R18-1139 ,R17-1732 , R21-4493 ], a direct comparison of empagliflozin and 
SGLT2i to these therapies is imperative. 
In addition, the EMPRISE US study [ P21-10532 ] used diagnostic coding from claims data to 
identify incident cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) as the main renal outcomes and 
assessed the comparative effectiveness of empagliflozin vs DPP4 inhibitors. The currentstudy builds upon the EMPRISE US study by also including key aspects of laboratory data that allow for assessment of eGFR-based renal outcomes and analyses of CKD cohorts defined by eGFR levels. This is a relevant adaptation to the EMPRISE US study methodology in that use of eGFR assessments of renal function are a more sensitive approach for categorizing CKD stages and monitoring changes in renal function over time. If feasible, 
this study will also include comparisons of risk for study outcomes between empagliflozin or 
SGLT2i compared to both DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1RAs.  GLP1RA was not included in the EMPRISE studies as a comparison group.

8. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the cardiovascular and renal 
effectiveness and safety of empagliflozin compared to DPP4i in patients with T2D in the 
!Overall cohort,
!Patients with established kidney disease (DKD cohort), and
!Patients without established kidney disease (non-DKD cohort).

9. RESEARCH METHODS
9.1 STUDY DESIGN
This will be a non-interventional comparative effectiveness and safety study, using existing 
(secondary) data from up to 20 US health systems that have mapped their electronic health record data to the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM). The study period will be 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2021, which includes data during the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be an assessment of COVID-era data for quality purposes, and we will perform a sensitivity analysis excluding all data available from March 2020 to the end of the study period. 
The primary objective of the study will include patients with T2D who initiate use of 
empagliflozin or DPP4i without prior use of either drug [class]. The primary analysis will compare patients with T2D initiating empagliflozin to patients with T2D initiating DPP4i.
The secondary objective of the study will include an additional cohort of patients: those with 
T2D who initiate use of any SGLT2i or GLP1RA without prior use of either drug class. 
Propensity score weighting (overlap weighting [ R20-1964 , R21-4495 ] will be used to balance 
covariates between two treatment groups in each comparison (empagliflozin vs DPP4i; 
SGLT2i vs GLP1RA). With overlap weighting, the resulting reweighted sample targets the subpopulation of patients with the most overlap in covariates across the two treatment groups. Patients in this subpopulation have substantial probability to be assigned to either treatment of interest, and therefore represent patients for whom there is clinical equipoise for treatment 
assignment. Propensity score models will be developed, and the reweighted populations will 
be assessed to ensure cross-treatment group covariate balance within both the DKD and non-DKD subgroups, as well as for the overall cohorts using methods of Yang et al [ R21-4497 ]. 
Additional details about propensity score modeling and reweighting are provided in the 
section on Data Analysis.
Study feasibility will be evaluated after data collection has occurred. If the final sample size 
does not meet the required sample size for 80% power, the planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be removed from the final study report. The primary analyses will still be assessed but in an exploratory capacity.  
9.2 SETTING
9.2.1 Study sites

9.2.4 Study discontinuation
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the study overall or at a particular 
study site at any time for the following reasons:
1. Failure to meet expected enrollment goals overall or at a particular study site2. Emergence of any methodological, effectiveness, or safety information that could 
significantly affect continuation of the study, or any other relevant administrative 
reasons.
3. Violation of Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice (GPP), the study protocol, or the 
contract by a study site, investigator or research collaborator, disturbing the appropriate conduct of the study
The investigator/the study site/research collaborator will be reimbursed for reasonable 
expenses incurred in case of study/site termination (except in case of the third reason).
9.3 VARIABLES
9.3.1 Exposures
Primary exposure (see Statistical and Epidemiological Analysis Plan for applicable drug 
codes): 
!Main comparison:
oIncident prescription order of empagliflozin [ATC codes: A10BK03, 
A10BD20] without prior use of any SGLT2i or DPP4 inhibitors
oIncident prescription order of any DPP4 inhibitor without prior use of any 
DPP4 inhibitor or any SGLT2i
!Secondary comparison:
oIncident prescription order of any SGLT2i without prior use of SGLT2i or 
GLP1RA
oIncident prescription order of any GLP1RA without prior use of any GLP1RA 
or SGLT2i
A modified As-Treated (AT) approach will be used for all analyses. Patients will be included 
in their incident prescription cohort with censoring occurring for the following reasons:
!Occurrence of outcome of interest
!Empagliflozin user has new prescription for a different SGLT2i during follow-up
!Empagliflozin [SGLT2i] user has new prescription for the comparator drug of interest 
during follow-up
!DPP4i or GLP1RA user has new prescription for any SGLT2i during follow-up
!No additional prescription for the incident drug has been written in the 1 year (+30 
days) since the last observed prescription
!2 years following index prescription
!End of study period

This modified approach will be used due to inconsistencies in the available prescribing data
(e.g., number of fills, number of pills) and discontinuation dates across PCORnet healthcare sites and the fact that claims/fill data are not available in PCORnet to supplement the written orders. We will assume a patient is on their initial prescription unless the criteria above have been met. To better understand potential limitations of this modified AT approach, a feasibility 
assessment will be performed once the initial data queries are performed to examine the 
extent of more detailed prescribing information (e.g., number of fills, number of pills, discontinuation dates) across participating healthcare sites.  If feasibility is determined by the investigative team, sensitivity analyses will be performed including sites with more complete prescribing information examining all primary and secondary outcomes (See section 9.7.2 ).
The intention-to-treat (ITT) approach will be used as a sensitivity analysis for the primary 
and secondary comparisons of the primary outcome. In this ITT analysis, follow-up will not be censored when a patient switches to, or adds, treatment with a different agent.
Primary subgroup of interest: diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
!DKD will be defined using diagnosis codes and laboratory values based on records at 
the index encounter and from other health system encounters up to 12 months prior to 
index prescription.  Analyses will be performed overall and within subgroups of DKD (DKD and no DKD at baseline). 
9.3.2 Outcomes
Any outcome requiring at least 2 measurements meeting the event definition over a specified 
timeframe will have a date of event set to the date of the first measurement.

9.3.3 Covariates
The overall list of covariates being examined in this investigation is provided in the study 
SEAP.  The SEAP provides an overview of the variables that will either be included in the propensity score modeling for patient matching or presented in descriptive analyses for the baseline variables but will not be included in PS modeling.
9.4 DATA SOURCES
This study will utilize high-quality renal function laboratory data available in medical 
electronic health records from approximately 20 health systems in the US that have mapped their data to the PCORnet CDM. Sites meeting PCORnet data curation quality checks will be eligible to participate in this study.  Sites will be approached for participation in this study based on an initial feasibility assessment to determine the extent and completeness of key data elements (renal laboratory data, prescription data, relevant medical diagnoses, and data from both inpatient and outpatient encounters). Death data will be ascertained from site records and augmented with de-identified encrypted linkage to external sources, which includes reported deaths from the government and commercial obituaries using Datavant Software.

misclassification through appropriate eligibility criteria (e.g., restricting to patients with 
evidence of interaction within the health system).  For time-to-event analyses, follow-up will be censored early if patient has lost contact with the health system (defined as 18 months after last encounter with the health system).
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
Below is an overview of the statistical analyses planned for this project and the approach to 
implementation of the analyses.  
9.7.1 Phased Implementation of Analyses 
A phased approach to implementation of data analyses will be used to allow examination of 
key aspects of the patient populations by treatment group and the prescribing practices by treatment type (i.e., empagliflozin, any SGLT2i, DPP4i and (if feasible) GLP1RA).  A first phase of the analyses will focus on descriptive evaluation of differences in demographic and clinical patient characteristics, number and timing of prescriptions across treatment groups, and summary of outcome event rates aggregated across treatment arms. The main rationale for this phased analytic approach is to examine the potential for exposure misclassification due to the limited medication exposure data available in PCORnet (e.g., no pharmacy claims data). Secondary goals of the initial phase will be to assess the degree to which patient characteristics have been well balanced after propensity score weighting, and to confirm that the study will have adequate statistical power based on observed sample size and aggregate event rates for key outcomes. Results from this first analytic phase will be examined and discussed by members of the study team (BI and ) prior to implementation of comparative outcome analysis to provide an opportunity for modification of the study protocol (if needed) and/or study discontinuation if determined appropriate.  Additional details for the phased analytic approach, along with codelists and table shells, are provided in the SEAP.
9.7.2 Main analysis
9.7.2.1 Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the overall cohort, 
stratified by DKD status and drug comparator 
Analysis : Baseline characteristics will be presented separately for each comparison cohort 
identified in sections above, resulting in one set of tables for each 2-arm comparison. Characteristics will include demographics, medical history, lab values, and concomitant medications. Continuous variables will be summarized as mean (standard deviation), median [25th percentile, 75th percentile], 5th and 95th percentiles, and minimum, maximum. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies (%), as will any continuous variable that is further categorized. 
Characteristics will be presented in the unweighted cohorts. Additionally, characteristics will 
be stratified by DKD status and drug comparators. The degree of imbalance in variables

between comparator arms will be quantified with absolute standardized mean differences (see 
also Objective 2). 
9.7.2.2 Generate propensity score models and overlap weights Analysis : We will use post-LASSO overlap weighting to create the weights for analysis 
within the DKD and no DKD groups separately. For each two-arm study, propensity score models will be built using a logistic LASSO model with the covariates of interest and all 
subgroup (see section below) by covariate pairwise interactions. The outcome of interest is 
treatment group, with empagliflozin [or any SGLT2i] as the treatment group of interest and DPP4i [or GLP1RA] as the reference treatment. In the post-LASSO approach, the variables/interactions that are remaining in the LASSO model are refit to a standard logistic regression to get the final propensity score estimates and weights (effects/probabilities from the LASSO model would have faults due to shrinkage of the coefficient estimates) and the overlap weights. The predicted probabilities from the refit logistic regression are considered the propensity scores. For patients on the reference treatment, the overlap weight is the same as the PS. For patients on the treatment of interest, the overlap weight is 1-PS. No trimming is required due to the PS weights being bounded between 0 and 1.
For each patient, the overlap weight is the predicted propensity that the patient received the 
treatment opposite from what they were initiated on. For example, for the comparison of empagliflozin versus DPP4i initiation, a patient who was initiated on empagliflozin will receive a weight equal to (1-ps), where ‘ps’ is the estimated propensity score for empagliflozin initiation, and a patient who was initiated on DPP4i is weighted by ‘ps’. 
Baseline characteristics will be presented in the reweighted populations. Distributions of 
covariates in the DKD and no DKD groups and further within subgroups of interest will be assessed using standardized mean differences. Absolute standardized mean differences will be visually depicted using the CONNECT-S plot. Absolute standardized mean differences should be below 0.10 across covariates and subgroups but those that are less than 0.25 might be acceptable. 
9.7.2.3 Determine the effect of empagliflozin compared to DPP4i on outcomes Analysis : The effect of empagliflozin compared to DPP4i on outcomes will be assessed using 
Cox proportional hazards models in a 2-arm comparison. The analysis will include all patients with a valid overlap weight and will be done for overall and within DKD subgroups. The main analysis will assess outcomes while patients remain on initial treatment. 
Follow-up will start the day after the index date (date of initiation of empagliflozin or DPP4i) 
and will continue until the first occurrence of the outcome of interest, or end of study date (date of death, date of study end, 2 years after index date). For the main AT analysis, follow up will be censored early if an empagliflozin user starts a DPP4i or other type of SGLT2i, or if a DPP4i user starts any SGLT2i. For the AT analysis, if an empagliflozin or DPP4i userinitiates a GLP1RA, this will be adjusted for in the model using a time-dependent indicator

variable. Additionally, follow-up will be censored early if there is no indication of a new 
prescription in the year (+30 days) following the last observed prescription. 
Incidence rates will be computed as the number of first events per 100 patient years of 
follow-up. Analyses of time to first event will be performed using Cox proportional hazards models. Outcomes where death is a competing risk will be analyzed using cause-specific 
proportional hazards models, achieved by censoring follow-up at the time of death. All 
analyses will be adjusted for covariates (variables) that continue to be unbalanced after reweighting, with any additional covariates that might be of medical interest identified by the clinicians. Hazard ratios comparing empagliflozin to DPP4i with 95% confidence intervals and the adjusted two-sided p-values for superiority testing will be presented for all outcomes. 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be created for each outcome in the overall and DKD subgroups 
using the reweighted population. Kaplan-Meier curves will also be generated to summarize the cumulative incidence of treatment switching by comparator arm.   
9.7.2.4 Determine the effect of SGLT2i compared to GLP1RA on outcomesAnalysis : Repeat objective 3 with the secondary comparison cohort of initiators of any 
SGLT2i or GLP1RA. In this analysis, follow up will be censored early if a SGLT2i user starts a GLP1RA, or if a GLP1RA user starts any SGLT2i. If a SGLT2i or GLP1RA user initiates a DPP4 inhibitor, this will be adjusted for in the model.

9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
The quality control, review, and monitoring plan are summarized below. Greater details are 
documented in the study DMRP.
Validation or quality control (QC) refers to establishing by objective evidence that 
requirements of programming tasks have been implemented correctly and completely. To ensure these requirements are met, internal and beta testing is performed for every query according to applicable standard operating procedures (SOP). Data quality checks will include evaluating variable distributions to identify extreme outliers, which will be handled with input from the clinical PI. Key variables will be evaluated for unusual patterns of missingness or distributions over time and by site. 
A Study Specific Data Characterization (SSDC) query will also be deployed to the selected 
sites to confirm data availability, completeness, conformance to the CDM specifications and 
study feasibility prior to the final production query. The SSDC will provide descriptive 
statistics of the data that will allow for an early evaluation of variable distributions. These results can often provide insights for local institutions to refine their data, and possibly refresh prior to the final query.
Additionally, as part of general QC standards, SAS log files will be saved after each 
production run and inspected for errors and warnings after each run by the program author.  Log files will be free from ERROR messages, and any WARNINGS or problematic NOTEs, such as those concerning uninitialized variables or multi-record merging, etc., should be investigated and, if allowed to remain, should be reviewed with the lead statistician, with input from the statistical mentor if needed.
The statistical mentor will review new statistical results before they are released to the 
internal team, or in parallel (if timelines necessitate), and will review programming specifications and/or code as requested by the lead statistician, or as needed based on an assessment of risk. The clinical PI will review new statistical results before they are released to the sponsor.

9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS
Limitations of the study include:
- Limitations inherent to all EHR-based studies, including potential for missing data 
(i.e., data that was generated through a different health system) or inaccurate data based on billing codes
- The data will represent 20 large US health systems but may not be representative of or 
generalizable to the entire US population
- Only the presence of a prescription will be used to identify drug exposure since due to 
the nature of US EHR data, which includes the unavailability of more detailed treatment exposure data is not available in PCORnet (i.e., no data are available for number of pills, or numbers of refills, days supply, or discontinuation orders).However, to account for the maximal days supply provided in the US, patients).Patients will be censored at 12 months following index prescription (with a 30-day grace period), which allows for the maximal amount of time a single prescription in the US is provided if no subsequent prescriptions are observed.  In EMPRISE US[P21-10532 ], approximately 40% of patients were censored due to treatment 
discontinuation and the mean follow-up time on treatment was approximately 6 
months in both exposure groups.  Therefore, patients in However, the current study may be followed beyond time of medication exposure. ability to estimate drug exposure using more accurate approaches commonly implemented in real-world studies using claims data (e.g., calculation of days supply) will not be possible. This limitation could result in higher than actual number of person years of follow-up time beyond actual drug exposure, which could lead to attenuation of the estimated risk differences between treatment groups. 
- With the advent of COVID, less laboratory and encounter data may have been 
collected, though we do not anticipate that this would differ by medication type
- Despite adjusting for numerous factors, there may be unmeasured confounders that 
impact the estimated differences in risk across treatment groups in this analysis
- eGFR data may not have been obtained as a part of routine clinical care, or the 
laboratory data may be missing, which is a potential limitation in all EHR analyses.

ANNEX 2. ENCEPP CHECKLIST FOR STUDY PROTOCOLS
ENCePP Checklist for Study Protocols (Revision 4)
Adopted by the ENCePP Steering Group on 15/10/2018
The European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP)
welcomes innovative designs and new methods of research. This Checklist has been developed by 
ENCePP to stimulate consideration of importan t principles when designing and writing a 
pharmacoepidemiological or pharmacovigilance study protocol. The Checklist is intended to promote the quality of such studies, not their uniformit y. The user is also referred to the ENCePP Guide on 
Methodological Standards in Pharmacoepidemiol ogy, which reviews and gives direct electronic 
access to guidance for research in pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance.
For each question of the Checklist, the investigat or should indicate whether or not it has been 
addressed in the study protocol. If the answer is “Yes”, the section number of the protocol where this issue has been discussed should be specified. It is possible that some questions do not apply to a particular study (for example, in the case of an innovative study design). In this case, the answer ‘N/A’ (Not Applicable) can be checked and the “Comments” field included for each section should be used to explain why. The “Comments” field can also be used to elaborate on a “No” answer. 
This Checklist should be included as an Annex by marketing authorisation holders when submitting 
the protocol of a non-interventional post-authorisa tion safety study (PASS) to a regulatory authority 
(see the Guidance on the format and content of the protocol of non-interventional post-authorisation 
safety studies). The Checklist is a supporting do cument and does not replace the format of the 
protocol for PASS presented in the Guidance and Module VIII of the Good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP).

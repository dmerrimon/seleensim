PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
 
Protocol Title:   A Randomized, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of Sipuleucel-T with Concurrent 
Versus Sequential Administration of Enzalutamide in Men with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant 
Prostate Cancer 
Protocol Number:  P12-2 
Clinical Phase:  2 
Investigational Product, Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) 
is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an immune response 
against prostate cancer.  It consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 
including antigen presenting cells ([APCs], defined as large CD54-positive PBMCs) that have 
been activated in vitro with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein composed of 
prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage colo ny-stimulating factor. 
A dose of sipuleucel-T is prepared using PBMCs from a single leukapheresis procedure.  A 
minimum of 50 million APCs (the biologically active component of sipuleucel-T) are 
administered via a single intravenous (IV) infusion.  A complete treatment of sipuleucel-T will 
include 3 doses of autologous cells, infused at approximately 2-week intervals. 
Sipuleucel-T is indicated for use in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 
metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC ). 
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor.  It is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
mCRPC who have previously received docetaxel.  The enzalutamide dose used in this study will 
be 160 mg orally once daily. 
Reference Product, Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  No reference product will be 
used in this clinical study. 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate peripheral PA2024-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a 
T cell stimulation index from a proliferation assay. 
Secondary Objectives: 
 To evaluate time to prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) progression. 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 4 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential 
 To estimate the percent of subjects who are PSA progression-free at 12 months. 
 To evaluate overall survival.  
 To determine the magnitude of peripheral immune response over time as determined by the 
following: 
– Peripheral PAP-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a T cell 
stimulation index from a proliferation assay. 
– T cell interferon- γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) response to 
P
A2024 and PAP. 
– Humoral response to PA2024 and PAP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). 
– Chemokine and cytokine production via fluorescent immunoassay (Luminex® assay). 
 To evaluate safety. 
Exploratory Objectives: 
 To evaluate time to next anticancer intervention. 
 To evaluate time to first cancer-related opioid use. 
 To evaluate time to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
decline. 
Study Design and Duration: 
This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effects of sipuleuc el-T when 
administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide.  This study consists of 3 phases.  
The screening phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue 
through registration.  The active phase will begin at registration and continue through the post-
treatment visit (30 to 37 days following the last study treatment).  The long term follow-up 
(
LTFU) phase will begin after the post-treatment visit and will continue until the subject’s death 
or until Dendreon terminates the study. 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T in addition to a total of 52 weeks of concurrent or sequential treatment with 
enzalutamide.  Subjects will be stratified by screening PSA levels (≥ 25 ng/mL, yes or no) and 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 5 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential screening lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (≥ 200 IU/L, yes or no), both obtained from the 
central laboratory. 
Enzalutamide treatment will occur either concurrently with sipuleucel-T (concurrent arm), or 
following administration of sipuleucel-T (sequential arm): 
Concurrent Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T concurrent ly with enzalutamide (160 mg orally once 
daily).  Enzalutamide treatment will start 2 weeks prior to the first leukapheresis and 
continue for 52 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever 
occurs first.  Subjects randomized to the concurrent arm who receive the 2-week 
enzalutamide run-in, but do not subsequently receive at least one partial (> 0 mL) 
infusion of sipuleucel- T will not receive any additional enzalutamide treatment, will 
undergo a post-treatment visit, and will enter the LTFU phase. 
Sequential Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T followed by enzalutamide (160 mg orally once daily).  
Enzalutamide treatment will start approximately 10 weeks after the first infusion of 
sipuleucel-T and continue for 52 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, whichever occurs first.  Subjects randomized to the sequential arm who do not 
receive at least one partial (> 0 mL) infusion of sipuleucel-T will not receive any 
enzalutamide treatment, will undergo a post-treatment visit, and will enter the LTFU 
phase. 
After 52 weeks of enzalutamide treatment provided by Dendreon, subjects in either 
treatment arm may continue to receive enzalutamide obtained from other sources at the 
discretion of their treating physician.  Dendreon cannot provide enzalutamide beyond the 
protocol-specified duration of 52 weeks. 
During the active phase, subjects in both arms will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume 
leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel-T.  This 
process will occur a total of 3 times at approximately 2-week intervals, as shown in the study 
design below.  Immune monitoring blood samples will be drawn and clinical and safety 
assessments will be performed at screening, preleukapheresis visits 2 and 3, and weeks 6, 10, 14, 
20, 26, 40 and 52, with the timing of visits based on the date of the first sipuleucel-T infusion.  
Imm
une monitoring blood samples will also be drawn following each sipuleucel-T infusion.  
Additional assessments including physical examinations, vital signs, ECOG performance status, 
AE monitoring, anticancer therapies, first opioid use for cancer-related pain, laboratory tests 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 6 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential (e.g., hematology and serum chemistries), and PSA monitoring will be performed at scheduled 
times. 
During the LTFU phase, safety (treatment-related AEs, cerebrovascular events, and seizures), 
survival status, PSA, ECOG performance status, first opioid use for cancer-related pain (if 
applicable), and anticancer therapies  will be assessed every 3 months until the subject’s death or 
until Dendreon terminates the study. 
The study design is illustrated below. 
 
Abbreviation:  LTFU = long-term follow-up. 
 
Study Population and Sample Size:  Approximately 100 men with mCRPC, 18 years of age or 
older will be enrolled.  
Statistical Considerations: 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms for 
immune response over time evaluated on the basis of PA2024-stimulated T cell proliferation via 
tritiated-thymidine uptake.  The immune response population will consist of all subjects who 
receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel-T and at least 10 weeks of enzalutamide.  PA2024 -specific T 
cell proliferation responses over time will be compared between the concurrent arm and 
sequential arm using a repeated measurement mixed model analysis. 
With 43 subjects per treatment arm (concurrent and sequential), there is 90% power to detect a 2-
fold difference in mean response between the arms at any time point assuming a coefficient of 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 7 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential variation of 1.25.  To allow for drop-outs and subjects who may not receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T or at least 10 weeks of enzalutamide, approximately 50 subjects per arm will be 
enrolled. 
The intent-to-treat population is defined as all randomized subjects, regardless of whether they 
receive treatment.  Analysis of non -immune response efficacy endpoints will be performed using 
this analysis population. 
The safety population will include all subjects who undergo at least 1 leukapheresis procedure or 
receive at least 1 dose of enzalutamide.

Proprietary and Confidential 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and Rationale 
1.1.1 Prostate Cancer 
In 2012, prostate cancer was the most common solid tumor malignancy in men in the United 
States, comprising 29% of new cancer cases (241,740 new cancer cases).  Approximately 80% of 
prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the primary site.  An 
additional 12% are diagnosed when locally advanced, and a further 4% when the cancer has 
already metastasized (Howlader 2011 ).  Prostate cancer-related deaths typically occur as a result 
of complications of metastatic disease, with an estimated 28,170 annual deaths in 2012  
(Siegel 2012). 
Treatment of localized prostate cancer typically has a curative intent and may include radical 
prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, or 
hormone therapy.  Watchful waiting or active surveillance may be employed where the risks of 
the treatment outweigh the benefits, taking into account the patient’s age and general health 
status. 
Although primary therapy effectively cures the majority of patients, disease does recur in 
approximately 20% to 40% of individuals, where an increased level of serum prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) may be considered to be evidence of biochemical failure and progression to 
advanced disease ( Ward 2005 ). 
In men with recurrent disease, the current standard of care for androgen-dependent, advanced 
prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) using a luteinizing hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist, an LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy, which results in 
similar, and initially high,  anticancer activity, with response rates attaining 80%.  A peripheral 
antiandrogen, such as flutamide or bicalutamide, is typically used during the initial treatment 
period with an LHRH agonist to block the transient testosterone flare, but randomized Phase 3 
trials have not consistently demonstrated a survival benefit with continuous combined androgen 
blockade (ADT plus antiandrogen) as compared with ADT alone ( Klotz 2001 ). 
Despite ADT, virtually all patients with recurrent disease will progress and their disease will 
spread to distant sites, most commonly bones and/or regional lymph nodes ( Scher 1996 ,  
Small 1997) .  Disseminated or metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer  (mCRPC) is a 
noncurable and lethal disease with a median survival reported in recent Phase 3 studies ranging 
from 12.2 to 27.2  months (Kantoff 2010 , Ryan 2013 ). 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 13 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Until recently, docetaxel was the only therapy demonstrated to enhance overall survival in 
patients with mCRPC ( Petrylak 2004 , Tannock 2004 ).  However, since 2010, sipuleucel-T 
(Provenge®, Provenge 2012 ), cabazitaxel (Jevtana®, Jevtana 2012 ), abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®, 
Zytiga 2012 ), and enzalutamide (Xtandi®, Xtandi 2011 ) have all received Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of mCRPC based on their demonstrated ability 
to increase overall survival.  This increasing repertoire of approved agents for the treatment of 
mCRPC creates challenges within the treatment paradigm as there are currently no clinical data 
to inform how these agents are best sequenced. 
Although enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC who have received 
prior chemotherapy, it has also been listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Guidelines for prechemotherapy treatment of patients with mCRPC who have an evidence level 
2A.  Sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide both have the potential to be administered prior to 
chemotherapy to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC.  Because 
androgen ablation has been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory properties, there is 
potential synergy from combining the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide with  
sipuleucel-T (Mercader 2001 , Drake 2005 , Gannon 2009 , Sutherland 2005, Koh 2009,  
Madan 2008
).  An evidence-based approach to assess the consequences of concurrent or 
sequential therapy with enzalutamide and sipuleucel-T is therefore warranted to optimize the 
benefits of these agents within the therapeutic paradigm. 
1.1.2 Sipuleucel-T 
Sipuleucel- T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an immune 
response against prostate cancer.  It consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), including antigen presenting cells (APCs, defined as large CD54-positive PBMCs) 
that have been activated in vitro with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein 
composed of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF).  
Sipuleucel-T was approved in the United States in 2010 for the treatment of men with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (hormone refractory) mCRPC ( Provenge 2011).  In the 
pivotal trial D9902B (IMPACT), 512 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel- T 
(N=341 subjects) or control (N=171 subjects).  Overall survival was longer in the sipuleucel- T 
group (median of 25.8 months versus 21.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.98; P=0.03).  More than 3,339 infusions of sipuleucel-T and control (a 
product manufactured from PBMCs without activation with the PA2024 antigen), have been 
administered to men with prostate cancer in clinical trials. 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 14 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Clinical data to support the safety of sipuleucel-T are provided from 904 subjects (sipuleucel-T, 
N = 601; control, N = 303) who participated in 4 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
controlled Phase 3 studies ( Provenge 2011).  Three of these studies were conducted in men with 
mCRPC (studies D9902B, D9901, and D9902A), and 1 study was conducted in men with 
androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC).  In the 4 randomized Phase 3 studies, adverse 
events (AEs) reported in ≥ 20% of all subjects were chills, fatigue, pyrexia, and back pain.  The 
most common AEs (observed in ≥ 5% of sipuleucel-T subjects as well as at least twice the rate of 
that in control subjects) included chills, pyrexia, headache, myalgia, influenza-like illness, and 
hyperhidrosis.  The majority of these events occurred within 1 day of infusion; were grade 1 or 2 
in severity; and were generally of short duration (i.e., resolved in ≤  2  days).  Grade 3 or 4 
events were reported in 27.6% of subjects in the sipuleucel-T group, compared with 28.4% in the 
control group.  Cerebrovascular events (CVEs) occurred in 3.5% of subjects in the sipuleucel- T 
group compared with 2.6% in the control group.  A registry of approximately 1,500 patients is 
ongoing and will further evaluate the risk of CVEs in subjects receiving sipuleucel- T. 
1.1.3 Enzalutamide 
Enzalutamide was approved in the U.S. in August, 2012 for the treatment of men with mCRPC 
who have previously received docetaxel ( Xtandi 2012).  Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor 
inhibitor that acts on several steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. 
In the pivotal AFFIRM trial, 1199 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral enzalutamide 
(160 mg per day, N=800 subjects) or placebo (N=399 subjects).  Overall survival was longer in 
the enzalutamide group (median of 18.4 months versus 13.6 months; HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.53, 
0.75, P < 0.001) (Scher 2008 ).  Common AEs associated with enzalutamide includ ed some 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE,  
NCI 2010) grade 3-4 events that had a ≥ 2% absolute increase in frequency in the enzalutamide 
arm compared to the placebo arm.  These included asthenic conditions, peripheral edema, back 
pain, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal weakness, diarrhea, 
hot flush, hypertension, headache, dizziness, spinal cord compression and cauda equina 
syndrome, paresthesia, mental impairment disorders, hypoesthesia, upper respiratory tract 
infections, lower respiratory tract and lung infection, insomnia, anxiety, hematuria, pollakiuria, 
fall, nonpathologic fractures, pruritus, dry skin, and epistaxis.  Seven out of 800 enzalutamide-
treated subjects (0.9%) experienced a seizure and were discontinued from the study. Grade 3 and 
4 AEs were reported among 47% of enzalutamide-treated subjects and 53% of placebo-treated 
subjects (Xtandi 2012). 
Medivation, Inc., the manufacturer of enzalutamide, is conducting a Phase 3 study of

3.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Study Design and Duration 
This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel-T when 
administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide.  This study consists of 3 phases.  
The screening phase will begin at the completion of the informed consent process and continue 
through registration.  The active phase will begin at registration and continue through the post-
treatment visit (30 to 37 days following the last study treatment).  The long-term follow-up 
(
LTFU) phase will begin after the post-treatment visit and will continue until the subject’s death 
or until Dendreon terminates the study. 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T in addition to a total of 52 weeks of concurrent or sequential treatment with 
enzalutamide.  Subjects will be stratified by screening PSA levels (≥ 25 ng/mL, yes or no) and 
screening lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (≥ 200 IU/L, yes or no), both obtained from the 
central laboratory. 
Enzalutamide treatment will occur either concurrently with sipuleucel-T (concurrent arm), or 
following a
dministration of sipuleucel-T (sequential arm): 
Concurrent Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T concurrent ly with enzalutamide (160 mg orally once 
daily).  Enzalutamide treatment will start 2 weeks prior to the first leukapheresis and 
continue for 52 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever 
occurs first.  Subjects randomized to the concurrent arm who receive the 2-week 
enzalutamide run-in, but do not subsequently receive at least one partial (> 0 mL) 
infusion of sipuleucel- T will not receive any additional enzalutamide treatment, will 
undergo a post-treatment visit, and will enter the LTFU phase. 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 17 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Sequential Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T followed by enzalutamide (160 mg orally once daily).  
Enzalutamide treatment will start approximately 10 weeks after the first infusion of 
sipuleucel-T and continue for 52 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, whichever occurs first.  Subjects randomized to the sequential arm who do not 
receive at least one partial (> 0 mL) infusion of sipuleucel-T will not receive any 
enzalutamide treatment, will undergo a post-treatment visit, and will enter the LTFU 
phase. 
After 52 weeks of enzalutamide treatment provided by Dendreon, subjects in either 
treatment arm may continue to receive enzalutamide obtained from other sources at the 
discretion of their treating physician.  Dendreon cannot provide enzalutamide beyond the 
protocol-specified duration of 52 weeks. 
During the active phase, subjects in both arms will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume 
leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an intravenous ( IV) infusion of sipuleucel-
T.  This process will occur a total of 3 times at approximately 2-week intervals.  A course of 
sipuleucel-T treatment comprises 3 infusions.  Immune monitoring blood samples will be drawn 
and clinical and safety assessments will be performed at screening, preleukapheresis visits 2 and 
3, and weeks 6, 10, 14, 20, 26, 40, and 52, with the timing of visits based on the date of the first 
sipuleucel- T infusion.  Immune monitoring blood samples will also be drawn following each 
sipuleucel-T infusion.  Additional assessments including physical examinations, vital signs, 
ECOG performance status (see  Appendix 1), AE monitoring, anticancer therapies, first opioid 
use for cancer-related pain, laboratory tests ( e.g., hematology and serum chemistries), and PSA 
monitoring will be performed at the times shown  in Table 1. 
During the LTFU phase, safety (treatment-related AEs, seizures, and CVEs), survival status, 
PSA, ECOG performance status, first opioid use for cancer-related pain (if applicable), and 
anticancer therapies will be assessed every 3 months until the subject’s death or until Dendreon 
terminates the study. 
The study design is illustrated in Figure 1.

4.0 STUDY POPULATION 
To participate in this study, subjects must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria 
4.1.1 Written informed consent provided prior to the initiation of study procedures. 
4.1.2 Age ≥ 18 years. 
4.1.3 Histologically documented adenocarcinoma prostate cancer confirmed by a pathology 
report from prostate biopsy or a radical prostatectomy specimen.  If prostatic tumor is of 
mixed histology, > 50% of the tumor must be adenocarcinoma.

Proprietary and Confidential Histopathological confirmation of metastatic disease is not required. 
4.1.5 Castrate-resistant prostate cancer, in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone  
(≤ 50 ng/dL), defined as current or historical evidence of disease progression concomitant 
with surgical castration or ADT, as demonstrated by one of the following: 
 Prostate specific antigen progression: PSA progression will be defined as 2 rising 
PSA values compared to a reference value, measured at least 7 days apart and the 
second value is ≥ 2 ng/mL ( Scher 2008 ). 
 Progression of measurable disease: ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest 
diameters of all measureable lesions or the development of any new lesions.  The 
change will be measurable against the best response to castration therapy or against 
the precastration measurements if there was no response. 
 Progression of non-measurable disease by one of the following: 
– Soft tissue disease: The appearance of 1 or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal 
worsening of non-measurable disease when compared to imaging studies acquired 
during castration therapy or against the precastration studies if there was no 
response. 
– Bone disease: 
 Bone scan: Appearance of 2 or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone 
scan when compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or 
against the precastration studies if there was no response.  Increased uptake of 
pre-existing lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression.

Proprietary and Confidential 4.3.4 Discontinuation from the Study 
Subjects may discontinue their participation in the trial at any time without prejudice.  If a 
subject withdraws consent for any further study involvement, complete withdrawal of consent 
must be documented in the subject’s medical record.  The date and reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF.  
Whenever possible, subjects discontinuing from the study will undergo a post-treatment visit.  
All AEs considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment(s) that are ongoing at the 
time of discontinuation will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until the subject 
returns to baseline.  The investigator should make every reasonable attempt to ensure that the 
subject is contacted (via telephone or during a post-treatment visit) to obtain the final status of 
any AEs and concomitant medications.   
Subjects will discontinue from the study (all treatment and subsequent assessments) for any of 
the following reasons: 
 The subject withdraws consent for any reason. 
 The subject loses the ability to freely provide consent.  
 The subject is lost to follow-up . 
 The subject fails to comply with protocol requirements. 
 The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator or 
Dendreon. 
 Dendreon terminat es the study. 
Subjects who withdraw consent, or lose the ability to freely provide consent, will be followed by 
the investigator for survival every 3 months using the Social Security Death Index (SSDI ) and 
National Death Index (NDI).   Date of death, where available, will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and on the CRF. 
4.4 Lost to Follow- Up 
If the subject fails to respond to requests for follow-up, the clinical trial site will send a registered 
letter, at a minimum, to the subject requesting contact with the clinic.  All attempts to resume 
contact (including copies of written correspondence) will be included in the source 
documentation.  Subjects who do not respond to requests for follow-up after all reasonable 
attempts to establish contact will be considered “lost to follow-up”.  Subjects who are lost to 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 25 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential follow-up will be followed by the investigator for survival every 3 months using the SSDI and 
the NDI.  Date of death, where available, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on 
the CRF. 
4.5 Disease Progression 
Disease progression is determined by the investigator per the definition below.  The earliest date 
of disease progression will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRF.  
Following disease progression, all study treatments will cease, the subject will undergo a post-
treatment visit,  enter LTFU, and will be treated at the investigator’s discretion. 
Any 1 or more of the following events constitutes disease progression: 
 PSA Progression (based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria, ( Scher 2008 ): 
– Decline from baseline: the first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the 
nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (i.e., a 
confirmed rising trend). 
– No decline from baseline: PSA progression ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks of 
enzalutamide treatment. 
PSA measurements obtained during the first 12 weeks of enzalutamide treatment should not be 
used as the sole criterion for determining progression.  Study treatments may be continued in 
equivocal cases where there is PSA progression but no clear evidence of disease progression or 
clinical deterioration, and where the investigator feels the subject is deriving clinical benefit from 
the study treatments and subject safety is not compromised (Scher 2008). 
 Clinically significant disease-specific event: 
– New spinal cord or nerve root compression. 
– New pathologic fracture. 
– Development of metastatic disease in a new anatomic location. 
– Disease progression based on radiographic imaging and Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.1.

Proprietary and Confidential 4.6 Concomitant Medications 
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood products, 
antibiotics, antiemetics, or other therapies, in accordance with standard practice at the clinical 
trial site.  Subjects receiving ADT, bisphosphonate therapy such as zoledronic acid (Zometa®), or 
denosumab (Xgeva®) at the time of registration should continue the therapy at a stable dose until 
the post-treatment visit or disease progression, whichever occurs first. 
All concomitant medications administered from screening through the post-treatment visit, 
including indication, dose, route, frequency and treatment dates, will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and o n the CRF.  After the post-treatment visit, only anticancer therapies will be 
recorded.  The first opioid taken for cancer-related pain will be recorded, regardless of when it is 
started. 
4.7 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
Subjects on ADT must continue this therapy until the post-treatment visit or disease progression, 
whichever occurs first. 
The following medications and interventions must not be initiated until the post-treatment visit 
or disease progression, whichever occurs first: 
 Investigational vaccines or other investigational products. 
 Ipilimumab . 
 Any therapy for prostate cancer except for that administered in this protocol and ADT . 
 External beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy. 
 Inducers or inhibitors of CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil, rifampin [see Appendix 3]).  
 Medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 that have a narrow 
therapeutic ind ex (see Appendix 3). 
 Inducers of CYP3A4 (including but not limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, 
rifabutin, rifapentine, and phenobarbital [see Appendix 3]).

Proprietary and Confidential 5.0 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Handling Study Treatments 
Study treatments must be stored, handled, and prepared as specified by the sipuleucel- T 
investigator’s brochure (IB, Sipuleucel-T 2013 ) and the enzalutamide prescribing information 
(Xtandi 2012 ).  Dendreon should be notified immediately if concerns regarding the quality or 
appearance of the study treatments arise. 
Accountability documentation, including receipt, storage and applicable storage conditions, 
administration, destruction and use of required processes must be maintained to ensure the study 
treatments are accurately administered. 
Dendreon will supply the study treatments (sipuleucel-T, enzalutamide).  Enzalutamide will be 
labeled with protocol-specific information, including the statement “Caution: New Drug-Limited 
by United States law to investigational use .” 
5.2 Sipuleucel-T Treatment 
5.2.1 Leukapheresis and Infusion Scheduling 
The subject’s 3 leukapheresis appointments will be scheduled by Dendreon.  Leukapheresis 
appointments will be scheduled at approximately 2-week intervals.  The clinical trial site will 
receive confirmation of the leukapheresis and infusion dates via email.  The clinical trial site will 
schedule the subject’s infusion appointments based on this schedule.  If the subject is 
subsequently deemed ineligible, the clinical trial site will be informed and the leukapheresis and 
infusion appointments will be canceled. 
5.2.2 Preleukapheresis Assessments  
Subjects will be evaluated for their ability to tolerate the leukapheresis procedure during 
preleukapheresis assessments that occur during screening and ≤ 5 days prior to the second and 
third
 leukapheresis.  The assessment may occur on the day of the leukapheresis procedure 
provided it occurs before the leukapheresis procedure. 
Venous access is evaluated to determine if, due to inadequate peripheral veins, placement of a 
central venous catheter is absolutely necessary to undergo leukapheresis.  If there is any question 
about adequate venous access, the subject will be assessed at a leukapheresis center by a 
leukapheresis nurse. 
If a subject has any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever 
(temperature > 100.5°F or > 38.1°C) within 1 week prior to a leukapheresis appointment, the 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 28 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential appointment should be rescheduled to occur after the fever resolves and the investigator believes 
the subject is healthy enough to undergo the procedure. 
5.2.3 Subject Preparation for Leukapheresis 
The subject should be instructed to eat calcium-rich foods in advance of the leukapheresis 
procedure.  The subject should drink plenty of fluids a few days prior to the procedure to 
promote adequate venous access during leukapheresis, but drink minimal fluids on the mornings 
of leukapheresis appointments. 
5.2.4 Leukapheresis 
The collection of blood cells to manufacture sipuleu cel-T is analogous to that for autologous 
blood transfusions.  Subjects undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis to 
harvest PBMCs (primarily lymphocytes and monocytes).  Prior mobilization with a colony-
stimulating factor is not performed.  Immediately after completion of the collection procedure, 
the leukapheresis product is transported to one of Dendreon’s regional immunotherapy 
manufacturing facilities.  All of the cells recovered from the leukapheresis procedure will be 
used to produce 1 dose of sipuleucel-T that is infused approximately 3 days following the 
leukaphe
resis procedure. 
To maintain the chain of identity and ensure subject safety, subject identifiers accompany the 
production of sipuleucel-T throughout the manufacturing process.  The subject’s identifying 
information will be revealed to Dendreon’s apheresis and manufacturing personnel.  The 
sipuleucel-T label with the subject identifier is returned to the clinical trial site. 
5.2.5 Sipuleucel- T Infusion 
Each sipuleucel-T dose is released by Dendreon for infusion approximately 3 days following the 
leukapheresis procedure.  Subjects will be infused according to the infusion guidelines provided 
in Appendix 4 . 
5.2.6 Sipuleucel- T Product Failures and Leukapheresis Rescheduling 
In the event that a subject’s leukapheresis procedure fails, sipuleucel-T does not meet quality 
release specifications, or infusion is not possible for any other reason, the subject may be 
scheduled to undergo a repeat leukapheresis procedure.  A minimum of 2 days must have elapsed 
since the last leukapheresis procedure.  Scheduling will depend upon capacity of the 
leukapheresis and Dendreon manufacturing facilities.  If the second or third leukapheresis 
appointment is delayed or rescheduled for any reason, a physical examination and all other 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 29 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential preleukapheresis procedures must be repeated within the 5 days prior to the next leukapheresis 
proc
edure.  The preleukapheresis immune monitoring samples will not be drawn again. 
There is a possibility that a subject’s sipuleucel-T may fail to meet quality requirements more 
than once.  In such instances, the subject may not receive all 3 infusions.  In rare instances, it 
may be determined that it is not possible to manufacture sipuleucel-T that passes quality control 
(QC) testing from a subject’s leukapheresis product. 
5.3 Enzalutamide Treatment 
For the concurrent arm, enzalutamide dispensing visits will occur 2  weeks prior to the first 
leukapheresis, at preleukapheresis visit 2 and at weeks 6, 10, 14, 20, 26, 34, 40, and 46; for the 
sequential arm, these visits will occur at weeks 10, 14, 20, 26, 34, 40, 48 and 52 (see Table 1). 
In the event of multiple sipuleucel-T product failures for a subject in the sequential arm, 
enzalutamide treatment should not be started until the subject has received all 3 sipuleucel- T 
infusions or a determination has been made that the subject will not receive 3 infusions.  Subjects 
randomized to the sequential arm who do not receive at least one partial (> 0 mL) infusion of 
sipuleucel-T will not receive any enzalutamide treatment. 
5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Subjects who complete the study will receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel- T and  52 weeks of 
enzalutamide (160 mg oral dose once daily).  The timing of doses is described in Section 3.1. 
5.5 Blinding/Unblinding 
This is an open-label study. 
5.6 Treatment Compliance 
Sipuleucel-T will be administered at the clinical trial site. 
Enzalutamide compliance will be monitored by reconciliation of returned study treatments 
and/or treatment packaging at every dispensing visit. 
5.7 Destruction and Return of Study Treatments 
5.7.1 Sipuleucel-T 
The clinical trial site will dispose of the sipuleucel-T bag and tubing according to institutional 
procedures for disposal of biohazardous waste that contains human blood.

If instructed by Dendreon to return the sipuleucel-T and/or tubing, the remaining sipuleucel- T 
will be placed in the original shipping box with the original packaging materials and shipped per 
Dendreon ’s instructions. 
5.7.2 Enzalutamide 
All undispensed, returned, or expired enzalutamide and any empty enzalutamide bottles will be 
retained until study treatment accountability and treatment compliance are verified by a 
Dendreon clinical research associate.  Following verification, any undispensed, returned or 
expired enzalutamide and any empty enzalutamide bottles will be disposed of according to

6.8 Immune Monitoring Assessments 
Immune monitoring samples will be obtained at the times outlined in Table 1 . 
Neither the subject nor the investigator will receive results from immune monitoring 
assessments. 
6.8.1 Immune Response 
Cellular and immune responses will be assessed from 100 mL blood samples (9x10 mL heparin 
whole blood tubes and 1x10 mL serum tube) collected at the times noted in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 1).  Following infusion of sipuleucel-T, a 10 mL blood sample (1x10 mL 
serum tube) will be collected.   
Immune response assessments will include T cell IFN-γ ELISPOT response to PA2024 and PAP, 
T cell proliferation response to PAP by tritiated thymidine uptake, humoral response to PA2024 
and PAP by ELISA, and chemokine and cytokine production via Luminex assay. 
6.8.2 Sipuleucel-T Lot Release 
Prior to infusion, small samples (3% to 4%) of cellular components from pre and post-culture 
(PA2024) cells will be used to assess product potency as part of the normal sipuleucel- T 
manufacturing process. 
Sipuleucel-T lot release assessments will include total nucleated cell (TNC) count, CD54+ cell 
count and CD54 upregulation. 
6.8.3 Product Characterization 
Unused portions of the pre and post-culture samples collected for sipuleucel-T lot release will be 
used for additional analyses including flow cytometry, protein array, and spectral analyses, to 
identify potential biomarkers of the immune response.  Tests to determine cellular composition 
will include assessment of the activation status of T cells, B cells, and NK cells.  In addition, the 
amounts and types of cytokines produced during the manufacture of sipuleucel-T will also be 
profiled. 
Human leukocyte antigen phenotyping will be performed in order to profile the major 
histocompatibility complex for each subject, which will make certain immune response analyses 
possible, such as tetramer analysis ( Altman 2006 ).

Proprietary and Confidential 6.8.4 Immune Gene Expression Analyses 
Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a heterogeneous disease, with varying symptoms 
and overall survival ranging from several months to several years ( Scher 2011 ).  The ability to 
accurately predict outcome in men with CRPC is a crucial element in understanding response to 
treatment.  While many studies have correlated clinical and laboratory variables with survival,  
the role that the immune system plays in controlling prostate cancer has not been fully studied, 
mainly due to the complexity of the immune system.  Moreover, immune response assays can 
only interrogate discrete pathways 1 at a time, rather than assess the complex interaction between 
the various cellular and secreted components that comprise the entire immune system.  Recent 
studies (Ross 2012 , Olmos 2012 ) have shown that gene-expression profiling of peripheral blood 
cells can yield prognostic information with regards to control of CRPC.  
An integrated and standardized system for collection, transport, and storage of whole blood 
specimens and isolation of either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or genomic deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) (e.g., PAXgene®), will allow analyses of immune gene expression by detection of RNA 
or genetic analysis of germline DNA. 
At screening, an 8.5 mL blood sample will be collected for baseline immune genetic analysis in a 
specialized tube that stabilizes intracellular DNA (e.g., PAXgene® Blood DNA Tube). 
At all immune monitoring assessment time points, a 2.5 mL blood sample will be collected to 
assess immune gene expression profiles through analysis of intracellular RNAs in immune cells.  
These blood samples will be collected in a specialized tube containing an additive that stabilizes 
intracellular RNA (e.g., PAXge ne® Blood RNA Tube). 
Neither the subject nor the investigator will receive results from gene expression analysis. 
6.8.5 Sample Retention 
Samples from subjects who do not provide consent for additional optional research  
(Section 6.8.6) will be retained for up to 5 years following Dendreon’s completion of the trial 
and then will be destroyed. 
6.8.6 Additional Optional Research 
Subjects will be given the opportunity to allow Dendreon to retain their blood samples (obtained 
for immune response, lot release, product characterization, and gene expression analysis ) 
indefinitely and to use them for other testing.  No additional blood draws will be required beyond 
those already being collected as part of the study.  Additional research may include genetic 
testing and retained samples may be sent to outside laboratories for testing. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 42 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Retained samples will be used for research only, will not be sold, and will not be identified using 
subject names or other personal identifiers.  Neither the subject nor the clinical trial site will 
receive results from additional testing. 
6.9 Study Materials 
The clinical trial site will have a calibrated scale for recording body weight and a calibrated 
sphygmomanometer and thermometer for vital signs assessments.  A current and fully stocked 
advanced cardiac life support cart will be immediately available on the premises.  The clinical 
trial site will also have a refrigerated centrifuge, a monitored and alarmed refrigerator, and a 
freezer (-20°C or below) as well as containers and dry ice for shipment of blood samples. 
The clinical trial site will provide all materials required for accurate documentation of subject 
visits and study activities. 
Dendreon will provide an approved protocol and any required amendments or administrative 
letters, as well as the IB and electronic CRFs.  Materials needed for the collection of laboratory 
samples, including immune monitoring samples, will be provided by Dendreon.  Dendreon will 
also provide all applicable study specific training materials and reference binders. 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject while on study that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment.  
Adverse events include exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, an increase in frequency or 
intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition, a condition detected or diagnosed after 
product administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or a 
continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at screening that worsen following the start of 
the study. 
7.1 Categories for Ranking Severity of Adverse Events 
The NCI CTCAE ( NCI 2010 ) will be used to score AE severity.  In general, the following 
general severity definitions apply: 
Mild (Grade 1):  The AE results in mild, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic 
with clinical or diagnostic observations only.  Intervention is not usually 
indicated. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 43 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Moderate (Grade 2): The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to 
interfere with some aspect of the subject’s normal daily activity.  Minimal, 
local, or noninvasive intervention is required. 
Severe (Grade 3): The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
results in discomfort or disability which is incapacitating and prevents 
most normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization or complicated 
treatment. 
Life Threatening   
(Grade 4):  The AE could reasonably result in death unless immediate medical 
intervention is undertaken. 
Fatal (Grade 5): The AE results in death. 
7.2 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments 
The following categories will be used to determine relatedness of AEs to study treatments: 
None: The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject. 
Possible: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study treatment, but could readily have been produced by the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
Probable:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study treatment and cannot readily have been produced by the subje ct’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
7.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, subject hospitalization or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention

Proprietary and Confidential to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of dru g 
dependency or drug abuse. 
7.3.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
All SAEs reported or observed, regardless of relationship to study treatments, and any remedial 
action(s) required, will be collected at all visits from registration through the post-treatment visit.  
Only treatment-related SAEs, seizures, and CVEs (regardless of causality) ongoing at the time of 
the post-treatment visit will be followed by the investigator until resolution, return to baseline, or 
the investigator determines no further improvement is expected.  Only new treatment-related 
AEs and SAEs, seizures, and CVEs (regardless of causality) will be collected after the post-
trea
tment visit.  
All SAEs, whether or not considered related to study treatment, must be reported to Dendreon 
within 24 hours by entering the information on the electronic SAE report form .  If access to the 
electronic SAE Form is unavailable for any reason, the SAE information must be reported to 
Dendreon or its designee within 24 hours by phone or by facsimile using the hardcopy SAE 
report form.

All seizures, regardless of causality, severity, or outcome, will be reported as AEs and SAEs 
when they occur from registration until the subject ceases study participation. 
7.3.4 Death Reports 
Death is an expected outcome of this study.  Deaths that meet any of the following criteria must 
be reported as an SAE: 
 Deaths that occur within 30 days of receiving the last study treatment. 
 Deaths that are the outcome of a SAE that occurs within 30 days from the last study 
treatment and are not due to disease recurrence. 
 Deaths due to a seizure or CVE, regardless of causality, that occur at any time during the 
study.  
 Deaths that occur at any time during the study and are considered by the investigator to be 
possibly or probably related  to the study treatment. 
Deaths that do not meet the se criteria will not be reported as an SAE, but will be recorded on the 
CRF.  
7.3.4.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements 
Dendreon will notify the FDA and all participating principal investigators of any AE associated 
with the use of study treatments that is serious, unexpected and at least possibly related.  Such 
notification will be provided within 15 calendar days after Dendreon’s initial receipt of the 
information.  If the event was fatal or life threatening, FDA will be notified no later than 7 days 
after Dendreon’s initial receipt of the report. 
The FDA will be notified of all deaths occurring within 30 days of sipuleucel-T infusion, 
regardless of causality, via a written IND Safety Report. 
Serious AEs that are attributable to disease progression will be considered expected, and, 
therefore, will not be reported by Dendreon on an expedited basis. 
7.4 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured on the AE CRF or SAE Report Form 
as appropriate:

 Any clinically significant result that is not part of another reported clinical diagnosis. 
 Any result that meets the definition of an SAE. 
 Any result leading to study drug discont inuation or interruption. 
 Any result that required therapeutic intervention or a change in subject management. 
Laboratory abnormalities not meeting the above conditions will not be reported on the AE CRF 
or SAE report form. 
7.4.1 Safety Monitoring and Enrollment Suspension 
An internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be notified within 48 hours of AEs with an 
outcome of death and nonfatal AEs with Grade ≥ 3 toxicity and that are at least possibly related 
to the study treatment.  Consideration will be given to suspending enrollment to an arm for any 
of the following: 
 An AE with an outcome of death which is at least possibly related to the study 
trea
tment(s). 
 The occurrence of nonfatal AEs with Grade ≥ 3 toxicities (with the exception of Grade 3 
chills, pyrexia, fatigue, or asthenia) which are at least possibly related to study 
treatment(s) in more than 3 of the first 10 subjects enrolled in an arm, or in more than 
30% of subjects in an arm at any time beyond enrollment of 10 subjects in that arm.  
If enrollment is suspended in either arm, study treatments will be discontinued in all subjects 
meeting any of the criteria for stopping treatment (Section  4.3), but may be continued in all other 
subjects.  Enrollment to the suspended arm will resume only with concurrence of the DMC and 
FDA. 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 General Considerations  
This Phase 2 randomized, open-label study is designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel-T when 
administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide.  Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 
either the concurrent arm or the sequential arm, stratified by PSA levels (≥ 25 ng/mL, yes or no) 
and LDH levels (≥ 200 IU/L, yes or no).  In general, data will be summarized in aggregate and 
by treatment arm.  All statistical tests will be performed at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 47 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential unless otherwise noted.  Nominal p-values will be provided with no multiplicity adjustment for 
secondary or exploratory endpoints. 
8.2 Sample Size Determination 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms for 
immune response over time evaluated using PA2024-stimulated T cell proliferation via tritiated-
thymidine uptake.  The PA2024 proliferation responses over time will be compared between the 
concurrent arm and sequential arm using a repeated measurement analysis.  With 43 subjects per 
treatment arm (concurrent and s equential), there is 90% power to detect a 2.0 fold difference in 
mean response between the arms at any time point assuming a coefficient of variation of 1.25.  
To allow for drop-outs and subjects who may not receive 3 infusions of sipuleucel-T or at least 
10 weeks of enzalutamide, 50 subjects per arm will be enrolled.  Coefficients of variation for 
proliferation responses ranging from 0.69 to 1.40 depending on visit have been observed in a 
recent trial of sipuleucel-T in a similar population (data on file). 
8.3 Populations for Analyses 
The immune response population will be defined as subjects who receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T and 10 or more weeks of enzalutamide.  Analysis of immune response endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, will be performed using this population.  This population will 
also be used to perform supplementary analyses of nonimmune response efficacy endpoints.  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects, regardless of whether 
they received treatment.  Analysis of nonimmune response efficacy endpoints will be performed 
using this analysis population. 
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 leukapheresis procedure or 
receive at least 1 dose of enzalutamide.  All safety variables (e.g., AEs, laboratory data, and vital 
sign data) will be analyzed based on the safety population. 
8.4 Endpoints 
8.4.1 Primary Endpoint(s) 
The primary endpoint is peripheral PA2024-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel- T 
over time as measured via a T cell stimulation index from a proliferation assay.  This endpoint 
was selected because it has demonstrated the highest signal to noise ratio of all the T cell assays 
Dendreon has evaluated in prior studies of sipuleucel-T (data on file).  
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 48 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential 8.4.2 Secondary Endpoint(s) 
Immune responses over time for ELISPOT and ELISA are secondary endpoints as are peripheral 
PAP-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a T cell stimulation index 
from a proliferation assay, and cytokine production by Luminex assay.  Additionally, responder 
analyses by time point will be performed for the data generated from the proliferation assays, 
ELISPOT, and ELISA.  A positive response will be defined as having a post-baseline result 
exceeding a threshold value, determined on the basis of baseline and historical sipuleucel-T data, 
that ensures a sufficiently low false positive rate (i.e., 5% or less) for each immune response 
parameter.  The threshold will be antigen and assay dependent.   
Time to PSA progression is defined as: 1) the time from randomization to PSA progression, and 
2) the time from first enzalutamide treatment to PSA progression.  Those subjects who do not 
experience PSA progression will be censored in the analysis at the date of their last PSA 
assessment.  PSA progression, based on the randomization date (i.e., definition 1) will be defined 
for those subjects who experience a decline in PSA compared to baseline as the date that a 25% 
or greater increase in PSA and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is 
documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later ( Scher 2008 ).  
For those subjects who do not experience a decline in PSA compared to baseline, PSA 
progression is defined as the date a 25% or greater increase from the baseline value along with 
an increase in absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more after 12 weeks of enzalutamide treatment 
(Scher 2008).  PSA progression based on the first enzalutamide treatment (i.e., definition 2) will 
be defined in a similar manner except the most recent PSA value prior to the first enzalutamide 
treatment will be used as the baseline value. 
PSA progression time, based on the randomization date, will be calculated as follows for those 
subjects with PSA progression:  
Progression time (days) = [(PSA progression date) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
PSA progression time, based on the randomization date, will be calculated as follows for subjects 
who are censored:  
PSA progression time (days) = [last PSA assessment date –  (randomization date)] + 1. 
PSA progression time based on the first enzalutamide treatment will be defined in a similar 
manner except the first enzalutamide treatment date will be used instead of the randomization 
date. 
Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.  Those 
subjects alive at the time of database cut-off or lost to follow-up will be censored in the analysis 
at the earlier of the cut-off date or the day of their last documented visit or contact date. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 49 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Overall survival time will be calculated as follows for subjects who died prior to data cut-off:  
Survival time (days) = [(death date) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
Overall survival time will be calculated as follows for subjects who are censored: 
Survival time (days) = [(last contact date) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
8.4.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
The time to next anticancer intervention is defined as the time from randomization to the first 
anticancer intervention.  Those subjects without an anticancer intervention will be censored at 
their last follow-up assessment when anticancer therapy information is collected. 
The time to first opioid use for cancer-related pain is defined as the time from randomization to 
the first use of an opioid for cancer-related pain.  Those subjects without a record of opioid use 
for cancer-related pain will be censored at their last follow-up assessment when opioid use for 
cancer-related pain is collected. 
The time to first ECOG performance status decline (i.e., increase in numerical value of ECOG 
performance status) is  defined as the time from randomization to the first decline in ECOG 
performance status by 1 point or more.  Those subjects without an ECOG performance status 
decline will be censored at their last follow-up assessment for ECOG performance status. 
8.5 Analyses 
8.5.1 Subject Disposition 
Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment group for the ITT population.  This 
summary will include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
 Number of subjects randomized. 
 Number of subjects infused. 
 Number of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study (i.e., refused further study 
assessments [with the possible exception of survival status]). 
 Reason(s) for premature discontinuation from the study. 
 Number of subjects who died. 
 Cause of death summary.

Proprietary and Confidential 
 Number of subjects in the immune response and safety analysis sets. 
In addition, the number of subjects screened for the trial will be summarized for the overall study 
population. 
8.5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic information and baseline disease information and characteristics will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics for all analysis populations and compared between 
treatment groups using the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for 
categorical variables. 
8.5.3 Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis will consist of a repeated measurement analysis of immune 
response over time evaluated using PA2024-stimulated T cell proliferation via tritiated-
thymidine uptake based on the immune response population.  The logarithm of response will be 
used for
 analysis.  Fixed effect terms in the model will include treatment arm, visit as a class 
effect, and treatment by visit interaction.  The correlation of responses across time within a 
subject will be modeled using several candidate variance-covariance structures including 
unstructured, compound symmetry, heterogeneous compound symmetry, autoregressive (1), and 
heterogeneous autoregressive (1).  The variance-covariance structure providing the smallest 
Bayesian information criteria will be selected for the final model.  Fixed effect terms in the 
model will be tested for significance using type III sums of squares.  The formal test for 
difference between the treatment arms will be based on the p-value for the treatment arm effect 
unless a significant treatment by visit interaction (p < 0.05) is observed, in which case by-visit 
treatment comparisons will be made using appropriate contrast statements.  Estimates of 
treatment effect and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided on the ratio 
scale obtained by exponentiation of the model derived treatment effect and CI on the logarithm 
scale.  Immune responses over time for other assays will be analyzed using identical methods 
described for the primary efficacy analysis except for the ELISPOT,  which will be analyzed 
using ranks instead of on the logarithm scale. 
The response rate for each assay and for each antigen will be compared between treatment arms 
at each visit using Fisher’s exact test based on the immune response population.  In addition, 
analyses will be performed modeling response rates over time using appropriate methods to 
account for the correlation of responses over time within a subject. 
Time to PSA progression will be compared between the treatment arms using a Cox regression 
model with terms for treatment, baseline PSA (logarithm scale), and baseline LDH (logarithm 
scale) in the model based on the ITT population.  The estimated HR of the treatment effect and

Proprietary and Confidential its 2-sided, 95% CI, using the sequential arm as the denominator will be provided.  The 
percentage of subjects free of PSA progression with an associated 95% CI at landmark time 
points such as 6 and 12 months will be provided by treatment arm as well as pooled over 
treatment arms using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Overall survival, time to next anticancer intervention, time to first chemotherapy, time to first 
cancer-related opioid use, and time to first ECOG performance status decline will be analyzed in 
a similar manner as described for time to PSA progression. 
8.5.4 Safety Analyses 
Safety data will be summarized descriptively in aggregate and by treatment group within the 
safety population. No formal statistical testing is planned for the safety data. 
8.5.4.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be summarized and listed by treatment arm and by the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, by preferred term within each system organ class.  
Summary tables will include all AEs reported in the treatment arms from the first leukapheresis 
or enzalutamide dose.  Summaries to be produced include the following: 
 Incidence within system organ class (MedDRA). 
 Incidence by decreasing frequency. 
 Incidence by NCI CTCAE severity grade, by decreasing frequency. 
 Incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs, by decreasing frequency. 
 Incidence of SAEs. 
 Incidence of AEs within 1 day of infusion. 
 Incidence of AEs that resulted in premature discontinuation of study treatments.  
Adverse events that occur multiple times for a subject will be counted only once per subject in 
incidence summary tables.  In tables that enumerate AEs by severity, only the greatest severity 
for an AE occurring multiple times for a subject will be counted. 
8.5.4.2 Laboratory Data 
Summaries of laboratory data collected from baseline until study completion will include: 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 52 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential 
 Incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities by NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 
(NCI 2010 ).  A clinically significant laboratory toxicity is defined as a post-baseline grade 3 
or higher toxicity where the baseline value was grade 2 or lower. 
 Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for 
laboratory values and their change from baseline by time point.  
Baseline results will be defined as the most recent nonmissing value obtained on or prior to the 
randomization date. 
8.5.4.3 Vital Signs 
Vital sign data (blood pressure, respiration rate, heart rate, and body temperature) will be 
summarized descriptively by time point. 
8.5.5 Study Treatment Administration 
Leukapheresis and sipuleucel-T infusion information will be summarized by treatment group.  
This will include the following: 
 Number of subjects who received a total of 0, 1, 2, or 3 infusions. 
 Reason(s) for not completing 3 infusions.  
 Number of subjects who receive a total of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more leukaphereses. 
 Number of subjects who receive a total of 3 leukaphereses and 3 infusions.  
The duration of treatment with enzalutamide will be summarized by treatment group.  The 
percent compliance with enzalutamide treatment will be computed as the number of pills taken 
divided by the expected number of pills to be taken and will be summarized by treatment group. 
8.5.6 Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
Concomitant medications and procedures will be presented in data listings by treatment group 
and will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionar y.  A summary table will 
be provided by treatment group and for all subjects combined.  Separate summaries will be 
provided for medications that were started prior to randomization and for medications started 
after randomization.

Use of select anticancer treatments during the study will be summarized by treatment group.  
This summary will include types of therapies used and will be based on the ITT population. 
Data from sipuleucel-T lot release assessments will be summarized.  Data to be summarized 
include CD54 upregulation, CD54+ cell count, and TNC count.  These data will be summarized 
descriptively by infusion (1, 2, and 3) and cumulative (summed across infusions).  Cumulative 
lot release assessment data will be compared between both arms using a t-test on the logarithm 
scale based on the immune response analysis population. 
Prostate specific antigen data, including change from baseline, will be summarized descriptively 
by treatment arm at each time point for the ITT population.  Additionally, the maximal decline of 
serum PSA from baseline at any time point will be summarized using waterfall plots. Baseline 
will be defined as the value collected immediately prior to the registration PSA value.  
Additional analyses of PSA will be performed using the most recent PSA value prior to the 
initiation of enzalutamide as the baseline value. 
8.6 Interim Analyses 
No formal interim analysis will be performed in this study.  For this open-label study, descriptive 
summaries of safety assessments and immune response parameters may be generated on a 
periodic basis.

y, and other endpoints should a difference of opinion exist. 
10.4 Monitoring 
A representative from Dendreon will visit the clinical trial site periodically to monitor adherence 
to the protocol, adherence to applicable FDA regulations, and the maintenance of adequate and 
accurate records.  Case report forms will be reviewed to ensure that key safety and efficacy data 
are reported as specified by the protocol.  The Dendreon representative must be permitted to 
access subjects’ complete medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation as 
needed to appropriately monitor the trial. 
10.5 Quality Assurance 
Dendreon Quality Assurance may arrange to visit the clinical trial site to audit the performance 
of the study and the study documents originating at the site.  The audit may be conducted by a 
Dendreon representative or designee.  The principal investigator will be informed of the outcome 
of the audit. 
In addition, inspections by health authority representatives and/or the IRB are possible at any 
time.  The investigator must inform Dendreon of any such inspection immediately.

APPENDIX 4 : INFUSION GUIDELINES 
Preinfusion Procedures 
DO NOT OPEN THE CLIMATE-CONTROLLED INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE 
SHIPPING PACKAGE UNTIL THE INFUSION STAFF IS READY TO INFUSE. 
DO NOT INFUSE SIPULEUCEL-T UNTIL YOU RECEIVE WRITTEN APPROVAL 
SIGNED BY THE IMMUNOTHERAPY MANUFACTURING FACILITY (IMF) 
QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) PERSONNEL VIA THE CLINICAL CELL PRODUC T 
DISPOSITION FORM (CPDF). 
Delivery Time Notification 
A courier service contracted by Dendreon arranges and provides transportation of sipuleucel- T 
from the IMF to the clinical trial site infusion center. 
When the manufacturing schedule is determined for each subject, Dendreon Clinical Scheduling 
forwards a Subject Schedule Report to the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), indicating the 
approximate delivery times for all 3 infusions.  The CRC is contacted immediately if there is a 
change in delivery time. 
Sipuleucel-T Shipping, Receipt, and Storage 
Sipuleucel-T is transported to the infusion center in an insulated polyurethane container.  
Sipuleucel-T must remain in the original, unopened shipping package, which is designed to 
maintain sipuleucel-T at 2ºC to 8°C until it is infused.  Quality control testing is performed on 
each sipuleucel-T product.  Due to shipping logistics and expiration times, sipuleucel-T is 
routinely shipped to the infusion center before required QC release testing is complete.  
Dendreon’s QA personnel review the results and issue a written release called the CPDF, 
indicating whether the sipuleucel-T is “Approved” or “Rejected” for infusion, or if 
manufacturing was “Terminated” in process.     
The CPDF is faxed to the infusion center or pharmacy.  Upon receipt, the pharmacy, infusion 
staff, or CRC completes the section of the CPDF marked “Infusion Site Use Only” and faxes it to 
Dendreon at the number provided on the form.  This notifies Dendreon that the CPDF was 
received.  
If the sipuleucel-T does not meet Dendreon quality specifications and is rejected or terminated, 
Dendreon Clinical Scheduling contacts the clinical trial site to notify them of the sipuleucel- T 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 67 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential rejection or termination.  If necessary, Dendreon Clinical Scheduling arranges for the return to 
the IMF of any delivered and rejected or terminated sipuleucel-T.  Dendreon Clinical Scheduling 
will also reschedule the subject as necessary.  The clinical trial site may also contact the 
Dendreon medical monitor for additional information regarding a sipuleucel-T rejection or 
termination.    
Subject Preparation for Infusion  
It is recommended subjects are premedicated approximately 30 minutes prior to infusion with 
650mg acetaminophen orally and an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine 50mg orally. 
Obtain the subject’s vital signs within 1 to 30 minutes prior to the start of the infusion.  
Document the subject’s blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respirations in his medical 
record.  
Sipuleucel-T Inspection and Expiration Time 
When the infusion staff and subject are ready for the infusion, open the polyurethane container 
and inspect the sipuleucel-T and the Final Product Label (FPL) affixed to the sipuleucel-T bag.  
The sipuleucel-T expiration time is indicated on the CPDF and on the FPL.  The expiration 
time is noted in the time zone of the infusion center.  Contact Dendreon Clinical Scheduling 
immediately if the expiration times on both documents do not match .  Confirm the infusion 
will begin prior to the sipuleucel-T expiration time noted on the CPDF and the FPL.  If 
sipuleucel-T administration cannot begin prior to the expiration time shown on the label, do not 
infuse and contact Dendreon Clinical Scheduling for further instructions. 
Occasionally, there is a delay in obtaining the CPDF due to operational or technical reasons. 
 If Dendreon indicates the CPDF is imminently pending, it is acceptable to administer the 
recommended premedications 30 minutes prior to the sipuleucel-T expiration time.     
 If a CPDF marked “Approved” is obtained within 30 minutes prior to the sipuleucel- T 
expiration time, it is acceptable to administer the recommended antihistamine intravenously 
rather than orally, in order to achieve higher systemic concentrations at the time the infusion 
is initiated. 
Two different infusion center staff members must confirm the subject identifiers (name, initials, 
subject number, and lot or chain of identity [COI] number) on the CPDF and FPL match the 
intended subject.  Document this verification process in the subject’s medical record.  If any 
information on the CPDF or FPL is incorrect or is inconsistent, contact Dendreon Clinical 
Scheduling and do not infuse  the sipuleucel-T until the discrepancy is resolved.   
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 68 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential The contents of the sipuleucel-T bag are generally slightly cloudy, with a cream- to-pink color.  
Examine the sipuleucel-T bag for leakage.  Gently re-suspend the contents by slowly rocking the 
bag back and forth, inspecting for clumps and clots.  Small clumps of cellular material should 
disperse with gentle manual mixing. 
If the sipuleucel-T bag leaks or if clumps remain in the bag do not infuse and contact the 
Dendreon Clinical Safety line.  
Sipuleucel-T Infusion Supplies 
Use a large-bore intravenous (IV) line suitable for blood transfusions to infuse sipuleucel-T; 18- 
or 20-gauge is recommended, but 22-gauge may be used when necessary.  The typical IV tubing 
set used for sipuleucel-T infusions has a universal spike, a 10-20 drip/mL macro-drip chamber 
WITHOUT a cell filter, and a minimum of one injection port.  An infusion pump may be used, 
but is not required, to ensure the rate of infusion is controlled.   
Infusion Procedures 
DO NOT INFUSE SIPULEUCEL-T PRIOR TO RECEIPT OF A CPDF INDICATING 
SIPULEUCEL-T IS APPROVED FOR INFUSION.  
Sipuleucel-T Infusion 
Infuse sipuleucel-T over the shortest period that is well tolerated but not less than 60 minutes.  
Record the infusion start and stop times in the subject’s medical record.  
If the subject develops an acute infusion reaction, slow the infusion and consult the section 
below on “Managing Acute Infusion Reactions” for recommendations regarding administration 
of additional medications.  It may not be necessary to immediately discontinue the infusion. 
If the infusion of sipuleucel-T is interrupted, do not resume the infusion if the sipuleucel-T bag 
will be held at room temperature for more than 3 hours following removal from the shipping 
container.  Record all sipuleucel-T infusion re-start and stop times in the subject’s medical 
record. 
Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Documentation 
Record all concomitant medications administered to the subject and all AEs. 
Document all concomitant medications administered, including all premedications, using the 
generic drug names, doses, routes, frequencies, indications, and start and stop dates in the 
subject’s medical record. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 69 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Describe any AEs, including start and stop dates (and duration if less than 24 hours), whether or 
not the event was serious, severity (based on the NCI CTCAE), relationship to sipuleucel- T 
(none, possible, or probable), and the outcome in the subject’s medical record. 
Refer to Section  7.0 of the protocol for more information regarding AEs and SAEs, including 
reporting requirements. 
Post-infusion Procedures 
Subject Follow- up 
Observe the subject for at least 30 minutes after the infusion.  Obtain vital signs within 30 
minutes (± 10 min) after completion of the infusion.  Document the subject’s blood pressure, 
heart rate, temperature, and respirations in the subject’s medical record. 
Documentation 
Retain the original CPDF and file it in the subject’s medical record. 
Sipuleucel-T Return or Disposal 
Dispose of the sipuleucel-T bag and tubing according to institutional procedures for disposal of 
biohazardous waste that contains human blood.  Dispose of all packaging materials and gel packs 
appropriately.  
If instructed by Dendreon to return the sipuleucel-T, place the remaining sipuleucel-T in the 
original shipping box with the packaging materials and ship per Dendreon instructions. 
Managing Acute Infusion Reactions 
Refer to the current sipuleucel- T IB for a complete list of acute infusion reactions, including 
severity.  Some common acute infusion reactions, such as pyrexia and/or rigors (chills), may 
warrant slowing of the infusion rate.  If acute infusion reactions occur, the current infusion tim e 
and subsequent infusion times can be increased up to a total infusion time of 1.5 to 2.0 hours.  If 
the infusion of sipuleucel-T is interrupted, do not resume the infusion if the sipuleucel-T bag will 
be held at room temperature for more than 3 hours following removal from the shipping 
container.   
For subjects who experience a significant acute infusion reaction, including rigors, during or 
immediately following an infusion, the following guidelines may be helpful: 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 70 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential 1. As prophylaxis during subsequent infusions, the dose or intensity of the recommended 
premedications may be increased. For instance, acetaminophen may be given at a higher 
oral dose than used previously and an IV rather than oral antihistamine may be 
administered.  In addition, IV administration of an H 2 antagonist may be considered as an 
additional premedication. 
2. A narcotic such as meperidine may be used as treatment for an AE or as prophylaxis 
during subsequent infusions.   
3. Additional or other premedications may be considered according to institutional practices 
and/or local standards of care.  Steroids should not be used for premedication or 
treatment during sipuleucel-T infusions.  The use of steroids may suppress any 
immune response elicited by sipuleucel- T. 
4. For severe acute infusion reactions supportive care measures such as supplemental 
oxygen, bronchodilator therapy for wheezing, and epinephrine should be used as 
clinically indicated.

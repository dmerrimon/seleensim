SYNOPSIS  
Name of Investigational Product:   Epacadostat (INCB0 24360) 
Title of Study:   A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of Epacadostat in 
Combination With Pembrolizumab and Chemotherapy in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid 
Tumors (ECHO-207/KEYNOTE-723) 
Protocol Number:   INCB  24360-207 Study Phase:   1/2 
Indication:   Advanced or metastatic solid tumors (Phase 1); advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non –small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial 
carcinoma (UC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), or any advanced or metastatic solid tumor that progressed on previous therapy with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor (Phase 2)  
Primary Objectives:  
• Phase 1:   To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to define a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or pharmacologically active dose (PAD) of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid 
tumors. 
• Phase 2:  To evaluate the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab  and 
chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic CRC, PDAC, NSCLC, UC, SCCHN, or any 
advanced or metastatic solid tumor who progressed on previous therapy with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor 
by assessing objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1.  
Secondary Objectives: 
• Phase 1:  To explore the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy 
in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors by assessing ORR per RECIST v1.1. 
• Phase 2:  To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat at the MTD and/or PAD in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in subjects with selected advanced or metastati c 
solid tumors.

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
Primary Endpoints:  
• Phase 1:  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring frequency, durat ion, and severity of 
adverse events (AEs) through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and through clinical laboratory blood and urine sample evaluations. 
• Phase 2:  ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects having a complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR), will be determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Phase 1:  ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects having a CR or PR, will be dete rmined by 
investigator assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1.  
• Phase 2:  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring frequency, duration, and severity of AEs through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs and ECG s, and through 
clinical laboratory blood and urine sample evaluations. 
Overall Study Design:  
Note:  As of 25 OCT 2018, this study is closed to enrollment.  As of this date, no subjects were enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) or Phase 2 mandatory biopsy 
Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G.  Any t ext included in this Protocol synopsis that references these 
treatment groups and cohorts has not been deleted but should be disregarded.  
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of epacadost at when given in combination with pembrolizumab and 7 chemotherapy regimens.  Phase 1 
will consist of a 3 + 3 + 3 design and will determine the MTD or PAD of epacadostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy; efficacy will also be explored.  Subjects with 
advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed after receiving at least 1 previous standard 
therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (or who are intolerant to or refuse standard of care) and for whom treatment with 1 of t he chemotherapy regimens is appropriate will be enrolled in Phase 1.  Phase 2 
will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the MTD or PAD of epacadostat selected in Phase 1 when given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.  Subjects with advanced or 
metastatic CRC, PDAC, NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous), UC, or SCCHN who have not previously 
received chemotherapy as first -line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease and have not previously 
received immune checkpoint inhibitors nor an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor will be 
enrolled in Phase 2.  A separate cohort of subjects with any advanced or metastatic solid tumor who 
progressed on previous therapy with a PD-1 or PD- L1 inhibitor  will also be enrolled in Phase 2. 
Phase 1:  
A 3 + 3 + 3 design will be used in which 7 treatment groups will be explored in parallel.  A minimum of 
3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each treatment group beginning with Cohort 1 (epacadostat 
100 mg  twice daily [BID]; starting dose), and the first 3 evaluable subjects will be observed for a 
minimum of 28 days in the cohorts where mFOLFOX6 or nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine are administered or 
21 days for all other chemotherapy regimens.   To be considered evaluable for dose tolerability, sub jects 
should meet 1 of the following criteria:  1) received the cohort- specified dose of epacadostat, 
pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy for at least 80% of planned doses in the DLT observation period

(45 doses epacadostat/2 doses pembrolizumab for subjects w ho received mFOLFOX6 or 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine; 34 doses epacadostat/1 dose pembrolizumab for subjects who received any 
other chemotherapy regimens) and completed the DLT observation period or 2) had a DLT during the 
DLT observation period.  It is reco gnized that certain toxicities due to chemotherapy (eg, including but 
not limited to gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea; renal insufficiency; high -grade laboratory 
abnormalities; hypersensitivity/rash) may initially be clinically indistinguishab le from toxicities due to 
immunotherapy.  Epacadostat will be held for these toxicities, and as a result, subjects may not receive at 
least 80% of the prescribed dose during Cycle 1.  In these cases, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) 
may assess subject s who receive dose intensities somewhat below 80% for the determination of DLTs, 
and consider in the adjudication process the specific toxicities encountered, likely cause of toxicities, and 
dose intensity and tolerability beyond Cycle 1.  Additional subje cts will be enrolled in a cohort to achieve 
the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects.  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than a DLT (eg, events clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, concomitant medication, comorbidity, or an AE clearly unrelated to treatment) during the DLT observation period will be considered 
nonevaluable for DLTs and will be replaced.  
The scenarios for expansion and de- escalation and the doses of epacadostat to be evaluated are 
summarized below: 
1. If 0 DL Ts occur in 3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 additional subjects will be treated in Cohort 1.  If there is 
≤ 1 DLT in these 6 subjects, enrollment in Phase 2 for that treatment group may proceed.  
2. If 1 of 3 subjects in Cohort 1 has a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  If there 
are no additional DLTs (≤ 1 DLT in 6 subjects), enrollment in Phase 2 for that treatment group may 
proceed. 
3. If 2 of 6 subjects in Cohort 1 have a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  If there are no additional DLTs (≤ 2 DLTs in 9 subjects), enrollment in Phase 2 for that treatment group may 
proceed. 
4. If ≥ 2 of 3, 3 of 6, or 3 of 9 subjects have DLTs within a cohort, de- escalation of epacadostat to 
50 mg  BID (Cohort ‒1) will be evaluated using the same criteria. 
If Cohort ‒1 is not tolerated within a given treatment group, that treatment group will not be pursued 
further.  The study will be terminated if Cohort ‒1 is not tolerated in all treatment groups.

2. PDAC ( Treatment Group B:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine ):  Simon 
2-Stage design  
3. Squamous NSCLC (Treatment Group C:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + paclitaxel /carboplatin ) 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 7 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
4. Nonsquamous NSCLC ( Treatment Group D:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + pemetrexed /platinum 
agent ) 
5. Any solid tumor that progressed on previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD-L1 inhibitor (Treatment Group 
E:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + cyclophosphamide) 
6. UC ( Treatment Group F:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab+ gemcitabine/platinum agent) 
7. SCCHN ( Treatment Group G:   epacadostat + pembrolizumab+ platinum agent/5-fluorouracil)  
Enrollment in a specific efficacy expansion cohort in Phase 2 may begin after a minimum of 6 subjects 
have been treated with epacadostat 100 mg BID in the corresponding treatment group in Phase 1 and 
there is ≤ 1 DLT in these 6 subjects. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be performed in the efficacy expansion cohorts.  If the 
cumulative incidence of treatment- related serious AEs (SAEs) is > 40% and/or the cumulative incidence 
of ≥ Grade  3 immune- related AEs is >  40% after 10 subjects are enrolled in a specific Phase 2 efficacy 
expansion cohort, further enrollment in that cohort will be interrupted until the sponsor, investigators, and 
health authorities (if applicable) determine an appropriate course of action.  If an efficacy expansion 
cohort is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort may be initiated at a lower dose of epacadostat. 
In addition to the efficacy expansion cohorts listed above, separate mandatory biopsy cohorts will be enrolled to evaluate changes in the tumor microenviron ment.  For the cohorts where IV chemotherapy is 
administered, subjects will receive IV chemotherapy only during Cycle 1 followed by epacadostat + pembrolizumab + IV chemotherapy starting with Cycle 2 Day 1.  For the CRC and PDAC cohorts, a 
minimum of 10 subjects with evaluable paired biopsy specimens will be enrolled.  A fresh tumor biopsy will be collected during screening.  On -treatment biopsies are mandatory and will be collected between 
Days 21 and 27 of Cycle 1 (IV chemotherapy only) and Cycle 2 (epacadostat + pembrolizumab + IV chemotherapy).  For subjects with squamous NSCLC, nonsquamous NSCLC, UC , or SCCHN, a 
minimum of 10 subjects with evaluable paired biopsy specimens will be enrolled.  A fresh tumor biopsy will be collected during screening.  On -treatment biopsies are mandatory and will be collected between 
Days 14 and 20 of Cycle 1 (IV chemotherapy only) and Days 7 and 13 of Cycle 3 (epacadostat + 
pembrolizumab + IV chemotherapy).  For subjects with any advanced or metastatic solid tumor that 
progressed on previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitor, a minimum of 5 subjects with evaluable 
paired biopsy specimens will be enrolled in the mandatory biopsy cohort; however, this cohort will be administered epacadostat, cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  A fresh tumor biopsy will be collected during screening, and an on- treatment biopsy is mandatory and will be 
collected between Days 7 and 13 of Cycle 3. 
If a subject is selected for inclusion in the mandatory biopsy cohort , and it is subsequently determined that 
tumor tissue cannot safely be obtained, or the biopsy does not meet the minimum standards for evaluation 
(as outlined in the Laboratory Manual), the subject may still enroll in the mandatory biopsy cohort and will b e followed for efficacy and safety.  The subject may be replaced in order to enroll sufficient 
numbers of subjects with paired biopsies.   
Note:   As of 25 OCT 2018, on- treatment tumor biopsies are no longer required for subjects who are 
already enrolled in the mandatory biopsy cohorts.

Study Schedule/Procedures:  
The study c omprises the following parts:  
• Screening:   Up to 28 days before enrollment.  Screening will begin at the time that the subject signs the 
informed consent and will continue until the date the subject is enrolled in the study received the first dose of treatm ent in the study (Cycle  1 Day  1). 
• Treatment:  Begins on the day that the subject receives the first dose of treatment in the study on Cycle  1 Day 1  and may continue in 28- day cycles (mFOLFOX6 or nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine ) or 
21-day cycles (all other chemo therapy regimens) ; additional site visits will occur during each cycle.  
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits on Day 1 (± 3 days) of each cycle.  Additional study 
visits may be required during some cycles for safety, efficacy,  assessments as 
described below. 
• End of treatment:  Occurs when the subject permanently discontinues epacadostat and pembrolizumab 
(+ 7 days).  
• Safety follow -up:  30 days (± 7 days)  and 90 days (± 7 days) after the EOT  visit . 
Note:   As of Amendment 7 , disease status (if applicable) and survival follow-up visits are no longer 
required.  The last study visit will be the 90 -day safety follow -up visit.  
Safety Assessments 
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7 , the only safety data that will be collected will be related  to SAEs  and 
AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment .  All safety procedures should be per standard of care 
for pembrolizumab and will not be collected in the database .  Therefore , only safety labs required 
for pembrolizumab should be conducted at each  cycle.  No other assessments outside of standard of 
care are required . 
Regular telephone conferences with study investigators will be scheduled by the sponsor in order to review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, agree on dose de-escalation, ad judicate individual 
high-grade AEs as potentially dose-limiting, and guide other major study decisions during Phase 1 and 
until the last subject has been treated for 3 months. 
Efficacy Assessments 
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7 , no further efficacy assessment w ill be required beyond Week 18.  
Imaging for the study will only be required at W eek 9 and Week 18 per RECIST v1.1.  Imaging should 
continue per standard of care for pembrolizumab after Week 18.  If the subject has radiographic progression, they may have t he option to continue treatment until confirmation of progression at least 
4 weeks later (but no later than 6  weeks) where feasible,  provided that the subject meets the definition of 
clinical stability defined as follows:  
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) 
indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 16 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease.  
• Absence of progressive tumors at critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention.  
Estimated Duration of Participation:  
Up to 28 days for screening, continuous treatment in consecutive 28-day (mFOLFOX6 and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine ) or 21 -day cycles (all other chemotherapy regimens) as long as subjects are 
receiving benefit and do not met any criteria for discontinuation of epacadostat  and pembrolizumab, and 
30 and 90 days for safety follow -up.  Study participation, including post- treatment follow -up, is expected 
to average 16  months for an individual subject. 
Estimated Number of Subj ects:   Up to 421 subjects may be enrolled in the study.  
Phase 1 – Approximately 42 to 126 evaluable subjects  
Phase 2 (Efficacy Expansion + Mandatory Biopsy) – Approx imately 237 to 295 evaluable subjects. 
As of 25 OCT 2018, this study is  closed to enrollmen t. 
A total of 70 subjects have been enrolled.  No subjects were enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion 
(all treatment groups) or Phase 2 mandatory biopsy Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G. 
Estimated Number of Study Sites:  Approximately 25 sites

Statistical Methods:  
As of 25 OCT 2018, no subjects were enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) 
or Phase 2 mandatory biopsy Treatment Groups A,  B, F, and G.  Any text included in this Protocol 
synopsis  that references these treatment groups and cohorts has not been deleted but should be 
disregarded.  
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, 7-parallel treatment group, Phase 1/2 study.  Phase 1 consis ts of a 
3 + 3 + 3 design for each of the 7 treatment groups.  A minimum of 6 and up to 9 subjects will be enrolled 
in each dose level.  The total number of subjects for Phase 1  will depend on the frequency of DLTs and 
the number of dose levels tested befor e the MTD or PAD is reached.  
Phase 2 consis ts of expansion cohorts (efficacy and mandatory biopsy) in specific tumor types (advanced 
or metastatic CRC, PDAC, squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC, UC, SCCHN, or any advanced or metastatic solid tumor that progress ed on previous therapy with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor).  A Simon 
2-stage design will be used for the CRC and PDAC efficacy expansion cohorts.  A single- stage design 
will be used for all other efficacy expansion cohorts.  The response rates for the historic al control (p
0), 
desired response rates for the combination (p 1), number of subjects needed in Stage 1 (n 1) and Stage 2 
(n2), total number of subjects (n), first-stage threshold declaring cohort undesirable (r 1), and the 
upper-limit of the number of responses in n subjects such that futility of the drug is concluded (r) are 
provided for each expansion cohort in the table below.  
Values for the CRC, PDAC, squamous NSCLC, and nonsquamous NSCLC, UC, and SCCHN efficacy 
expansion cohorts are calculated based on a 1-sided Type I error of 0.1 and power of 80%; values for the cohort enrolling solid tumors that progressed on prior PD- 1/PD -L1 therapy are based on a 1- sided Type I 
error of 0.1 and power of approximately 98%. 
Tumor Type  p0 p1 n1 n2 n r1 r 
CRC  40% 60% 12 26 38 5 18 
PDAC  25% 45% 15 12 27 4 9 
Squamous NSCLC  30% 50% - - 33 - 13 
Nonsquamous NSCLC  50% 70% - - 33 - 20 
Solid tumors that progressed on previous 
therapy with a PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitor  5% 25% - - 33 - 3 
UC 60% 80% - - 33 - 23 
SCCHN  50% 70% - - 33 - 20 
In addition to the efficacy expansion cohorts listed above, separate mandatory biopsy cohorts will be enrolled to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment.  Assuming the true rate of subjects positive 
for the biomarker is 50%, the probabilit y of observing ≥ 4 subjects out of 10 with the biomarker is 83% 
for CRC, PDAC, squamous NSCLC, nonsquamous NSCLC, UC, and SCCHN cohorts, and the probability of observing ≥ 2 subjects out of 5 with the biomarker is 81% for previous PD-1 or PD- L1 
inhibitor therapy cohort. 
All statistical analyses are exploratory in nature.  Descriptive statistics will be derived where appropriate.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum for each cohort.  Categorical endpoints will be summarized with frequency and 
percentage for each cohort.  If data warrants, ORR will be estimated with 95% exact confidence interval.  
Safety Monitoring Committee: 
Due to the complexity of the study, an SMC will review safety data at regular intervals throughout the 
study .  Details regarding membership, roles, and responsibilities of the committee are specified in the 
SMC charter.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Role of the Immune System in Cancer  
Targeting the immune system is a proven and effective approach for the treatment of cancer , and 
immunotherapy is now an accepted standard of care in several tumor types.  The blocking of 
immune cell coinhibitor y receptors such as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte –associated protein 4 
(CTLA -4) by ipilimumab, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD- L1) by atezolizumab , avelumab , or 
durvalumab provide a critical mechanis m for redirecting the host immune response against the 
tumor ( Chen and Mellman 2013).  Although these agents have antitumor activity when 
administered as monotherapy, multiple immune inhibitory mechanisms are present concur rently 
within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that combination therapies may be required for 
optimal therapeutic effect ( Quezada and Peggs 2013). 
1.1.1. Inhibition of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 as a Target for Cancer 
Recent interest has focused on the role of indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 ( IDO1 ) as a 
mechanism of induction of tolerance to malignancy ( Godin- Ethier et al 2011).  IDO1  is a 
heme-containing, monomeric oxidoreductase that c atalyzes the degradation of the essential 
amino acid tryptophan to N- formyl -kynurenine.  Kynurenine can be subsequently metabolized 
through a series of enzymatic steps to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.  IDO1  is the first 
rate-limiting enzyme i n one o f the catabolic  pathways of tryptophan. 
The expression and activity profiles of IDO1 are distinct from those of tryptophan dioxygenase, 
an enzyme predominantly expressed in liver that catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as IDO1 
and maintains proper tryptophan balance in response to dietary uptake.  In contrast to tryptophan 
dioxygenase, IDO1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with particularly high levels found in areas of contact with potential sources of immune challenge (eg, gut, respiratory tract, pl acenta, 
spleen), consistent with a role for regulating tryptophan metabolism in a local microenvironment (Mellor and Munn 2004).  Within the immune system, IDO1 activity is specifically induced in 
cells such as dendritic cel ls (DCs) and macrophages at localized sites of inflammation 
(Munn and Mellor 2007).  
IDO1 -driven oxidation of tryptophan results in a strong inhibitory effect on the development of 
T-cell–mediated responses by blocking T- cell a ctivation and inducing T-cell apoptosis 
(Mellor  et al 2003).  Both the reduction in local tryptophan levels and the production of 
tryptophan catabolites that are inhibitory to cell proliferation contribute to the immunosuppr essive effects ( Frumento et al 2002) such as dendritic cell maturation and T- cell 
growth arrest and cell death ( Mellor and Munn 1999).  IDO1 activity also promotes the 
differentiation of naive T cells to cells with a regulatory phenotype (Treg ; Fallarino  et al 2006).  
Because increased Treg activity has been shown to promote tumor growth and Treg depletion 
has been shown to allow an otherwise ineffectual antitumor immune response to occur (Zou 2006 ), IDO1 expansion of Treg may provide an additional mechanism whereby IDO1 
could promote an immunosuppressive environment.

A critical role for IDO1 in immunomodulation has been confirmed in numerous animal models, 
including models of allograft tolerance, inflammation, and cancer ( Mellor and Munn 2004).  
While IDO1 inhibition can exacerbate disease in models of autoimmune disorders (Mellor  and Munn 2004), IDO1 null mice show no evidence of susceptibility to developing 
spontaneous autoimmunity or alterations in immune system development ( Mellor  et al 2003), 
suggesting that IDO1 inhibition, in a therapeutic setting, may produce minimal side effects in subjects without pre-existing autoimmune conditions. 
Within the context of cancer, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that IDO1 is a key 
regulator of the immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for tumor escape from immune 
surveillance.  Several groups have demonstrated that blockade of IDO1 activity can directly influence the ability of tumor -bearing animals to reject tumors ( Uyttenhove et al 2003, 
Muller  et al 2005).  In addition, studies with 1- methyl -tryptophan demonstrate that IDO1 
inhibition dramatically increases the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents (eg, platinum compounds, taxane derivatives, cyclophosphamide) without increased toxicity 
(Muller  et al 2005).  Although the specific mechanisms responsible for this potentiation remain 
to be fully elucidated, the effects were not observed in T- cell–deficient animals, suggesting that 
the results may be the consequence of the disablement of immunosuppressive mechanisms that 
exist within the tumor microenvironment.  
Based on studies examining serum levels of tryptophan and kynurenine, IDO1 appears to be 
chronically activated in subjects with cancer, and IDO1 activation correlates with more extensive 
disease ( Huang et al 2010 , Weinlich et al 2007).  IDO1 has subsequently been found to be 
overexpressed by a wide variety of human tumor cell types, as well as by the DCs that localize to the tumor-draining lymph nodes ( Uyttenhove et al 2003, Munn et al 2004).  Increased expression 
of IDO1 in tumor cells has been shown to be an independent prognostic variable for reduced overall survival ( OS) in subjects with melanoma, ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers 
(Okamoto et al 2005, Brandacher et al 2006, Ino et al 2006, Nakamura et al 2007, 
Witkiewicz  et al 2008, Hamid et al 2009).  
Together, these results suggest that the IDO1 pathway is a key regulatory element responsible for the induction and maintenance of tumor immune tolerance.  Small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 
may provide an innovative and tractable method to treat malignancies in combination with 
chemotherapeutics and/or immunotherapy- based strategies.  
1.2. Overview of Epacadostat  
Epacadostat is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme in both human tumor 
cells and human DCs.  A Phase 1 monotherapy study in subjects with advanced solid tumors is 
complete  and showed epacadostat  monotherapy was generally well -tolerated at doses of up to 
700 mg twice daily ( BID).  The most common adverse events  (AEs) were Grade 1 or 2 fatigue 
and gastrointestinal disturbances.  No responses were observed; however, 7 out of 52 subjects 
had stable disease ( SD) for at least 16 weeks (Beatty et al 2017).  With the recent emergence of 
immune -targeted agents (eg, PD -1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors), being investigated in several 
solid tumors and hematologic malignancies the co mbination of epacadostat with these agents 
was explored  and several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies are ongoing .

In a Phase 1 open- label , dose-escalation study (INCB 24360-201), epacadostat in combination 
with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg intravenous [ IV]), was evaluat ed in 21- day cycles.  The initial 
evaluation of epacadostat 300 mg BID in combination with ipilimumab was terminated due to 
the occurrence of clinically significant alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )/aspartate 
aminotransferase ( AST ) elevations in 5 of 7 subjec ts treated at this dose level.  These AEs were 
reversible in all subjects upon discontinuation of study therapy and administration of corticosteroids.  Enrollment was restarted at lower doses , and 40 subjects were enrolled:  25 mg 
BID (n  = 8), 50 mg BID continuous (n = 16), 50 mg BID intermittent dosing (2 weeks on and 
1 week off; n = 9), and 75 mg total daily dose (50 mg q AM and 25 mg q PM; n = 7).  The most 
common all grade immune -related AEs (irAEs ) were rash (50%), pruritus (35%), diarrhea 
(28%), increased ALT/AST (23%), and hypothyroidism (10%).  Immune- related AEs ≥ Grade 3 
occurred in 23% of subjects.  The most common ≥ Grade 3 irAEs were increased AST/ALT (10%) and colitis (5%).  Among 30 immunotherapy- naive subjects, objective response rate 
(ORR ) was 30% (9/30) per immune -related response criteria ( irRC ) and 27% (8/30) per 
RECIST.  The disease control rate (DCR; complete response ( CR) + partial response [ PR] + SD) 
was 60% per irRC and 57% per RECIST.  Median progression- free survival ( PFS) was 
8.3 months by irRC and 6.7 months by RECIST.  Among 10 points previously treated with 
immunotherapy, the DCR by both criteria was 30% (all SDs; Gibney et al 2015).  
A Phase 1/2 study is currently evaluating epacadostat in combinat ion with pembrolizumab 
(INCB 24360-202).  Epacadostat 25 mg BID, 50 mg BID, and 100 mg BID with pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and epacadostat 300 mg BID with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 
3 weeks was evaluated in Phase 1 dose- escalation; epacadost at 50 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 
300 mg BID with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks was evaluated in Phase 1 
dose-expansion.  The most common (≥ 15%) all -grade treatment -related AEs were fatigue, rash, 
arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea, and nausea.  Grade ≥  3 treatment -related AEs were observed in 
19% (most common:  rash [8%] and increased lipase [3%]).  There were n o treatment -related  
deaths .  Among 19 subjects who were treatment-naive for advanced melanoma (M1c 53%), 
5 CRs, 6 PRs, and 3 SDs were observed.  All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median 
follow-up in responders [minimum, max imum]: 56+ [46, 90+ weeks ]).  Median PFS has not 
been reached ; the PFS rate was 74% at 6 months and 57% at 12 months.  Responses were also 
observed in subjects previously treated for advanced melanoma (n = 3; 1 CR, 1 SD) and subjects 
with non–small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ; n = 12; 5 PRs, 2 SDs), r enal cell carcinoma ( RCC; 
n = 11; 2 PRs, 5 SDs), endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 7; 1 CR, 1 PR), urothelial carcinoma  
(UC; n = 5; 3 PRs), triple -negative breast cancer ( TNBC ; n = 3; 2 SDs), and squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN ; n = 2; 1 PR, 1 SD).  Based on the overall safety and 
efficacy  profile , epac adostat  100 mg BID was selected as the recommended dose for Phase 2 
(Gangadhar et al 2016), and efficacy and safety of the combination is being investigated in 
tumor- specific cohorts of diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, melanoma, NSCLC, UC, TNBC, 
SCCHN, ovarian cancer, RCC, and microsatellite- instability (MSI) high colorectal cancer 
(CRC) , gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Recently presented data f rom Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 subjects showed ORRs and DCRs, respectively , of 35% and 63% in 40 NSCLC subjects 
(Gangadhar et al 2017); 33% and 50% in 30 RCC subjects ( Lara et
  al 2017 ); 35% and 53% in 
40 UC subjects ( Smith et al 2017); and 34% and 61% in 38 SCCHN subjects 
(Hamid  et al 2017a ).

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
A randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study (INCB 24360-301) of pembrolizumab in 
combination with epacadostat or placebo in treatment- naive subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma was initiated based on results observed in the Phase 1  study.  The dual 
primary endpoints of the study are PFS per RECIST v1.1 and OS.  During an interim analysis, the ex ternal Data Monitoring Committee  concluded that the study did not meet the primary 
endpoint of improving PFS in the combination compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  Additionally, the external Data Monitoring Committee further determined that the OS endpoint 
was not expected to reach statistical significance.  Of note, there were no new safety concerns.  
This study remains open so that subjects who are still on treatment  will have continued access to 
open- label pembrolizumab  monotherapy.  
While the results from Study INCB  24360-301 are specific to melanoma and cannot be 
extrapolated to other tumor types, the sponsor, in collaboration with Merck, halted further enrollment in Phase 3 studies investigating epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in 
subjects with SCCHN, UC, and RCC.  The remaining Phase 3 studies investigating epacadostat 
in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC were amended to become 
randomized Phase 2 studies. 
For a thorough overview of the pharmacology of epacadostat an d ongoing clinical studies , refer 
to the epacadostat Investigator' s Brochure ( eIB). 
1.3. Overview of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with 
high specificity of binding to the PD -1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and 
programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro  data, pembrolizumab has 
high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced 
malignancies.   Pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications.  For more details on specific indications , refer to the pembrolizumab Investigator 's 
Brochure  (pIB). 
Activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy over platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (PT- DC) in 
subjects with previously untreated advanced NSCLC subjects who were PD- L1+ (≥ 50% 
expression on tumor cells) was demonstrated in a Phase 3 study ( Reck et al 2016).  Median PFS 
was 10.3 months with pembrolizumab and 6.0 months with chemotherapy ( hazard ratio 
[HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.37 to 0.68; p < 0.001).  Overall survival was 
significantly longer with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; p = 0.005).  Objective response rate was greater in subjects treated with pembrolizumab 
versus investigator' s choice chemotherapy (45% vs 28%).   
Activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy in subjects with advanced UC that 
progressed during or after the receipt of platinum- based chemotherapy was investigated in the 
Phase 3 KEYNOTE -045 study ( Bellmunt et al 2017).  A statistically significant advantage in OS 
of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was demonstrated (HR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.91; p = 0.0022).  The median OS was 10.3 months with pembrolizumab and 7.4 months with 
chemotherapy.  Notably, PFS for the 2 groups was similar (HR 0.98, 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.19) despite an ORR for pembrolizumab of 21.1% versu s 11.4% for chemotherapy.  The median time 
to response was 2.1 months with both pembroli zumab and chemotherapy.  The median duration

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
response was not reached with pembrolizumab (range, 1.6+ to 15.6+ months) and was 
4.3 months (range, 1.4+ to 15.4+) with chemotherapy.  Interim analysis of the Phase 2 
KEYNOTE -052 study demonstrated the activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
cisplatin -ineligible subjects with unresectable or metastatic UC ( Balar et al 2016).  ORR was 
24% (CR 6%) in all subjects , and favorable response rates were observed in subjects with high 
PD-L1 expression,  defined as combined positive score of ≥ 10% (ORR 37%; CR 13%).  
Activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects w ith recurrent or metastatic 
non-nasopharyngeal SCCHN was demonstrated in 2 cohorts of the P hase 1/2 KEYNOTE -012 
study ( Seiwert et al 2016 , Chow et al 2016) and in the P hase 2 KEYNOTE -055 study 
(Bauml  et al 2017).  In the expansion cohort of KEYNOTE-012, 132 subjects with recurrent 
and/or metastatic SCCHN regardless of PD -L1 expression received pembrolizumab 200 mg 
every 3  weeks.  ORR was 18% by central review ( Chow et al 2016).  Median duration of 
response (DOR) was not reached (range:   ≥ 2 months to ≥ 11 months) as of the data cutoff.  
Median PFS was 2  months, and the 6-month rates for PFS were 23%.  Median OS was 8 months, 
and the 6-month OS rate was 59%.  Responses were observed regardless of PD- L1 expression 
and association with human papilloma virus ( HPV ) status ( Chow et al 2016 ).  
In the KEYNOTE -055 study, 171 subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who were 
resistant to platinum agent and cetuximab received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks.  Objective response rate was 16% by central review with a median DOR  of 8 months 
(range,  2+ to 12+ months).  Median PFS was 2.1 months, and median OS was 8 months.  
Responses were observed regardless of PD-L1 expression and HPV status ( Bauml et  al 2017).  
1.4. Overview of 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin in 
Colorectal Cancer  
The mFOLFOX6 regimen is composed of 5 -fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin .  
5-Fluorouracil is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that interferes with th e synthesis of DNA , and 
to a lesser extent RNA , leading to cell death  in rapidly growing cells .  When used in combination 
with leucovorin, the effect of FdUMP , an active metabolite of 5-fluorouracil, on inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase is enhanced.   Oxaliplatin is a platinum agent that binds to DNA to form 
crosslinks that inhibit DNA replication and transcription.  Of the 3 commercially available 
platinum agents, oxaliplatin is the preferred agent for the treatment of subjects with colorectal 
tumors. 
In addi tion to mFOLFOX6, other common first- line oxaliplatin -based approaches in subjects 
with advanced CRC include CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOXIRI with or 
without targeted agents ( NCCN 2017a , Van Cutsem et al 2016).  Historical data show that ORRs 
ranging from 35% to 55% with oxaliplatin -based regimens were observed in the first line -setting  
in subjects with metastatic CRC ( Tournigand et al 2004, Saltz  et al 2008, Bokemeyer et al 2009, 
Van Cutsem et al 2009, Douillard et al 2010).

1.5. Overview of nab-Paclitaxel /Gemcit abine  in Pancreatic Cancer  
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and 
blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary.  nab -Paclitaxel is an 
albumin -bound formulation of paclitaxel, an anti microtubule agent that promotes the assembly of 
microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization.  
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule 
network that is e ssential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.  
Activity for gemcitabine in combination with nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced 
pancreatic cancer was demonstrated in a Phase 1/2 study ( Von Hoff et al 2011) and in a Phase 3 
study ( Von Hoff et al 2013).   In the Phase 1/2 study, among the 44 subjects treated at the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ; gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 followed by nab -paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle), the response rate was 48%, and median survival was 12.2 months.  At this dose, Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included fatigue in 27%, neuropathy in 
20%, and neutropenia in 49%.  In the Phase 3 study, subjects treated with this combination 
showed a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death with a median PFS of 5.5 versus 
3.7 months and an ORR of 23% compared with 7% with gemcitabine alone.   The most common 
Grade 3 or greater treatment -related AEs were neutropenia (38% vs 27%), fatigue (17% vs 7%), 
and neuropathy (17% vs 1%) in the combination treatment group  versus the gemcitabine-only 
treatment group.  There was no difference in serious life-threatening toxicity (4% in each 
treatment group ).  Based on results from this Phase 3 study, combination of nab- paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine is now accepted standard of care as first -line treatment for subjects with 
advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer.  
1.6. Overview of Platinum -Based Doublet Chemotherapy in Non –Small 
Cell Lung Cancer  
Cisplatin and c arboplatin binds to DNA to form crosslinks that inhibit DNA replication and 
transcription and are the more commonly used commercially available platinum agents for the 
treatment of subjects with non- colorectal tumors .  Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent th at 
promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization, resulting in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.  
Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate -dependent metabolic 
processes essential for cell replication.  In combination with a platinum agent, paclitaxel and 
pemetrexed  represent standard-of- care fi rst-line therapy for NSCLC subjects (without sensitizing 
epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ ALK ] 
translocation) with squamous and nonsquamous histologies, respectively ( NCCN 2017c , 
Novello et al 2016).  
Randomized studies comparing various PT -DC regimens in NSCLC have shown similar efficacy 
results, with ORRs ranging from 15% to 32%, median PFS of 4.0 to 5.1 months, and median OS 
from 8.1 to 10.3 months.  One - and 2- year OS rates ranged from 30% to 4 4% and 10% to 19%, 
respectively  (Kelly et al 2001, Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2002, Scagliotti et al 2008 , 
Schiller et al 2002).  Bevacizumab and maintenance therapy with pemetrexed have improved 
clinical outcomes  (Barlesi et al 2014, Scagliotti et al 2014, Patel et al 2013), but most subjects 
will eventually progress  (Chang 2011).

1.7. Overview of Low -Dose Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that is thought to exert its effect by  cross -linking tumor 
cell DNA.  Cyclophosphamide is primarily used at high doses for the treatment of hematologic 
malignancies (lymphomas , multiple myeloma, leukemias) but can be used for the treatment of 
ovarian  and breast cancers.  Additionally, cyclophosphamide can be used as an 
immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of autoimmune and immune- mediated diseases.   
Preclinical and clinical findings have demonstrated that c yclophosphamide is  a potent immune 
modul ator that targets suppressive regulatory immune cells within the tumor microenvironment 
while enhancing effector cells.  Low doses of cyclophosphamide have been used  to selectively 
deplete Tregs while enhancing effector and memory cytotoxic T cells within the tumor 
microenvironment, which resulted in suppressed tumor growth and enhanced survival 
(Abu Eid et al 2016, Ahlmann and Hempel 2016).  
1.8. Overview of Gemcitabine /Platinum Agent  in Urothelial  Carcinoma  
Activity of gemcitabine/cisplatin combination chemotherapy compared with methotrexate, 
vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) as first- line treatment for metastatic UC was 
investigated in a Phase 3 study in 405 subjects ( von der Maase et al 2000).  Overall survival was 
similar on both arms (HR  = 1.04, 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.32; p = 0.75), as were time to progressive 
disease, time to treatment failure, and response rate ( gemcitabine/cisplatin , 49%; MVAC, 46%); 
however, gemcitabine/cisplatin  provided a better safety profile and tolerability.  Unfortunately, 
cisplatin ineligibility is common in subjects with UC because of renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min) or performance status of 2, both, or additional comorbidity.  Carboplatin 
provides an alternative for cisplatin in these subjects.  Results from a Phase 3 study comparing gemcitabine/carboplatin with methotrexate/carboplatin/vinblastine (M -CAVI) in 
238 cisplatin -ineligible subjects showed ORRs of 41.2% (36.1% confirmed response) with 
gemcitabine/carboplatin and 30.3% (21.0% confirmed response) with M- CAVI (p  = 0.08 
unconfirmed response; p = 0.01 confirmed response) and similar OS (HR = 0.94, 95% CI, 
0.72 to  1.2; p = 0.64) and PFS (HR = 1.04; 95% CI , 0.80, 1.35).  However, more subjects have 
severe acute toxicity (death resulting from toxicity, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, 
Grade 3  to 4 renal toxicity, neutropenic fever, or Grade 3 to 4 mucositis) with M -CAVI 
compared with gemcitabin e-carboplatin (21.2% vs 9.3%; De Santis et al 2012 ).  Results from 
these Phase 3 studies form the basis of combination therapy with gemcitabine and a platinum 
agent as first -line standard -of-care treatment for subjects with advanced/metastatic UC 
(NCCN  2017d, Bellmunt et al 2014).

1.9. Overview of Platinum Agent/5-Fluorouracil in Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck  
Initial treatment options for patients with recur rent or metastatic SCCHN include various 
chemotherapy agents (platinum agent [cisplatin or carboplatin], 5-fluorouracil, or taxanes), either 
alone or in combination, and the biologic agent cetuximab ( NCCN 2017b, Gregoire et al 2010).  
In Phase 3 studies cisplatin/5-fluourouracil, ORRs were 30% ( Forastiere et al 1992, Jacobs 
et al 1992, Clavel et al 1994 , Gibson et al 2005) while ORR with carboplatin/5 -fluorouracil was 
21% ( Forastiere et al 1992 ).  While these ORRs are considered significant improvements relative 
to single -agent platinum therapy, improvements in OS have not been observed.  The addition of 
the EGFR -targeted monoclonal antibody cetuximab to platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) 
and 5-fluorouracil (EXTREME regimen) prolonged median OS from 7.4 months to 10.1 months 
(HR = 0.80; p = 0.04) and median PFS from 3.3 months to 5.6 months (HR = 0.54; p < 0.001) 
compared with a platinum agent and 5-fluorouracil doublet.  Additionally, ORR increased from 
20% with platinum/5 -fluorouracil to 36% with the EXTREME regimen (p < 0.001; 
Vermorken  et al 2008).  Based on these results, the EXTREME regimen is now the standard of 
care for patients with non- nasopharyngeal SCCHN in the recurrent and metastatic setting 
(NCCN 2017b, Gregoire et al 2010).  
1.10. Study Rationale  
While chemotherapy has largely been thought to be immunosuppressive and exert its effect via direct cytotoxicity, there is an emerging body of evidence to suggest that some chemotherapies may influence an immune response to tumors via induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD), 
elimination of immunosuppressive cells, or sensitization of tumor cells to immune effector cells (Apetoh et al 2015).  FOLFOX -bevacizumab may i nduce a decrease in granulocytic 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells, high levels of which are associated with a poor prognosis 
(Limagne et al 2016).  Gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide have been shown to improve 
antitumor immun ity by depleting immunosuppressive Tregs ( Ghiringhelli et al 2007, Le and 
Jaffee 2012 , Shevchenko et al 2013).  Platinum agents have demonstrated immunogenic effects 
via ICD and enhancement of effector immune response through PD-L1 receptor expression (Hato et al 2014).   Paclitaxel and 5 -fluorouracil have been shown to restore antitumor activity of 
CD8+ T cells ( Sevko et al 2013, Vincent et al 2010 ).  Given these findings, the combination of 
chemotherapy with immunotherapy is a rational choice , especially in subjects for whom these 
chemotherapies are the accepted standard of care. 
Programmed cell death 1/PD -L1 blockade is being investigated in combination with 
chemotherapeutic agents in various tumor types.  In a Phase 1 study (n = 56), nivolumab in 
combination with PT -DC in chemotherapy -naive NSCLC showed ORR ranging from 33% to 
50% and PFS from 4.8 to 6.1 months, and ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs were observed in 
45% of subjects ( Rizvi et al 2016).  More promising efficacy signals have been observed in the 
KEYNOTE -021 study of pembrolizumab in combination with PT- DC from op en-label cohorts 
(n = 74, ORR 48%-71%, PFS ~10 months, ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs 56 %-71%; 
Gadgeel  et al 2016) and a randomized cohort of pembrolizumab/PT-DC versus PT- DC (n = 123, 
ORR  55% vs 29%, PFS 13 vs 8.9 months, ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs 39% vs 26%; 
Langer  et al 2016) as well as a Phase 1 st
 udy of atezolizumab (n  = 58 safety evaluable, 
n = 41 efficacy evaluable, ORR 50 %-77%, PFS immature at time of analysis;

Giaccone et  al 2015). Confirmatory Phase 3 clinical studies in advanced/metastatic NSCLC are 
ongoing for these 3 therapies.  
In addition to NSCLC, preliminary data of PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitors in combination with 
chemotherapy in metastatic C RC and pancreatic cancer  have been reported.  In a Phase 1 study 
in subjects with previously untreated metastatic CRC (n  = 23), atezolizumab in combination with 
FOLFOX and bevacizumab showed an ORR of 52% with a median PFS of 14.1 months.  The 
regimen was well -tolerated , and no unexpected toxicities observed ( Wallin et al 2016).  In a 
Phase 1 investigator- initiated study of pembrolizumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 in 
subjects with advanced gastric malignancies (n  = 10), the combination of pembrolizumab at 
doses of up to 200 mg given every 2 weeks with mFOLFOX6 was well- tolerated.  Common 
≥ Grade 3 AEs were neutropenia (40%) and hyponatremia (30%).  Stable disease was observed 
in 4 of 7 CRC subjects ( Stenehjem et al 2016) .  Preliminary data from a Phase 1/2 study of 
nab-paclitaxel ± gemcitabine with  nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic 
pancreatic cancer showed the addition of nivolumab to nab- paclitaxel or 
nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine  was tolerable.  No dose- limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) were observed in 
the 11 subjects treated with nivolumab plus nab- paclitaxel , and the most common AEs were 
anemia, neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism (18% each).  One DLT was observed in the 
6 subjects treated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine  plus nivolumab, and the most common AE 
was anemia (33%).  Two  of 6 subjects treated with nab-paclitaxel and nivolumab had a PR and 
4 had SD.  Of the 11 subjects treated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine  and nivolumab, 3 subjects  
had a PR and 3 subjects had SD ( George et al 2016 ). 
The ID O pathway inhibitor indoximod has been evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in 
clinical studies.  In a Phase 1 study (n = 27), indoximod in combination with docetaxel in pretreated subjects with metastatic solid tumors was well-tolerated with no unex pected toxicities 
and had a modest ORR of 18% ( Soliman et al 2014 ).  Based on encouraging activity observed in 
subjects with breast cancer from this study, a Phase 2 study of indoximod in combination with docetaxel or pacli taxel was initiated.  Preliminary safety data showed AEs were similar to those 
typically seen with taxanes , and no unexpected AEs were observed ( Tang et al 2016).  
Indoximod in combination with nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer was also well -tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study, and preliminary efficacy showed 
durable responses in 42% of subjects ( Bahary et al 2016).  
Combining the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat, p embrolizumab , and chemotherapy may result in 
greater immunomodulatory effects in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in enhanced clinical 
benefit  in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
1.10.1. Justification for Treatment Regimen  
The initial epacadostat  dose selected  for this study in combination with pembrolizumab and 
chemotherapy is 100 mg  BID, with the option to de- escalate to 50 mg BID based on DLTs 
observed in the safety run -in.  The initial dose selected is based on the preliminary observation 
that the average kynurenine inhibition at 6 hours after administration of epacadostat  using a 
standardized whole blood assay is 89%, and the safety profile of this dose level has been well-tolerated .  Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic observations from studies 
INCB  24360- 101 and INCB  24360-201 in subjects  with cancer support the 25 mg BID to 
300 mg BID dose levels , which provide a differential pharmacologic effect.  Based on a 6 -hour 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
observation period at steady state on Day 15 after administration of epacadostat  and using a 
standardized whole blood assay, kynurenine levels are incompletely inhibited (66%), compared 
with baseline levels in subjects treated with 25  mg BID , but are nearly maximally inhibited 
(89%) in subjects treated with 100 mg BID.  Complete inhibition of IDO1 is not required for 
maximally effective activity in preclinical models ; however, maximally effective doses in 
nonclinical models result in exposures that are comparable to monotherapy doses of 50 mg BID 
to 300 mg BID in humans.  Additionally, a detailed interrogation of the effect of dose and exposure on the pharmacodynamic effect of epacadostat on the tryptophan pathway wa s 
performed in Study INCB 24360-101.  Using an ex vivo  assay optimized for determining the 
inhibition of the metabolism of tryptophan to kynurenine by IDO1, epacadostat treatment produced significant dose-dependent reductions in plasma kynurenine levels and in the plasma 
kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at all doses and in all subjects .  Near maximal changes were 
observed at doses of ≥ 100 mg BID with > 80% to 90% inhibition of IDO1 achieved throughout 
the dosing period ( Beatty et al 2017).  
Epacadostat doses of up to 700 mg BID as monotherapy have been well -tolerated .  In the 
INCB  24360-202 study, epacadostat doses of up to 300 mg BID were evaluated in combination 
with pembrolizumab.  The MTD was not exceeded in this study.  While there was a higher 
incidence of Grade 3 rash in the 300 mg BID cohort than in the 100 mg BID cohort, these did not 
qualify as protocol-specified DLTs.  The dose of epacadostat 300 mg BID is currently being investigated in other studies of epacadostat in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors. 
In the Phase 3 INCB  24360-301 study, the combination of epacadostat 100 mg BID plus 
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks ( Q3W ) was chosen based upon a benefit/risk assessment 
made specifically in melanoma in collaboration with Merck.  In INCB 24360-202, there was 
evidence of improved efficacy in melanoma subjects at all doses of epacadostat from 50 mg to 
300 mg BID.  Given that melanoma is an immunotherapy responsive tumor, and lower doses of 
epacadostat appeared to have similar activity, epacadostat 100 mg BID dose was selected for 
evaluation in the INCB 24360-301 study because of the lower incidence of dose interruptions 
and dose reductions compared with  the 300 mg BID dose observed in the INCB 24360-202 
study.  
The starting dose selected for the current study was formed on the basis of having a well-tolerated safety prof ile as monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapy 
agents , as well as providing nearly maximum target inhibition of IDO1.   Given that epacadostat 
was determined to be safe as monotherapy at doses up to 700 mg BID, the choice of the pharmacologi cally active dose (PAD) of 100 mg BID is justified as the sta rting dose in this 
combination study, and the dose range of 50 mg BID to 100 mg BID is justified as the dose 
range to potentially evaluate in this study .

1.10.2. Rationale for Efficacy Endpoi nts 
RECIST v 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009) will be used by the local site to determine eligibility  and 
evaluate disease status .  However, because immunotherapeutic agents may produce antitumor 
effects by potentiating endogenous cancer -speci fic immune responses that may take weeks to 
emerge, t he response patterns seen with  immunotherapeutic agents may extend beyond the 
typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents and can manifest a clinical response 
after an initial increase in  tumor burden or appearance of new lesions.  As a result, RECIST v1.1 
may not provide a comprehensive response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents ; therefore, 
RECIST v1.1 will be used with the following adaptation: 
If radiologic imaging shows initial PD , tumor assessment should be repeated ≥ 4 weeks later 
(but no later than 6 weeks) to confirm PD with the option of continuing assigned treatment 
while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  If repeat imaging shows stability or 
reduction in tumor burden compared with the initial scan demonstrating PD, treatment may 
be continued or resumed.  If repeat imaging confirms progressive PD, subjects will be discontinued from treatment .  In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased 
or decreased, investigators should consider all target lesions as well as nontarget lesions. 
In subjects who have initial radiologic evidence of PD, it is at the discretion of the investigator to continue a subject on treatment until repeat imaging is obtained.  T his decision should be based 
on the subject's overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data.  Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are clinically stable , as defined b y the following criteria: 
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention . 
When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed.  Subjects who are deemed clinically unstable are not req uired to have repeat imaging for confirmation of PD. 
In all other instances, treatment decisions will be made based on investigator review of the 
clinical and radiographic data.

1.11. Potential Risks of the Treatment Regimen  
1.11.2. Ris
ks From Pembrolizumab  
The most frequently reported adverse events (≥ 10%) in 2799 subjects treated with 
pembrolizumab were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, cough, pruritus, dyspnea, 
arthralgia, rash, constipation, headache, vomiting, asthenia, pyrexia, back pain, anemia, and peripheral edema.  The 5 m ost frequently reported SAEs were pneumonia (3.0%), pleural 
effusion (1.7%), pneumonitis (1.6%), dyspnea ( 1.6%),  and pulmonary embolism (1.5%).  For full 
details and recommended management guidelines , refer to the pembrolizumab Investigator's 
Brochure ( pIB). 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.

1.11.3. Risks From mFOLFOX6  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 40%) of oxaliplatin were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), diarrhea, emesis, fatigue, and stomatitis.  Serious adverse reactions 
including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities , and 
hepatotoxici ty can occur .  Anaphylactic reactions to oxaliplatin may occur within minutes of 
administration.  
In clinical studies of oxaliplatin , the most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and 
treated subjects with advanced CRC were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, 
nausea, emesis, and diarrhea.  Both 5- fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with 
gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions.  When oxaliplatin is administered in 
combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased.   Allergic 
sensitization, including anaphylactoid reactions and urticaria, has been reported after  the 
administration of both oral and parenteral leucovorin. 
1.11.4. Risks From nab- Paclitaxel /Gemcitabine  
The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions of nab- paclitaxel in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) are neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, alopecia, 
peripheral edema, diarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, decreased appetite, rash, and dehydrati on.  
Additionally, nab-paclitaxel causes myelosuppression.  Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently 
and may require dose reduction or treatment interruption.  Sepsis occurred in subject s with or 
without neutropenia who received nab- paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine.  Pneumonitis 
occurred with the use of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine.  Severe 
hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome have been reported.   nab -Paclitaxel contains 
albumin derived from human blood, which has a theoreti cal risk of viral transmission.  Refer to  
the US prescribing information  (Abraxane PI 2015) or EU SmPC (Abraxane SmPC 2015) for 
nab-paclitaxel for full details.  
1.11.5. Risks From Paclitaxel /Carbopl atin 
Bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is dose-dependent 
and is also the DLT  of carboplatin.  Anaphylactic reactions to carboplatin may occur within 
minutes of administration.  Carboplatin can induce emesis, which can be more severe in subject s 
previously receiving emetogenic  therapy.   Although peripheral neurotoxicity is infrequent, its 
incidence is increased in subject s older than 65 years and in subjects  previously treated with 
cisplatin.  
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and is the DLT  of 
paclitaxel.   Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and 
hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2 % to 
4% of subject s receiving paclitaxel in clinical studies.  Fatal reactions have occurred in subject s 
despite premedication.

1.11.6. Risks From Pemetrexed /Platinum Agent  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20% with single- agent use) with pemetrexed 
are fatigue, nausea,  and anorexia.  When pemetrexed is used in combination with a platinum 
agent, common adverse reactions include the following :  vomiting (40%), nausea (56%), 
neutropenia (29%), leukopenia (18%), anemia (33%), stomatitis/pharyngitis (14%), 
thrombocytopenia (10%), and constipation (21%).  Refer to  the US prescribing information  
(Alimta PI 2013) or EU SmPC (Alimta SmPC 2016) for pemetrexed for full details.  
1.11.7. Risks From Cyclophosphamide  
The most often reported a dverse reaction s with cyclophosphamide are neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, fever, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Cyclophosphamide can cause 
myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia), bone marrow 
failur e, and severe immunosuppression, which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal 
infections, including sepsis and septic shock.  Hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, 
hematuria, and secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, 
lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported.  Myocarditis, myopericarditis, 
pericardial effusion including cardiac tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be 
fatal, have been reported.  Pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary veno- occlusive disease, 
and other forms of pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure have been reported during 
and after  treatment with cyclophosphamide.  Veno -occlusive liver disease including fatal 
outcome has been reported. 
1.11.8. Risks From G emcitabine /Platinum Agent  
In the Phase 3 study of gemcitabine/ cisplatin versus MVAC, ≥ Grade 3 anemia was more 
common with gemcitabine /cisplatin (27%) versus MVAC (18%); however, this did not result in 
an increase in RBC transfusion rates.  Subjects treated with gemcitabine /cisplatin  had more 
≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia compared with MVAC (57% vs 21%, respectively); but there was 
no Grade 4 bleeding on either arm, and ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was infrequently associated 
with Grade 3 bleeding (2% for both treatment groups ; von der Maase et al 2000).  In the P hase 3 
study in UC, severe acute toxicity (death, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, ≥ Grade 3 
renal toxicity, neutropenic fever, or mucositis) was observed in 9.3% of subjects receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and 21.2% of subject s receiving M -CAVI.  The most common 
≥ Grade 3 AEs were leukopenia (44.9%, 46.6%), neutropenia (52.5%, 63.5%), febrile 
neutropenia (4.2%, 14.4%), thrombocytopenia (48.3%, 19.4%), and infection (11.8%, 12.7%) in 
subjects treated with gemcitabine/ carboplatin versus M- CAVI, respectively 
(De Santis  et al 2012).

1.11.9. Risks From Platinum Agent/5 -Fluorouracil  
In a Phase 3 study of cisplatin /5-fluorouracil and carboplatin /5-fluorouracil versus single-agent 
methotrexate as first -line treatment for metastatic SCCHN, 33% of subjects treated with 
cisplatin/5 -fluorouracil and 26% of subjects treated with carboplatin/5- fluorouracil had 
≥ Grade 3 AEs.  Compared with single-agent methotrexate, leukopenia was more frequent in 
cisplatin -treated subjects , and thrombocytopenia was more frequent in carboplatin- treated 
subjects.  Stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting were common nonhematologic events with the platinum agent/5 -fluorouracil regimens , and renal toxicity was more frequent in cisplatin -treated 
subjects ( Forastiere et al 1992).  
1.11.10. Risks From Combining an IDO  Inhibitor With  Chemotherapy  
In a Phase 1 study of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod with docetaxel in advanced solid 
tumors, the most frequent AE s were fatigue (58.6%), anemia (51.7%), hyperglycemia, (48.3%), 
infection (44.8%), and nausea (41.4%; Soliman et al 2014).  In a Phase 2 study of indoximod 
plus docetaxel in subjects with metastatic breast cancer, the most common indoximod -related 
AEs of any grade occurring in ≥ 10% of subject s were fatigue (20%), nausea (20%), diarrhea 
(13%), and headache (12% ; Tang et al 2016).  
Recently presented safety data from a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of indoximod with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine  in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer showed the most 
frequently reported AE s (regardl ess of attribution) occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects were anemia, 
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, weight loss, dizziness, fever, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, rash, hypotension, hypo kalemia, hyponatremia, ALT increased, AST increased, ALP  increased, platelet count 
decreased, white blood cell count decreased, and neutrophil count decreased ( Bahary et al 2016).  
1.11.11. Risks From Combining a PD -1 Inhibitor With  Chemotherapy  
In an investigator -initiated Phase 1 study of subjects with metastatic CRC, c ommon AEs when 
pembrolizumab was combined with mFOLFOX6 were neutropenia (40%) and hyponatremia 
(30%; Stenehjem et al 2016 ).  The mo st common AEs in 11 subjects with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer treated with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine  plus nivolumab was anemia (33% ; 
George  et al 2016). 
Recently presented safety data from a randomized cohort of the KEYNOT E-021 study where 
subjects with nonsquamous NSC LC were treated with pemetrexed/carboplatin  plus 
pembrolizumab showed the most common ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related AEs were an emia (12%), 
decreased neutrophil count (5%), and acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, 
neutropenia, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia (3% each; Langer et al 2016).   In an open- label 
cohort from the same study, NSCLC subjects treated with paclitaxel /carboplatin  plus 
pembrolizumab, treatment -related AEs ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 36% subjects; the most common 
events were anemia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia (n = 2 each ; Gadgeel et al 2016).

1.11.12. Risks From Combining Epacadostat and Pembrolizumab 
In the Phase 1 portion of the INCB  24360-202 study of epacadostat in combination with 
pembrolizumab, the most common all- grade treatment -related AEs were fatigue (29%), rash  
(29%), pruritus (23%), arthralgia  (19%), diarrhea (18%), and nausea (16%).  Treatment -related 
AEs ≥ Grade 3 were observed in 19% (most common:  rash [8%] and increased lipase [3%]).  
Five subjects (8%) experienced treatment -related AEs that led to discontinuation, including 
Grade 3 arthralgia, Grade 3 AST increased/ Grade 2 ALT increased, Grade 3 lipase increased, 
Grade 3 aseptic meningitis, and Grade 2 nervous system disorder.  There were no treatment-
related deaths ( Gangadhar et al 2016).  
Data from 294 subjects in the Phase 2 portion of the study (epacadostat 100 mg P O BID + 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W) further support the acceptable safety and tolerability profile of 
this combination .  The  most common all- grade treatment -related AEs were fatigue (29%), rash 
(17%), nausea (11%), and pruritus (10%).  Treatment -related A Es ≥ Grade 3 were observed in 
18%.  Treatment-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuations occurred in 11 subjects (4%); the most common were arthralgia and rash (n = 2 subjects each) and there was only 
1 treatment -related AE that led to death (respir atory failure , secondary to aspiration pneumonia; 
pneumonitis could not be ruled out ; Hamid  et al 2017b).  
In Study INCB  24360-301, the external Data Monitoring Committee  found no new safety 
concerns with pembrolizumab plus epacadostat compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Treatment -related AEs ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 22% of subjects receiving epacadostat plus 
pembrolizumab and in 17% of subjects receiving placebo plus pembrolizumab.  Treatment -
related AEs leading to treatment discontinuations occurred in 11% and 10% of subjects treated with epacad ostat plus pembrolizumab and placebo plus pembrolizumab, respectively 
(Long  et al 2018).

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
Note:   As of 25 OCT 2018, this study is closed to enrollment.  As of this date, no subjects 
were enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) or Phase 2 mandatory 
biopsy Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G.  Any text included in the body of this Protocol 
that references these treatment groups and cohorts  has not been deleted but should be 
disregarded.  
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of epacadostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab  and 7 chemotherapy  
regimens (Figure  1).  Phase 1 will consist of a 3 + 3 + 3  design  and will determine the MTD or 
PAD of epacadostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy; efficacy will a lso be explored.  Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have 
progressed after receiving at least 1 previous standard therapy for advanced or metastatic disease 
(or who are intolerant to or refuse standard of care) and for whom treatment with 1 of the chemotherapy regimens is appropriate will be enrolled in Phase 1.  Phase 2 will further evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the MTD or PAD of epacadostat selected in Phase 1 when 
given in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.  Subjects with advanced or 
metastatic CRC, PDAC, NSCLC  (squamous or nonsquamous), UC, or SCCHN who have not 
previously received chemotherapy as first -line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease and 
have not previously received immune checkpoint inhibitors nor an IDO inhibitor will be enrolled in Phase 2.  A separate cohort of subjects with any advanced or metastatic solid tumor who 
progressed on previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitor will also be enrolled in Phase 2. 
4.1.1. Phase 1  
A 3 + 3 + 3  design will be used in which 7 treatment groups will be explored in parallel.  A 
minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each treatment group beginning with Cohort 1 (epacadostat 100 mg BID; starting dose), and the first 3 evaluable subjects wi ll be 
observed for a minimum of 28 days in the cohorts where mFOLFOX6 or 
nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine  are administered or 21 days for all other chemotherapy regimens .  To 
be considered evaluable for dose tolerability , subjects should meet 1 of the following 
criteria:   1) received the cohort -specified dose of epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and 
chemotherapy for at least 80% of planned doses in the DLT observation period (45 doses epacadostat/2 doses pembrolizumab for subjects who received mFOLFOX6 or nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine ; 34 doses epacadostat/1 dose pembrolizumab for subjects who 
received any other chemotherapy regimens ) and complete d the DLT observation period or  
2) had a DLT during the DLT observation period.  It is recognized that certain toxicities due to  
chemotherapy (eg , including but not limited to gastrointestinal toxicity , including diarrhea; renal 
insufficiency; high -grade lab oratory abnormalities; hypersensitivity/ rash) may initially be 
clinically indistinguishable from toxicities  due to immunothera py.  Epacadostat will be held for 
these toxicities , and as a result, subjects  may not receive at least 80% of the prescribed dose 
during Cycle 1.  In these cases, the Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC) may assess subjects  
who receive dose intensities somewhat below 80% for determining  DLTs  and consider in the 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 58 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
adjudication process the specific toxicities encountered, likely cause of toxicities, and dose 
intensity and tolerability beyond Cycle 1.  Additional subjects will be enrolled in a cohort to 
achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects.  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than a 
DLT (eg, events clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, concomitant medication, comorbidity, or an AE clearly unrelated to treatment) during the DLT observation 
period will be considered nonevaluable for DLTs and will be replaced. 
The scenarios for expansion and de- escalation are summarized below , and the doses of 
epacadostat to be evaluated are summarized in Table  1: 
1. If 0 DLTs occur in 3 subjects in Cohort 1, 3 additional subjects will be treated in 
Cohort 1.  If there is  ≤ 1 DLT  in these 6 subjects, enrollment in Phase 2 for that treatment 
group may proceed. 
2. If 1 of 3 subjects in Cohort 1 has a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in 
Cohort 1.  If there are no additional DLTs (≤ 1 DLT in 6 subjects), enrollment in P hase 2 
for that treatment group may proceed. 
3. If 2 of 6 subjects in Cohort 1 have a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  If there are no additional DLTs (≤ 2 DLTs in 9 subjects), enrollment in Phase 2 for that treatment group may proceed. 
4. If ≥ 2 of 3, 3 of 6, or 3 of 9 subjects have DLTs within a cohort, de- escalation of 
epacadostat to 50 mg BID (Cohort ‒1) will be evaluated using the same criteria.  
If Cohort ‒1 is not tolerated within a given treatment group, that treatment group will not be 
pursued further.  The study will be terminated if Cohort ‒1 is not tolerated in all treatment 
groups.

a If epacadostat 100 mg BID is not tolerated within a treatment group, epacadostat 50 mg BID will be evaluated.  
Dose interruptions and/or modifications may be implemented based on toxicity as described in 
Section  5.5.1.1.  Dose modifications should not be made during the DLT observation period 
without discussion with the medical monitor.  Intrasubjec t dose escalation is not permitted.  
Subjects will be assigned to a treatment group (Table  2) based on the chemotherapy regimen 
most appropriate for their  tumor type.

1. CRC ( Treatment Group A :  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + mFOLFOX6) :  Simon 
2-Stage design  
2. PDAC ( Treatment Group B:  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine ):  Simon 2- Stage design  
3. Squamous NSCLC (Treatment Group C :  epacadostat + pembrolizum ab + 
paclitaxel /carboplatin ) 
4. Nonsquamous NSCLC (Treatment Group D :  epacadostat + pembroli zuma b + 
pemetrexed /platinum agent) 
5. Any solid tumor that progressed on previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitor 
(Treatment Group E:  ep acadostat + pembrolizumab + cyclophosphamide) 
6. UC ( Treatment Group F :  epacadostat + pembrolizumab + gemcitabine /platinum agent) 
7. SCCHN ( Treatment Group G:   epacadostat + p embrolizumab + platinum 
agent/5 -fluorouracil) 
Enrollment in a specific efficacy expans ion cohort in Phase 2 may begin after a minimum of 
6 subjects  have been treated with epacadostat 100 mg BID in the corresponding treatment group 
in Phase 1  and there is ≤ 1 DLT in these 6 subjects. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be performed in the efficacy expansion cohorts.  If 
the cumulative incidence of treatment -related SAE s is > 40% and/or the cumulative incidence of 
≥ Grade 3 irAEs  is > 40% after 10 subjects are enrolled in a specific Phase 2 efficacy expansion 
cohort, further enrollm ent in that cohort will be interrupted  until the sponsor, investigators, and 
health authorities (if applicable) determine an appropriate course of action.  If an efficacy 
expansion cohort is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort may be initiated at a lower dose of 
epacadostat.  
In addition to the efficacy  expansion cohorts listed above, separate mandatory biopsy cohorts 
will be enrolled to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment.  For the cohorts where IV chemotherapy is administered, subjects will receive IV chemotherapy only during Cycle 1 
followed by epacadostat + pembrolizumab + IV chemotherapy starting with Cycle 2 Day 1.  For 
the CRC and PDAC cohorts, a minimum of 10 subjects with evaluable paired biopsy specimens will be enrolled.  A fresh tumor biopsy will be collected during screening.  On -treatment biopsies 
are mandatory and will be collected between Days  21 and 27 of Cycle 1 (IV chemotherapy only) 
and Cycle 2 (epacadostat + pembrolizumab + IV chemotherapy).  For the squamous NSCLC, 
nonsquamous NSCLC, UC , or SCCHN  cohorts, a minimum of 10 subjects with evaluable paired 
biopsy specimens will be enrolled.  A fresh tumor biopsy will be collected during screening.  
On-treatment biopsies are mandatory and will be collected between Days 14 and 20 of Cycle 1 
(IV chemotherapy only) and Days 7 and 13 of Cycle 3 (epacadostat + pembrolizumab + IV 
chemotherapy).  For subjects with any advanced or metastatic solid tumor that progressed on

previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD-L1 inhibitor , a minimum of 5  subjects with evaluable paired 
biopsy specimens will be enrolled in the mandatory biopsy cohort; however, this cohort will be 
administered epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and cyclophosphamide starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  A 
fresh tumor biopsy will be collected du ring screening , and an on- treatment biopsy is mandatory 
and will be collected between Days 7 and 13 of Cycle 3. 
If a subject is selected for inclusion in the mandatory biopsy cohort, and it is subsequently 
determined that tumor tissue cannot safely be obtained, or if the biopsy does not meet minimum 
standards for evaluation (as outlined in the Laboratory Manual), the subject may still enroll in the 
mandatory biopsy cohort and will be followed for efficacy and safety.  The subject may be 
replaced in order to enroll sufficient numbers of evaluable subjects  with paired biopsies. 
Note:  As of 25 OCT  2018, on- treatment tumor biopsies are no longer required for subjects 
who are already enrolled in the mandatory biopsy cohorts.

4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
This is an open- label study.  Assessment of safety using CTCAE v4.0 and efficacy using 
RECIST v1.1 are objective measurements, and only comparisons to pretreatment conditions will 
be made.  
4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1. Planned Number of Subjects  
Up to 421 subjects from up to 25 sites may be enrolled in the study: 
• Phase 1 – Approximately 42 to 126 evaluable subjects.  
• Phase 2 (Efficacy Expansion + Mandatory Biopsy) – Approximately 237 to 
295 evaluable subjects.  
As of 25 OCT 2018, this study  is closed  to enrollment.   A total of 70 subjects were enrolled.  
No subjects were enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) or Phase 2 
mandatory biopsy Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G. 
4.3.2. Replacement of Subjec ts 
Subjects may be replaced for any of the following reasons: 
• Subject is not evaluable for DLTs (see Section  5.5.1.1). 
• In the Phase 2 mandatory biopsy cohorts, subject has not met the biopsy requirements 
for the study (ie, pre- and on- treatment samples).  
• Subject does not meet the eligibility requirements of the study (eg, accidental 
enrollment).  
4.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
After signing the ICF, screening assessments may be completed over a per iod of up to 28 days.  
Each subject enr olled in the study may receive treatment in continuous 28- day ( mFOLFOX6 or 
nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine ) or 21 -day cycles ( all other chemotherapy regimens ) if, in the 
judgment of the investigator, the subject is receivi ng benefit from treatment and has not met any 
criteria for treatment discontinuation .   
Subjects who complete a standard duration of chemotherapy, or who must stop chemotherapy 
due to cumulative chemotherapy -related toxicities , may continue on pembrolizuma b for a total of  
35 pembrolizumab infusions and epacadostat through the end of the cycle in which the 35th pembrolizumab infusion is administered.  Subjects may not start a new  or different 
chemotherapy regimen during this period.  Unless a maximum number of chemotherapy cycles 
are noted in the Protocol (see Section  5.3), subjects may continue chemotherapy beyond the 
maximum administration of epacadostat or pembrolizumab  at the discretion of the treating 
physician  in line with local prescribing labels, treatment guidelines , and/or standards of care.  If 
subjects are continued on chemotherapy, contraception methods should continue for 180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy .

Subjects who must discontinue epacadostat due to epacadostat -related toxicities may continue 
pembrolizumab for a total of 35 pembrolizumab infusions.  Unless a maximum number of 
chemotherapy cycles are noted in the Protocol (see Section  5.3), subjects may continue 
chemotherapy beyond the maximum administration of pembrolizumab at the discretion of the 
treating physician in line with local prescribing labels, treatment guidelines, and/or standards of 
care.  If subjects are continued on chemotherapy, contraception methods should continue for 
180 days after the last dose of chemotherapy . 
Once a subject discontinues epacadostat  and pembrolizumab, the subject will enter the follow -up 
period (see Section  6.4). 
Study participation, including post- treatment follow -up, is expected to average 16 months for an 
individual subject (mFOLFOX 6:  18-24 months, nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine:  8-12 months; 
paclitaxel /carboplatin:  12-18 months; peme trexed /platinum agent:  12- 18 m onths; 
cyclophosphamide:  4-6 months ; gemcitabine/platinum agent:  8-12 months; platinum 
agent/5 -fluorouracil:  8-12 months). 
4.5. Overall Study Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF.  The end of the study will occur when all 
subjects h ave discontinued epacadostat and pembrolizumab and have completed the 30- and 
90-day safety follow- up assessments or a minimum of 18 weeks after initial study medication 
administration.  If by the end of the study there remains at least 1 subject still on study treatment for at least 18 weeks, the subject(s) may enter additional treatment cycles.  At this point, a 
database lock of the study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data.  Any remaining 
subjects may continue to receive study medication s and be seen by the investigator per usual 
standard of care for this subject population.  In addition, t he investigator will be expected to 
monitor for and report any SAEs, AEs of special interest, and pregnancies, as detailed in Section  8.  The remaining subjects are considered to be on study until a discontinuation criterion 
is met and written notification is provided to the sponsor. 
4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.  The investigator is to notify the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, and send a copy of t he notification to the sponsor or sponsor' s designee and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively, if required by regulatory decision, or upon 
review of emerging data.  If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for 
termination of the study.

5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1. Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
Each subject will be identified in the study by a subject ID number, which is a combination of 
the site ID and subject number.  Site staff should contact the interactive response technology 
(IRT) to obtain the subject ID number during screening.  This subject ID number will be 
maintained  throughout the study and will not be reassigned.  Subjects who fail screening and are 
repeating the screening process due to a change in eligibility status will be assigned a new 
subject ID number.  For subjects who signed an ICF but are not treated, refe r to the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) Completion Guidelines for instructions on which eCRFs to complete. 
Site staff will contact the IRT to enroll the subject and obtain the initial assignment for the 
relevant treatments .  The investigator or designe e will select the assigned treatments  from the 
stock that correspond to the number provided by the IRT, record the unique identifiers in the 
eCRF, and dispense the treatment  to the subject.  All subsequent dispensing of relevant 
treatments  should follow this process.  Full details will be provided in the IRT manual.  
If a subject is mistakenly given treatment that is not assigned by the IRT, the IRT help desk must 
be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of the treatment must be documented 
by the study site.

Subjects must receive premedications (IV or PO) with corticosteroids and antiemetics based on 
institutional guidelines, investigator practice, or local prescribing information or standards of 
care.  All premedications must be recorded in the eCRF.  Subjects r eceiving cisplatin must also 
receive hydration as per institutional guidelines.  
Subjects must meet minimum criteria for start of each chemotherapy cycle as outlined in Appendix M , Section  M.1 . 
Gemcitabine and platinum agent will be administered in a 21 -day cycle for a maximum of 
6 cycles.  Subjects will receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m
2 over 30 minutes (± 5 min) on Days 1 
and 8.  Administration of a platinum agent (carboplatin AUC  5 IV over 30 minutes [± 5 min] or 
cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours [± 5 min]) will follow the gemcitabine infusion on Day 1.  
The dose of carboplatin should be calculated based on local or institutional standards, and  the 
maximum dose may be limited based on these standards. 
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 efficacy expansion subjects  enrolled in Treatment Group F, applicable 
chemotherapy agent  will be administered after epacadostat and pembrolizumab (if applicable) on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 , Cycle 1 Day 8, and Cycle 2 Day  1  
. 
For Phase 2 mandatory biopsy subjects enrolled in Treatment  Group F , only IV chemotherapy 
will be administered during Cycle 1, and epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and IV chemotherapy will 
be administe red starting on Cycle 2 Day 1. 
Sites are instructed to consult local prescribing information for additional information and 
instructions for preparation and infusion of gemcitabine and the applicable platinum agent. 
Subjects may receive prophylactic G -CSF support with filgrastim per institutional guidelines.  
Prophylactic G -CSF should not be given in the first cycle unless discussed with the medical 
monitor. 
5.3.7.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling 
In countries where carboplatin , cisplatin, gemcitabine, or their generic equivalents are available, 
investigators are responsible for ensuring that subjects receive commercially available supplies 
of these therapies for the entire duration of study participation.  Incyte may provide ce rtain 
reference therapies where required by applicable law or regulation or under other limited 
circumstances when a subject may not otherwise have access to these therapies.  The contents of 
the labels will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.

5.3.8.1. Description and Administration 
Subjects must receive premedications (IV or PO) with corticosteroids and antiemetics based on 
institutional guidelines, investigator practice, or local prescribing information o r standards of 
care.  All premedications must be recorded in the eCRF.  Subjects receiving cisplatin must also 
receive hydration as per institutional guidelines.  
Subjects must meet minimum criteria for start of each chemotherapy cycle as outlined in 
Appendix N , Section  N.1. 
Subjects will receive a platinum agent (carboplatin AUC 5 IV over 30 minutes [± 5 min] or 
cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes [± 5 min] ) on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle  followed by 
5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 per day IV continuous infusion on Days 1 through 4 (for a total dose 
of 4000 mg/m2 over 96 hours ) of each 21- day cycle for a maximum of 6  cycles.   The dose of 
carboplatin should be calculated based on loc al or institutional standards , and the maximum dose 
may be limited based on these standards. 
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 efficacy expansion subjects  enrolled in Treatment Group G, platinum 
agent/5 -fluorouracil will be administered after epacadostat and pembrolizumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 
and Cycle 2 Day 1 . 
For Phase 2 mandatory biopsy subjects enrolled in Treatment Group G, only IV chemotherapy 
will be administered during Cycle 1, and epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and IV chemotherapy will 
be administered starting on Cycle 2 Day 1.   
Sites are instructed to consult local prescribing information for additional information and 
instructions for preparation and infusion of applicabl e platin um agent and 5-fluorouracil.

5.4. Treatment Compliance  
Epacadostat and cyclophosphamide are oral medications, and compliance will be calculated by 
the sponsor based on the drug accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the 
sponsor/designee (tablet counts).  The objective is 100% compliance, and site  staff should 
evaluate compliance at each visit and take appropriate steps to optimize compliance.  
Pembrolizumab, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, ci splatin, paclitaxel, 
pemetrexed, gemcitabine, and nab- paclitaxel are administered as an IV infusion by site 
personnel.  Receipt of infusions will be documented by the site staff and monitored by the 
sponsor/designee. 
5.5. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.5.1. Dose Modifications 
Modifications to epacadostat dosing are planned for the Phase 1 cohorts (see Section  4.1.1).  
Dose modifications in the form of reductions, interruption, or discontinuation of components of 
the chemotherapy regimen  and/or interruption or discontinuation of pembrolizumab or 
epacadostat may  also be needed for individual subjects in the event of a DLT or AE (related or 
unrelated to treatment).  Intrasubject dose escalation for epacadostat, pembrol izumab , or any 
chemotherapy drug  is not permitted.  
5.5.1.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity and Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose 
A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any of the toxicities in  Table 3 occurring up to and 
including Day 28 for the cohorts where mFOLFOX6 and nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine  are 
administered and Day 21 for all other chemotherapy regimens in Phase 1 , except those with a 
clear alternative explanation (eg,  disease progression) or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal 
laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms based on investigator determination.  Immune- related AEs of Grade 3 that improve to Grade 1 or lower 
within 14 days after the initiation of supportive care or corticosteroid therapy can be deemed a 
non-DLT.  All DLTs will be assessed by the investigator using CTCAE v4.0 criteria  
(Appendix E ).  To be considered evaluable for dose tolerability , subjects should meet 1 of the 
following criteria:  1) receive the cohort-specified dose of epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and 
chemotherapy for at least 80% of planned doses (45 doses epacadostat/2  doses pembrolizumab 
for subjects who receive mFOLFOX6 or nab- paclitaxel /gemcitabine ; 34 doses 
epacadostat/1  dose pembrolizumab for subjects who receive any other chemotherapy regimen ) 
and complete the DLT observation period, or  2) had a DLT during the DLT observation period. 
It is recognized that certain toxicities due to chemotherapy (eg, including but not limited to 
gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea; renal insufficiency; high -grade laboratory 
abnormalities; hypersensitivity/rash) may initially be clinically indistinguishable from toxicities due to immunotherapy.  Epacadostat will be held for these toxicities, and as a result, subjects 
may not receive at least 80% of the prescribed dose during Cycle 1.  In these cases, the SMC 
may assess subjects who receive dose intensities somewhat below 80% for the determination of 
DLTs, and consider in the adjudication process the specific toxicities encountered, likely cause of toxicities, and dose intensity and tolerability beyond Cycle 1. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 75 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
Individual subject dose reductions may be made based on events observed at any time during 
treatment with epacadostat ; however, for the purposes of dose cohort de- escalation, expanding a 
dose cohort, and determining the MTD of epacadostat, decisions will be made based on events that are observed from the first day of epacadostat  administration  through and including the final 
day of Cycle 1 ( Day 28 for the cohorts where mFOLFOX6 and nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine  are 
administered and Day 21 for all other chemotherapy regimens ).  A lower MTD of epacadostat 
may subsequently be determined based on rele vant toxicities that become evident after Day 28 
for the cohorts where mFOLFOX6 and nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine  are administered and Day 21 
for all other chemotherapy regimens .

5.5.1.1.2. Follow- Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or a ppears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 30 days , unless the subject discontinues epacadostat  and pembrolizumab, in which 
case, the subject will be followed for 90 days after the last dose of epacadostat  or pembrolizumab 
(whichever is later; see Section  8).  During follow-up, subjects should be seen as of ten as 
medically indicated to en sure safety.  
5.5.1.2. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose De-Escalation 
Regular  telephone conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with study investigators in order 
to review cohort- specific data and overall safety data, agree on dose de-escalation, adjudicate 
individual high- grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other major study decisions. 
5.5.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Reductions or Interruption s of Epacadostat 
and/or Pembrolizumab 
Dose reductions of epacadostat for the management of AEs are not permitted; however, 
administration may be delayed for management of toxicities  (see Section  5.5.3 and Appendix G ).  
Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that the investigator consult with  the medical 
monitor (or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting t herapy for 
reasons other than Protocol-mandated medication hold.  Additionally, the investigator must notify the sponsor' s medical monitor and study project manager via email before restarting 
epacadostat  that was temporarily interrupted because of an AE. 
For specific guidance for interruption of epacadostat in the event of SS, see Section  5.5.6. 
Dose reductions of pembr olizumab for the management of AEs is not permitted; however, 
administration may be delaye d for management of toxicities  (see Section  5.5.3 and Appendix G ). 
Dose interruptions of epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab may be permitted in the case of medical/surgical ev ents or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (eg, elective surgery, 
unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or holidays).  Subjects will be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption.  The reason for interruption should be documented in the eCRF.

5.5.3. Management of Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Adverse events associated with epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab exposure may represent an 
immunologic etiology.  These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after t he first dose 
or several months after the last dose of epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab treatment and may 
affect more than 1 body system simultaneously.  Therefore, early recognition and initiation of 
treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs 
were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of epacadostat and/or  pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care.  For suspected irAEs, ensure 
adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes.  Additional procedures or tests 
such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation.  
Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue epacadostat and/or 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids.  Dose modification and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated with epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab are provided in 
Appendix G .  Subjects who develop a ≥ Grade 2 irAE should be discussed immediately with the 
sponsor. 
It is important to note that some chemotherapy -related AEs will overlap with potential irAEs 
(including but not limited to gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea; renal insufficiency; 
high-grade laboratory abnormalities ; rash/hypersensitivity).  In these cases, both the 
chemotherapy -related AE ( see Section  5.5.4) and irAE management guidance ( Appendix G ) 
should be reviewed to determine the most appropriate management of therapy. 
5.5.4. Management of Chemotherapy- Related Adverse Events  
Dose modifications for hematologic and nonhematologic AEs related to chemotherapy may be 
managed per institutional guidelines.  In the absence of these, recommendations for dose 
modifications for the applicable chemotherapy regimen in the event of hematologic and nonhematologic AEs are provided in the Protocol appendices: 
• Appendix H  for subjects who receive mFOLFOX6  
• Appendix I  for subjects who receive nab- paclitaxel/gemcitabine   
• Appendix J  for subjects who receive paclitaxel /carboplatin  
• Appendix K  for subjects who receive pemetrexed /platinum agent  
• Appendix L  for subjects who receive cyclophosphamide  
• Appendix M  for subjects who receive gemcitabine/platinum agent  
• Appendix N  for subjects who receive platinum agent/5-fluorouracil 
It is important to note that some chemotherapy -related AEs will overlap with potential irAEs 
(including but not limited to gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea; renal insufficiency; high-grade laboratory abnormalities ; rash/hypersensitivity).  In these cases, both the 
chemotherapy -related AE and irAE management guidance ( Appendix G ) should be reviewed to 
determine the most appropriate management of therapy.

5.5.5. Treatment After Initial Radiologic Evidence of Disease Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents such as epacadostat and /or pembrolizumab may produce antitumor 
effects by potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns 
seen with immunotherapeutic agents  may extend beyond the typical time course of responses 
seen with cytotoxic agents and can manifest as a clinical response after an i nitial increase in 
tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. 
RECIST v1.1 will be adapted for defining PD to account for the unique tumor response seen 
with immunotherapies.  This adaptation is known as irRECIST and will be used to guide treatment  decisions for discontinuation of therapy due to disease progression.  These disease 
assessments will be performed by the study site . 
If radiographic imaging shows PD,  it is at the discretion of the investigator to keep a subject on 
treatment or to stop treatment until imaging is repeated ≥ 4 weeks (but not ≥ 6 weeks)  later in 
order to confirm PD.  When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed .  The decision to continue treatment after the first evidence of disease progression is at 
the investigator 's discretion and should be based on the clinical status of the subject as described 
in Table 4. 
Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are clinically  stable 
as defined by the following criteria:  
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Subjects who are clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for the confirmation 
of PD.  
In subjects wh o discontinue study therapy without documented disease progression, every effort 
should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by radiologic imaging until the subject has confirmed PD, starts a new anticancer therapy, withdraws consent , or die s.

5.5.6. Procedure for Subjects Exhibiting Serotonin Syndrome  
There is a rare chance that epacadostat could cause an increase in serotonin levels in the brain 
that might trigger SS when administered in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This 
syndrome has been most closely associated with use of MAOIs, meperidine , linezolid, or 
methylene blue; all of these agents are prohibited during the study.  Selective s erotoni n reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are 
permitted in the study.   
Serotonin syndrome usually manifests with autonomic changes, mental status changes, and neurological findings.  These mild, moderate, and severe signs and symptoms of SS ( see Table 5) 
should be evaluated  in the context  of possible comorbid conditions as well.   The following 
procedures will be implemented if subjects exhibit the signs/symptoms  of SS, including tremor; 
hyperreflexia; and spontaneous, ocular, or inducible clonus, together with agitation, fever, 
diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity: 
• Immediately interrupt epacadostat , pembrolizumab , and chemotherapy (if applicable)  
administration.  
• Immediately interrupt any SSRI or SNRI administration.  
• Provide appropriate medical management of the subject until all signs/symptoms are resolved (eg, IV fluids and/or sympathomimetic amines for hypotension, 
benzodiazepines for agitation, administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, 
such as cyproheptadine). 
• If etiologies other than SS are excluded, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (if 
applicable) administration may  be resumed unless other AE management guidelines 
apply for the specific event.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 80 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
• If subject chooses to remain in the study, restart treatment with epacadostat after the 
SSRI or SNRI has been discontinued, no sooner than 5 half- lives have elapsed for the 
specific SSRI or SNRI in question and after resolution of signs/symptoms of SS.  The 
SSRI or SNRI  treatment  MAY NOT be restarted.  
• If subject chooses to withdraw from the study or must restart treatment with SSRI or 
SNRI, the subject should be scheduled for a follow-up visit.  Treatment with SSRI or 
SNRI may be initiated 2 weeks after resolution of signs and symptoms of SS. 
• If subject experiences moderate or  severe unconfounded SS in the opinion of the 
investigator, without concomitant SSRI  or SNR I usage, or serotonergic concomitant 
medications, only pembrolizumab administration may  be resumed; epacados tat 
treatment should be permanently discontinued.

5.6. Discontinuation of Sub jects  From Study Treatment  
5.6.1. Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be withdrawn from the study at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the investigator or the sponsor if enrollment in the study is inappropriate, the study 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.   
Subjects must  be discontinued from treatment for the following reasons: 
• Unacceptable AEs as descri bed in Appendix G , Table G -1 with a requirement to 
permanently discontinue. 
• The subject becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn by the subject . 
Note :  Consent withdrawn means that the subject can no longer be followed and no 
additional data can be collected . 
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per irRECIST .  See Section  5.5.5, 
Section  7.6.2.1, and  Appendix F . 
• The subject has an unacceptable toxicity or a toxicity that does not recover in 
12 weeks.  Investigators who wish to continue treatment after a treatment delay of 
12 weeks should consult with the sponsor's medical monitor for approval. 
• The subject has completed 35 infusions of pembrolizumab and completed epacadostat 
treatment through the end of the cycle in which the 35th  pembrolizumab infusion is 
administered .  If the subject has discontinued epacadostat for epacadostat- related 
toxicities but continued on pembrolizumab monotherapy, the subject must be discontinued after 35 infusions of pembrolizumab. 
• The study is t erminated  by the sponsor. 
• The study is t erminated  by the lo cal health authority, IRB, or IEC. 
A subject may be  discontinued from treatment as follows: 
• The subject has attained a confirmed CR and has been treated for at least 24 weeks with epacadostat and pembrolizumab and had at least 2 infusions of pembrolizumab 
beyond the date of initial CR. 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will determine 
whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or epacadostat  administration in 
the investigator 's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling 
the subject.

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
5.6.2. Discontinuation Procedures  
Discontinuation of epacadostat  and pembrolizumab does not constitute study withdrawal or 
completion.  The subject will proceed to the safety follow-up period when epacadostat  and 
pembrolizumab are permanently discontinued.  The EOT  visit should be conducted whenever 
possible except when subjects are physically unable to travel to the site for the EOT visit, have 
withdrawn consent, or are lost to follow up.  Reasonable efforts should be made to have the 
subject return for the safety follow-up visit to have procedures completed as described in 
Section  6.  The date the subject was discontinued from epacadostat  and pembrolizumab and the 
specific reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a subject is discontinued from epacadostat and pembrolizumab: 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason (s) for the discontinuation must be documented in the subject' s medical 
record and in the eCRF.  
• The EOT or early termination visit should be performed. 
• The date epacadostat and pembrolizumab was discontinued should be recorded in the 
IRT. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
epacadostat –related or pembrolizumab–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, 
or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer.  
5.7. Procedures for Withdrawal From Study  
If the subject discontinues epacadostat and pembrolizumab and actively withdraws consent for 
collection of follow- up data (ie, subsequent anticancer treatments  and safety follow -up), then no 
additional data collection should occur.  The date the subject was withdrawn from the study will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.8. Concomitant Medications 
Medications  or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the study.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications, discontinuation from study therapy may be required.  The investigator should discuss any 
questions regarding this with the sponsor.  The final decision on any supportive therapy rests 
with the investigator and/or the subject' s primary physician.  However, the decision to continue 
the subject on study therapy requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and 
the subject.  
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before Cycle 1 Day 1  and 90 days after the 
last dose of epacadostat  or pembrolizumab (whichever is later) should be recorded.  Concomitant 
medications administered in  the 90 days after the last dose of epacadostat  or pembrolizumab 
(whichever is later) should be recorded for SAEs and AEs as defined in Section  8.

5.8.1. Permitted  (Acceptable) Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject 's welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF, including all 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen , frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF. 
5.9. Restricted Medications  
• Systemic steroids may be used at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents. 
• Use of coumarin-based anticoagulants (eg, warfarin ) is discouraged.  Low-dose 
warfarin  (1 mg) is acceptable; however, doses that increase the INR are discouraged 
and may require dose modification.  If an alternative to coumarin- based 
anticoagulants cannot be used, close INR monitoring is recommended. 
• Use of the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (a UGT1A9 inducer) is discouraged.  Because there is a potential interaction that could result in lower epacadostat 
exposures, an alternative to carbamazepine should be used, if possible. 
5.10. Prohibited Medications /Treatment 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies starting from screening  through 
EOT  period of this study unless otherwise noted below: 
• Any investigational medication other than epacadostat, pembrolizumab, or the 
assigned chemotherapy regimen . 
• Any anticancer medications, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy other than epacadostat, pembrolizumab, or the assigned chemotherapy

Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The exclusion criteria (Section  3.2) des cribe  other medications that are prohibited during this 
study.  There are no prohibited therapies during the post- treatment follow -up period. 
5.10.1. Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the  
treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Appendix G , Table G-1.  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV 
treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if symptoms do not 
improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require additiona l supportive care.  It may be necessary to perform 
conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of 
evaluation of the event. 
The dose modification and supportive care guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab.  If after 
the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pembrolizumab and/or epacadostat, the i nvestigator does not need to follow the dose modification and supportive care 
guidelines.

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
Additionally, subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary 
by the treating investigator, including, but not limited to, the items outlined below: 
• Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice.  Subjects 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
• Diarrhea:   See Appendix G , Table G-1. 
• Infection :  Subjects with a documented infectious complication should receive oral or 
IV antibiotics or other anti- infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating 
investigator for a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional 
practice.  
• Infusion- related reactions with pembrolizumab:  See Appendix G , Section  G.3. 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, subjects will only be required to visit the clinic per standard of 
care.  Safety (including laboratory analytes) assessments that are consistent with the standard of 
care for the subject's condition should be performed via local labs.  Disease status should 
continue to be monitored by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) , or PET -CT scan as appropriate at a frequency consistent with the standard of care for the 
subject 's disease.  
As of Amendment 7, data will only be collected for informed consent, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, EOT disposition (reason for discontinuation), drug accountability, dosing 
information, end of study ( EOS ) disposition (end of study form), and death if it occurs within the 
safety reporting period.  See Table 6 for protocol- required assessment s to limit clinic visits and 
procedures for subjects.  Only Table  6 should be followed by all subjects in all cohorts 
continuing on- treatment beyond Amendment 7 .  All other tables in this section may be 
disregarded . 
All study assessments will be performed as indicated in the schedule of assessments ( Table 7, 
Table 9, Table 11, Table 12, and Table 14) and all laboratory assessments will be performed as 
indicated in Table 8, Table 10, Table 13, and Table 15.  Table 16 presents a summary of clinical laboratory analytes to be assessed.  See Section  7 for instructions on each assessment.  Further 
details of study procedures and assessments can be found in the S tudy Reference Manual.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between the signing of the ICF and the day that the subject is enrolled 
and received the first dose of treatment in the study (Cycle 1 Day 1) and must not exceed 
28 days .  The ICF must be obtained before performing any study-specific procedures.  
Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during screening process . 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 109 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
Procedures conducted as pa rt of the subject's routine clinical management (eg, blood count, 
imaging) and obtained before signing the ICF  may be used for screening, provided that the 
procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been performed within the required 
timeframe.  All information associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into the 
appropriate eCRF pages. 
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before 
enrollment or the administration of epacadostat, pembrolizumab , or chemotherapy regimen .  
Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during screening if the 
investigator believes the results to be in error.  For screening assessments that are repeated, the 
most recent avai lable result before treatment assignment will be used to determine subject 
eligibility.  Treatment should start as soon as possible but within 7 days after the date of 
enrollment.  Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening proces s 1 time 
if the investigator believes that there has been a change in eligibility status.  
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day that the subject receives the first dose of treatment in the 
study on Cycle 1 Day 1 and may continue in 28- day cycles  (mFOLFOX6 or 
nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine ) or 21 -day cycles ( all other chemotherapy regimens ) if, in the 
judgment of the investigator, the subject is receiving benefit from treatment and has not met any 
criteria for treatment discontinuation .  See Section  4.4 for details on the maximum duration of 
treatment.  
Cycle 1 Day 1 must be no more than 28 days after the subject has signed the ICF.  
6.3. End of Treatment 
The EOT visit will be conducted  when the subject permanently discontinues epacadostat  and 
pembrolizumab ( + 7 days).  As the discontinuation date of epacadostat may differ from that of 
pembrolizumab, the EOT visit should be conducted on the latter of the 2 dates.  
If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data will be entered in the EOT page in the eCRF.  The subject 
should be encouraged to return for the follow-up visits. 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is t he interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled safety 
follow-up visit(s), which should occur 30 days (± 7 days) and 90 days (± 7 days) after the EOT 
visit.  Adverse event s and SAEs must be reported up until at least 90 days (120 days for 
pregnancy) after the EOT visit , the date of the follow-up visit, or until epacadostat - or 
pembrolizumab- related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longer.  If an EOT visit was not conducted, the last dose of epacadostat or 
pembrolizumab (whichever is later) should be used as the start of the safety follow-up period. 
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the follow-up visit and report 
any AEs that may occur during this period.  If the subject cannot return to the site for the safety 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 110 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
follow-up visit, the subject should be contacted by telephone for assessment of AEs and SAEs, 
and this should be documented in the eCRF. 
Adverse event s and SAEs before the start of the new anticancer therapy must be repor ted.  If a 
subject begin s a new anticancer therapy before the end of the 30 -day or 90- day safety follow -up 
period, the safety follow-up visit should be performed before the new anticancer therapy is 
started.  
6.4.2. Disease Status Follow- Up 
As of Amendment 7, dise ase status follow -up visits for subjects who discontinued for any reason 
other than disease progression are no longer required.  The last study visit will be the 90- day 
safety follow -up visit. 
6.4.3. Survival Follow- Up 
As of Amendment 7, survival follow-up visits for Phase 2 subjects are no longer required.  The 
last study visit will be the 90 -day safety follow- up visit.  
6.5. End of Study  
Subjects will be considered as having completed the study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained. 
Note:  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death. 
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact related to this study. 
− Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of 
jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise 
entitled.  Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason a 
subject withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is terminated by the local health authority or IRB or IEC. 
NOTE :  As of Amendment 7, the 90-day safety follow- up visit will be considered the EOS  
for an individual subjec t unless any of the above conditions have been met before this visit.  
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.   Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF.

7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study- specific procedures , using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains all elements 
required by ICH E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by the investigator, 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation.  
Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study  (see Appendix A ). 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure 
The IRT will be contacted to obtain a subject identification number when a subject enters the 
screening period .  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be 
contacted to enroll the subject and obtain treatment group assignment.  Additionally, the IRT will 
be contacted at each regular stud y visit, as appropriate,  to update the relevant  treatment  supply.  
The IRT will also be contacted  when the subject permanently discontinues treatment . 
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening by the investigator or qualified designee and will include date of birth, race, ethnicity (where 
allowed by local regulations), medical and surgical history, and concurrent illnesses assessed 
using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 ( NCI 2010).   Medical history should include all active conditions 
and any condition considered to be clinically significant by the investigator.   
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
Details regarding  the disease for which the subject has enrolled in this study (eg, date of 
diagnosis, primary tumor histology, previous systemic therapies, surgeries, radiation therapy, and 
stage of cancer) will be collected at screening.

7.4. Prior  and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, use of concomitant medications should be monitored for subjects 
to verify that subjects are not taking any concomitant medication prohibited per protocol; 
however, concomitant medications no longer need to be collected in the eCRF. 
Prior and concomitant medications  and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures must be recorded in the eCRF, and any 
medication received  or procedure performed within 28 days before enrollment and up until the 
subject discontinues from the study will be recorded in the e CRF.  The medication record will be 
maintained  after  signing the ICF  to document concomitant medications , including any changes to 
the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over-the-counter 
medications , or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during the study period.  
Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition during the study will also be recorded in the e CRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
NOTE:  As of Amendment  7, safety assessments should be as per site standard of care.  Only 
AEs leading to discontinuation and SAEs will be collected in the eCRF.  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in e liciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with epacadostat, pembrolizumab , or chemotherapy regimen .  The definition, 
reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section  8. 
All AEs of unknown etiology associated with epacadostat  or pembrolizumab exposure should be 
evaluated to determine if it is possibly an irAE.  See Section  5.5.3 and Appendix G  regarding the 
identification, evaluation, and management of AEs of potenti al immunologic etiology.  
7.5.2. Physical Examinations 
7.5.2.1. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced r egistered nurse practitioner,  as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include height and the following organ or body 
system assessments:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; ly mph nodes; and a brief neurologic examination.  
Clinically significant abnormal findings during screening should be recorded as medical history. 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
7.5.2.2. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed physical examination as clinically 
indicated before treatment administration.  A targeted physical examination will be a 
symptom- directed evaluation conducted by the investigator or designee.  The targeted physical 
examination will include assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject 
symptoms, AEs, or other findings.  New clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs.  
7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature, and 
weight.   Clinically significant abnormal findings during screening should be recorded as medical 
history.  New clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. 
7.5.4. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position 
after 5 minutes of rest  and should not be performed within 15 minutes after a blood collection.  
Electrocardiograms  must be obtained at screening for all subjects; s ubsequent ECGs may  be 
obtained during the treatment period as clinically indicated.   
The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site and will be used for 
immediate subject management.  The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a 
subject from the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the 
responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as 
appropriate.  Clinically significant abnormal findings during screening should be recorded as medical history.  New clinically  significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. 
7.5.5. Laboratory Assessments 
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, l aboratory assessments only need to be performed in accordance 
with standard of care at each investigational site for the subject's condition and monitoring .  
Laboratory results do not need to be reported in the CRF, but all laboratory results corresponding with an SAE will be reported on the SAE form. 
Laboratory tests for screening period should be performed by the site 's local laboratory  within 
7 day s before the first dose of  treatment .  Clinically significant abnormal findings during 
screening should be recorded as medical history.  After Cycle 1, predose laboratory procedures 
can be conducted up to 72 hours before administration of epacadostat, pemb rolizumab , and/or 
chemotherapy regimen .  Results must be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee and 
found to be acceptable befor e each dose of treatment.   New clinically significant abnormal 
findings should be recorded as AEs. 
7.5.5.1. Serum Chemistry  
A comprehensive serum chemistry will be performed as clinically indicated.  Appropriate 
monitoring intervals should be discussed with the medical monitor in these circumstances.  
Serum chemistry tests will be performed by the site 's local laboratory.

Hematology with differential will be performed as clinically indicated.  Appropriate monitoring 
intervals should be discussed with the medical monitor in these circumstances.  Hematology with 
differential will be performed by the site 's local laborato ry. 
7.5.5.3. Liver Chemistry  
Liver chemistry  tests will be performed as clinically indicated.  Appropriate monitoring intervals 
should be discussed with the medical monitor in these circumstances .  Liver chemistry tests  will 
be performed by the site 's local laboratory.  
7.5.5.4. Coagulation Panel 
A coagulation panel will be performed as clinically indicated .  The coagulation panel will be 
performed by the site 's local laboratory.  
7.5.5.5. Endocrine Function  
Endocrine function tests will be performed as clinically indicated.  Endocrine function testing 
analysis will be performed by the site 's local laboratory. 
7.5.5.6. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will be performed as clinically indicated.   Urinalysis will be performed by  the site 's 
local laboratory.  
7.5.5.7. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be r equired for all women of childbearing potential during screening 
and as clinically indicated . 
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on study, the subject will immediately be discontinued from study treatment .  The site will contact the subject at least monthly and 
document the subject' s status until the first well-baby visit to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the 
outcome is an SAE (eg, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or 
life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study investigator will make every 
effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of 
the fetus or newborn to the sponsor.  If a male subject impregnates his female partner, the study 
personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the sponsor and followed as described above and in Section  8.5. 
7.5.5.8. Serology 
Serology will be performed at screening only to assess eli gibility for inclusion in the study.

7.6. Efficacy Assessments  
NOTE :  As of Amendment 7, no further efficacy assessment will be required beyond Week 18.  
Imaging for the study will only be required at Week 9 and Week 18 per RECIST v1.1.  After 
Week 18, CT/MRI or PET -CT assessments a re only required to be performed as per standard of 
care guidelines for the subject 's condition and monitoring.  Subjects must be withdrawn from the 
study if, in the opinion of the investigator, the disease has progressed and the subject is no longer having clinical benefit from the study treatment. 
7.6.1. Initial Tumor Imaging 
Initial tumor imaging must be performed within 28 days before the first dose of treatment.   The 
site study team must review prestudy images to confirm that the subject has measurable disease 
per RECIST v1.1. 
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening 
scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days before the first dose of 
treatment.  The same imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout the study.   
Baseline scan must be a contrast CT or MRI, except in circumstances where there is a contrast 
allergy or with medical monitor approval.  When the CT component of a positron emission 
tomography/CT uses higher energy and thinner slices, it may be acceptable (with medical monitor approval).  A standard, full assessment for lesions should be conducted at baseline, 
including CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  The same modality (CT or MRI) 
should be used for follow-up assessments every 9 weeks, including radiologic assessments of all sites of disease present at baseline.  In addition to radiologic monitoring, all other lesions 
observed at the screening visit should be followed. 
For selection of target lesions, RECIST v1.1 should be followed.  For example, RECIST 
discourages selection of target lesions inside the field of previous irradiation.  Lesions situated in 
a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not 
considered measurable unless it is the solitary site of measurable disease AND there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Also, if a subject has only 1 measurable lesion, this 
lesion should not be biopsied. 
7.6.2. Tumor Imaging During the Study  
Tumo r imaging should be continued on treatment and assessed per RECIST v1.1, and the same 
imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout the study.  Imaging should be 
performed every 9 weeks (± 7 days) from Cycle 1 Day 1  for the first 12 months of tr eatment .  
After 12 months of treatment, the assessments should be performed  every 12 weeks (± 7 days).  
Assessments should continue to be performed until disease progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever occurs 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 116 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
first.  More frequent scanning is allowed, if clinically indicated.  Imaging should not be 
delayed for delays in cycle starts or extension of combination treatment cycle intervals.  
Response should be confirmed by a repeat radiographic assessment not less than 4 weeks from 
the date the response was first documented.  The scan for confirmation of response may be performed at the earliest of 4 weeks after the first indication of response or at the next scheduled 
scan (9 weeks late r), whichever is clinically indicated.  
Disease progression should be confirmed at least 4 weeks (but not later than 6 weeks) after the 
first scan indicating PD in clinically stable subjects.  Subjects who have unconfirmed disease 
progression may continue on treatment until progression is confirmed provided that  they have 
met the conditions detailed in Section  7.6.2.1. 
7.6.2.1. Assessment of Progressive Disease According to Immune- Related RECIST 
Criteria  
RECIST v1.1 will be adapted for defining PD to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapies.  This adaptation is known as irRECIST and will be used to guide 
treatment decisions for discontinuation of therapy due to disease progression. 
If imaging shows PD,  it is at the discretion of the investigator to keep a subject on treatment or to 
stop treatment until imaging is repeated ≥ 4 weeks later, but not ≥ 6 weeks later, to confirm PD.  
When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed; however, the decision to continue treatment after the first evidence of disease progression is at the 
investigator's discretion based on the clinical status of the subject. 
Subjects may continue to receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD (see  Table 4) if 
they are clinically stable as defined by the following criteria:  
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Subjects who are deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for 
confirmation.  If radiologic progression is confirmed, then the subject will be discontinued from treatment as specified in the Protocol, and the first radiographic evidence of PD should be the 
date of progression.  If radiologic progression is not confirmed, then the subject should 
resume/continue treatment and have their next scan according to the Protocol- specified schedule.  
If progression is not confirmed and the subject continues on treatment, the next scan that 
documents disease progression (and is confirmed by a second scan at least 4 weeks later) will be 
considered the date of disease progression. 
Note:   If a subject with confirmed radiographic progression (ie, 2 scans ≥ 4 weeks apart 
demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved, and there is no 
further increase in the tumor dimensions at the confirmatory scan, an exception may be considered to continue treatment upon consultation with the sponsor.  Clinically stable subjects 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 117 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
should also have at the confirmatory scan no further increase in the target lesions, no 
unequivocal increase in nontarget lesions, and no additional new lesions develop (nonworsening 
PD) to continue treatment.  
In determining whether the tumor burden has increased or decreased, investigators should 
consider all target lesions as well as nontarget lesions.   
Progressive disease is confirmed if ANY of th e following conditions are met on the subsequent 
confirmatory scan: 
• Target lesions reach the PD threshold (increase in tumor burden ≥ 20% and absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm relative to nadir), OR if the threshold has already been 
reached on the initial  scan showing PD, they remain above the threshold. 
• Nontarget lesions show unequivocal progression. 
• New lesions appear, OR if they appeared on the initial scan showing PD, they have grown.  
7.7. Performance and Quality -of-Life Assessments 
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7 , ECOG performance status will no longer be collected and sh ould 
be monitored only per the site's standard of care, if applicable.  
7.7.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG performance status ( Appendix C ) at 
screening , before the administration of treatment on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the EOT and 
safety follow -up visits as specified in the schedules of assessments (Table 7 , Table 9, Table 11, 
Table 12, and Table 14).

7.10. Other Study Procedures  
7.10.1. Distribution of  Subject Reminder Cards and Subject  Diaries  
Subjects will be provided with reminder cards at each visit.  All necessary instructions, such as 
administration instructions for epacadostat , concomitant medications, and reminders of visits to 
conduct laboratory tests, should be provided to the subject in writing on this reminder card, or on accompanying written materials.  Subject diaries may be used for the purpose of documenting 
epacadostat  administration and AEs.  The subject diary should have an area on which  the date 
and time of the last dose of epacadostat  taken before each visit will be recorded as well as the 
time (and content, if applicable to the visit) of the last meal.  On Cycle 1 Day 1 , subjects will 
also be given an SS information sheet for signs and symptoms of SS.  This information sheet also 
instructs subjects to seek immediate medical care if any of these symptoms are observed.  
7.10.2. Post-Treatment Anticancer Therapy Status  
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, post- treatment anticancer therapy will no longer be co llected.  
The investigator or qualified designee will enter  all new anticancer  therapy initiated after the last 
dose of epacadostat or pembrolizumab  (whichever is later)  in the eCRF .  If a subject initiates a 
new anticancer therapy before the scheduled 30-d ay or 90 -day safety follow-up visit, the 
appropriate safety follow-up visit should be rescheduled so it occur s before the first dose of the 
new anticancer therapy.  
7.10.3. Data Collection for Survival Follow- Up 
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, data collection for surviva l follow -up visits for Phase 2 subjects 
are no longer required.

For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
that occurs after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfu sion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form of the eCRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of new AEs should be continued for at least 90 days  after the last dose of epacadostat  or 
pembrolizumab, or 30 days following cessation of study treatment if the subject  initiates new 
anticancer therapy  (whichever is earlier ); monitoring for pregnancy should continue for 120 days 
after the last dose of epacadostat or pembrolizumab (whichever is later).  Adverse events 
(including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) sho uld be described using a diagnosis 
whenever possible rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE. 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs/SAEs associated with the disease progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression, the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, resulted in hospitalization, a life -threatening event, or death), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section  8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progress ion), it should be indicated that each event (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is related to disease progression on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF.

Incyte Corporation  Page 127 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.0 Grades 1 through 4.  The CTCAE v4.0 
severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death will be graded accordingly using 
Grades 1 through 4 and have the outcome noted as fatal.  If an event is not classified by CTCAE, 
the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening cons equences; urgent intervention indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  Adverse events may also be detected when the y are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the extent possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 
NOTE:  Causality assessment for epacadostat , pembrolizumab, and the chemotherapy regimen 
must be indicated.  If appropriate, the relationship to the combination may be assessed as well.  
• The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with regard to study drug. 
• The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recov ering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The seriousness, as per serious adverse event (SAE) definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event form and the treatment should be specified on the Prior/Concomitant Medications or Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event, and the outcome.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 128 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
AE, that l asts for 3  days before worsening to a Grade 3 severity.  The Grade 1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade 1 AE definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity from Grade 1 to Grade 3.  The 
Grade 3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event changed in intensity from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event 
either changed severity again or resolved.  
8.2. Laborat ory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the laboratory test result as an additional event.  
Laborator y abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade  3 or 4 AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of 
serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1.  A dose modification for the laboratory abnormality may be 
required (see Section  5.5) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test 
abnormality as an SAE.  
8.2.1. Potential Drug -Induced Liver In jury (Hy 's Law) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur before  the reporting of a potential DILI event (also known as Hy's Law).  All occurrences 
of potential DILIs meeting the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section  8.3.2 for 
reporting details).  
Potential drug-induced liver injury is defined as follows: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation ≥ 3 times ULN  
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis  (elevated serum 
ALP ) 
AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease, or 
the administration of other drugs  known to be hepatotoxic.

8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a substantial disruption of a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug[s] or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through 90 days 
(120 days for pregnancy) after the last dose of epacadostat  or pembrolizumab, or 30 days 
following cessation of study treatment if the subject i nitiates new anticancer therapy  (whichever 
is earlier ) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its 
occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol.  Any SAEs occurring more than 90 days  
(120 days for pregnancy) after the last dose of epacadostat  or pembroliz umab (whichever is later) 
should be reported to the sponsor or its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.  
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form of the eCRF.  
The investigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the study 
treatment .  NOTE:  Causality assessment for epacadostat, pembrolizumab, and the chemotherapy 
regimen must be indicated.  If appropriate, the relationship to the combination may be assessed 
as well.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 130 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Causality assessment for epacadostat , pembrolizumab, and each 
chemotherapy a gent administered must be indicated.  If appropriate, the relationship to the 
combination may be assessed as well.   Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact information of the sponsor' s study -specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, interrupted or discontinued), or 
subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, 
regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE  (new occurrence)  is not documented in the IBs for epacadostat or pembrolizumab or 
in the US prescribing information or EMA Summary of Product Characteristics for the chemotherapy agents  and is thought to be related to epacadostat, pembrolizumab, or 
chemotherapy agent , then the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further information 
from the investigator for reporting to health authorities.  The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notificati on (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the 
same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committee s in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries.  
NOTE:  As of Amendment 7, all SAEs regardless of causality relationship will be submitted to the sponsor as described above and entered in the  eCRF.

8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or metho d.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The study drug must be discontinued immediately (female subjects only; s ee 
Section  5.5.2 for the maximum permitted duration of study drug interruption). 
• The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well-baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal 
relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as w ell as follow -up to the 
first well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations, whichever is later.  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6. Events of Clinical Interest  
Events of clinical  interest (ECIs) must be recorded as such in the eCRF as an ECI.  
For this study, ECIs include: 
1. Potential drug-induced l iver injury (or Hy's Law) – an elevated AST or ALT laboratory 
value that is ≥ 3 × the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is ≥ 2 × the ULN and, at the same time, an ALP  laboratory value that is <  2 × the ULN, as 
determined by way of Protocol- specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory 
testing.  
Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents.  The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an under lying etiology.  The study site guidance for 
assessment and follow-up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).

2. An overdose of epacadostat or pembrolizumab that is not associated with clinical 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  For this study, an overdose will be defined as 
≥ 1000 mg of epacadostat or ≥ 1000 mg (5 times the dose) of pembrolizumab.  No 
specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of epacadostat or pembrolizumab.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for 
signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated.  
3. Serotonin syndrome (see Section  5.5.6 for further detail s). 
4. Any of the following AEs :  
a. ≥ Grade 3 diarrhea 
b. ≥ Grade 3 colitis 
c. ≥ Grade 2 pneumonitis 
d. ≥ Grade 3 rash or dermatitis  
e. Grade 4 laboratory  abnormality  
Events of clinical interest  that occur in any subject from the date of first dose of treatment 
through 90 days after EOT or the initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related to epacadostat  or pembrolizumab, must be recorded in the eCRF.  A 
detailed narrative of the event should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the event. 
8.7. Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of 
Overdose to the Sponsor  
For purposes of this study, an overdose is defined as an overdose will be defined as ≥ 1000 mg of 
epacadostat or ≥ 1000 mg (5 times the dose) of pembrolizumab.  All occurrences of overdose 
must be reported as an SAE (see Section  8.3.2 for reporting details).  
8.8. Warnings and Precau tions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the Investigator' s Brochure s (eIB, pIB ).  Additional 
safet y information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of 
Investigator Notifications (INs).  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study, as necessary.  If new significant risks are identi fied, they will be 
added to the ICF. 
8.9. Safety Monitoring Committee  
Due to the complexity of the study, an S MC will review safety data at regular intervals 
throughout the study.  The frequency of meetings will be contingent upon enrollment and availability of  safety data for analysis and review.  Details regarding membership, roles, and 
responsibilities of the committee are specified in the SMC charter .

8.10. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be r eported to the sponsor.  All product complaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.  
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information.  Any AE associated with a product 
complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.2 of this Protocol. 
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication with the product.

9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
The safety population includes all subjects enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of 
epacadostat .  All safety analyses will be based on the safety population. 
The full analysis set includes all subjects enrolled in the study who received at least 1  dose of 
epacadostat  and have at least 1 postbaseline assessment or who discontinued epacadostat .  All 
efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set . 
 
 
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
9.2.1. Sample Size in Phase 1  
A 3 + 3 + 3  design will be used in Phase 1 to determine the MTD or PAD and DLT of 
epacadostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab and 7 chemotherapy regimens.  The 
total number of subjects will depend on the frequency of DLTs and number of dose levels tested before MTD or PAD is established.  Based on 3 + 3 + 3 design algorithm, within each treatment group, a minimum of 6 subjects and up to 9 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level. 
9.2.2. Sample Size in Phase 2  
9.2.2.1. Efficacy Expansion 
NOTE:  As of 25 OCT 2018, this study is closed to enrollment.  As of this date, no subjects were 
enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) or  Phase 2 mandatory biopsy 
Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G; therefore , disreg ard this section. 
Phase 2 consists of expansion cohorts (efficacy and mandatory biopsy) in specific tumor types 
(advanced or metastatic CRC, PDAC, squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC, UC, SCCHN, or any 
advanced or metastatic solid tumor that progressed on previous therapy with a PD -1 or PD- L1 
inhibitor).  A Simon 2-stage design will be used for the CRC and PDAC efficacy expansion 
cohorts.  The response rates for the historical control (p
0), desired  response rates for the 
combination (p 1), number of subjects needed in Stage 1 (n 1) and Stage 2 (n 2), total number of 
subjects (n), first -stage threshold declaring cohort undesirable (r 1), and  the upper limit of the 
number of responses in n subject s such that futility of the drug is concluded (r) are provided for 
each ex pansion cohort in  Table 21. 
In addition, a single-stage Phase 2 expansion will be used for all other efficacy  expansion 
cohorts.  The sample sizes and decision rules are summarized  in Table 22.  The definitions of p 0, 
p1, n, and r are the same as those in  Table 21. 
The calculation is  based on a 1-sided Type I error of 0.1 and power of 80%, with the exception 
of the cohort enrolling solid tumors that progressed on previous treatment with a PD -1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor, which is  based on a 1-sided Type I error of 0.1 and power of approximately 98%.

9.4.4. Saf
ety Analyses 
9.4.4.1. Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent AE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a 
pre-existing event after the first dose of epacadostat , pembrolizumab, or chemotherapy .  Analysis 
of AEs will be limited to treatme nt-emergent AEs, but data listings will include all AEs 
regardless of their timing to treatment  administration.  Adverse events will be tabulated by the 
MedDRA preferred term and system organ class.  Severity of AEs will be based on the NCI 
CTCAE v4.0 using Grades 1 through 4. 
The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to epacadostat  will be 
considered to be treatment-related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify the relationship of 
the AE to epacadostat , the AE will be con sidered treatment -related.  The incidence of AEs and 
treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.

9.4.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the clinical reference labo ratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 4 using CTCAE v4.0.  The following summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTCAE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed postbaseline. 
• Shift tables from baseline to the worst postbaseline value using CTCAE grade. 
• For laboratory parameters where CTCAE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/high classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.
 
9.4.4.3. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will  be determined for vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time.  Vital sign results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities (see Table 23), and s ubjects 
exhibiting clinically notable vital sign abnormalities will be listed.  A value will be considered an "alert" value if it is outside the established range and shows a > 25% change from baseline.

Note:   As of 25 OCT 2018, this study is closed to enrollment.  As of this date, no subjects were 
enrolled in Phase 2 efficacy expansion (all treatment groups) or Phase 2 mandatory biopsy 
Treatment Groups A, B, F, and G; therefore , the interim analysis is no longer applicable. 
In Phase 2, there will be a pl anned interim analysis for futility in  the CRC and PDAC expansion 
cohorts.  The Simon 2-stage design will be applied to each expansion cohort independently.  According to  Table 21, during Stage 1, n
1 subjects with s pecific tumor types (advanced or

Incyte Corporation  Page 139 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
metastatic CRC  or PDAC) will be enrolled in each cohort.  If ≤ r1 responses are observed, the 
cohort will be terminated for futility.  If more than r 1 responses are observed within each cohort, 
additional n 2 subjects will b e enrolled for Stage 2 evaluation. 
Based on this early termination rule, the probabilities of early termination under the assumption 
of historical control response rates (H 0) and desired response rates (HA) are shown in Table 25. 
Table 25: Probabilities of Early Termination for Simon 2-Stage Design 
Tumor Type  p0 p1 Probability of Early Termination  
Under H 0 Under H A 
CRC  40% 60% 0.6652  0.1582  
PDAC  25% 45% 0.6865  0.1204  
The interim analysis for each expansion cohort will be conducted once the first postbaseline 
radiologic tumor assessments for Stage 1 subjects within the cohort are available.  Enrollment will be held at that time unless a sufficient number of responders have been observed before that time.

10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
This study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that originate in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in adherence to the study Protocol; GCPs as defined in Title  21 of the US CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; ICH E6 GCP consolidated guidelines; and 
local regulatory requirements as applicable to the study locations.  
The investigator will be responsible for: 
• Permitting study-related monitoring, sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections by providing direct access to source data and other relevant clinical study documents. 
− Monitoring:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee, study 
monitors, will monitor the study according to a predetermined plan.  The 
investigator must allow the study monitors to review any study materials and subject records at each monitoring visit. 
− Auditing:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee may audit the 
clinical study site and study data to evaluate compliance with the Protocol, 
applicable local clinical study regulations, and overall study conduct.  The 
investigator must allow the auditors to review original source records and study documentat ion for all subjects.  
− Regulatory inspection:  Regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection of the 
study and the site at any time during the development of an investigational 
product.  The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspec tors 
and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other 
study-related documents.  The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor 
when contacted by any regulatory authority for the purposes of conducting an inspection. 
• Obtaining informed consent and ensuring that the study subjects' questions have been answered and the subjects fully understand study procedures: 
− Informed consent must be obtained before any study- related procedures are 
conducted, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. 
− Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC-approved version in a 
language that is native and understandable to the subject.  A template will be 
provided by the sponsor or its designee.  The sponsor or its designee must review and acknowled ge the site -specific changes to the ICF template.  The ICF must 
include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have direct access to subject records.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 141 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
• Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided b y the 
sponsor are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB/IEC. 
• Adhering to the Protocol as described in this document and agreeing that changes to the Protocol procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second, by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility criteria.  
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or if not approved, 2 years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If 
the investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options. 
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data) , will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  
The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is respons ible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study treatment to the study site.  
• Inventory of study treatment at the site.  
• Subject use of the study treatment  including pill or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed. 
• Return of study treatment to the investigator or designee by subjects. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 142 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
study treatment.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study 
treatment  until verified by the  study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study treatment back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional 
standard operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on- site destruction of investigational 
supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until 
the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and 
accuracy of accountability by the investigative site.  At sites where the study treatment is 
destroyed before monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the 
site SOP.  
10.3. Data Management  
Note:  As of  Amendment 7, only SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, EOT disposition (reason 
for discontinuation), drug accountability, dosing information, EOS disposition (end of study form), informed consent , and death ( if it occurs within the safety reporting perio d) will be 
collected in the eCRF.  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department at the sponsor or its designee.  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed.  
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries, 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF, verifying that the information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements. 
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are responsible for ensuring that 
sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of protected information must be obtained. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 143 of 203 
Protocol INCB 24360- 207 Am 7 Version 7  14 FEB  2019  
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if applicable.  Only the subject 
number will be recorded in the eCRF; if the subject's name appears on any other document 
(eg, laboratory report), it must be redacted from  the copy of the document to be supplied to the 
sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with 
local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or 
its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the 
information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. 
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered studies ") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, " clinical investigator " is defined as 
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or 
subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, any changes to the financial information previously reported by a c linical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations.  In the event that the clinical investigator is not reminded, they nevertheless will remain obligated to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study.  
10.6. Publication Policy  
By signing the study Protocol, the investigator and his or her institution agree that the results of the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Corporation (Incyte), for the purposes of national 
and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical 
professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and national regulations.  If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the investigator's name, address, 
qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of study results 
are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee.  A signed agreement will be retained by the sponsor or its designee.

APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly ef fective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with  the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method. 
2  Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency.  
3  Vasectomised partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective met hod only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

APPENDIX G.  DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR EPACADOSTAT  AND 
PEMBROLIZUMAB  
G.1. Dose Modifications for Epacadostat and Pembrolizumab for Immune- Related 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) associated with epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immu nologic etiology.  These immune- related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab 
treatment and may affect more than 1 body system simultaneously.  Therefore, early recognition 
and initiation of treatment is  critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study 
data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids, and/or other supportive care.  For suspect ed 
irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes.  Additional 
procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of 
the evaluation.  Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue epacadostat and/or pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids.  Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab and/or epacadostat are 
provided in Table G-1.

General Instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab and epacadostat have been withheld, pembrolizumab and epacadostat can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and 
corticosteroid has been tapered.  Pembrolizumab and epacadostat should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve w ithin 12  weeks of last dose or corticosteroids 
cannot be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid.  Other immunosuppres sive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot 
be controlled by corticosteroids . 
NOTES: 
a. Withhold OR permanently discontinue pembrolizumab or epacadostat at the discretion of the investigator.   
b. For subject s with Grade 3 or 4 immune -related endocrinopat hy where withholding of pembrolizumab and epacadostat is required, pembrolizumab and epacadostat may be

APPENDIX I. DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR 
GEMCITABINE/ NAB -PACLITAXEL  
I.1. Criteria for Start of Cycle (Criteria for Administration on Day 1 of Each Cycle) 
A cycle of therapy may begin on a scheduled Day 1 if the following conditions are met: 
• ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L. 
• Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L. 
• Sensory neuropathy has improved to ≤ Grade 1. 
• Any other AE that occurred has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 severity or returned to baseline. 
The dose of each agent selected for use in the new cycle will follow the guidelines shown in 
Table I-1, taking tolerability of the most recent dose into account. 
If new cycle starting requirements are not met, regardless of dose modification, all treatments 
(epacadostat, pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and nab- paclitaxel) will be held, and the subject will 
be evaluated at least weekly until the toxicity has resolved.  
From the second cycle onwards, all treatments will be discontinued if therapy has not been initiated within the 14 days after the sche duled Day 1. 
I.2. nab- Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Dose Modifications  
Gemcitabine treatment cycles and those including nab-paclitaxel may be delayed or the dose 
may be reduced for laboratory parameters or AEs that are judged to be related to gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel.  A maximum of 2 dose reductions are allowed:  for gemcitabine from 
1000 mg/m
2 to 800 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, and for nab- paclitaxel from 125 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 
and 75 mg/m2 (Table I-1).  
Day 1 of each study cycle will correspond with the first day of chemotherapy administration.  Thus, study cycles may become out of sync with the originally planned schedule.  All 
assessments will shift to coincide with the revised treatment (cycle) schedule.  
Table I-1: nab- Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Dose Level Reductions

First dose reduction  800 mg/m2 100 mg/m2 
Second dose reduction  600 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 
If additional dose reduction required Discontinue Discontinue 
After a second dose reduction, if neutropenia or thrombocytopenia reoccur (third occurrence) and are clearly associated with chemotherapy, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine  may be 
discontinued, and pembrolizumab and epacadostat may be continued at the discretion of the investigator and approval of the medical monitor.

I.4. Other Adverse Dru g Reactions in Subjects With nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine  
Dose interruptions and modifications for nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine for other adverse drug 
reactions are described in Table I-3.  
Table I-3: Dose Modification s for nab- Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Adverse Drug 
Reactions  
 Gemcitabine  nab-Paclitaxel 
Febrile neutropenia:  Grade 3 or 4  Withhold until fever resolved and ANC ≥ 1.5 × 109/L; resume at next lower 
dose level. 
Peripheral neuropathy:  Grade 3 or 4  No dose reduction.  Withhold until improves to ≤ Grade 1; resume at next lower dose level. 
Cutaneous toxicity:  Grade 2 or 3  Reduce to next lower dose level; discontinue treatment if toxicity persists.  
Gastrointestinal toxicity:  Grade 3 
mucositis or diarrhea  Withhold until improves to ≤ Grade 1; resume at next lower dose level.  
Note:  If the subject meets more than 1 of the criteria listed, dose modifications should always be based on the system showing 
the greatest degree of toxicity.  Dose interruptions and modifications will be made at the discretion of the investigator.  
If the toxicities listed in Table I-3 persist or reoccur despite 2 dose reductions and are clearly 
associated with chemotherapy, nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine  may be discontinued, and 
pembrolizumab and epacadostat may be continued at the discretion of the investigator and 
approval of the medical monitor.  If nab -paclitaxel must be discontinued for peripheral 
neuropathy, gemcitabine, pembrolizumab, and epacadostat may be continued at the discretion of the investigator and approval of the medical monitor. 
I.4.1 nab- Paclitaxel Hypersensi tivity Reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions are not expected with nab-paclitaxel.  If they do occur, minor 
symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia may require

temporary interruption of the infusion.  However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring 
treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria, require 
immediate discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Subjects who 
experience a ≥ Grade 3 allergic reaction or anaphylaxis events will not be rechallenged with 
nab-paclitaxel.  Subjects with < Grade 3 infusion reactions can be rechallenged following 
premedication (per institutional guidelines).  If nab-paclitaxel is discontinued due to a 
hypersensitivity reaction, gemcitabine, pembrolizumab, and epacadostat may be continued at the discretion of the investigator and approval of the medical monitor. 
I.4.2. Management Guidelines for Nonhematologic Toxicities

K.2. Pemetrexed and Platinum Agent  Dose Modifications 
Table K-2 provides guidance for dose reductions for hematologic toxicities, and Table K-3 provides guidance for nonhematologic toxicities.  
It is important to note that some chemotherapy -related AEs will overlap with potential irAEs 
(including but not limited to gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea; renal insufficiency; high-grade laboratory abnormalities; rash/hypersensitivity).  In these cases, both the 
chemotherapy -related AE and irAE management guidance ( Appendix G ) should be reviewed to 
determine the most appropriate management of therapy.

Description of changes:  
• Removed text describing secondary objectives/endpoints for DOR and PFS by 
RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST for Phase 1 and Phase 2. 
  
  
Rationale for changes:   Update based on sponsor decision to terminate enrollment, not 
all cohorts have been ful ly enrolled , and Phase 2 efficacy expansion cohorts, where 
overall survival was to be collected , will not be open for enrollment .  Therefore,  it will 
not be possible to adequately complete analysis for some objectives.

Description of changes:  
• Removed text regarding  optional on- treatment biopsies in Phase 2 efficacy 
expansion subjects. 
• Added text indicating that on-treatment biopsies are no longer required for subjects enrolled in Phase 2 mandatory biopsy cohorts.

Rationale for change:  For consistency with Inclusion Criterion #5. 
5. Section 4.5, Overall Study Duration 
Description of change:  The text in this section was revised to clearly define an end of 
the study for subject management and data analysis.  
Rationale for change:  Given enrollment has been terminated by the sponsor and all 
subjects have been followed for at least 18 weeks (2 imaging assessments) , the sponsor is 
considering this the end of the study for the purpose of database lock and study analysis.  
Subjects will continue receive study treatment if none of the discontinuation criteria are 
met.

(Criterion  #20) 
Description of change:   Text describing inclusion criterion for Phase 2 subjects with 
non− small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have driver mutations (EGFR, ALK fusion 
oncogene, or ROS1) was clarified to indicate these subjects must have received prior 
treatment with an approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
Rationale for change:   FDA request.  
2. Section 5.5.1.1, Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Determination of Maximum Tolerated 
Dose (Table 3, Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity ) 
Description of change:   Two new criteria for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
added:  Grade 4 (life -threatening) immune- related adverse event (irAE) and Grade 4 
(life-threatening) electrolyte abnormality.  Additionally, the criterion for DLT exceptio ns 
related to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea adequately controlled with medical therapy within 48 hours was limited to Grade 3 events.  
Rationale for change:   FDA request.  
3. Synopsis, Data Monitoring Committee; Section 8.9, Data Monitoring Committee; Section 9.5, Analyses for the Data Monitoring Committee 
Description of change:   Text describing the establishment of a Data Monitoring

6. Synopsis, Overall Study Design; Section 4.1.2, Phase 2: Expansion Cohorts; 
Section  7.9.4, Tumor Biopsy 
Descripti on of change:   Text on optional biopsies for subjects enrolled in the Simon 
2-stage portion of Phase 2 was revised.  Additional text indicating that subjects who 
provide a biopsy that does not meet minimum standards for evaluation (as outlined in the 
Labor atory Manual) may still enroll in the study but may be replaced in order to enroll 
sufficient numbers of biopsy evaluable subjects.   
Rationale for change:  To provide guidance on the collection and timing of optional 
biopsies for subjects enrolled in the Simon 2-stage portion of Phase 2 who receive IV 
chemotherapy, and flexibility to replace nonevaluable biopsy samples.

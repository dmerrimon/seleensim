CONFIDENTIAL1.3 Protocol Amendment 10 Summary of Changes
Protocol Amendment 10 Summary and Rationale:
This sect ion describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 10. 
The primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Describe the management of study  procedures (eg, distributi on of  study  medicat ion and
conduct of study  visits) to m aintain subject safet y, confident iality, and study  integrity in the
context of healt hcare delivery  challenges due to a pandemic (eg, coronavirus disease 2019
[COVID -19]).
Change the frequency  of clini c visi ts after at l east Week 72 to every  24weeks, starting at the
next visit that is a mult iple of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 144, etc), while requiring subjects to
return to the site every 8 weeks between these clinic visits to receive an 8 -week supply o f study
medicat ion for at-home administration.
Update the treatment duration to remove the maximum treatment duration of 5 y ears and to
allow treatment to continue unt il vedo lizumab SC is available in the subject’s country
commercially  or through other access p
rograms.
Remove the opti on that subjects can switch to vedolizumab intravenous (IV) if vedo lizumab
subcutaneous (SC) is not available (originally proposed in protocol amendment 7; note that
this opti on was never implemented for any  subject).
This global am endment harm onizes changes fro m regional amendments 8 and 9 into a single 
global amendment. Minor grammatical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not 
affect ing the conduct of the study  are included for clarification and administrative purpos es only. 
A history  of MLN0002SC -3030 protocol  amendments 1 through 9 is provided in Appendix G.

vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) 
treatment to remove the maximum 
treatment duration of 5 years and to 
allow treatment to continue until 
vedolizumab SC is available in the
subject’s country commercially or 
through other access programs.To ensure uninterrupted study 
medication availability for subjects 
who continue to receive clinical 
benefit from vedolizumab SC 
treatment. 
Section 2.0STUDY SUMMARY
Section 5.2.2 Secondary EndpointsClarified that for subjects with 
Crohn’s disease (CD), the 
proportion of subjects with clinical 
response will be summarized for 
randomized early terminator CD 
subjects only (defined as 
randomized CD subjects withdrawn 
from the parent study between Week 
6 and Week 52).Clinical response will not be 
summarized for randomized 
completer CD subjects (ie, subjects 
who completed the Maintenance 
Phase of MLN0002SC -3031) or for 
nonrandomized Week 14 responder 
CD subjects (ie, subjects who did 
not achieve a clinical response at 
Week 6 of Study 
MLN0002SC -3031 but who did 
achieve a clinical response at Week 
14 after receiving a third 
vedolizumab intravenous (IV) 
infusion). CD disease activity is 
measured using 2 d ifferent indices 
in Studies MLN0002SC -3031 and 
MLN0002SC -3030 (Crohn’s 
Disease Activity Index and 
Harvey -Bradshaw Index [HBI], 
respectively). For randomized 
completer CD subjects or 
nonrandomized Week 14 responder 
CD subjects, baseline values in 
Study MLN0 002SC -3031 are used 
for comparison which are not 
available. Clinical remission will be 
evaluated for all ulcerative colitis
(UC) and CD subjects.

Section 6.1Study Desig n
Appendix ASchedule of Study 
Procedures , table header and 
footnotes c, j, u, vChanged the frequency of clinic 
visits after at least Week 72 to every 
24weeks, starting at the next visit 
that is a multiple of 24 (eg, 
Week 96, 120, 144, etc).To reduce subject burden while 
maintaining suff icient safety  
monitoring and ensuring adequate 
data collection to support endpoint 
analy ses. All enrolled subjects are 
estimated to have completed the 
Week 72 visit by the time of 
implementation of this amendment. 
Section 6.1Study Desig n
Appendix ASchedule of Study 
Procedures , footnote qSpecified that subjects must return 
to the clinic ever y 8 weeks to 
receive an 8-week supply of 
vedolizumab SC for administration 
at home.To support at -home study drug 
administration wh ile enabling 
appropriate study drug 
accountability measures.
Section 6.1Study Desig n
Section 8.2Investigational Drug 
Assignment and Dispensing 
ProceduresChanged the language regarding 
vedolizumab SC injections by 
subjects or caregivers from “should 
occur” to “may occur” under the 
supervision of study staff at each 
clinic visit. To allow flexibility in the 
administration of study medication 
at clinic visits. 
Section 6.1Study Desig n
Section 8.1Study Medication and 
Materials
Section 9.1.22 Procedure for 
Switching to PFS+NSD and 
PFS+AIRem oved the option that subjects 
can switch to vedolizumab IV if 
vedolizumab SC is not available.To align protocol procedures across 
all regio ns with those approved in 
Amendment 8. This option was 
never implemented in any region, 
and no subjects in this study 
switched to vedolizumab IV.
Section 9.1.5 Vital Sign Procedure Rem oved the specification that vital 
signs be obtained within 0.5 hour 
before a scheduled blood draw. To remove the time restric tion 
between the vital sign 
measurements and blood draws 
during the same visit.
Section 9.1.6.1 Diary  Completio n 
and Review 
Section 9.1.6.2 Collection of 
Subject -Reported Components of 
HBI ScoreClarified that partial Mayo scores
for subjects with UC are calculated 
based on daily diary entries. Added 
a new Section 9.1.6.2 to clarify that 
HBI scores for subjects with CD are 
calculated using symptoms 
collected at the site during clinic 
visits using an electronic device, 
outside of the subject diary. To accurately reflect the data 
sources for UC and CD disease 
activity .
Section 9.1.18 Patient Reported 
Outcomes MeasuresChanged section heading from 
“Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Instruments” to “Patient -Reported 
Outcomes Measures.”To correct the nomenclature 
describing PRO assessments.

will receive vedolizumab SC 108 mg. From this OLE study of vedolizumab SC therapy, data regarding the occurrence 
of important clinical events resulting from chronic vedolizumab SC administration will be obtained. Important clinical 
events including those related to safety and advers e events of special interest (AESIs); serious infections including 
opportunistic infection such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), liver injury, malignancies, 
injection site reactions or systemic reactions and hypersensitivity) as well as efficacy (eg, maintenance of clinical 
remission/ clinical response, quality of life, and various other patient- reported outcome [PRO] measures) will be 
collected. This study will provide long -term safety data for vedolizumab SC dosing to complement the sa fety data 
gathered from Study MLN0002SC -3027 in UC subjects and Study MLN0002SC -3031 in CD subjects.
Japan only
In Japan, active enrolled subjects who have been participating in this study for at least 16 weeks will have the option to 
switch from administe ring vedolizumab SC in prefilled syringe (PFS) to administering vedolizumab SC in PFS in a 
needle safety device (PFS+NSD) or in an autoinjector (PFS+AI). Only participating subjects who choose to switch 
presentation will be randomized (1:1) to PFS+NSD or P FS+AI, and randomization will be stratified by the subject’s 
underlying disease, UC or CD. Training is required at 2 clinic visits to start self -injection at home. Subjects will 
receive training on how to use PFS+NSD or PFS+AI at the clinic before the firs t administration with the presentation. 
After switching to PFS+AI or PFS+NSD, subjects will continue with all procedures as per the study schedule during 
the remaining length of the OLE study.  
Subjects will not be permitted to switch between PFS+NSD and PFS+AI. Subjects may be 
switched back to PFS if a safety concern, lack of self -injection capability, or other issue including but not limited to 
lack of availab ility of the device is identified with PFS+NSD or PFS+AI. 
Primary Objectives:
To obtain data on long term safety and tolerability on vedolizumab SC in UC or CD subjects.
Secondary Objectives:
To obtain data on AESIs; serious infections including opportu nistic infection such as PML, liver injury,
malignancies, injection site reactions or systemic reactions and hypersensitivity in UC and CD subjects receiving
long-term vedolizumab SC treatment.
To obtain data on maintaining clinical response and clinical remission in UC and CD subjects receiving long -term
vedolizumab SC treatment.
To obtain data on PROs, including quality of life and work productivity and activity, in UC and CD subjects
receiving long -term vedolizumab SC treatment.

Subject Population: Subjects with UC or CD who participated in a prior qualified vedolizumab SC stud y 
(MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031).
Number of Subjects:
Approximately 692 subjects will enter this study. Comprised of 
approximately 169 UC and 348 CD subjects who will have been 
randomized into the Maintenance Phase of Study MLN0002SC -3027 
or MLN0002SC -3031 and approximately 73 UC and 102 CD 
non-randomized subjects who will have achieved a clinical response 
at Week 14 after the third vedolizumab IV infusion after not having 
achieved a clinical response at Week 6.Number of Sites: 
Approximately 300 site s globally
Dose Level(s):
Vedolizumab SC 108 mgRoute of Administration:
Subcutaneous
Duration of Treatment:
It is anticipated that the duration of vedolizumab SC treatment will 
vary by subject based on continued benefit, but will be until 
vedolizumab SC is available in the subject’s country commercially  or 
through other access programs, or if the subject withdraws from the 
study, or the sponsor decides to close the study. Period of Evaluation:
The first dose of vedolizumab S C in this 
OLE study will be timed according to the last 
dose of study drug in the MLN0002SC -3027 
or MLN0002SC -3031 studies, to maintain 
the trough serum concentration above the 
level associated with clinical efficacy of 
vedolizumab IV in UC and CD subjects .
Subjects with UC or CD who completed 
the Maintenance Phase (Week 52 
assessment) will receive vedolizumab 
SC 108 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W).
Subjects with UC or CD who withdrew 
early  from the Maintenance Phase due 
to disease worsening or need for rescue 
medications will receive vedolizumab 
SC 108 mg once every week (QW).
Subjects with UC and CD who did not 
achieve a clinical response at Week 6 
but who did achieve a clinical response 
at Week 14 after having received a third 
vedolizumab IV infusion at Week 6 will 
receive vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W.
After the final dose of vedolizumab SC on 
this study (eg, due to withdrawal), subjects 
will complete a Final Safety Visit, 18 weeks 
from the last dose received. Additionally, 
upon completion of (or withdrawal from)
this study, subjects will be required to 
participate in a long -term follow -up (LTFU) 
safety survey by telephone, 6 months after 
the last dose of study drug.

Statistical Consideratio ns:
Safety: 
Safety evaluations will be descriptive based on incidence, severity and type of AEs, PML checklist responses, vital 
signs, laboratory results and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Descriptive statistics will be calculated. Safety analyses will 
be per formed by UC subject population (overall and separately for subjects who received vedolizumab SC and 
subjects who received vedolizumab IV in the Maintenance Phase of Study MLN0002SC -3027) and CD subject 
populatio n. 
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs ([TEAEs] defined as any AEs, regardless of 
relatio nship to study drug), AESIs (serious infections including opportunistic infection such as PML, liver injury, 
malignancies, injection site re actio ns or systemic reactio ns and hypersensitivity), and SAEs that occur on or after the 
first dose date and up to 18 weeks after the last dose date of the study drug will be summarized by Medical Dictionary

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Diseases and Current Treatments 
Inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD) i s a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disorder of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract th at includes 2 ent ities, namely ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD). 
UC i s characteri zed by  diffuse, superficial inflammat ion of the colonic mucosa that begins in the 
rectum  and extends proximally to invo lve any cont iguous length of co lon. The prevalence of UC is 
approximately  200/100,000 of the United States (US) populat ion and approximately 150/100,000 
of the popul ation in Western Europe [1-3] and 63.6/100,000 of the population in Japan [ 4].A 
genet ic contribut ion to the di sease is indicated by  the increased incidence o f UC (of 30 to 
100times that of the general populat ion) am ong first -degree relatives of pat ients with UC. The 
characterist ic patho logy is one of chronic inflammation characterized by large numbers o f 
lymphocy tes and hist iocytes in the di seased mucosa and submucosa with an acute inflammatory  
infiltrate composed of neutrophils variably present.
CD is a relapsing, remitt ing inflammatory disease that may invo lve any portion of the length o f the 
GI tract from mouth to anus in a transmural fashion fro m 
mucosa to serosa. The prevalence of CD 
is approximately 150/100,000 of the US populat ion and approximately 125/100,000 of populat ion 
in Western Europe [1-3] and 21.2/100,000 of the populat ion in Japan. The characterist ic patholog y 
involves a chronic inflammatory  infiltrate consist ing of neutrophils and macrophages. Hallmarks 
of CD include granulo matous inflamma tion and aphthous ulcerat ion.
Clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea, ty pically bl oody , as well  as abdominal pain, fecal 
urgency, and incont inence. Clinical manifestations of CD include diarrhea, as well as abdo minal 
pain, fecal urgency, and incont inence. In both UC and CD systemic features such as fever, weight 
loss, malaise, and fat igue are indicators of more extensive disease. Extra -intestinal manifestations 
such as uveit is, arthritis, ankylosis spondylit is, or primary sclerosing cho langitis may also be seen 
in conjunct ion with IBD. The diagnosis of UC is usually made by the clinical presentation and ke y 
features of the history, physical examinat ion, in combinat ion with laboratory and imaging studies. 
The di agnosis of CD is usually  made by histopa thologic examinat ion of endoscopic mucosal 
biopsy specimens obtained on ileocolonoscopy .
Current treatments have been effective for many patients with IBD but have numerous limit ations 
for pati ents wi th moderately to severely act ive disease. 5
-aminosalicylates (5 -ASAs) are the 
mainstay  of UC pharmacotherapy  for induct ion and maintenance of remissio n for patients with 
mild to m oderate di sease, but are less effective in moderate to severe disease. [5,6]. 
Corti costeroi ds are often required for the 1/3 of patients who fail to respond to 5 -ASAs [
7,8]. 
The National Cooperative Crohn’s Disease Study demonstrated a role for sulfasalazine (a 5 -AS
A) 
in moderately to severely  active CD [5]. However, the efficacy of 5 -ASAs in CD has been c alled 
into questi on by a recent meta -analysis [6]. Corti costeroi ds are often required for the patients who

CONFIDENTIALfail to respond to 5 -ASAs. While highly effective for induct ion of remissio n, corti costeroi ds are 
not recommended for the maintenance of remissio n in UC or CD due to signif icant undesirable 
side effects, including osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and increased risk of infect ion. 
Immunomodulatory agents, including 6 -mercaptopurine and azathioprine, have a role in 
maintenance of remissio n of moderately  to severely act ive UC and CD. Their relat ively slow onset 
of action precludes their use during flares o f disease, and the use of these agents has been reported 
to potentially increase the risk of lympho ma in patients with IBD [9]. In UC , other severe adverse 
events (AEs) associated with use of immuno modulators include cy topenias, hepat itis, and 
infect ion. Methotrexate has a role in the management of refractory  CD; however, it also 
demonstrates a number of dose -limit ing toxicit ies. Ant ibiotics have marginal efficacy in 
maintenance of remissio n in CD.
Intravenous (IV) cy closporine has a role in the management of severely  active UC; however, it is 
impract ical in non -hospi talized patients, requi res intense monitoring, and may cause irreversible 
nephrotoxi city, all of which limit its use. 
Monoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) directed against tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF -α) have been 
approved for the treatment of UC in many countries world -wide, including infliximab (Remicade), 
which is administered by IV infusio n, and adalimumab (Humira) and go limumab (Simponi), 
which are administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection [10-12] . These agents have substant ially 
improved the care of patients with UC by inducing and maintainin g remissi on and decreasing the 
need for hospitalizat ions and surgeries, and other complicat ions. Alt hough TNF -α antagoni sts 
represent an important addit ion to the UC pharmacologic armamentarium, they  are effect ive in 
only a subset of patients, with roughly 2/3 of pat ients in controlled trials not in remissio n at the end 
of the first y ear of therapy  [
13,14] . Induction of remissio n with infliximab occurs in only 31% to 
39% of patients wi th UC [
15]and durable clinical remission ( ie, defined as clinical remissio n at 
Weeks 8, 30, and 54) occurs in only 26% of pat ients with UC. In addit ion, controlled studies have 
demonstrated that, after failure of 1 TNF -α antagonist, a patient’s response to a second TNF -α 
antagonist is substant iall
y lower [16]. The TNF -α antagonists are also associated with a number of 
serious safet y concerns based on their suppressio n of systemic immunit y, including react ivation of 
tubercul osis (TB); various bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infect ions; and malignancies, 
such as hepatosplenic T cell lympho ma [
10,11] .
Failure of pharmaco logical therapy  leads to col ectomy  in 9% to 35% of pat ients with UC wi thin 
5years. Colectomy is considered to be an important adjunct treatm ent for refractory UC; however, 
colectomy wi th ileal pouch anal anastomosis (the standard surgic al therapy) has m any limit ations 
and is associated with its own set of complications, including high stool frequency [17], female 
infertilit y [
18], and a cumulative incidence of pouchit is of 50% at 10 years [ 19]. The limitat ions o f 
current therapies for UC indicate that there is a significant need for s afer and more effect ive 
therapi es.
Biologic agents, including mAbs against TNF -α, such as infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab 
(Humira) and certolizumab pego l (Cimzia), have proven useful for both induct ion and 
maintenance of clinical response and clinical re mission in CD [10,11,20] . However, efficacy data

CONFIDENTIALfor both infliximab and adalimumab in CD indicate only  a minori ty of patients having a durable 
response at 1 year [13,14] . Certolizumab pegol as maintenance therapy  was studi ed only  up to 
26weeks, and achieves the same modest results in the general moderately to severely act ive CD 
popul ation with more sub stant ia
l outcom es in the subgroup of patients with baseline C -react ive 
protein (CRP) ≥10 mg/L [14]. In addition to its modest efficacy, treatment with TNF -α antagonists 
has been associated with serious adverse events (SAEs) invo lving hypersensit ivity and infect ion. 
React ivations of latent tubercul osis (TB) [
21]and disseminated histoplasmosis have been reported 
and, in some cases, have been fatal [
22]. A new class of therapy, the integrin inhibitors, has shown 
promising results to date. In tegrin antagoni sts target and disrupt the leukocyte adhesio n and 
trafficking systems, thereby  reducing inflammat ion. Natalizumab (Tysabri), a pan -
α4(α4β7and 
α4β1) integrin antagonist was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 for 
use in CD patients who are refract ory to standard therapy [23]. However, due to the antagonizing 
effect of natalizumab on α 4β1, whi ch m ediates T -cell migrat ion into the central nervous sy stem  
(CNS), bone marrow, and skin via adhesion to its ligand, vascular cell adhesion mo lecule -
1 
(VCAM -1), natalizumab therapy  has been associated with increased risk of John Cunningham 
virus (JCV) reactivat ion and subsequent development of progressive mult ifocal 
leukoence phalopathy  (PML). As a result, natalizumab is cautiously prescribed for the treatment of 
CD. 
Surgical remo val o f highly diseased, strictured, or stenotic segments of bowel in CD is not 
curative. Relapse occurs in a majorit y of patients wit h CD who undergo segm ental  resect ions, and 
the need for additional surgery is the rule rather than the except ion [24]. The limitat ions of current 
therapi es for IBD indicate that there is a significant need for safer and more effect ive therapies.
4.1.2 Vedolizumab
Vedolizumab (also known as ML N0002) is a novel reco mbinant humanized mAb co mposed of 
2light chains o f the subclass and 2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 heavy  chains. Vedolizumab binds 
specifically to the human lymphocy te integrin 47. The α 4β7integrin mediates lymphocy te 
trafficking to GI mucosa and gut -associ ated lymphoid t issue (GALT) through adhesive interact ion 
with mucosal addressin cell adhesio n molecule -
1(MAdCAM -1), which is expressed on the 
endothelium o f mesenteri c lymph nodes and GI mucosa [25-28] . As a result, vedolizumab impairs 
the migrat ion of gut -homing leukocytes into GI mucosa [
29]andacts as a gut -selective 
immuno modulator.
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) has been granted market ing approval in several regions, including the US and European Unio n 
(EU). Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to sev erely 
active UC and CD, who have failed convent ional treatment, such as immuno modulators, 
corticosteroi ds, or TNF -α antagonists. The approved dosing and administration regimen is 300 mg 
vedo lizumab IV infused intravenously at Weeks 0 and 2, then once every 8 weeks (Q8W) 
thereafter, beginning at Week 6.

CONFIDENTIALVedolizumab SC (also known as Vedolizumab Injection, for Subcutaneous Use; Vedolizumab 
Solution for Inject ion in Pre -filled Syringe; or MLN0002 SC) is a new liquid presentation that has 
been developed for SC administration. To develop vedo lizumab SC, the vedolizumab IV 
presentation was modified to ensure the long -term stabili ty needed for a liquid product. However, 
the vedo lizumab SC drug product composit ion is similar to that of the vedo lizumab IV 
presentati on after reconsti tution. No changes were made that would impact the primary structure 
of the protein, and comparable biochemical properties and in vitro funct ional act ivity have been 
demonstrated. Therefore, the nonclinical and clinical informat ion from st udies wi th vedolizumab 
IV are considered relevant .
As of 19 May  2020 (data l ock point), m ore than 6856 subjects have received at least 1 dose of 
vedo lizumab across all studies in the clinical development program. Phase 3 placebo -controlled 
studi es enrolled 2427 subjects with UC or CD, of who m 1434 subjects were administered 300 mg 
of vedo lizumab IV for induct ion followed by  once every  4weeks (Q4W) or Q8W for up to a total 
of 52 weeks and 488 subjects were administered 300 mg vedo lizumab for induct ion only [30-32] . 
As of 19 May 2020, vedo lizumab exposure has extended for ≥12months in 2878 subjects, 
≥24months in 1762 subjects, ≥36 m onths in 1176 subjects, ≥48months in 909 subjects, 
≥60months in 718 subjects, ≥72 months in 478 subjects, ≥84months in 292 subjects, ≥96months 
in 223 subjects, and ≥108 months in 111 subjects. Based on drug shipment data as of

May 2014 is est imated to be approximately 510,259 patient-years. 
Previously  conducted clinical  studi es have characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, 
pharmacokinet ics (PK), pha rmacodynamics, and immunogenicit y of vedolizumab in healt hy 
subjects and subjects with UC or CD. Please refer to the current edit ion of the Invest igator’s 
Brochure (IB) for the most recent data for vedolizumab.
4.1.2.1 Nonclinical
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studi es have been conducted with vedo lizumab and its murine 
homo
logue, Act -1. Act -1 has demonstrated clinical and histomorpho logic evi dence of efficacy  in 
an animal model of IBD (cotton -top tamarins). Extensive nonclinical evaluat ions of the 
cardi ovascular , acute, l ocal, subchroni c, chroni c, immunol ogic, and reproductive toxicit y of 
vedo lizumab in pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbit s and 
cyno molgus monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development. Nonclinical 
studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize 41integrin [29].
A single -dose l ocal tolerance study  was conducted to determine the local irritancy potential of 
vedo lizumab SC when administered by SC inject ion to rabbits. Macroscopic and histological 
examinat ions of the injection sites indicated no findings o f concern with the vehicle or formulated 
vedo lizumab SC.

CONFIDENTIAL4.1.2.2 Clinical Experience With Vedolizumab IV
Single-and mult iple-dose PK of vedo lizumab have been stud ied in healt hy subjects and in subjects 
with moderately  to severely active UC or CD and similar PK was observed. Vedolizumab exhibit s 
target -mediated drug disposit ion; hence, its elimination is characterized by linear and nonlinear 
processes. Following IV infusio n, vedo lizumab serum concentrations generally fell in a 
biexponent ial fashion until approximately 1 to 10 µg/mL, with a linear total body  clearance of 
approximately  0.157 L/day  and a serum  half-life of around 25 days. Thereafter, the serum 
concentra tions f ell in a nonlinear fashio n. The vo lume of distribut ion for vedo lizumab is 
approximately  5 L.
In subjects with moderately to severely act ive CD (Study  C13007), including subjects who had 
failed treatment with 1 or more therapies including TNF -α antag onists, vedo lizumab IV 300 mg at 
Weeks 0 and 2 (induct ion) fo llowed by 300 m g either Q4W or Q8W from Week 6 through 
Week 52 (m aintenance) dem onstrated statistically significant differences in efficacy compared to 
placebo for both the induct ion phase and ma intenance phase. The study  met its primary endpoint 
for the induction phase, clinical remissio n at Week 6, but did not meet the second primary endpo int 
of enhanced clinical response (Crohn’s Disease Activit y Index [CDAI] -100) at Week 6 in the 
overall popul ation although the treatment difference favored vedolizumab. The study  did meet its 
primary  endpoint for the maintenance phase, clinical remissio n at Week 52, as well as important 
secondary  endpoints, including enhanced clinical response at Week 52 and cor ticosteroi d-free 
clinical remissio n at Week 52 [
31]. 
In Study  C13011, vedolizumab IV (300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6) was administered to subjects 
with moderately or severely act ive CD who had failed convent ional therapies, inclu ding TNF -α 
antagonists. The primary endpo int of clinical remission at Week 6 in the TNF -α antagoni st failure 
intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion was not met; however, a treatment difference was observed at 
Week 10 in this populat ion. Similar treatment differe nces favoring vedo lizumab IV were also 
demonstrated for the overall population and in the subgroup of subjects who were TNF -α 
antagonist naïve [
32].
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable safet y profile based on an analysis o f safet y data from both 
completed and ongoing studies (see current edi tion of  IB). In phase 1 and 2 clinical trials 
(13completed phase 1 studies in healt hy subjects and 8 completed phase 1b/2 studies in UC or CD 
patients), there was no consistent evidence of any dose -toxicity relationships, and vedo lizumab 
was well tol erate d. The majorit y of the safet y data is fro m 3 well -controlled, phase 3 clinical 
studi es that eval uated the safet y of vedolizumab IV for up to 12 months in subjects with UC 
(Study C13006 [52 weeks]) or CD (Studies C13007 [52 weeks] and C13011 [10weeks]). In
addition, addi tional safety  resul ts are available from a completed long -term open -label extensi on 
(OLE) study  (C13008), in which subjects were administered vedolizumab IV Q4W.
In the pivotal phase 3 studies (C13006 and C13007), the most commo n (≥5% and at a higher 
incidence than placebo) adverse reactions in subjects administered vedo lizumab IV were nausea, 
nasopharyngit is, upper respiratory  tract infect ion, arthralgia, py
rexia, fat igue, headache, and 
cough. Most SAEs have been related to exacerbat ions or complications of the underlying UC or

sites of these infections correlated with the known tissue distribut ion of MAd CAM -1 binding sites. 
Anal abscess, abdo mina l abscess, and gastroenteritis were the most frequent ly reported serious 
infect ions. Extraintest inal infect ions (bronchit is, pneumo nia, urinary  tract infect ion, sepsis) 
occurred at low frequency (<1%). A total of 4% of vedo lizumab -treated subjects and 3% of 
placebo -treated subjects experienced an infusio n-related reaction. In Studies C13006 and C13007, 
10% of subjects were posit ive for antivedo lizumab antibodies (AVA) 16 weeks fo llowing the last 
dose of vedolizumab. Results fro m the clinical program to date do not suggest an increased risk for 
malignancy wit h vedo lizumab treatment. Overall, the safet y profile fo llowing long -term treatm ent 
with vedolizumab IV in Study  C13008 was consistent wi th safet y in the 52 -week studi es. 
Concomitant use of corticosteroid s and/or convent ional immuno modulators di d not appear to be 
associ ated wi th any increased rate of infect ions based on the comparative rates of infections in the 
phase 3 trials amo ng subjects who had and had not received these medicat ions. 
One death occurr ed in a vedolizumab -treated subject during Study C13006 and 5 deaths occurred 
during Study C13007, including 1 death in a placebo -treated subject. As of 19 May 2020, a total o f 
66 deaths fro m mult iple causes were reported in the vedo lizumab clinical develo pment program , 
including the completed long -term Study C13008. Six of the 66 subjects were being treated for UC 
and 15 subjects for CD. The remaining 45 subjects were being treated for indicat ions wit h high 
mortalit y: 39 subjects with steroid -refractory  intestinal  acute graft -versus -host di sease, 4 subjects 
undergo ing allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation, and 2 subjects for metastatic 
malignant melano ma. The causes of death varied and detailed informat ion can be found in the 
current edit ion ofthe IB. 
Overall, vedo lizumab was well tolerated in clinical studies .
4.1.2.3 Clinical Experience With Vedolizumab SC
The feasibilit y of administering the vedo lizumab IV formulat ion by alternative dosing routes SC 
or intram uscular (IM) injection was explored in an open -label, single dose, parallel -group 
bioavailabilit y study  (C13010) in healt hy male subjects. In this stud y, 42 subjects were enrolled 
and 14 subjects each received a single dose of 180 mg vedolizumab IV as IV infusio n (over 
30minutes), SC inject ions (2 × 1.5 mL × 60 mg/mL), or IM inject ions 
(2 × 1.5 m L ×60mg/mL). Following SC administration, absorption of vedo lizumab was gradual, 
achieving maximum concentration at 7 days post -inject ion (time o f first occurrence of C max[tmax]). 
The m aximum  observed serum  concentration (C max) following SC injecti on was approximately  
1/3 of the C maxfollowing 30 minute IV in fusio n. There was no difference in the terminal 
eliminat ion profile o f the SC cohort compared to the IV cohort, indicat ing that the eliminat ion of 
vedo lizumab is not absorption rate- limited. The absolute bioavailabilit y of vedolizumab was 
approximately  75% for SC administration. Vedolizumab was well tolerated when administered at 
a dose of 180 mg by SC inject ion. Five of the 14 subjects (36%) in the IV infusio n cohort and 3 of 
the 14 subjects (21%) in the SC cohort experienced a drug -related AE (assessed by the 
investigator). Most AEs were mild or moderate in severit y. Three of the 14 subjects (21%) in the 
IV infusion cohort and 2 of the 14 subjects (14%) in the SC cohort in this study were AVA positive

CONFIDENTIALusing the originally  devel oped AVA assay that was used in the phase 3 studies with vedo lizumab 
IV. While all 3 AVA posit ive subjects in the IV infusion cohort had neutralizing AVA, no 
neutralizing AVA was observed in the SC cohort.
The bioavailabilit y and PK of vedo lizumab fo llowing a single SC inject ion of ve dolizumab SC at 
3dose levels (54, 108, and 160 mg) relat ive to a single IV infusio n of vedolizumab IV 300 mg was 
examined in a phase 1, open -label study  (MLN0002SC -101). Forty -eight (24 Japanese and 
24 non- Japanese) healt hy, adult male and female subjects were rando mized, A total of 12 subjects 
received a single dose of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg and 36 subjects received a single dose of 
vedo lizumab SC at 54, 108, or 160 mg (12 subjects per dose group).
The bioavailabilit y following a single SC injection of ved olizumab SC was 75.1%, independent of 
the vedolizumab SC dose evaluated (54, 108, or 160 mg). Vedolizumab reached maximum seru m 
concentrations around 1 week after a single SC injection. Vedolizumab was eliminated by both 
linear and nonlinear pathway fo llowing SC inject ion, with more rapid eliminat ion with decreasing 
dose/concentration. Compared with non -Japanese subjects, Japanese subjects generally showed 
similar or slightly higher exposure; however, ethnicit y did not have an impact on clearance or 
central volume o f distribut ion based on the populatio n PK analysis, likely  due to the fact that 
weight was included as a covariate for various populat ion PK parameters. Simulations further 
confirmed that vedolizumab SC at 108 mg every  2 weeks (Q2W) is expected to provide lower 
trough concentrations at steady  state than vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q4W and similar steady -state 
exposures (average serum concentration at steady  state [C av,ss]) to that from  the approved 
vedo lizumab IV 300 mg Q8W maintenance regimen.
An electr ochemiluminescence (ECL) assay has been developed to determine serum titers of AVA. 
This assay  has improved drug tolerance as compared to the prior enzyme- linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) method used in the vedo lizumab clinical development program and, a s a resul t, is 
more sensit ive. Both assays were used in Study  MLN0002SC -101; the ECL assay  data were used 
in the analysis of PK and safet y.
Consistent with what has been reported in the literature [33,34] , the percentage of AVA posit ive 
subjects appeared to be higher among subjects who receive d vedo lizumab SC (ECL 66.7% to 
75.0%; ELISA 16.7% to 50.0%) compared with subjects who received vedo lizumab IV (ECL 
41.7%, ELISA 8.3%). In addit ion, a higher percenta ge of AVA posit ive subjects who received 
vedo lizumab SC had persistent ly posit ive AVA
s for ≥14 weeks ; in 4 of these subjects, an impact 
on PK was observed . However, no dose -dependent trend in AVA posit ivity was seen. The clinica l 
significance of these immunogenicit y resul ts is uncl ear, since this was a single dose study  in 
healt hy subjects. 
Overall, 75.0% (36/48) of subjects had treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and the 
percentage of subjects with a TEAE was ident ical in subjects who received vedolizumab SC 
compared wi th subjects who received vedolizumab IV. All TEAEs were considered by the 
investigator to be mild or moderate in intensit y; no TEAEs of severe intensit y were reported. The 
percentage of subjects with mild or moderate TEAEs was similar between subjects who received 
vedo lizumab SC and vedo lizumab IV; the percentages were also similar across the dose groups.

CONFIDENTIALNo subjects had clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results that 
were reported as AEs. Two subjects had elevated bilirubin levels that met the predefined markedly 
abnorm al value cri teria; however, no subject had abnormal liver funct ion test (LFT) results 
involving aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
Two AEs of special interest were reported: 1 subject in the vedo lizumab SC 108 m g group 
experienced ery thema at the inject ion site on the left thigh and 1 subject in the vedo lizumab SC 
160 m g group experi enced an inject ion site reaction. Both events occurred on Day  1, and were 
observed at the 30 minute postdose observat ion time point (a protocol -defined time point). In each 
case, the event resolved at the 1.5 hour postdose observat ion time point and was considered by the 
investigator to be mild in intensit y and rel ated to study  drug. Both subjects recovered without any 
sequelae.
Pain was assessed by the subjects who received vedolizumab SC immediately fo llowing the SC 
inject ion and between 15 and 30 minutes fo llowing the inject ion. The pain assessments at 15 to 
30minutes postinject ion were generally lower than the assessments recorded immediately 
following the in jection. The maximal reported score was 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, and all but 1 score 
for the 15 to 30 minute postinjection t ime point were ≤3.
No SAEs, severe AEs, or deaths were reported in Study MLN0002SC -101. The observed AEs are 
consistent with the ove rall safet y profile of vedo lizumab.
In addit ion to Study  MLN0002SC -101, 4 phase 1 bioequivalence studies in healt hy subjects have 
also been co mpleted (Studies Vedo lizumabSC -1017, VedolizumabSC -1018, 
VedolizumabSC -1021, and VedolizumabSC -1022). Vedolizumab SC was well tol erated wi th an 
acceptable safet y profile in healt hy subjects. With the except ion of injection site react ions, the 
safet y profile of vedo lizumab SC was similar to vedolizumab IV among phase 1 studies. Refer to 
the current edition o f the IB fo r addi tional information on these studies.
Vedolizumab SC has been studied in 2 phase 3, rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
clinical studies in adult patients with UC (Study  MLN0002SC -3027) or CD (Study  
MLN0002SC -3031). The efficacy and safet y ofvedolizumab SC for the treatm ent of adult patients 
with moderately to severely  active UC was dem onstrated in a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study evaluating efficacy endpoints at Week 52 (Study MLN0002SC -3027). In 
this study , enro lled subjects had failed at least 1 convent ional therapy , including corticosteroids, 
immuno modulators, and/or TNF- α antagoni sts (including primary  nonresponders). Subjects who 
achieved clinical response after 2 doses of open -label vedo lizumab IV (at Week 0and Week 2) 
were eligible to be rando mized. For the evaluat ion of the Week 52 endpo ints, 216 subjects were 
rando mized and treated in a double -blind fashio n (2:1:1) to one of the fo llowing regimens: 
vedo lizumab SC 108 mg Q2W, vedo lizumab IV 300 mg Q8W, or placebo. The primary endpo int, 
the proporti on of  subjects wi th clinical remissio n at Week 52, was met; a statist ically significant 
higher remissio n rate at Week 52 was observed for vedo lizumab SC subjects than for placebo 
subjects. Across the secondary  endpoints, the proporti on of  subjects meet ing the efficacy criteria 
was consistent ly greater in subjects receiving maintenance vedo lizumab SC treatment.

CONFIDENTIALwere observ ed for rates of m ucosal  healing at Week 52 and durable clinical response at Weeks 6 
and 52. Clinically  meaningful  treatm ent differences between vedo lizumab SC and placebo were 
also observed for durable clinical remissio n and corticosteroid -free remissio n at week 52 although 
these were not statist ically significant.
The efficacy and safet y of vedolizumab SC for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely  active CD was demonstrated in a rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study  
evaluati ng efficacy  endpoints at Week 52 (Study  MLN0002SC -3031). In this study , enrolled 
subjects had inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to 1 convent ional therapy, 
including corticosteroids, immuno modulators, and/or TNF -α antagonists (in cluding primary  
nonresponders). Subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 6 after 2 doses of open- label 
vedo lizumab IV (at Week 0 and Week 2) were eligible to be randomized. For the evaluat ion of the 
Week 52 endpo ints, 409 subjects were randomized and treated in a double- blind fashio n (2:1) to 
receive vedo lizumab SC 108 mg or placebo SC Q2W. The primary efficacy endpo int was met; 
statist ically significant ly higher clinical remissio n rates at Week 52 were observed in the 
vedo lizumab SC group than in th e placebo group. Across mult iple efficacy endpo ints, including all 
secondary  endpoints, trends favoring vedolizumab SC over placebo were observed. Alt hough not 
statist ically significant, for the secondary efficacy endpo int of enhanced clinical response at Week 
52, the treatment difference favored vedolizumab SC treatment. A clinically meaningful effect of 
vedo lizumab SC over placebo was observed for the secondary endpo int of corticosteroid -free 
remission at Week 52. A favorable trend for the efficacy o f ved olizumab SC was also observed for 
the secondary  endpoint of clinical remissio n at Week 52 in the TNF -α antagonist na ïve subject 
popul ation. Because secondary endpo ints were sequent ially assessed as long as they met statist ical 
significance and because the first secondary  endpoint was missed, the remaining secondary  
endpo ints coul d not be form ally assessed.
Safety data from  the com pleted phase 3 placebo -controlled study  in subjects wi th UC and CD 
indicate that vedolizumab SC was well tolerated wit h an accept able safet y profile (refer to the 
current edition o f the IB). Except for inject ion site reactions, the safet y profile o f vedo lizumab SC 
was consistent with that for vedolizumab IV. In both studies (MLN0002SC -3027 and 
MLN0002SC -3031), injection site react ions were more frequent ly reported in the vedo lizumab SC 
group than in the placebo group. For both studies, the most frequent infect ion AEs were reported in 
the High Level Term o f upper respi ratory  tract infecti on. The frequency of SAEs was generally 
similar across treatm ent groups wi thin each o f the studi es, and no inject ion site reactions led to 
discontinuat ion of the study  medicati on. 
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
As IV infusio n may not be convenient as long -term therapy for some pat ients, vedolizumab SC has 
been developed to enable inject ion by pat ients or their caregivers. 
This is a phase 3b OLE study to gather long -term efficacy and safet y of vedo lizumab subcutaneous 
(vedo lizumab SC) in subjects with UC or CD. All enro lled subjects will receive vedo lizumab SC 
108 m g. Establishing the long -term safet y and tol erabili ty of vedolizumab SC is a key  com ponent 
of the clinical development program o f vedo lizumab SC in UC and CD. From this OLE study of

CONFIDENTIAL6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION
6.1 Study Desig n
This is a phase 3b OLE study  to gather l ong-term safety and efficacy of vedo lizumab SC in 
subjects with UC and CD. All enrolled subjects will receive vedo lizumab SC 108 mg. Establishing 
the long-term safet y and tol erabilit y of vedo lizumab SC is a key com ponent of the clinical 
development program of vedo lizumab SC in UC and CD. 
From  this OLE study  of vedo lizumab SC therapy, data regarding the occurrence of important 
clinical events result ing from chronic vedolizumab SC administration will be obtained. Imp ortant 
clinical events including those related to safet y and AESIs as well as efficacy (eg, maintenance of 
clinical remissio n/clinical response, qualit y of life, and various other health outcomes measures) 
will be co llected. This study will provide long -term safet y data for vedolizumab SC dosing to 
complement the safet y data gathered fro m Study  MLN0002SC -3027 in UC subjects and Study  
MLN0002SC -
3031 in CD subjects.
A control group has not been included in this study based on the following considerat ions. Fi rst, 
since the observed rates of rare safet y events such as those listed above can be est imated fro m an 
observat ional study , a controlled study  is unnecessary . Second, all subjects participat ing in this 
long-term safet y study  will have participated in a pre vious MLN0002SC study .
Subjects enro lling in this OLE study  will have participated in the MLN0002SC- 3027 or

Subjects with UC or CD who completed the Maintenance Phase (Week 52) will receive 
vedo lizumab SC 108 mg Q2W.
Subjects with UC or CD who withdrew early fro m the Maintenance Phase due to disease 
worsening or need for rescue medicat ions fro m Week 14 will receive vedo lizumab SC 108 mg

PFS+AI (autoi njector) presentation will replace the PFS p resentation.
The fo llowing applies regardless of the ty pe of presentati on of  SC device used:
After receiving init ial (Week 6 nonresponders) or refresher training fro m the healt h care provider 
([HCP]; invest igator or designee) on the proper SC injection technique and how to manage 
hypersensit ivity reacti ons potenti ally associ ated with the inject ion, the subjects or their caregivers 
will inject the active vedo lizumab SC under the supervisio n of the HCP at the first 2 clinic visits in 
this study . In addi tion to the subjects training and HCP supervisio n of the SC inject ion technique, 
the first 2 clinic visits will allow the direct observation of any  potenti al hypersensit ivity or 
inject ion site reactions associated with active SC inject ion and timely intervent ion. HCPs will have 
appropriate monitoring and treatment for hypersensit ivity reacti ons available for use. Subjects 
who experience a severe hypersensit ivity react ion associ ated wi th active SC inject ion will be 
discontinued fro m the study . 
Clinic visits will occur at Weeks 0, 1 (QW subjects only ), 2 (Q2W subjects only ), 4, 8, 16, and 
every 8 weeks unt il at least Week 72 or the next visit that is a mult iple of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 
144, etc), and then every 24 weeks thereafter until the end of the study. Vedoli zumab SC inject ions 
by subjects or caregivers may occur under the supervisio n of study  staff at each clinic visit. All 
other scheduled doses should occur outside of the clinic. Between visits scheduled every 
24weeks, subjects will return to the clinic eve ry 8weeks only to receive an 8 -week supply  of 
vedo lizumab SC for administration at home; no other scheduled procedures will be performed. If 
any assessments are needed at the study medicat ion dispensation visit (eg, to address an AE), these 
assessments wo uld be recorded as an unscheduled visit.
Subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to inject vedolizumab SC into the thigh, abdomen, 
or upper arm, and to rotate the inject ion sites. Subjects and their caregivers will be instructed that 
the upper arm is to be used only when the caregiver administers the SC inject ion. Details on the 
training protocol and inject ion technique will be included in the appropriate Study Manual .For all 
SC dosing occurring outside of the clinic, subjects will receive a phone call fro m study staff within 
24 hours prior to every  inject ion for these scheduled doses to administer the PML subjective 
checklist and inquire about general healt h status and experience with prior inject ion. In accordance 
with the Risk Assessment and Management Program for PML (RAMP), any  posi tive PML 
subjective finding must be evaluated via the physician administered PML object ive checklist prior 
to subject receiving the respective dose (refer to RAMP Site Staff Brochure). AEs reported by the 
subject will be handled in accordance with Sect ion 10.0 of the protocol .
Once the PFS+AI is available, subjects will switch fro m administering vedo lizumab SC in a PFS 
to administering vedo lizumab SC in a prefilled syringe in an autoinjector (PFS+AI). Subjects 
switching to the PFS+AI device will receive training on how to use PFS+AI before starting 
self-inject ion athome. An addit ional clinic visi t for training can be arranged as needed. After 
switching to PFS+AI, subjects will continue with all procedures as per the study  schedule during 
the rem aining length of the OLE study  (Secti on 9.1.22 ).

CONFIDENTIALvedo lizumab IV dosing maintenance regimen (300 mg Q8W) in the phase 3 regist ration studies 
(C13006 and C13007). The vedo lizumab exposure -efficacy  relat ionship has been demo nstrated in 
UC subjects in Study  C13006, where higher serum vedo lizumab concentrations were associated 
with higher efficacy . 
Therefore, a vedolizumab SC dosing regimen that provi des similar exposure to that from the 
recommended vedolizumab IV dosing regimen is predicted to provide similar efficacy and have a 
similar safet y profile. The vedo lizumab SC maintenance dosing regimen o f 108 m g Q2W was 
selected based on modeling and simulations fro m the preliminary  resul ts from the single -dose 
phase 1 study MLN0002SC -101, where the SC bioavailabilit y was assessed for vedolizumab SC at 
different dose levels. At this vedo lizumab SC dose level, it is ant icipated that the av erage serum 
concentration over the dosing interval at steady -state (C av,ss) will match the recommended 
vedo lizumab IV maintenance dosing regimen, while the steady -state trough serum concentration 
(Ctrough) levels will be approximately twice the levels achieved in the vedo lizumab IV Q8W 
regimen, but below the vedolizumab IV Q4W regimen.
A dose escalat ion regimen of vedo lizumab SC 108 mg QW will be administered in subjects with 
loss of clinical  response at enrollment in the current study , or who l ose response or experience 
treatm ent failure during the current study. This regimen is expecte d to result in similar C avg,ssvalue 
to that of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg Q4W and approximately double in comparison to vedolizumab 
SC 108 m g Q2W or vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W, while the C troughis expected to be 
approximately  50% higher com pared to vedolizumab IV 300 m g Q4W. Hi gher m ultiple doses 
(6and 10 mg/kg) have been evaluated in a limited number of UC subjects in phase 2 vedo lizumab 
IV studi es (C13002 and C13004), and the exposure, including C trough, achieved at these higher 
doses was higher than the ste ady-state exposure from SC 108 mg QW regimen. The safet y profile 
at these higher doses fro m the phase 2 studies was consistent with Q8W and Q4W dosing, 
suggest ing a lack of addit ional safet y concerns at the proposed vedo lizumab SC dose escalat ion 
regimen ( 108 m g QW). Based on the long -term vedolizumab IV safet y data fro m the C13008 
study  this dose escalat ion regimen is expected to lead to improved efficacy without unacceptable 
increase in safet y risk.

The m aximum  dose of oral  corti costeroi d for the treatm ent of UC or CD that may be 
coadministered with vedo lizumab SC as a long- term regimen is 30 m g/day  of predniso ne (or 
equivalent), or 9 mg/day o f budesonide. Subjects who require consistent doses higher than 
30mg/day o f prednisone (or equivalent) should be wit hdrawn fro m the study . Cases in which the 
investigator believes the subject should stay  on study  must be di scussed wi th the m edical advisor 
or the Takeda medical mo nitor.
Subjects receiving oral corticosteroids will begin an oral corticosteroid tapering re gimen once the y 
either achieve clinical response or if, in the opinio n of the invest igator, they have demo nstrated 
sufficient improvement in clinical signs and symptoms since participat ion in another vedo lizumab 
SC study .
The recommended tapering schedule is as fo llows:
For predni sone at doses >10 mg/day  (or equivalent), the dose should be reduced at a rate of 
5mg per week unt il a 10 m g/day dose i s reached.
For prednisone at doses ≤10 mg/day (or equivalent) or once a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is 
achie ved by tapering, the dose should be reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week unt il 
discontinuat ion.
For budesonide, the dose should be tapered at a rate of 3 mg every 3 weeks.
Invest igators should strongly consider withdrawing subjects who require recurrent 
corticosteroi d courses wi th an inabilit y to taper.
7.4 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from  the study  or study 
medicat ion shoul d be recorded in the electronic case report for m (eCRF) using the fo llowing 
categori es. For enrollment failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.20 .
1.Pretreatment event (PTE) or AE. The subject has experienced a PTE or AE that requires early 
termination because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s 
healt h or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the PTE or AE.
LFT Abnormalit ies.
Study  medicati on shoul d be dis continued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up 
(including repeat laboratory  tests, until a subject’s laboratory  profile has returned to 
norm al/baseline status, see Section 9.1.9 ), if the fo llowing circumstances occur at any time 
during study  medicat ion treatment:

–ALT or AST >3 × ULN with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
2.Significant protocol  deviat ion. The discovery  after the first dose of study  medicat ion that the 
subject failed to meet protocol entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health.
3.Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful. Three attempts to con tact the subject must be documented (ie, 2 attempts 
by phone and 1 attempt by  registered l etter).
4.Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject wish es to wi thdraw from  the study . The reason for 
withdrawal , if provi ded, shoul d be recorded in the eCRF.
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, 
where possible, the primary  underlying reason should be reco rded (ie, withdrawal due to an 
AE or l ack of  efficacy shoul d not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category ). 
5.Study  terminat ion. The sponsor, IRB, IEC, or regulatory  agency  terminates the study .
6.
Pregnancy. The subject is found to be pregnant. 
Note: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately. The 
procedure is described in Sect ion 9.1.11 .
7.Lack of efficacy. 
Treatment failure as determined by disease worsening (as defined in Section 9.3.2 ) or need 
for rescue m edicat ions (as defined in Sect ion 7.3.1 )
 in subjects receiving the vedo lizumab 
SC QW regimen.
Need for m ajor surgi cal intervent ion for the treatment of UC or CD.
8.Leukopenia or lymphopenia: WBC and lymphocy te counts will be mo nitored for all subjects. 
Azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine, or methotrexate, if applicable, should be discont inued and the 
dose of study drug held for an abso lute lymphocyt e count <0.5×109/L at any po int in the study. 
The abso lute lymphocy te coun t must be repeated at appropriate intervals as determined by the

8.2 Investigational Drug Assignment and Dispensing Procedures
Subjects will be assigned to receive treatment according to the schedule allo cated to each study  
site.
The invest igator or invest igator’s designee will access the interactive web response system 
(IWRS) prior to Week 0 to register a subject as eligible. Subjects will retain their subject ID from 
their respect ive parent study (MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031). The invest igator or the 
investigator’s designee will ut
ilize the IWRS to enroll the subject into the study. The medicat ion 
ident ificat ion (ID) number of the invest igational drug to be dispensed will then be provided by the 
IWRS as well as at subsequent visits. If sponsor -supplied drug is lost or damaged, the site can 
request a replacement from IWRS. Refer to the appropriate study  manual  provided separately for 
additional information. 
For SC inject ion, the recommended sites are the lower abdomen (except for the 2 inch area around 
the navel), the outer area of the upper arms, and the front of the thighs. The inject ion site should be 
changed for consecut ive inject ions. Each new injection should be given at least 1 inch from a site 
used before.
During clinic visits, vedolizumab SC inject ions may be administered by  the subject (or caregiver) 
under the supervisio n of a HCP prepared to manage hypersensit ivity react ions including 
anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measure shoul d be 
available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed during the administration and for one 
hour fo llowing com pletion of the administration.
Study  medicati on storage, di sposal and di rections for use for the subject inject ions will be 
described in i nformation provided to the subject.
For further dispensing informat ion, please refer to the pharmacy and/or appropriate study manual.

8.4 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor- Supplied Drugs
Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned to the sponsor or 
designee.
The investigator or designee mus t ensure that the sponsor -supplied drug is used in accordance wit h 
the protocol and is dispensed only to subjects enro lled in the study . To docum ent appropri ate use 
of sponsor -supplied drug, vedolizumab SC, the investigator or designee must maintain record s of 
all sponsor -supplied drug delivery to the site, site inventory, dispensat ion and use by each subject, 
and return to the sponsor or designee.
Upon receipt of sponsor -supplied drug, the invest igator or designee must verify the contents of the 
shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantit y is correct, and the 
medicat ion is in good condit ion. If quant ity and condit ions are acceptable, invest igator or designee 
shoul d acknowl edge the recei pt of the shipment (by  signing botto m half of the packing list and 
faxing per instructions provided on the form or by  recording in IWRS). If there are any  
discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, Takeda must be 
contacted to resolve the issue. The packing lis t shoul d be filed in the investigator’s essent ial 
docum ent file.
The invest igator or designee must maintain 100% accountabilit y for all sponsor -supplied drugs 
received and dispensed during his or her entire participat ion in the study . Proper drug 
accountab ility includes, but is not limit ed to:
Continuously mo nitoring expiration dates if expiry date is provided to the invest igator or 
designee.

questionnaires at the time po ints specified in the schedule of events ( Appendix A). Subject s will 
also complete the WPAI -UC or WPAI -
CD to assess the impact of disease on loss of work 
productivit y and act ivity impairment.
9.1.18.1 Inflammatory Bow el Disease Questionnaire
The IBDQ is a valid and reliable [37]instrument u sed to assess qualit y of life in adult subjects with 
IBD. It includes 32 questions on 4 domains o f HRQOL: Bowel  Systems (10 i tems), Em otional 
Funct ion (12 items), Social Funct ion (5 items), and Systemic Funct ion (5 i tems). Subjects are 
asked to recall symp toms and qualit y of life fro m the last 2 weeks and rate each item on a 7 -point 
Likert scale (higher scores equate to higher qualit y of life). A total IBDQ score is calculated by  
summing the scores fro m each dom ain; the total  IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 22 4.
9.1.18.2 EQ-5D Questionnaire
The EQ -5D questionnaire, developed by the ‘EuroQol Research Foundat ion’ is a simple, valid, 
and reliable [38]instrument used to measure genera l HRQOL in subjects and includes 5 domain 
items -mobility, self -care, usual  activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Subjects 
choose the level of healt h probl ems they  currently  have on each i tem as “None”, “Moderate”, or 
“Extreme” and are scor ed a 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A composite EQ -5D score can be calculated 
from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. The EQ -5D visual analog score (VAS) score 
is a self -assigned rating of overall healt h using a 20 cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as 
the worst and 100 as best possible healt h. The EQ -5D index score and EQ -5D VAS score have 
been shown in many studies to be valid and reliable instruments for measuring HRQOL in patients 
with GI di seases.

There i s no m inimum t ime for repeat evaluation by unscheduled visit in order to determine if a 
subject meets the criteria for disease worsening. In general, however, enough time should be 
provi ded for clinically  meaningful change to occur. 
9.3.6 Poststudy Care
The study  medication will not be available upon complet ion of the subject’s participat ion in the 
study . The subject should be returned to the care of a physician and standard therapies as required.
9.3.7 Alternative Approaches to Study Procedures and Data Collection Due to a Pandemic 
In unavo idable circumstances, in particular a pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other future similar 
unexpected public healt h concerns), that impact the study  site’s abili ty to conduct study  
procedures according to the Schedule of Study  Procedures ( Appendix A), contingency  measures 
may be implemented. The following information provides guidance regarding changes to the study 
procedures that could be implemented for study participants or study  sites that are affected by  a 
pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other future similar unexpected public healt h concerns) that require 
physical distancing that may  resul t in subjects missing their visits. This guidance is aligned wit h 
the current guidance fro m global heal th authori ties on the conduct of clinical studies during the 
COVID -19 pandemic.
Because a pandemic (eg, COVID -19) may peak in different regions at different times and 
restri ctions implemented by local laws and recommendat ions may vary , any  decisi on on 
procedural  changes shoul d be m ade on a case -by-case basis by  the princi pal investi gator i n 
consultation wit h the sponsor or designee, while maintaining subject safet y and confident iality as 
the priority.
The principal invest igator shoul d also notify the IEC/IRB as appropriate of any  deviat ion for 
temporary  use of  alternat ive methods for conducting subject visits (eg, video conferencing, 
telephone visits) and use of the direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment process in the event of res trictive 
measures due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19), per local requirements.
Procedural  changes due to COVID -19 (or other similar pandemic) may include the fo llowing:
All attem pts shoul d be made to perform the assessments with the subject present at the sit e 
using the visit windows. Exceptions may be granted for alternat ive approaches to study  
procedures and data collection through approval by the sponsor or designee. Such instances 
must be documented in the study  records and may include the fo llowing:

CONFIDENTIAL–Sitesimpacted by  a pandemic (eg, COVID -19) must contact the sponsor or designee to 
discuss individual subject and site circumstances to obtain approval for use of alternat ive 
approaches to study  procedures and data collect ion.
–Sites may seek approval fro m the Medi cal Monitor to continue subjects in the study despite 
departure from the Schedule of Study  Procedures. Principal investigators are expected to 
evaluate the impact to the safety o f the study part icipants and site personnel for subjects to 
continue. In e valuat ing such requests, the sponsor or designee will give the highest priorit y 
to the safet y and welfare of the subjects. Subjects must be willing and able to con tinue 
taking study  medicati on and rem ain com pliant wi th the protocol .
Inform ed Consent Proced ure:If necessary and if required locally, informed consent from a 
study  participant m ay be obtained via verbal consent when these individuals are unable to 
travel  to the site. Informed consent forms will be signed once the subject can return in person to 
the study  site.
Clinic Visits: For clinic visit s (other than the Final Visit/ET Visit and the Final Safet y 
Follow-up Vi sit), alternative m ethods for conducting subject visits (eg, video conferencing, 
telephone visits) may  be used wi th prior approval  by the spo nsor or designee (ie, telemedicine 
visit):
–When approval is given for a clinic visit to be conducted using an alternat ive approach, a 
study  site physician will speak direct ly wit h the subject by telephone or other medium (eg, 
a computer -based video communi cation) during each visit window to assess subject safet y 
and overall clinical status.
–Assessments: During visits using an alternative method, the study  site physician or other 
qualified site personnel should contact the subject and conduct the fo llowing a ssessments
within specified visit window timeframes: AE/SAE collect ion, docum entati on of  
concomitant medicat ion and procedures, diary review, administration of the subject ive 
PML checklist, subject assessment of disease activity based on subject -reported s ymptoms, 
and PRO assessments (IBDQ, EQ -5D, and WPAI). Sites may record the scores of the 
IBDQ, EQ -5D, and WPAI assessments on behalf of the subject, with the subject’s 
agreem ent in the event of a telemedicine visit. 
–Primary Efficacy  Measurement: For subje cts wi th CD, during telemedicine visits that are 
conducted with prior approval by the sponsor or designee due to unavo idable 
circumstances related to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19), si tes m ay record subject -reported 
components of the HBI score on behalf o f the subject during the telemedicine visit, with 
the subject’s agreement. In such situations, site personnel would not be able to access any 
data provided by the subject at any  other visit. For subjects with UC, subject -reported 
components of the parti al May o score should be recorded in the daily diary  per protocol . 
For all subjects, the investigator’s assessment of disease act ivity shoul d still be performed 
based on subject -reported symptoms and recorded in the source documents even if a 
physical examinat ion cannot be performed.

CONFIDENTIAL–Collect ion of Clinical Laboratory  Sam ples: Safety laboratory  assessments (i e, clinical 
chemistry  and hematol ogy) shoul d be conducted at least every  24 weeks. If a subject is 
unable to visit the study site due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19), sites may elect to use local 
laboratories if it is feasible for the subject to visit a local laboratory  sooner than the study  
site for sam ple collect ion. Local  laboratory  assessments should include clinical chemistry  
and hematol ogy, as specified in Table 9.a, and results should be communicated to the 
Medical Monitor and used to ensure subject safet y. Stool  samples and collect ion of 
samples for FSH,  are not required when local 
laboratories are used; however, sampling for these assessments will be resumed upon the 
subject’s subsequent visit to the site. Female subjects of childbearing potential will 
continue to complete at- home urine pregnancy tests on a monthly basis prior to 
administration of study  drug.
–Protocol  Deviat ions:Any deviat ions from the protocol -specified procedures due to a 
pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other similar pandemic) will be recorded as related to a 
pandemic (eg, COVID -19).
Final Visit/ET Visit and Final Safet y Follow-up Visi t:The Final Visit/ET Visit and the Final 
Safety Follow-up Vi sit shoul d be perform ed wi th the subject present at the study  site. If  the 
visit cannot be conducted onsite within the visit w indow, sites may conduct final visit 
procedures remotely as is feasible, including using local laboratories for assessment of clinical 
chemistry  and hematol ogy (as specified in Table 9.a). Assessments that cannot be completed 
during the protocol -
specified window will be recorded as a protocol deviat ion, and such 
deviat ions will be recorded in the study  records as rel ated to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or 
other similar pan demic).
SC Inj ection Training and Monitoring of Hypersensit ivity React ions:See Secti on6.1for 
subject/caregiver training upon study  entry  of prop er SC inject ion and m anagement of 
hypersensit ivity react ions potenti ally associ ated with an SC inject ion. See Section 9.1.17 for 
procedures related to the PML checklist and Section 11.1.1 for training procedures of site 
personnel and subjects in recognizing signs and symptoms of PML. See Section 10.2 for 
procedures for collecting and reporting AEs, SAEs, and abnormal LFTs.
For all SC dosing occurring outside of the clinic, subjects will receive a phone call fro m study 
staff wit hin 24 hours prior to every  inject ion for these scheduled doses to administer the PML 
subjective checklist and inquire about general healt h status and experience with prior inject ion 
(see Section 6.1). This telephone visit should occur before every dose occurring outside of the 
clinic, regardless of any  alternative procedures implemented due to a pandemic (eg, 
COVID -19). 
In cases of a posit ive PML checklist or when a physical examinat ion or other in -person 
procedure is needed in response to an AE, the subject should be evaluated in person at the site 
per protocol if possible. If the subject cannot visit the site due to a pande mic (eg, COVID -19), 
the site shoul d contact the Medical Monitor.

alternat ive study  medicati on delivery  to subj ects may  be necessary  to provi de study  
medicat ion if an in -person visit to the study  site is not feasible. In this situat ion, study  
medicat ion (no m ore than an 8 -week supply) may be shipped directly fro m study  sites to the 
subject’s residence by a contracted logistics provider or distributor (DTP shipment) in 
compliance wit h nat ional laws or temporary  national emergency  measures and wi th sponsor 
standard operating procedures. Details of the process are provided in the pharmacy manual. 
Discontinuati on or Wi thdrawal  From the Study  or Study  Medicat ion:If a subject c hooses to 
withdraw from  the study  or study medicati on due to personal  concerns rel ated to a pandemic 
(eg, COVID -19), this must be specified as the reason for subject withdrawal in the eCRF. 
AEs of COVID-19–related di sease and COVID -19 pneum onia are now in cluded as m edically 
significant AEs (see Table 10.a).
For subjects who are impacted, any alternat ive approaches to study procedures (ie, procedures not 
conducted per t he Schedule of Study Procedures) due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other 
similar pandemic) must be documented in the study records as related to a pandemic (eg, 
COVID -19). Data collected using alternat ive methods may be handled different ly in the final data 
analyses. This will be documented in the SAP. 
9.4 Biological Sample Retention and Destruction
In thi s study , specimens will be collected as described. The samples will be sent to a central 
laboratory  that processes the samples and serves as a secure storag e facilit y. The sponsor and 
researchers working with the sponsor will have access to the samples collected and any test resul ts. 
All samples co llected during the study will be stored securely wit h limited access and the sponsor 
will require anyo ne who work s with the samples to agree to hold the research informat ion and any 
resul ts in confidence.
Samples will  be stored for no l onger than 15 y ears after com pletion of the study . No sam ples will 
be stored for longer than permitted by  the applicable law and samp les will be destroy ed upon 
notification fro m Takeda. 
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample ident ifier similar to labeling in the main study but 
using a code that is different from the code attached to the health information and other clinical te st 
resul ts collected in the study . The sample and data are linked to personal health informat ion with 
code numbers. This link means that the subject may be ident ified but only indirect ly. The code 
numbers will be kept secure by  or on behalf of the sponsor.
Subjects who consented and provided pharmacogeno mic samples in the prior study can withdraw 
their consent and request disposal o f their stored sample at any  time. Notify sponsor of consent 
withdrawal .

CONFIDENTIAL10.0 PRETREATMENT EVENTS (PTE) ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND PROD UCT 
COMPLAINTS (PC)
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A PTE i s defined as any  untoward m edical  occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but pri or to administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessar ily have to have a causal relat ionship with study participat ion. For 
this study that is the time period between ET/Week 52 of the parent study and Week 0 of this study.
10.1.2 AEs
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
In addit ion, drug -device AEs related to qualit y or malfunct ion will be collected.
10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for PTEs and AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indic ate a new di agnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedu re.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason.
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/ AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 10 20 October 2020
CONFIDENTIALLaboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  re-test and/or continued monitoring o f an abnormal value are not considered an 
intervent ion. In add ition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagno sis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medic al condi tions and shoul d NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing episodic condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an 
episode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the episodes beco me mo re frequent, serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataract s, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condi tionshoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg , “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators shou ld ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul densure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).

CONFIDENTIALChanges in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
capture d once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent arenot considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
performed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive sur geries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surg ery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction bet ween exacerbation o f pre-existing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose withany medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF.
10.1.4 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion.
4.Results in persistent o r significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.

PTEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are also to be considered SAEs and should 
be reported and fo llowed up in the same manner (see Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 ).
10.1.5 Special Interest AEs 
A special interest AE (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to 
the com pound or program , for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communicat ion by the 
investigator to Takeda may be appropriate. Such events may require further invest igation in order 
to characterize and understand them and would be described in protocols and instructions provided 
for invest igators as to how and when they should be reported to Takeda. Refer to Section 10.2.1.4
for inform ation for speci al interest AE reporti ng. 
10.1.6 Severity of PTEs and AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as foll
ows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by  the subject.
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship o f each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvemen t of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequen ce from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assesse d 
as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject 
and/or physician.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Episodi c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdrawn –a study  medication is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stopping a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study  medicati on was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion was already 
stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose Increased –the dose was increased due to the particular AE.
Dose I nterrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  one or m ore stages: the di agnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congeni tal anom aly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardi ovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death. 
Unknown –the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospital change or 
residence change at the end of the subject ’s participation in the study .
10.1.14 Product Complaints
A product complaint (PC) is a verbal, written, or electronic expressio n that implies dissat isfaction 
regarding the identit y, strength, puri ty, quali ty, or s tabilit y of a drug product and/or presentation

CONFIDENTIALCollect ion of AEs will co mmence fro m the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study  and cont inue until the subject is first administered study medicat ion 
(Week 0) or until enro llment failure. For subjects who discont inue prior to study medicat ion 
administration, PTEs are collected unt il the subject discont inues study participation.
Collect ion of AEs will co mmence fro m the time that the subject is first administered study  
medicat ion (Week 0). Routine co llection of AEs will cont inue until 18 weeks post l ast dose of 
medicat ion.
10.2.1.2 AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs oc curring at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the c hange. 
Non-serious PTEs, rel ated or unrel ated to the study  procedure, need not to be followed- up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust be m onitored u ntil the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The 
following informat ion will be documented for each event:
1.Event term .
2.Start and stop date. 
3.Severit y.
4.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship between the event and administration of study 
medicat ion(s) (rel ated or not rel ated) (not completed for PTEs).
5.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship to study  procedure(s), including the details of 
the suspected procedure.
6.Action concerning study  medicat ion (not applicable for PTEs).
7.Outcom e of event.
8.Seriousness.
Several qualit y of life (QOL) instruments will be used in this study (eg, IBDQ, EQ -5D, WPAI -UC 
or WPAI -CD). They  will not be used as a primary  means to collect AEs. However, should the 
investigator become aware of a potential AE through the informat ion collected with this 
instrum ent, proper follow -up wi th the subject for medical evaluat ion shoul dbe undertaken.

10.2.1.3 Adverse Event Collection Involving Medically Anticipated Clinical Events 
UC and CD are ass ociated wi th certain characteristic signs and symptoms, including diarrhea and 
rectal  bleeding, that m ay be present at Baseline and persist or fluctuate based on the individual 
subject’s disease history  during the course of the study . These signs and sympt oms will  not be 
collected as AEs. These characterist ics of disease activit y will be regul arly captured in the May o 
score or HBI respectively. 
Exacerbat ions of disease act ivity (eg, increase in the daily  amount of  rectal  bleeding bey ond the 
subject’s norma l fluctuation, new signs and symptoms of UC or CD) will be collected as AEs and 
reported according to regulatory  reporting requi rements. 
Extra -intestinal manifestations of the subject’s disease (eg, arthralgia, arthrit is, uveit is) that 
develop or worsen during the study  are consi dered AEs. 
10.2.1.4 Special Interest AE Reporting
If this special interest AE , whi ch occurs during the treatment period or the fo llow-up peri od, is 
considered to be clinically significant based on the criteria below, it should be recor ded in the 
special interest AE eCRF or an SAE Form. The Form shoul d be com pleted and reported to SAE 
reporting contact in Sect ion 1.1within 24 hours.
Hypersensitivity Reactions (including injection site reactions). 
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence such 
prem edicat ions are unlikely to be necessary or beneficial. At the discret ion of the invest igator, 
however, subjects may  be administered premedicatio n prior to any  study  drug a dministrati on. 
Corti costeroi ds, if given as a premedicat ion, should be limited to the day  of administrati on. 
During clinic visits, vedo lizumab SC should be administered in the presence of a healt h care 
professio nal prepared to manage hypersensit ivity reactions including anaphylaxis, if they  occur. 
Appropriate monitoring and medical support measure should be available for immediate use. 
Subjects should be observed during the administratio n and for one hour following co mpletion o f 
the administration.
Subject s and caregivers will be instructed to report the development of rash, hives, pruritus, 
flushing, urticaria, injections site pain, redness and/or swelling, etc. that may represent an 
administration -related reacti on to study  medicat ion. Subj ects will be ask ed to report 
administration related AEs to the sites immediately  as they  are experienced or after having 
received appropriate medical care. Appropriate treatment and fo llow-up will be determined by the 
Invest igator. If signs or symptoms of an administratio n-related reacti on are observed during the 
administration of study  medicati on, it shoul d be immediately discont inued and the subject treated 
as medically appropriate. In the case of a mild reaction, study  drug administrati on m ay be

reacti ons) m ust be wi thdrawn from  the study  (see the appropriate Study  Manual ). 
In all cases of administration -related reacti on, the medical mo nitor must be informed as soon as 
practi cal. The disposit ion of subjects with less severe inje ction-related reacti ons shoul d be 
discussed wi th the Medical Monitor.
Serious Infection 
Subjects will be mo nitored for si gns and symptoms of infect ion and for lymphopenia during the 
study . Subjects with signs and symptoms suggestive of infect ions, includi ng GI infect ions, will be 
treated as clinically indicated. Interventions may include ant ibiotic treatment, if appropriate and/or 
discontinuat ion of conco mitant immuno modulators. Bl ood, sputum , urine, and/or stool cultures 
shoul d be obtained as appropriate for the detection and diagnosis of infection. Withho lding or 
terminating study  drug administrati on m ay be considered as described in Sect ion7.4.
Malignancy 
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the study will be reported as AEs. Local medica l 
practi ces for the management of malignances will apply. Subjects with history  of malignancy 
(except for specific cancers) or at high risk for malignancy will be excluded from the study per the 
exclusio n criteria.

10.2.3 Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST elevated >3 ×ULN on 2 consecut ive occasions, the 
abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as an AE. In addition, an LFT Increases eCRF must be co mpleted 
provi ding addit ional information on relevant recent history , risk factors, clinical signs and 
symptoms and results of any addit ional diagnosti c tests performed.
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST >3 ×ULN and total bilirubin >2 ×ULN for which an 
alternat ive etio logy has not been i dentified, the event should be re corded as an SAE and reported 
as per Secti on 10.2.2 . The investigator must con tact the Medical Monitor for discussio n of the 
relevant subject detai ls and possible alternative etiologies, such as acute viral hepat itis A or B or 
other acute liver disease or medical history /concurrent m edical  condi tions. Foll ow-up laboratory  
tests as described in Sect ion 9.1.9 must also be performed. In addit ion, an LFT Increases eCRF 
must be completed and transmitted with the Takeda SAE form (as per Section 10.2.2 )

A data safet y monitoring board (DSMB), independent fro m the sponsor, will be established to 
review safet y data from  this study  on a regul ar bas is and make appropriate recommendations 
regarding the safe conduct of the study . 
A detailed charter will outline all act ivities of the DSMB (eg, ty pe of data reviewed, frequency  of 
meet ings and locat ion of meetings). The DSMB will be closed at the time of market ing approval. 
11.1 Adjudication Committee
A PML Independent Adjudicat ion Committee (IAC) will be implemented for this study. The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist. 
11.1.1 Risk M inimization Action Plan for PML (RAMP Program)
To address the theoretical risk o f the development of PML in subjects treated with vedo lizumab, 
the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a RAMP for PML. The 
complete descri ption of the RAMP program , including m aterials and instructi ons for i ts 
implementation and mo nitoring, i s included in the appropriate Study  Manual. 
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of  study  drug, if applicable. Subjects are assessed for signs and 
symptoms of PML prior to the administration of each dose of study  drug using a PML subject ive 
symptom  checklist. Subj ects wi th a posi tive PML subjective symptom checklist at any  time afte r 
enrollment in a vedolizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a prespecified algorithm 
(the PML Case Evaluat ion Algorithm). The respective dose of study drug will be withheld unt il the 
evaluat ion is co mplete and results are available. Subsequ ent doses of study  will be administered 
only if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively  excluded, as described in the RAMP algorithm. An 
IAC has been stabled as part of the RAMP program to review new neuro logical signs and 
symptoms potentially  consistent wi th PML, and will provide input regarding subject evaluat ion 
and management as defined in the IAC charter. 
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specif ic neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects about PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sit es and are included in the appropriate Study Manual. Forma l 
teaching and traini ng will be performed for site personnel prior to the start of the study . Subjects 
will receive training and educat ional materi als pri or to receiving treatm ent. The informed consent 
form will contain specific informat ion on the hypothetical risk of PML. Any docum ented case of 
PML will be reported as an SAE, regardless of whether hospitalizat ion occurs.

for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA). Drugs will be coded using the World Health Organizat ion 
Drug Dict ionary (WHODRUG).
12.1 Electronic CRFs
Com pleted eCRFs are required for each subject who s igns an informed consent.
The sponsor or its designee will supply investigative sites with access to eCRFs. The sponsor will 
make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRFs. These forms are used to 
transmit the informat ion collected in the performance o f this study  to the sponsor and regulatory  
authori ties. eCRFs must be completed in English. Data are transcribed direct ly onto eCRFs.
After complet ion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by Takeda 
personnel (or designees) and will be answered by the site. 
Correcti ons are recorded i n an audit trail that captures the old informat ion, the new informat ion, 
ident ificat ion of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, and the reason 
for change.
The principal invest igator must review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and must sign 
and date the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furt hermore, the investigator must retain full 
responsibilit y for the accuracy  and authent icity of all data entered on the eCRFs .
eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptabilit y at the study  site during peri odic visi ts 
by study  monitors. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review the subject’s medical 
and hospital records pertinent to the study to ensure accuracy of the eCRFs. The completed eCRFs 
are the sole property  of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third pa rties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmental healt h or regulatory authorities, 
without wri tten permissio n of the sponsor.

Moni toring visit s to the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data , and records. 
The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access to source documents by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (contract research organization) and by the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the spon sor or designee, 
including but not limited to the Invest igator’s Binder, study  medicat ion, subject medical records, 
inform ed consent docum entati on, docum entati on of  subject authori zation to use personal healt h 
inform ation (if separate fro m the inform ed con sent form s), and review o f eCRFs and associated 
source documents. It is important that the invest igator and other study personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator shoul d not devi ate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consu lt with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria.
The site should document all protocol de viations in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify  the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or IEC, as 
requi red). Si gnificant devi ations include, but are not limited to, those that invo lve fraud or 
misco nduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary  study  
assessment. A Protocol Deviation Form should be completed by the site and signed by the sponsor 
or desi gnee for any  significant deviat ion from the protocol. 
The pr ocedure below applies to Japanese sites only.
The invest igator can deviate and change from the protocol for any medically unavo idable reason, 
for example, to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, without a prior written agreement 
with the sponso r or a prior approval fro m IRB. In the event of a deviat ion or change, the 
investigator should notify  the sponsor and the head of the study  site of the deviat ion or change as 
well as its reason in a written form, and then retain a copy of the written form. When necessary, the 
investigator may  consul t and agree wi th the sponsor on a protocol amendment. If the protocol 
amendment i s appropri ate, the am endment proposal should be submitted to the head of the study

according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or regi onal regul atory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Invest igator” that are listed in Appendix B. 
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicab le state and federal/local requirements 
of each participat ing regio n. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has di rect parti cipat ion in this study , written notification regarding his or her abstinence fro m 
voting must also be obtained. Those Americas sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all 
members due to privacy  and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Feder al Wide 
Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by the Department of Health and Human 
Services.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Invest igator’s Brochure, a copy o f 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials and/or advertisements 
and other documents required by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a 
central  or local IRB or I EC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the protocol and 
subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of the study  (ie, before shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug or study specific
enrollment activit y). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study  by exact protocol  title, 
number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns of other documents (eg, informed consent form) 
reviewed; and state the approval date. The sponsor will ship drug and notify  site once the sponsor 
has confirmed the adequacy  of site regul atory  documentati on and, when applicable, the sponsor 
has received permissio n from competent authorit y to begin the trial. Unt il the site receives 
notification no protocol act ivities, in cluding pre -enrollment may occur.

CONFIDENTIAL15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the study, its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the 
date informed consent is given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the 
participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and 
without prej udice to hi s or her further m edical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
inform ed consent form  and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use.
The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subj ect. 
It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both o ral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally  acceptable representative may 
provi de such con sent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participat e in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  the subject, o r the subject’s legally acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, 
using blue or black ballpo int ink. The invest igator must also sign and date the informed consent 
form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at th e time of consent and prior to subject entering 
into the study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee o f the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medical record. Copies of the signed informed consent form, the signed subject authorization for m 
(if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable ) shall  be given to the subject.

CONFIDENTIALAll revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised conse nt was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the revised informed consent form.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to prot ection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulat ions, limite d subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject init ials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy o f the subject’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, FDA, MHRA and PMDA of Japan), the sponsor’s designated auditors, 
and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original  medical records (source data or 
docum ents), including, but not limited to, laboratory  test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n 
and discharge summaries for hospital admissio ns occurring during a subject’s study participation, 
and autopsy  report s. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific 
authori zation of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2).
Copi es of  any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally ident ifiable informat ion rem oved (ie, subject name, address, and other ident ifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Dis closure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication and Disclosure
The investigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the invest igator from the study . During and after the study , only  the sponsor m ay make study  
inform ation available to other study  invest igators or to regulatory  agencies, except as required by  
law or regul ation. Except as otherwise allowable in the clinical study  site agreement, any  public 
disclosure (including publicly accessible we bsites) related to the protocol or study  resul ts, other 
than study  recrui tment m aterials and/or advertisements, is the sole responsibilit y of the sponsor.
The sponsor may publish any data and informat ion fro m the study (including data and informatio n 
gener ated by  the invest igator) without the consent of the invest igator. Manuscript authorship for 
any peer -reviewed publicat ion will appropriately reflect contribut ions to the production and 
review of the document. All publicat ions and presentations must be pre pared in accordance with 
this secti on and the Clinical Study  Site Agreement. In the event of any discrepancy  between the 
protocol  and the Clinical Study  Site Agreement, the Clinical Study  Site Agreement will prevail.

In order to ensure that informat ion on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to 
comply with applicable laws, regulat ions and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum register 
intervent ional clinical tri als it sponsors anywhere in the worl d on ClinicalT rials.gov or other 
publicly  accessible websites before start of study , as defined in Takeda Policy/Standard . Takeda 
contact informat ion, along wit h invest igator’s cit y, state (for Americas investigators), country, and 
recrui ting status will be registered a nd available for public viewing. 
For some registries, Takeda will assist callers in lo cating trial sites closest to their ho mes by 
provi ding the invest igator name, address, and phone number to the callers request ing trial 
inform ation. Once subjects receiv e invest igator contact informat ion, they  may call  the si te 
requesting enrollment into the trial. The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the trial 
inquiries according to their established subject pre -enrollment process. If the caller asks addit ional 
questions bey ond the topic of trial enro llment, they should be referred to the sponsor.
Any invest igator who objects to Takeda providing this informat ion to callers must provide Takeda 
with a wri tten noti ce request ing that their informat ion not be list ed on the registry  site. 
15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure
Takeda will post the results of clinical trial son ClinicalTrials.gov or other publicly  accessible 
websites, as required by Takeda Policy/Standard, applicable laws and/or regulat ions.

(P) = obtained from previous study h=hours, Wk=week.
(a) Subjects (not including those in Japan) will switch to PFS+AI at any scheduled or unscheduled visit when they become availa ble at the site. An additional visit for training of self -injection 
can be set as needed. For sites not able to conduct onsite visits due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other similar pandemic), alternative methods for conducting visits (eg, video conferencing, 
telephone visits) may be used with prior approval by the sponsor or designee. Safety laboratory assessments (ie, clinical chemistry and hematology) sh ould be conducted at least every 24 weeks. 
If a clinic visit must be conducted via alternative methods due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19), safety laboratory assessments may be done using local laboratories if it is feasible for the subject 
to visit a local laboratory sooner than the study site for sample collection. See Section 9.3.7 for guidance on alternative methods for conducting study procedures due to a pandemic. 
(b) Subjects eligibility for OLE will be assessed at ET/Week 52 of the previous study (MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031), or at the relevant visit for Week 14 responders. If the subject 
is deemed eligible they will undertake informed consent for MLN0002SC -3030. Week 0 dosing will occur in accordance with Section 6.1of this protocol. 
(c) The first 2 doses will be administered in the clinic. For all subjects, clinic visits will be at Week 0, 1, 4 and 8 and the n every 8 weeks until at least Week 72 or the next vi sit that is a multiple 
of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 144, etc), and then every 24 weeks thereafter. 
(d) Telephone visit: subjects will be contacted via telephone prior to dosing outside of the clinic every week.
(e) Japan only: subjects can switch to PFS+NSD or PFS+AI at any scheduled or unscheduled visit beginning from the Week 16 visit. An additional visit for training of self -injection 
(eg, 1 week after the switch) can be set as needed. 
(f) Subjects seen at an unscheduled visit for disease exacerbation or SAE will complete the Unscheduled Visit assessments.
(g)Final Visit/ET: The duration of vedolizumab SC treatment will vary by subject based on continued benefit, but will be until vedolizu mab SC is available in the subject’s country
commercially or throug h other access programs.

CONFIDENTIAL(h) Final Safety Follow -up Visit: Subjects will return 18 weeks after the last dose of vedolizumab SC for final safety assessments.
(i) Including reassessment of female reproductive status.
(j) A physical examination will be done at Week 0 if Week 0 is not the same day as ET/Week 52 of the parent study. Physical examinations will then be performed at We eks 1, 4, 8, 16 and every 
8 weeks until at least Week 72 or the next visit that is a multiple of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 144, etc), a nd then every 24 weeks thereafter. Clinically significant findings will be recorded as an AE 
if it starts after the first dose of study drug on thisstudy. 
(k) Vital signs will also be measured on dosing days prior to dosing in the clinic. Height may be t aken from the parent study.
(l) The PML checklist will be administered in person at dosing occurring in the clinic during scheduled visits. The PML subject ive checklist will be administered over the phone when subject is 
injecting outside of the clinic. 
(m) Monitoring of concomitant medications and concomitant procedures will begin at enrollment. Any medications that are ongoing at the end of the parent study and that are still present at the 
time of enrollment into the MLN0002SC -3030 study will be recorde d in the eCRF for Study MLN0002SC -3030.
(n) WPAI -UC/WPAI -CD and PRO (IBDQ, EQ -5D): To be performed at Week 24 and every 24 weeks thereafter while on study. 
(o) Collection of AEs will begin following the signing of the informed consent and will continue th rough to Final Safety Visit. Collection of all SAEs starts at enrollment and will continue 
through to Final Safety Visit.
(p) Disease activity is assessed by partial Mayo score for UC subjects and by HBI for CD subjects in this study and is recorded at the clinic visits.
(q) Dosing in this study (Week 0) will occur no more than 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for completers/ET in Study MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031. For Week 14 
responders from the parent study, Week 0 will occur no more than 1 week (±7 days) from Week 14 in Study MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031. From Week 16, continue QW dosing. 
Subjects will return to the clinic every 8 weeks to receive an 8 -week supply of vedolizumab SC for administration at home.
(r) Pregnancy test: All fema les of child bearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test at the ET/Final Safety Visit. A urine pregnancy test will be completed for all females of child bearin g 
potential prior to each dose of study drug injected during clinic visits and monthly pri or to home dosing.

(a) Subjects (not including those in Japan) will switch to PFS+AI at any scheduled or unscheduled visit when they become availa ble at the site. An additional visit f or training of self -injection 
can be set as needed. For sites not able to conduct onsite visits due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19 or other similar pandemic), alternative methods for conducting visits (eg, video conferencing, 
telephone visits) may be used wit h prior approval by the sponsor or designee. Safety laboratory assessments (ie, clinical chemistry and hematology) should be conducted at least every 24 weeks. 
If a clinic visit must be conducted via alternative methods due to a pandemic (eg, COVID -19), sa fety laboratory assessments may be done using local laboratories if it is feasible for the subject 
to visit a local laboratory sooner than the study site for sample collection. See Section 9.3.7 for guidance on alternative methods for conducting study procedures due to a pandemic.
(b) Subjects eligibility for OLE will be assessed at ET/Week 52 of the previous study (MLN0002SC -3027 or MLN0002SC -3031), o r at the relevant visit for Week 14 responders. If the subject 
is deemed eligible they will undertake informed consent for MLN0002SC -3030. Week 0 dosing will occur in accordance with Section 6.1of this protocol. 
(c)The first 2 doses will be administered in the clinic. For Q2W subjects, clinic visits will be at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and then ev ery 8 weeks until at least Week 72 or the next visit that is a multiple 
of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 144, etc), and then every 24 weeks thereafter.
(d)Telephone visit: subjects will be contacted via telephone prior to dosing outside of the clinic every 2 weeks.
(e)Japan only: subjects can switch to PFS+NSD or PFS+AI a t any scheduled or unscheduled visit beginning at the Week 16 visit. An additional visit for training of self -injection 
(eg, 2 weeks after the switch) can be set as needed. 
(f)Subjects seen at an unscheduled visit for disease exacerbation or SAE will complete the Unscheduled V isit assessments.
(g)Final Visit/ET: The duration of vedolizumab SC treatment will vary by subject based on continued benefit, but will be until vedolizu mab SC is available in the subject’s country 
commercially or through other access programs. 
(h)Final Safety Follow -up Visit: Subjects will return 18 weeks after the last dose of vedolizumab SC for final safety assessments.
(i)Including reassessment of f emale reproductive status.
(j)A physical examination will be done at Week 0 if Week 0 is not the same day as ET/Week 52 of the parent study. Physical exami nations will then be performed at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16 and every 
8 weeks until at least Week 72 or the next visit that is a multiple of 24 (eg, Week 96, 120, 144, etc), and then every 24 weeks thereafter. Clinically significant findings will be recorded as an AE 
if it starts after the first dose of study drug on thisstudy.
(k)Vital signs will also be meas ured on dosing days prior to dosing in the clinic. Height may be taken from the parent study.
(l)The PML checklist will be administered in person at dosing occurring in the clinic during scheduled visit. The PML subjective checklist will be administered o ver the phone when subject is 
injecting outside of the clinic. If the subject is escalating to QW dosing at an Unscheduled Visit for disease exacerbation, then the PML checklist will be administered prior to dosing.
(m)Monitoring of concomitant medication s and concomitant procedures will begin at enrollment. Any medications that are ongoing at the end of the parent study and th at are still present at the 
time of enrollment into the MLN0002SC -3030 study will be recorded in the eCRF for Study MLN0002SC -3030.

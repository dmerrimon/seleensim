Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 7 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  5.  INTRODUCTION An elevated bottle height (i.e. IOP) during surgery had a significant impact post-operatively on the corneal tissue and anterior chamber.1,2 A recent study compared the safety and efficacy of Active Sentry (at 44-50 mmHg) handpiece with Ozil (at 65-70 mmHg) handpiece and found that Active Sentry was as efficacious and as safe.3 However, the study did not utilize the full benefit of Active Sentry, which is also being able to operate at lower IOP levels (down to 20mmhg) compared to Ozil.   6.  OBJECTIVE(S) To assess the efficiency of the Active Sentry handpiece at low IOP compared with the Ozil at high IOP.  7.  SUBJECTS 7.1. Subject Population  Eligible test subjects will be 50 years of age or older and who are eligible to undergo sequential bilateral uncomplicated cataract surgery.   A total of 70 eyes of 35 subjects at one site will be enrolled. Both eyes of a subject must be enrolled. Subjects must meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will be provided information on the study and asked to sign a patient information and consent form to participate. The patient information and consent form will be approved by an appropriate ethics committee. 7.2. Inclusion Criteria Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria: Note: Ocular criteria must be met in both eyes. • Be eligible to undergo sequential bilateral uncomplicated cataract surgery. • Undergo uneventful cataract surgery. • Gender: Males and Females.   • Both eyes must have same grade of cataract. • Willing and able to provide written informed consent for participation in the study.  • Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.   7.3. Exclusion Criteria If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the subject or either eye, the subject should not be enrolled in the study. • Patient under 50 years of age. 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 8 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  • Unable to complete sequential bilateral cataract surgery in both eyes by the same surgeon (JS). • Patient cataract surgery complicated by posterior capsular tear. • Any disease state deemed by PI that increases risk of complicated cataract surgery (ie Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, zonular dehiscence, history of eye trauma, RA, prior refractive surgery, etc). The principal investigator reserves the right to declare a patient ineligible or non-evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.   Pregnancy has a known effect on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such, subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may be excluded from analyses of effectiveness. 8.  STUDY DESIGN 8.1. Study Design  This study is a single site, single-masked, randomized, prospective, contralateral eye study of the efficiency of the Active Sentry handpiece at low IOP compared with the Ozil at high IOP. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively and at 1 day and 1 week post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include measurement of visual acuity and central corneal thickness (CCT).  The primary outcome measure will be the total aspiration time between groups on day of surgery.  Secondary outcome measures are as follows: • Total fluid volume between groups on day of surgery. • Total phaco time between groups on day of surgery. • Total case time between groups on day of surgery. • Aspiration time during phaco between groups on day of surgery. • Central corneal thickness (CCT) between groups at postoperative day 1 and week 1.  Exploratory outcome measures are as follows: • Cumulative dissipated energy between groups on day of surgery.  8.2. Methods Used to Minimize Bias  As a randomized study there is no expected bias. Patient selection will be based on the patient’s interest and the surgeon’s opinion as to whether they are a suitable candidate for sequential bilateral cataract surgery. The data analyzer will be masked.   
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 9 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  The measurement of visual acuity will be conducted in a systematic fashion to minimize bias. Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will be instructed to perform the same testing in the same fashion for all subjects, with the same level of encouragement to subjects.   All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs) or computer files generated by automated test equipment. All site personnel involved in the study will be trained in regard to conducting study-specific procedures. 9.  STUDY PROCEDURE  9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signed documents will be maintained by the investigator as a permanent part of the subject's medical records. A signed copy will be provided to the subject.  9.2. Visits and Examinations  Subjects will participate in 7 study visits, including one visit for screening. Visits will include an uptake visit, two operative visits, and 4 postoperative visit (Visit numbers 1-4 and 2a, 3a, and 4a below).  The visit schedule, complete with window and associated CRF forms, are displayed in Table 9.2-1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be conducted, are provided below.   Table 9.2-1.  Visit Schedule  Visit Number Visit Name Visit Window CRF Number 1 Preoperative  -90 to 0 days from surgery 1 2 Operative 0 from surgery 2 3 1 Day Postoperative  1-2 days postoperative 3 4 1 Week Postoperative 7 days (±3) postoperative 4 2a Operative* 0 from surgery 2a 3a 1 Day Postoperative*  1-2 days postoperative 3a 4a 1 Week Postoperative* 7 days (±3) postoperative 4a *second eye  
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 10 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  9.2.1. Preoperative   At the preoperative exam, subjects will be consented, qualified for the study (compared with inclusion/exclusion criteria), and assigned a study ID/subject number.  Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially at each site in the order of enrollment. Pre-operative qualification should take place no more than 90 days prior to surgery.    A medical history will be taken and exams will include the tests described below: § visual acuity, § slit lamp examination, § central corneal thickness In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care preoperative measures should be undertaken.    Measurements should be made as described in section 9.3 below.   9.2.2. Operative (Surgery)  All subjects will undergo sequential bilateral cataract surgery. The surgeon’s usual standard of care with regard to treatment and medication will be used for all study subjects. Surgery planning will be performed using the surgeon’s preferred method.  Surgical findings will be recorded and will include the tests below: § Total phaco time, § Total aspiration time, § Total fluid volume, § Total case time, § Cumulative dissipated energy  Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.  Any subject whose surgery is not completed successfully will be documented in the appropriate case report form. These subjects will be monitored for safety but clinical performance data may be excluded from the analysis. 9.2.3. Postoperative 1 Day  
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 11 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  All routine, usual standard of care postoperative measures should be undertaken.  In addition, the subject will undergo central corneal thickness measurement, slit lamp examination, and VA testing in accordance with the specifications below (Section 9.3).  Adverse events will be monitored.  9.2.4. Postoperative 1 Week  All routine, usual standard of care postoperative measures should be undertaken.  In addition, the subject will undergo central corneal thickness measurement, slit lamp examination, and VA testing in accordance with the specifications below (Section 9.3).  Adverse events will be monitored.   9.2.5. Exit Procedures In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting that the subject did not complete the study and the reason for premature study exit.  If no premature exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be completed at the end of Visit 7 (Postoperative 1 Week, Second Eye).   9.3. Study Methods and Measurements All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section.  Specific study examination procedures are outlined below.    9.3.1. Central Corneal Thickness (CCT) Central corneal thickness (CCT) will be measured by Pentacam or equivalent. The same methodology of assessing CCT should be consistent for each subject.  9.3.2. Slit Lamp Examination The current standard for quantifying anterior segment inflammation is clinical slit-lamp examination findings classified using the Standardisation of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) grading system.   9.3.3. Visual Acuity (VA) Measure target distance visual acuity using a high contrast Snellen chart under photopic lighting at a distance of 20 ft for eyes targeted for distance and 14-16 inches for eyes targeted for near.   9.4.  Unscheduled Visits Unscheduled exams may be conducted at the discretion of the Investigator with all relevant information from the exam recorded in the source documents and on the Unscheduled Visit pages within the CRF booklet. 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 12 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  9.5.  Discontinued Subjects Discontinued subjects are those who do not have an exit visit or who come into the office to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time if, in the opinion of the investigator, their continued participation in the study poses a risk to their health. The reasons for discontinuation include: a. Adverse event; b. Lost to follow-up; c. Subject decision unrelated to an adverse event; d. Protocol violation; e. Treatment failure; f. Other. To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 7, investigators should assess each subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapies and/or medical procedures that might be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured. 10.  ANALYSIS PLAN 10.1. Analysis Data Sets All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses will be performed based on data from those eyes where uncomplicated cataract surgery was completed.   10.2. Statistical Methodology A summary of the data will be prepared for all measurement time points.   For variables measured on a continuous scale, these summaries will include the sample size, as well as the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. For variables measured on a categorical scale, summaries will provide the number and percentage of subjects in each category. These summaries will be provided for all eyes completing the study.  The difference in the aspiration time between groups will be used to test the non-inferiority hypothesis. If the upper boundary of the 95th confidence interval is not greater than 23, non-inferiority will be claimed. In the event that non-inferiority is demonstrated, then a test of superiority will be performed.  10.3. General Statistical Considerations The statistical analyses will be performed using R, version 4.1.2 or higher.  Any statistical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05. 11.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION Assuming a pooled standard deviation of 36.85 seconds and a mean difference of 0 seconds, the study would require a sample size of: 32 for each group (i.e. 64 eyes of 32 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 13 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  subjects), to achieve a power of 80% and a level of significance of 5%, for declaring that the Active Sentry is not inferior to the Ozil at 23 seconds margin of non-inferiority. To account for drop outs a total of 35 subjects (70 eyes) will be recruited. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons outside of the Study. Results will be submitted for publication and presentation at national and/or international meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer-review journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs). No protected health information will be included on the forms. CRFs will be retained in the patient’s file for a minimum period of 3 years. Collected information will only be used for purposes of this study and no information will be sold to third parties. The following people will have access to your study records:   •    Study Doctor and staff involved with the study  •    Study Monitor or Auditor  •    Sponsor Company or Research Institution  •    Review boards or accrediting agencies  •    Other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies  The de-identified data may be shared with other researchers for future analysis. 13.  QUALITY COMPLAINTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS All subjects will be monitored for adverse events over the course of the study. A place to record any adverse event is included on each case report form. 13.1. General Information An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered. a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical studies, an AE can include an untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by asking if the patient has any problems.  
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 14 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be documented on an Adverse Event Form (AEF). A separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity), any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverse event’s relationship to the study treatment. Nonserious Adverse Events A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that does not meet serious criteria noted below (e.g., is not life-threatening, does not require hospitalization, does not prolong a current hospitalization, is not disabling, etc.). All adverse events must be reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study treatment.  For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be collected on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the study.   Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. NOTE: Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the individual remained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred, the event should be considered serious. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 15 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  • Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE, if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the Medical Monitor immediately (i.e., within one working day of the Investigator’s or site’s knowledge of the event) as follows: o In studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC system.  o Additional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.  In addition to the reporting of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor, the SAE must be reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  The investigator must document all adverse device events (serious and nonserious but related) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints will also be documented.   • Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form must be e-mailed immediately to the study coordinator (Mackenzie Champion). • Additional relevant information is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.    Study coordinator contact information is provided below.

Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 16 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023   Further, depending upon the nature of the adverse event (serious or nonserious) or quality complaint being reported, the study sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subject’s medical records.  The investigator must also report all adverse events and quality complaints according to the relevant IRB requirements.  12.3.1 Intensity and Causality Assessments  For every adverse event and quality complaint, the investigator must assess the causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation. An assessment of causality will also be performed by the Medical Monitor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:  Causality Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event or quality complaint was caused by the medical device.   Not Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality complaint).  Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:   Intensity (Severity) Mild An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom. Moderate An adverse event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities. Severe An adverse event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint when applicable. 13.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up procedures 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 17 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow-up procedures must be documented and available to the study coordinator who, with the Medical Monitor, will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.  13.5. Safety Analyses The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment-related.   14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, consistent with the 1996 version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  In addition, all applicable local, state and federal requirements will be adhered to.  This study is to be conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board regulations.  The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB/ethics committee approval prior to initiating the study. The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov. 14.1 Confidentiality The data collected will be data typical for the procedure(s) when performed on eyes outside the study. Any data collected will become part of the patient’s clinical record. The data will be subject to the same privacy and confidentiality as other data in the clinical record.  Only the principal investigator, research consultant and clinic staff will have access to the data collected. All data shared outside the practice will be de-identified; patients’ protected health information will not be available and will not be reported in any analyses or publications. No data will be sold to third parties. De-identified data may be used for future research.

CONFIDENTIALITY No protected health information (PHI), including the patient’s name and date of birth, will be collected; to ensure this, no PHI information is permitted to be entered on any of the Case Report Forms (CRFs). Subjects will only be identified by subject IDs and identities will be removed at the initial visit so that there is no further need to protect or destroy the information. Collected information will only be used for purposes of this study and no information will be sold to third parties. The non-PHI information collected may be used for future research, though there is currently no plan to do so.  17. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE INFORMATION/STUDY RELATED INJURIES Every effort to prevent study-related injury will be taken by the Study Doctor and staff. In the event a patient is injured as a direct result of the study while following the Study Doctor’s instructions and the study requirements, the patient will be instructed to contact his or her doctor immediately. The Study Doctor is to treat the injured subject as needed 
Active Sentry at low IOP vs Ozil at high IOP Page 19 of 20 v 1.0  27 Apr 2023  for those injuries caused directly by this research study. In the event of injury or illness caused by or occurring during a subject’s participation in this research study, all charges for medical care provided to the subject will be billed to his or her insurance company. The Study Doctor or Sponsor does not offer to cover the medical care costs for injuries or illnesses that are not caused directly by the research study. The Sponsor does not offer to provide any other compensation, unless specifically agreed to elsewhere in this document. This information will be provided to each study subject before the start of the study in the consent form. 18. STUDY ENDPOINT CRITERIA 18.1. Patient Completion of Study  If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 7) of the study, he/she is considered to have completed the study.   18.2. Patient Discontinuation  Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time they choose.  Study patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., non-compliance, failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discontinued from the study.  Study patients discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study will be replaced.   18.3.

We will recruit 44 individuals with a n acute or subacute stroke (3  days to 30 days  post stroke) to 
participate in this randomized controlled  trial at UCI ARU  and Rancho  Los Amigo s National 
Rehabilitation Center . These individuals will have an  acute or subacute  stroke with arm/ hand 
weakness defined as a score of less than 50 (out of 66) on the arm motor scale of the Fugl -Meyer 
Assessment .  
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. History of stroke aff ecting the arm, at least 3 days to 30 days prior to enrollment  
2. Age 18 to 80 years of age  
3. Upper extremity weakness, defined as a score of less than 50 (out of 66) on the arm motor 
scale of the Fugl -Meyer Assessment  
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Moderate to severe pai n in the stroke -affected upper extremity (score >6 on 10-point  visual 
analog pain scale), at rest or increased when attempting to use LARA  
2. Sever e tone at the affected upper extremity (score >4 on the Ashworth Spasticity Scale)  
3. Severe aphasia (score of 2 or  higher on the NIH stroke scale – question 9)  
4. Deficits in vision, language, attention, or other cognitive functions severe enough to interfere 
with using LARA  
5. Currently pregnant  
6. Difficulty in understanding or complying with instructions given by the experi menter  
7. Inability to perform the experimental task that will be studied  
 
Method s: 
The primary outcome measure will be the Upper Extremity Fugl -Meyer Score to assess motor 
impairment in the affected arm.  Secondary outcome measures will be Box and Block s Test, Modified 
Ashworth Scale of Spasticity to measure  spasticity of the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, Visual 
Analog Pain scale to assess pain , NIH Stroke Scale, mini mental state exam to assess cognitive 
function  and the Borg scale to acc ess their perceived exertion levels .  We will perform  testing at three 
separate evaluations: At the initial baseline visit , 3-week s post therapy or the day before discharge if 
sooner, and 3 -month follow up.  The end point of the study will be the 3-month af ter baseline 
evaluation.  
After the baseline evaluation, all participants will be randomized into 2 groups:  LARA group versus 
conventional hand and arm exercise program.   Randomization will be done through  a web-based  
program.  
For LARA group:  participants  will be fitte d for a LARA chair, they will receive a  demonstrat ion by a 
research therapist and be instructed on how to get in/out of the LARA chair, how to propel LARA in a 
straight line, turns, figure 8 if possible.  Participants will also receive training on how to  perform arm 
exercise s using a video  gaming  program .    Participants will receive 2 sessions lasting  30 mins eac h 
for these training exercises .  Participants will begin his/her exercise rou tine starting the third session .  
A research therapis t will be available to assist but study participants are  expected to perform exercise 
routine s by themselves as much as possible.   The r esearch therapist will record and keep a log of 
time spent assisting study participants every day.  
4 
 If supervising therap ists believe LARA participants are skilled enough to drive LARA, participants will 
begin using LARA to go to therapy appointment s and move around ARU by themselves throughout 
the study.  
For control group:  participants will receive a demonstrat ion by a res earch therapist and instruct ions 
on how to perform arm/hand exercise  program s using towel and table.  Towels, tables and an 
exercise log will be provided.  Participants will receive 2 sessions lasting  30 minutes  for each training .  
Participants will begin his/h er exercise rou tine starting the third session .  A research therapist will be 
available to assist but study participants are  expected to perform exercise routine s by themselves as 
much as possible .  The r esearch therapist will record and keep a log of time  spent assisting study 
participants every day.  
Study par ticipants will be compensated with a cash stipend of $100 for each evaluation .  Study 
participants will receive a maximum total of $300 from the study.

Box & Blocks  
Right  Left 
  
 
Box and Blocks Test  
- Open test box and place the divider between the two compartments  
- Position the box lengthwise along the edge of a standard height table with compartment with cubes on same 
side as the subject’s dominant hand  
- Seat the subject in a standard height chair facing the box  
- The examiner sits facing the subject to view blocks being transported and note discrepancies in technique  
- “I want to see how quickly you can pick up one block at a time with your right/left hand (point to hand), carry 
it to the other side of the box and drop it. Make sure your fingert ips cross the partition. Watch me while I 
show you how.”  
- Examiner transports three cubes over partition  
- “If you pick up two blocks at a time, they will count as one. If you drop one on the floor or table after you have 
carried it across, it will still be c ounted, so do not waste time picking it up. If you toss the blocks without your 
fingers crossing the partition, they will not be counted. Before you start, you will have a chance to practice for 
15 seconds. Do you have any questions? Place your hands on th e sides of the box. When it is time to start, I 
will say ‘READY’ and then ‘GO.’”  
- Perform a 15 second practice. If mistakes are made, correct them.  
- “This will be the actual test. The instructions are the same. Work as quickly as you can. READY … (wait 3 
secon ds) GO.”  
- After one-minute  STOP  
- Count the number of blocks transported and record. Subtract blocks transported more than one at a time or if 
the fingertips did not cross over  
- Turn the box so all the blocks are on the same side as the next hand to be tested  
- “Now you are to do the same thing with your left hand. First you can practice. Put your hands on the sides of 
the box as before. Pick up one block at a time with your hand and drop it on the other side of the box. READY … 
(wait 3 seconds) GO.”

0 No increase in muscle tone.  
1 Slight increase in tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal 
resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is 
moved in flexion or extension.  
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal 
resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM, but 
affected part(s) easily moved.  
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but 
affected part(s) easily moved.  
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.  
4 Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension . 
 
 
For elbow, go from full flexion to full extension in 1 second with patient supine 
and arm stop a pad (per Bohannon and Smith, Phys Ther 19 87).

Answers in bold  and underlined  indicate depression. Although differing sensitivities and 
specificities have been obtained across studies, for clinical purposes a score > 5 points is 
suggestive of depression and should warrant a follow -up interview. Scores > 10 are almost 
always depress ion.

 Daily Procedures:   
1. Stroke patients admit ted to ARU . 
2. Screen will be done  upon admission  (within 1-2 days) . 
3. Baseline evaluation will be performed within  1-3 days after the screening visit .  
The therapist will see p atients in  a separate room right outside ARU.   
4. Randomization occurs after baseline evaluation – same day if poss ible.  We will 
use the web-based  formula to randomize  patients from both study sites . 
5. Study participants will be assigned to groups the day after randomization  and 
begin their assigned intervention.  
6. We will measure patient’s heart rate and blood pressure in sitting position before 
and after each training session and record the data in  the vital  signs  log.  
7. For LARA group:  participants will b e fitted for LARA chair, will receive a 
demonstrat ion by a research therapist and will be instructed on how to get in/out of 
LARA chair, how to propel LARA in a straight line, turns, figure 8 if possible  (please see 
below for more details) .  Participa nts will receive 2 sessions lasting  30 minutes  each for 
these trainings .  If time permits, participants will perform video games using LARA in the 
commo n area at ARU.  Instruction for  all these training s will be played through  a pre-
programmed computer.  All data will be recorded to the same computer.  Starting the 
third sessi on, a research therapist  will be available to a ssist but study participants are 
expected to perform exercise routine s by themselves as much as possible.   The 
research therapist will record and keep a log of time spent assisting study participants 
every day.   
Study participa nts will perform the following exercise routines for 15 minutes , 5 days a 
week : 
a. Spin LARA with unimpaired arm (wheel on impaired side is locked) for 30 sec.  
b. Spin LARA with impaired arm (wheel on unimpaired side is locked) for 30 s ec. 
c. Go straight (put these two skills to use) for 2 mins.  
d. Turn test unconstrained (turn towards the impaired side) for 30 sec.  
e. Turn test unconstrained (turn towards the unimpaired side) for 30 sec.  
f. Functional Task (Figure 8 track) for 2 mins.  
Study partici pants will then play the video games:  balloon and rocket driving for another 
15 mi nutes , 5 days a week.  
8. For cont rol group:  participants will receive a demonstration by a research 
therapist and will be instructed on how to perform arm/hand exercises using towel and 
table  (please see appendix A for details) .  Towels, tables and an exercise log s will be 
provided.  Par ticipants will  receive 2 sessions lasting 30 minutes  each for these 
trainings.  Starting the third session, a  research therapist  will be available to a ssist but 
study participants are expected to perform exercise routine s by themselves as much as 
29 
 possible.   The r esearch therapist will record and keep a log of time spent assisting study 
participants every day.   
 
9. If supervising  therapists at ARU and research therapist believe LARA participants 
are skilled enough to drive LARA, participants will begin using LARA to go to therapy 
appointment s and move around ARU by themselves.  
10. 3 clinical evaluations:  baseline, 3 -week post therapy or the day before discharge 
if sooner, 3 -month follow up.   All clinical evaluation s must be completed within 2 days of 
scheduled dates.  
11. 3-month follow up  is 3 months after baseline evaluation . 
  
30 
 Statistical Consideration s 
Data will be analyzed using modified inten tion-to-treat analysis. That is, all participants will be 
included in the analysis if data from the last follow -up assessment is available, regardless of 
treatment they receive or deviations from protocol. For missing data, we will carry forward the 
last a vailable value. The effect of treatment on each outcome measure will be assessed using a 
repeated -measures ANOVA. Follow up analysis will be done using t -tests with Bonferroni 
corrections, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests if the distributions fail the Lilliefors  test for normality. We 
hypothesize that the participants in the LARA therapy group will have significantly greater 
reductions in motor impairment measured by FM score than participants in the conventional 
therapy group. We expect this will be due to the i ncreased dose of therapy LARA provides, and 
we will include total arm activity (as measured by the wrist -mounted actigraphy ) and baseline 
function as covariates in the analysis. We will compare changes in MAL score, ARAT score, 
range of motion at the shou lder and elbow, Visual Analog Pain scores, Ashworth Spasticity, and 
10 min walk scores using student’s t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for non -parametric data. 
We expect improvements in functional use of the impaired limb (MAL and ARAT) and range of 
motion but expect no significant differences in pain, spasticity, wheelchair odometer reading, or 
walking speed. All analyses will be reviewed by our statistical consultant .

 Appendix A  
Part 1: Arm Strengthening Exercises with Tabletop 
Support  
 
These exercises for the joints of the arm can help strengthen weak arm muscles, improve 
range of motion, and minimize stiffness and pain.  
 
Instructions  
 
• Use the muscles of your weak arm as much as  possible.  
• Use the stronger arm to help guide the weaker arm only as  needed.  
• Move  slowly.  
• The movements should not cause pain, but you may feel your muscles  stretch.  
• Repeat each exercise ten  times.  
• Perform  exercises   times per  day.  
 
 
Exercises  
 
(1) Shoulder and Elbow  Flexion/Extension  
 
1. Place towel on the  table  
2. Place weaker arm on top of  towel.  
3. Using the strength of your shoulder and elbow, stretch your arm out in front of  you 
4. Try to keep arm as straight as  possible.  
5. Using the strength of your weaker arm, bend your  elbow.  
6. Pull arm back towards  you.  

32 
  
(2) Shoulder  Abduction/Adduction  
 
 
1. Using the strength of your shoulder, slide arm out away from  you.

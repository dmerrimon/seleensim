 1. SYNOPSIS   
Name of Investigational 
Product:   NRX -101 (administered to subjects who respond to an intravenous 
infusion of ketamine - 0.5 mg/kg administered over 40 min; on Day 
0) 
Name of Active Ingredient:   Fixed dose combination of d -cycloserine + lurasidone  
Reference Product( s):  Lurasidone/placebo  
Title  of Study : NRX -101 for the Treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation and 
Behavior (ASIB)  in Bipolar Depression  
Phase  of Development : Phase 2b/3 
Study Site (s): Approximately 12  study sites which may be either inpatient 
psychiatric hospitals or community mental health centers/bipolar 
clinics with immediate access to inpatient care facilities.   All sites 
will have a minimum of 12 months prior experience in the use of 
ketamine for stabilization of patients with ASIB in Bipolar 
Depression as part of their practice of medicine.  
Study Duration:  Screening: up to 48 hours ; IV ketamine Day 0; 6 -week treatment; 4 
week follow up  
Background and Rationale:  
 
 DCS and Lurasidone , taken together,  have been shown to maintain 
a 50% reduction in depression and a 75% reduction in suicidality 
following a single infusion of ketamine in patients with suicidal 
ideation and bipolar depression.  Ketamine is increasingly used in 
medical practice to achieve rapid stabilization of patients with 
ASIB.  However, the duration of ketamine effect is limited and its 
repeated use for maintenance of stabilization is not proven.  
Objectives:  The objectives of the study are as follows:  
Primary Objective:  
• The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis 
that following stabilization of depression and ASIB in 
response to initial ketamine infusion, NRX -101 is superior 
to lur asidone alone and also superior to placebo as oral -
therapy for delaying time to relapse (resulting in a new 
treatment plan or the subject relapsing to baseline levels of 
depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented 
bipolar depression presenting w ith symptoms of 
depression and suicidal ideation.  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To demonstrate superiority over placebo and over 
lurasidone alone in maintaining remission from depression 
in bipolar disorder . 
• To demonstrate efficacy can be sustained with NRX -101 
dosing regimens  
• To demonstrate NRX -101 safety

 Endpoint(s)  Primary Endpoint:  
• The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, 
defined as the need to implement a new treatment plan or a 
return to baseline levels on the Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating S cale (C -SSRS), or the Montgomery Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) subset on the Bipolar 
Inventory of Symptom Severity (BISS).  
Study Design  IV Ketamine infusion followed by a double blind, placebo –
controlled, parallel arm trial  
Inclusion Criteria:  A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the 
following criteria apply:  
 
1. Male or female, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at 
screening.

clinically important information.  
3. Diagnosed with B ipolar Disorder ( BD) according to the 
criteria defined in the DSM -5. The diagnosis of  BD will be 
made by a site psychiatrist and supported by the MINI 
7.0.2 . The diagnosis will be confirmed by remote, 
independent raters, via teleconference between the screen 
visit and the baseline visit.  
4. Suicidal ideation or behavior of sufficient severity  to meet 
the requirements for a score of 4, or 5 on the C -SSRS

laboratory evaluations, and electrocardiogram (ECG).  
7. If fem ale, a status of non -childbearing potential or use of 
an acceptable form of birth control per the following 
specific criteria:  
a. Non-childbearing potential (e.g., physiologically

correctly: implants, injectable or patch 
hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, 
IUD, double -barrier contraception, sexual 
abstinence. The form of birth control will be 
documented at screening and baseline.  
8. Body mass index between 18 -35 kg/m2. 
9. Concurrent psychotherapy will be allowed if the type (e.g., 
supportive, cognitive behavioral, insight -oriented) and 
frequency (e.g., weekly or monthly) of the therapy has 
been stable for at le ast three months prior to screening and 
if the type and frequency of the therapy is expected to 
remain stable during the course of the subject’s 
participation in the study.  
10. Concurrent hypnotic therapy (e.g., with zolpidem, 
zaleplon, melatonin, benzodiazepi nes or trazodone) will be 
allowed if the therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks 
prior to screening and if it is expected to remain stable 
during the course of the subject’s participation in the

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1   Acute Suicidal Ideation and B ehavior  in Bipolar Disorder  
Bipolar disorder  (i.e., form erly known as manic depressi ve disorder ) is a well -established psychiatric 
diagnosis , with a prevalence in  about 2.6% in the United States (approximately 8.5 million  people ) (Kessler 
et al., 2005 ). The risk o f acute suicidal ideation and behavior (ASIB) is uniquely high in patients during 
bipolar depressi ve episodes , compared to those with major depressive disorder (MDD), thought disorders, 
and personality disorders . Lifetime suicide behavior occurs in 25% to 56% of people with BD (Nierenberg 
et al. , 2001 ). About 3% to 14%  of the total 30,000 annual deaths from suicide  in the United States  are 
associated with bipolar depression  (Mahli et al., 2015 ). The  overall  rate of death by suicide among bipolar 
patients is  164 per 100,000 person years , compared to about 14 per 100,000 person yea rs for the general 
population . Those who have a suicide attempt are 2.3 times more likely to die by suicide compared to those 
without a suicide attempt ( Coryell et al. , 2016 ). Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression has uniquely lethal 
clinical characteristics ( Pompili , Gonda, &Serafini , 2013 ). 
4.2   Current Treatment Options  
Despite its lethal characteristics, there is no approved pharmacologic treatment for patients with ASIB in 
bipolar depres sion. As a result, electroconvulsive therapy, often combined with inpatient psychiatric care 
remains the treatment of last resort for patients with ASIB in bipolar depression, despite its well -
documented side effects that include memory loss and confusion,  along with its high cost.  No 
antidepressants have  Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval  for use in patients with bipolar 
depression  and acute suicidality . Physicians are increasingly cautious about the use of selective serotonin 
release inhibitors ( SSRI’s), particularly in patients with ASIB because of evidence that SSRI’s and other 
antidepressants may actually increase the risk of suicidal ideation, particularly i n younger patients   (Stone 
et al., 2009 ). This evidence has resulted in an FDA warning on the label of current antidepressants. 
Moreover, it seems clear that antidepressants do not decrease suicidal ideation and behavior in proportion 
to their effect on symptoms of depression.  
In recent years, 5 -HT2a antagonists have been shown to have effic acy in treating bipolar depression  
(olanzapine fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lurasidone) . While these medications are effective at 
reducing overall symptoms of depression, they do not specifically reduce suicidal ideation, as shown in 
recent clin ical trials of lurasidone ( Loebel et al., 2014a; Loebel et al., 2014b ). Moreover, in these two 
studies, individuals with active suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10 ≥ 4) were specifically excluded because 
of concerns regarding exacerbating suicidality . Similarly, acutely suicidal patients are routinely excluded 
from clinical trial s of other experimental anti -depressive agents . Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression 
represents a major unmet medical need that must frequently be treated with voluntary or involuntary 
hospitalization under highly supervised conditions and electroconvulsive th erapy  (ECT) . 
Whereas all approved drugs for depression act primarily through monoaminergic mechanisms, the 
serendipitous discovery that ketamine has a rapid and profound effect on depression and suicidality 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 17 of 103  
 (Berman, et. al ., 2000 ) led to the realization th at the glutamate system and the N methyl -D-aspartate 
receptor (NMDAR) may play an important role in depression and suicidality.  
4.3   Rationale for Clinical Development Plan  
To meet the unmet need  for the treatment of ASIB  in adults with BD, NeuroRx, Inc. is d eveloping NRX -
101, a fixed -dose combination oral capsule composed of d -cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone, intended as a 
component of a sequential therapy , which  takes advantage of a unique synergistic confluence of three  
FDA -approved drugs with long histori es of safety.  
The combination of the drugs for the proposed sequential therapy  (DCS, lurasidone, ketamine)  has been 
tested in an acute toxicity study under a protocol reviewed in advance by FDA and found to have no 
evidence of neurotoxicity, even at other wise toxic doses (i.e. 2000 mg/kg) of lurasidone. Each of the 
proposed drugs  has a long history of safe use in humans and their AE profiles are well characterized. The 
safety of the three drugs, given in combination has been tested in a human phase 2 study  that was deemed 
IND-exempt by FDA.  
DCS is a broad spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  DCS has been used in 
millions of individuals without report of significant safety concerns .  
Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic wit h approval for the treatment of depressive episodes ass ociated 
with bipolar depression. Of the other drugs in its class, lurasidone requires the lowest treatment dose and 
demonstrates the fewest side effects . 
Ketamine is a nonbarbiturate, rapid -acting gene ral anesthetic for intravenous ( IV) or intramuscular 
injection, approved for surgical anesthesia.  Ketamine has a wide margin of safety. Its use for more than 
12,000 types of operative and diagnostic procedures was studied in over 10,000 subjects participat ing in 
105 separate clinical studies.  
Ketamine has been shown in multiple randomized clinical trials to induce nearly immediate remission from 
acute suicidality and depression, however the clini cal effect has been demonstrated to diminish at 3 days 
post-dose. Whereas Ketamine is a direct NMDA channel blocker which binds to the PCP binding site, DCS 
in high doses has an NMDA antagonist effect by binding to the glycine site.  This effect is apparently 
unrelated to its properties as an anti -infective By combin ing the potential of DCS to extend the anti -
depressant effects of ketamine with the antipsychotic properties of lurasidone ( Stone et al., 2009 ), NRX -10 
has potential to stabilize individuals with bipolar depression during acute crisis  and address a serious  
medical need . 
For details regarding the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties of the three drug product 
components of the proposed sequential therapy, please see the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), which also 
provides a review of relevant non -clinical and clinical experience for each. Safety information is also 
provided in the product safety labeling for each of the drugs  in the Investigator’s Brochure .

 Although the mechanisms mediating anti -depressant -related increases i n suicide are not totally established, 
leading theories suggest that increases in anxiety/akathisia may play a critical role. ( Harada et al., 2014 ; 
Popovic et al ., 2015 ) Serotonin -related anxiety/akathisia may be modele d in rodents using several well -
estab lished assay systems such as the elevated plus maze and are known to be sensitive to serotonergic 
agents. ( Sachdev, Brune , 2000 ) In this assay, increased percent time spent in the open arms of the maze is 
believed to be associated with increased akathisia and anxiety . In contrast, increased total distance traveled 
in the maze is thought to be a signal related to psychosis. As shown by Javitt ( 2014 ) and in   
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 19 of 103  
 Table 1 (below), DC S significantly reduces the anxiogenic effects of lurasidone and quetiapine as 
measured by % time  spent  in open arm, suggesting that this treatment might reduce medication -induced 
suicidality as well as suicidality associated with BD itself. These findings  are consistent with the 
documented anti -suicidal effectiveness of acute ketamine treatment ( DiazGranados et al., 2010 ; Ballard et. 
al., 2014 ), including theories that ketamine’s reductions in suicidality are associated with reductions not 
only in depressi on but also in anxiety .

 Table 1 Effect of NMDA and 5 -HT2a Antagonists in Rodent Akathisia Model  
 
Source: Javitt , 2014  
 
Our preclinical research, using the Rat Akathisia model, suggests an additional synergistic interaction 
between  DCS and lurasidone . On one hand, as described above, DCS appears to block the anxiogenic 
effects of lurasidone. Conversely, lurasidone may in turn have the ability to reverse low -level 
psychotomimetic effects of DCS  and ketamine . This signal may be apprec iated from the decrease in 
distance traveled when lurasidone is added to DCS. Lurasidone mediates its antipsychotic effects at both 
D2 and 5 -HT2A receptors. As opposed to pure serotonergic agents used in the treatment of major 
depressive disorders (e.g. , SSRIs), the additional D2 blockade of lurasidone makes it a clinically effective 
antipsychotic and, thus, also potentially effective in treatment of psychotic symptoms that may be induced  
by NMDA antagonists . 
Clearly the phenomena observed in rodents should  not be viewed as isomorphic with drug - induced 
akathisia and/or jitteriness/anxiety syndrome in humans. However, we believe that these findings provide a 
rationale for combining glycine site -binding NMDAR antagonists with 5 -HT2a antagonists in phase 2 and  
3 studies of otherwise -safe drugs for the treatment of bipolar depression. This is particularly true in 
situations where akathisia is believed to predispose to suicide in vulnerable patients.

 4.5   Clinical Experience  
Antidepressant effects of high dose DCS w ere first noted in the late 1950’s when it was first introduced as 
a treatment for tuberculosis ( TB). Several clinicians noted dramatic improvement in patients’ depressive 
symptoms, leading to suggestions of potential psychotropic effects. These effects we re subsequently 
confirmed in small  scale clinical studies. ( Crane, 1959 and 1961 ). The mechanism of action was unknown 
at the time and the finding was not pursued. The interaction of DCS with the NMDA receptor was first 
demonstrated in 1989, ( Hood et al., 1989 ), leading to some interest in NMDAR blockers as potential 
antidepressant treatments. ( Trullas, Skolnick 1990 ; Skolnick et al. , 1996 ). For example, both DCS and the 
related compound ACPC were shown to be active in mice, using the forced swim test for d epression. 
(Lopes  et al. , 1997 ) To the best of our knowledge, no clinical antidepressant research programs targeting 
the NMDA receptor were initiated at that time.  
Interest in the potential clinical use of DCS as an antidepressant agent was renewed followi ng Berman’s 
fortuitous observation of ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effect in 2000 . An initial  study performed with 
DCS at a dose of 250 mg/d did not show therapeutic effect, but did demonstrate relative lack of 
psychotomimetic side effect when DCS was c ombined with concurrent antidepressant treatment ( Heresco -
Levy , Javitt  et al., 2006 ). Based upon these safety data, a study using a higher dose of 1000 mg/d) was 
initiated with results reported in 2013 (Heresco -Levy et al., 2013 ) (see Figure 1). At the higher, 1000  mg 
dose, significant beneficial effects were observed in 13 subjects  vs placebo control with SSRI -
nonresponsive depressive symptoms. The improvements were manifest within 2 weeks and persisted 
throughout the 6 -week treatment  period.

The 2013 Heresco -Levy study provided initial evidence that DCS might be useful as an NMDAR - targeted 
antidepressant, but t he time of onset for DCS alone was suboptimal for treating acutely depressed 
individuals . Therefore, an open -label study was performed in which subject s with bipolar depression 
received an infusion of  ketamine  on Day 1, followed  by oral administration  of DCS, titrated to a dose of  
1000mg/day  combined  with lurasidone 66mg/day as individual commercially -supplied medications. Seven 
of 8 subjects completed the study and no  adverse effects were noted. Over a period of 8 weeks, a >  75% 
reduction in suicidal ideat ion and a 50% reduction in depression was noted, using the Hamilton Depression 
Scale  (HAM -D). (Figure 2; Kantrowitz , 2015 ). Note that suicidal ideation was eliminated entirely at 4 
hours post -infusion of ketamine ( Figure 3; Kantrowitz, 201 4).

4.6   Investigational Therapy  
The investigational therapy to be evaluated in this study  consists of sequential treatment consisting of the 
following components:  
1. an initial, one -time intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 m g/kg administered over 40 min)  on Day 
0, followed by  
2. twice daily oral capsules of NRX 101 (d -cycloserine [DCS] + lura sidone), which is initiated on D ay 
1 (in subjects who respond to ketamine) and continued for up to 6 weeks . It is anticipated that 
subjects  entering the study will be receiving concurrent disorder -directed treatment with various 
predefined combinations of medications.   This treatment regime will be maintained upon entry 
into the study.   However, any use of lurasidone, quetiapine, or olanzapin e will be stopped at study 
entry. This regimen may be supplemented with mood stabilizers at the discretion of the treating 
physician.

Page 24 of 103  
 Our clinical objective is to offer patients the clinical benefit of rapid reduction in symptoms of depression 
and suicidal ideation that has been observed with intravenous ketamine, while maintaining that benefit with 
a daily oral agent that does not have ketamine’s potential for abuse and psychosis.  
4.7   Dosing Rationale  
The doses chosen for the three components of the sequenti al therapy are based on current dosing 
recommendations for each. In Stage1, the one -time IV infusion of ketamine on Day  0 at 0.5  mg/kg over 
40 minutes is below the  lowest recommended IV  concentration ( 1 mg/kg ) to induce anesthesia , and is 
consistent with s tudies of ketamine for use in depress ion.  
DCS is well -tolerated as a second -line treatment for TB  at therapeutic split daily oral doses in the range of 
500 to 1000 mg/d ay. The recommended oral dose of lurasidone f or the treatment of acute depressive BD is 
20 to 120 mg/day for up to 6 weeks.  Therefore,  dosing of the fixed -dose combination NRX  101 during 
Stage  2 will be  twice daily over 6 weeks . The s tarting doses at 350 mg DCS and 16.5 mg lurasidone , and 
the titration over 5 days to a maximum of 950 mg DCS and 66 mg lurasidone  are planned accordingly. Up -
titration is built in to the dosing strategy in the case of subject agitation and a stepdown is allowed for 
somnolence.  
For complete details regarding dosing recommendations, please see the product safety la beling for each of 
the drugs, which are included in  the Investigator Brochure (IB) .

 5. OBJECTIVES  
5.1   Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that following response to initial ketamine 
infusion , experimental drug NRX -101 (DCS +  lurasidone ) is superior to lurasidone alone and placebo as 
oral-therapy for delay ing time to relapse (resulting in a new treatment plan or the subject relapsing to 
baseline levels of depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented bipolar dep ression presenting with 
symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation . 
The primary study hypothesis (alternative hypothesis) is that ketamine  and experimental drug NRX -101 
(K/N) delays the time to documented relapse as compared to both lurasidone (L) and pl acebo (P) as measured 
by the hazard ratio (h) versus the null hypothesis of no delay in time to relapse for either comparator treatment 
(ketamine /lurasidone [K/L] and ketamine /placebo [K/P]) as follows:  
H0: hNRX -101 < h L and h P 
Ha: hNRX -101 > hL and h P. 
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as the need to implement a new treatment 
plan or a return to baseline levels on the C olumbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) , or the 
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) subset on the Bipolar Inventory of Symptom 
Severity ( BISS ). 
All relapses will be doc umented by the site physician and reviewed on a monthly basis by a Relapse 
Adjudication Committee. The Relapse Adjudication Committee (RAC) will determine whether the relapse 
met the primary endpoint criteria.   
5.2   Secondary Objective  
The s econdary objectives of the study are the following:  
• To demonstrate bipolar depression efficacy  
• To demonstrate efficacy can be sustained with NRX -101 dosing regimens  
• To demonstrate NRX -101 safety   
The secondary study hypotheses (alternative hypotheses favoring K/N vs. K/L and K/P) are the following:  
1. K/N will favorably separate from both K/L and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained difference between 
groups thereafter.  
2. All cause discontinuation (including  discontinuation for continued suicidal ideation) will be lower 
for K/N than both K/L and K/P.  
3. K/N will favorably separate from K/L and K/P starting at day 7, with sustained difference 
thereafter .  
4. Improvements within the K/N group observed at Week 2 will remain stable to end of study.  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 26 of 103  
 5. C-SSRS scores will remain <4 for 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation ( i.e., “crisis” will 
resolve within the 6 week time period with more favorable outcomes in the K/N group as compared 
to K/L and K/P . 
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by assessing changes in the secondary outcome 
measures: C -SSRS, CHRT, and the BISS  (including its subscales).  These measures will be assessed at the 
times specified on the Study Activity Schedule , Table 3.

 6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1   Overvie w 
The multi -center study will consist of a 6 -week, parallel group, double -blind, randomized, adaptive, 
superiority trial designed to test the hypothesis that following response to ketamine infusion, exper imental 
drug NRX -101 (DCS +  lurasidone) is superior to  both lurasidone alone and placebo as oral -therapy for 
delaying t ime to relapse  (resulting in a new treatment plan or the subject  relapsing to baseline levels of 
depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented bipolar depression presenting with symptoms of 
depression and suicidal ideation.  
6.2   Methods  
In Stage 1 eligible subjects will initially receive an infusion of open -label ketamine 0.5mg/Kg. Those who 
do not respond to ketamine infusion as mea sured by a ≥25% improvement in the MADRS  subset on the 
BISS  and a reduction in C -SSRS suicidal ideation to ≤ 3 at 24 hours post infusion will be withdrawn from 
the study and treated according to standard of care for subject s with suicidal ideation or behav iors. 
Subjects who respond successfully to ketamine infusion, as defined above (≥25% improvement in the 
MADRS subset of the BISS and C -SSRS ≤3) at 24 hours post infusion will proceed to Stage 2 and be 
random ized to either  experimental drug  NRX -101 ( DCS + l urasidone) , lurasidone  alone,  or placebo . 
Efficacy data will be collected for the subjects responding to ketamine through 6 weeks or until earlier 
rescue.  
Subjects may be terminated from the study and rescued with alternative therapy at any time if, in the  
opinion of the investigator, subjects have a significant  safety  risk for clinical deterioration or suicide .

defined study populations including separate evaluability rules for the ketami ne treatment (Stage 1) and 
randomized treatment (Stage 2).  
For Stage 1, the Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  population will include all subjects who received the ketamine 
infusion and have the 24 -hour post-infusion efficacy assessments . The Per -Protocol Population w ill include 
the subset of ITT subjects who were eligible, who had the 24-hour post-infusion efficacy assessments 
within 18 to 30 hours post the start of the initial infusion, and who had no major protocol violations . The 
Safety Population will include all subjects treated with ketamine who have any post -baseline safety data.  
For Stage 2, the ITT population will include all subjects who received the randomized study treatment  and 
have any post -baseline efficacy assessments . The Per -Protocol population will i nclude the subset of ITT 
subjects who were eligible , who ha ve any post -baseline efficacy assessments within 1 day of scheduled 
visits through Day 7 and within 2  days of scheduled visits through Day 42, and who had no major protocol 
violations . The Safety P opulation will include all subjects as treated with study treatment  who have  any 
post-baseline safety data  through Day 70.

 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS – PLAN AND METHODS  
8.1   Site of Care and Study Conduct  
Subjects may be recruited upo n presentation in an outpatient psychiatric practice, emergency department, 
community mental health setting, or psychiatric hospital.  The site of care will be either (1) a community 
mental health/bipolar clinic setting with overnight observation capabilit y and with immediate access to a 
psychiatric inpatient facility or (2) an inpatient setting.  Only sites that have been using ketamine for 
stabilization of patients with bipolar depression as part of their practice of medicine for at least 12 months 
will b e included as study sites in the trial.  Eligible study sites will already have written policies and 
procedures around the use of ketamine, will be properly licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration 
for the storage and use of ketamine, and will have written criteria for ensuring the safety of patients under 
their care who receive ketamine.  
It should be emphasized that dedicated (typically for -profit) psychiatric research facilities whose physicians 
do not otherwise provide ongoing care to patients wit h suicidal bipolar depression are not eligible to 
participate as study sites because of concerns that such facilities may not have adequate clinical experience 
or resources to ensure patient safety over the course of the study.  
The study protocol does not dictate the site of care (inpatient vs. outpatient).  That is determined by the 
treating physician  in consultation with the patient and family , based upon assessment of the patient’s 
acuity, the patient’s home environment, and other factors that psychiatri sts expert in the management of 
this patient population use in determining the appropriate site of care.  It is anticipated that subjects 
enrolled at C -SSRS level 4 are likely to be managed in the outpatient setting, whereas those enrolled at C -
SSRS level 5 will be maintained under continuous professional observation until they have stabilized at a 
C-SSRS level 3 or lower.  Just as site of care is determined by the treating physician, the decision to 
discharge those subjects who begin in the inpatient setti ng is entirely up to the study physician, based upon 
the same protocols and criteria already in place to determine discharge for patients with suicidal bipolar 
depression.  The study sponsor and the study protocol will not influence this decision in an y wa y.  The 
sponsor does require, however, that subjects with C -SSRS level 5 ideation or behavior be under continual 
professional observation from the time of enrollment and ketamine infusion to the point at which the 
patient is deemed to have stabilized and i s randomly assigned to one of the study arms.  
All eligible  subjects will recei ve ketamine  infusion  according to the procedures in this protocol . All 
infusions will be conducted in a clinic -like or hospital setting with a licensed anesthetist, standard 
moni toring equipment, and full emergency backup available. Subjects who experience sufficient 
improvement and are stable after the ketamine infusion may be hospitalized or discharged at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  Discharge will only be allowed if there is an established support structure and 
agreement to follow the safety plan  whereby sites will contact subjects twice daily for the next week  either 
in person or through a video connection provided by sponsor  and then at least weekly  through the e nd of 
the study to collect study data to support efficacy and safety. The election to follow subject s who respond 
to initial ketamine on an inpatient or outpatient basis will be made by the treating study physician with the 
consent of the subject .  
Subject s who meet study criteria for relapse  at any point during the study will be withdrawn from the study 
and offered clinically -appropriate treatment as determined by the treating study physician, which may 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 35 of 103  
 include inpatient hospitalization, repeated administr ation of ketamine, electroconvuls ive therapy (ECT) , or 
other treatments determined by professional judgment. Subjects who demonstrate therapeutic benefit from 
experimental drug NRX -101 ( DCS + lurasidone ) at study completion  may be offered prescribed DCS by 
their treating psychiatrist.  
The Schedule of Study Activities ( Table 3) summarizes the frequency and timing of efficacy, PK, and 
safety measurements  applicable to this study.  With the exception of post -dose assessm ents, visit -specific 
subject -reported outcomes  assessments should be conducted or completed before any tests, procedures, or 
other  consultations for that clinic visit to prevent influencing subject perceptions. A recommended  order of 
study procedures will be provided to sites as a separate document.  
Actual dates and times of assessments will be recorded in the source documentation and e lectronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF) .

 8.1.2 Screening Period  
Once subject s agree to participate in the study by signing the informed consent document, a full 
medical and psychiatric history will be taken and a physical and laboratory examination will be 
performed, as out lined in the Schedule  of Study Activities  (Table 3). The screening period may 
extend for up to 48 hours  following the signing of the informed consent  in order to allow time for 
the independent third party raters’  interview to be conducted and the ketamine infusion to be 
scheduled . Upon determination by the site investigator(s) that the subject  meets the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for the study, a remote interview will be scheduled with an independent rater . 
8.1.3 Remote Interview  
To ensure that appropriate subject s are entered into the trial , remote diagnostic assessments  (for 
Bipolar Disorder, C -SSRS and BISS ) will be performed by remote, i ndependent third party 
raters ’. The interview will be performed remotely by t he independent, third party  rater, via 
telephone  during the 24 hour screening period . Depending on level of suicidal ideation and 
behavior , the subject  may be contacted while at home or while being managed in an ED, 
hospital, or other acute care facility . Sites will be n otified of the results within 2  business  hours 
of the interview  completion . 
8.1.4 Stage 1:  Ketamine Infusion  
For entry into Stage 1 of the study (ketamine infusion ), all eligibility criteria MUST continue to 
be met ( i.e., all inclusion criteria a nd no exclusion criteria).  
All subjects will receive ketamine by continuous infusion for 40 minutes by use of an electronic  
pump. The start and stop times of the ketamine infusions will be documented in  the eCRF.  
Detailed instructions for dose preparation will be  provided to  site research pharmacists  in an 
additional guidance document . Storage conditions should be followed according to the package 
insert. Dosing procedures will be provided to the clinical unit  in a separate infusion document.  
Assessments : During the infusion , the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale 
(CADSS ) and the  Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) are administered at 0 (-5 minutes) , 40 
minutes (completion of infusion)  and 4 hours .  Both are  administered by a clinician.  
Phys iological Monitoring : Each participant will be allowed to rest in a semi -recumbent position. 
Each subject will receive an intravenous  (IV) line. The monitoring will include a non -invasive 
blood pressure cuff, a 3- or 5-lead ECG , a pulse oximeter and oxygen  by face mask or nasal 
cannula at 4 to 6 liters per minute, as needed.  Vital signs will be monitored continuously and 
recorded every 20 minutes . Each subject will receive an infusion for 40 minutes.  
The IV line will be left in place for at least 1 hour fo llowing the infusion to allow for additional 
medications to control emergent side effects. Medical staff monitoring the infusion will be 
prepared to treat increases in blood pressure greater than 180/100 mmHg or heart rate greater 
than 110 bpm, or follow t heir institutional guidelines if more conservative. If these elevations 
resolve spontaneously within a short time period, they will generally not be treated. The study 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 40 of 103  
 infusion will be discontinued in the event that three consecutive measurements remain ab ove 
protocol -defined limits  for 20 minutes or more , or according to institutional guidelines if more 
conservative, despite antihypertensive administration. The psychiatry research staff member will 
administer rating scales at -5, 40  minutes  and 4 hours . All side effects and vital parameters will 
be recorded during the infusion and for the 4 hours following  at 1 hour intervals . Clinically 
relevant vital sign  changes will be recorded as AEs. The subject may be released after the 4 hour 
measurements are comple te as long as they have achieved pre -treatment vital signs 
measurements or are deemed to be clinically stable” or something along those lines. .  Subjects  
will be required to have an adult escort them home post -administration of ketamine , or may be 
transpor ted home by a medical transport company provided that presence of a responsible adult 
at the home location has been verified .  Participants who cannot ensure a reliable adult transport 
or home observer will not be allowed to enroll in the study.  Subjects will be instructed not to 
drive or operate heavy machinery for at least 24 hours post -administration.  
 
8.1.5 Post Discharge Phone Visit  
At 10 hours post the start of the ketamine infusion (plus/minus 2 hours) the patient will be 
assessed by a study investigator  (in-person or called at home if subject were to be discharged) .  
During this phone visit, the procedures listed in Table 3 (C -SSRS (since last visit), and an 
assessment of AEs) will be completed.  
8.1.6 Randomization  
Subjects will be assessed in person 24 hours p ost-infusion for response to ketamine. Those who  
do not respond will be provided standard of care for ongoing suicidal ideation. Following the 
documented observance of a therapeutic response to intravenous k etamine as defined by a 25% 
or greater reduction in the on the MADRS subset of the BISS  score and a score of <3 on the C -
SSRS  at 24 hours post infusion, subject s will be randomized 2:1:1 to either a fixed dose 
combination of experimental drug NRX -101 ( DCS + lurasidone) , or to an identical capsule 
contain ing placebo  + lurasidone , or to an identical capsule containing placebo .  Randomization 
blocks will be allocated at the site level to ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced 
per site . An Interactive Web Response System will be used.  
8.1.7 Early Ter mination Visit  
If a subject  withdraws consent, or is otherwise terminated from the study, every effort should be 
made by the site to perform the procedures listed for Day 70. 
8.1.8 Post Ketamine Infusion  Follow -Up 
Subject s who are n on-responders at 24 hours foll owing the start of the ketamine infusion will be 
withdrawn from the study and treated according to the site’s standard treatment procedure . Non-
response is defined as less than  a 25% reduction on the MADRS subset of the BISS  score and a 
score of ≥4 on the C-SSRS .

Page 41 of 103  
 8.1.9 Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the Concomitant 
Medication Log for each subject , along with dosage information and start and stop dates.  
Allowed concomitant medications include any pre scription or over -the-counter medication not 
specifically excluded by the protocol (see Appendix 1), as well as stable, ongoing antidepressant 
or antipsychotic therapy and stable allowed hypnotic therapy. Subject s requiring excluded drugs 
will be disco ntinued from the study.  
Prohibite d concomitant medications which the patient and the study investigator agree may be 
discontinued, will be washed out for a period of 5 half lives or one week, whichever is longer.   
Clinically appropriate tapering regimens may  be used if necessary.  The screen period may be 
extended, upon consultation with the medical monitor, to allow for a sufficient washout period.  
A list of prohibited concomitant medications is included in Appendix 1. 
 
8.1.10  Subject  Recruitment  
Subject s will be recruited through study clinician s from patients who present at the site with 
bipolar depression and suicidal ideation . Those deemed eligible will be scheduled for a screening 
visit with one of the study physicians at the site .  Appropriate recruitment str ategies such as 
advertising, primary care physician referrals and internet based outreach may be used as well.  
Any patient facing materials will be submitted for IRB approval.  
8.1.11  Inclusion of Children  
Adolescents  between the ages of 18 and 21  will be elegibl e for enrollment . We are not including 
children younger than age 18. We have decided to exclude children under the age of 18 because 
there are specific safety considerations, as well as treatment considerations in pediatric bipolar 
depression that exceed t he scope of this study. However, if treatments from this proposal are 
found efficacious and well tolerated, a next step may  be the consideration of use in children of 
younger ages.  
8.2   Procedures  
8.2.1 Laboratory/Diagnostic Procedures  
Clinical laboratory safety te sting will be conducted locally by the study site using CLIA -
approved laboratories that have been audited by study personnel for compliance. Once the 
subject  has signed the informed consent document, the urine pregnancy test will be performed at 
the Screen  Visit, and Visits 5 and 9 . ECGs will be measured at the Screen Visit, the Baseline  
Visit (at the 24 -hour time  point) , and at Visits 5 and 9 . Chemistry and complete blood count 
(CBC ) will also be obtained at the Screen Visit, and at Visits 5 and 9 . Weight,  BMI, oral 
temperature, seated  pulse and  seated  blood pressure ( vital signs) will be recorded at each visit. At

8.2.2 Drug Levels  
Blood samples for monitoring therapeutic drug levels  will be collected on all subjects to veri fy 
exposure and consi stency with the randomization schedule. The timing of the blood draws are 
defined in Table 3 and include both pre -dosage (time 0) and post initial dosing of investigational 
product  within  the first 2 hours. Analyses of the samples will be conducted by the central 
laboratory.  
8.2.3 Randomization phase   
Following the documented observance of a therapeutic response to IV ketamine as defined by a 
25% or greater reduction in the baseline MADRS and a C -SSRS < 3 at 24 hours post infusion, 
subject s will be randomized 2: 1:1 to either a fixed dose combination of experimental drug NRX -
101 ( DCS + lurasidone) or to an identical capsule containing placebo  + lurasidone or to an 
identical capsule containing placebo . Institution balancing will be used to ensure that treatment 
and control groups are balanced with stratification according to C -SSRS 24  hours post -infusion 
(1, 2). Subject s who respond to ketamine will be followed for 6 weeks or until they require 
additional treatment .  
8.2.4 Blinding Procedures  
Investigational product will b e provided in a blinded fashion to sites for dispensation to subjects .  
8.2.5 Outcome and Safety Measures  
8.2.5.1  Outcome Measures  
8.2.5.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as (1) a return to  a score of  >4 on 
the C -SSRS, (2) a score of >20 on the  MADRS subset of the BISS  following a response to 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 43 of 103  
 ketamine at 24 hours , or (3) the treating physician’s determination that a change in treatment 
plan, such as re -hospitalization, ECT, or addition of new antidepressant drugs i s required . 
All site-defined relapses will be adjudicated by a Relapse Adjudication Committee (RAC) which 
will review documentation provided by the site for each incidence and determine whether the 
relapse meets the protocol definition of relapse . The RAC will meet monthly . The RAC is 
authorized to determine that relapse occurred even if the site does not make this determination.  
8.2.5.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by assessing changes in the secondary  
outcome measures: C -SSRS,  Concise Health Risk Tracking –Clinician, -Self-Rated (CHRT -C 
and –SR), and BISS . These measures will be assessed at the times specified on the Schedule  of 
Study Activities , Table 3.  
The C-SSRS (and the retrospective Columbia -Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment 
(C-CASA component), Suicide Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (SIBQ) , BPRS, CHRT -C 
and –SR, will be evaluated within and between study treatment groups. Mean changes fr om 
baseline for the differences from baseline and after randomization baseline will be evaluated 
using a paired t -test with in each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P.  
8.2.5.1.3. Diagnostic Metric  
The following diagnostic metric will  be evaluated at baseline:  
• MINI 7.0.2  
8.2.5.1.4. Additional Endpoints  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed for both study stages : 
• Study dose per treatment group  
• All-cause discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  
• Suicide rates  
• Incidence of hospitalization and ER visits for disease -related outcomes  
• Proportion of subjects who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proportion of subjects who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages.  
8.2.5.2  Safety Endpoints  
8.2.5.2.1. Overall Adverse Events  
Separate safety analyses will be performed for the two stages for the Safety population . Safety 
endpoints will include ad verse events (AE), vital signs , and relevant clinical chemistries and 
hematology parameters.

 The princ iple of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of AE data . Treatment 
emergence is defined to be any event that occurred during the observation period and was not 
present at baseline, or one which represents an exacerbation of a condition pre sent at baseline .  
Events emerging during ketamine treatment  will be counted during the randomized phase of the 
study  if not resolved by the start of randomized treatment initiation . Unresolved AE outcomes at 
the end of randomized treatment  will be followe d for an additional seven days or until resolution, 
whichever occurs earlier.  
Adverse events will be classified by MedDRA . For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed per stage or until treatment -emergent AEs are resolved . The type , 
incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of AEs will be reported for 
treatment -emergent and suspected adver se reactions . Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will 
also be reported . Narratives will be written for every AE classified as  serious or associated with 
death . Safety results will be displayed separately for each stage and combined.  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using two -sided Fisher Exact tests to compare K/N vs. 
K/L and K/P . Mean changes from baseline will be displ ayed for each serum chemistry and 
hematology parameter as well as the shift; unpaired t -tests will be used to compare K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P; in addition, paired t -tests will be performed for the change s from baseline for each 
study treatment group .   
8.2.5.2.2. Safety Measures  
The Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects ( PRISE ), CADSS, and Barnes Akathesia Scale 
(BARS)  (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and between study 
treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline for the differe nces from baseline and after 
randomization baseline will be evaluated using a paired t -test within each study group and an 
unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P.  
 
8.2.5.2.3. Other Safety Measures  
It is expected that some subject s in both groups (more amo ng those randomized to 
placebo+lurasidone  and placebo ) will have recurrence of their depression and, possibly 
suicidality. Therefore, the investigators plan to effect careful surveillance of all study subjects as 
follows:  
Subjects who receive ketamine will be maintained under continuous professional observation 
until stabilization is documented or ketamine is deemed not to have achieved stabilization and 
the treating physician has elected another therapeutic option (which in most cases will be 
hospitalizati on with ECT).  In general, study subjects will be maintained under direct observation 
in a mental health center or inpatient setting during the 24 hour stabilization period.  At the 
election of the treating physician in consultation with the patient and fa mily, patients may return 
home during the 24 hour stabilization period, provided the treating physician has made

Page 45 of 103  
 arrangements with the patient and family to maintain close professional contact during this 
period and a responsible adult will be escorting th e patient at all times.   Participants who cannot 
ensure a reliable adult transport will not be allowed to enroll in the study.  Subjects will be 
instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery for at least 24 hours post -administration.  
Daily  contact wit h a physician, psychologist,  or psychiatric nurse who will assess symptoms and 
any subject  or family /significant other  concerns . The contact will be either through a telephone 
or actual visit.   All on -site study visits will include a meeting with a study p sychiatrist.  
The study will employ the u se of HIPAA -compliant, electronic video monitoring of medication 
compliance , with the capability to send an immediate alert for outreach with any missed doses of 
medication.   A non -adherence period of 12 hours (i.e. 2 missed doses will trigger outreach by 
study personnel).  
In case of loss of  phone contact or repeated non -adherence to medication, study staff will contact 
an identified  family member /significant other .  If study staff determines that hospitalization is 
urgent, either the family member will take the subject  to the emergency room or the staff will 
contact 911 for an ambulance.   
The investigators recognize that although DCS has been used as an anti -infective in millions of 
individuals without report of signi ficant safety concerns, DCS has thus far been used in 21 
subject s at the 1000mg dose in formal studies of psychiatric illness . Therefore, the study medical 
monitors will surveil for safety issues via frequent safety listings reviews .  
The timing and incide nce of adverse findings will be compiled following planned surveillance of 
all study subjects by study medical monitors . The number of such episodes will be evaluated 
using a Poisson regression model to compare study treatment groups controlling for C -SSRS  24 
hours post infusion (1, 2), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender.  
Vital signs will be obtained at every  office  visit.  ECGs  will be measured at the Screen V isits, and 
at Visit s 1, 5, and 1 0. Digital ECGs will be obtained after the subject  has been resting in a semi -
recumbent position for at least 10 minutes.  All digital ECGs will be documented by recording 
date, time, heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT, and QTcF intervals. Mean 
differences will be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Puddu et al ., 1988 ). Vital signs and 
ECGs will also be evaluated within and between study treatment groups.  If indicated,  additional 
ECG assessments can be made at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator will judge 
the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it will be decided as to whether or 
not the abnormality is clinically significant or not clinically significant and the reason for the 
abnormality will be recorded on the eCRF. Abnormal values shall not be recorded as AE s unless 
deemed clinically significant.  
At the Screen visit, and at Visits 1, 5, and 9, subject s will have their blood drawn for chemistry 
and CBC blood tests. At Screen, and at Visits 5 and 1 0, subject s will have a physical 
examination .  If these tests or exams are abnormal per established site -specific normal ranges, it 
will be decided by the site investigator whether or not the abnormality is clinically significant or 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.

Page 46 of 103  
 not clinically significant and recorded on the eCRF. Abnormal and clinically significan t lab 
values will be reported as AEs if they fulfil l any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. Abnormal lab values (clinically significant and 
clinically non -significant), will be reviewed monthly by the medical monitor for trends. Should 
any abnormal lab values exceed rates described in the IB, the FDA and SPONSOR  will be 
notified within regulatory timelines.  McNemar paired comparison tests will be performed within 
study treatment groups for the abnorma l percents while two -sided Fisher Exact tests will be 
performed between treatment groups.  
8.2.6 Study Instruments  
Study  instruments will be administered in accord ance to the schedule in  Table 3. 
8.2.6.1  Efficacy Measure s 
Bipolar  Inventory of Symptom Scale  (BISS) (Bowden et al., 2007 ): The BISS i s a 44-item 
clinician -rated scale (22 items for the depression subscale and 22 items for the mania scale), in 
which each items is rated on a 0 -4 severity scale which is which operationally  defines each item , 
confining  the assessment to only one behavioral construct.  Items are grouped into  10 established 
symptom clusters, based on  prior studies of phenomenology and reports of  symptom clusters and 
principal components in  ratings of BD. The ti meframe for the BISS is the past 7 days.  The BISS 
scale has been found to have high internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha=0.93 for the Total 
Scale, 0.92 for the depression subscale, and 0.90 for the mania subscale) and inter -rater 
reliability (ICC=0.96 for total scale, 0.98 for depression subscale, and 0.95 for mania subscale) 
(Gonzalez , et al, 2008).  Regarding discriminant validity, the BISS total score was able to 
significantly distinguish between patients in a depressed, manic or mixed episode from 
subsyndromal patients, recovered patients, and healthy controls (Gonzalez et al, 2008).  
Convergent validity was demonstrated by strong Pearson correlations (i.e., r=.64 to .94) between 
the BISS total score and the BISS depression subscale and the MADRS, an d between the BISS 
total score and the mania subscale and the YMRS across all patient and control groups described 
above;  divergent validity was demonstrated by smaller and (i.e., r= -.14-0.30) correlations 
between the BISS depression subscale and the YMRS  scale, and between the BISS mania scale 
and the MADRS (r= -.06-.31). 
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) (Posner et al ., 2007 ): The C -SSRS is a 
low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was developed in the 
National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess 
severity and track suicidal events through any treatment. It is a clinical interview providing a 
summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered d uring any evaluation or risk 
assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C -SSRS can also be used 
during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening. The C -SSRS will be performed to assess 
suicidal ideation and behavior.  C-CASA is the retrospective counterpart of the more detailed 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 47 of 103  
 classification instrument C -SSRS. The C -SSRS tool was first developed for a prospective 
national study of treatment for adolescent suicide attempts. C -SSRS was developed by reliance 
on evidence stemming fr om two decades of research.  It contains a 1 -to-5 rating scale for suicidal 
ideation of increasing severity (from a “wish list to die” to an “active thought of killing oneself 
with plan and intent”), in contrast to C -CASA, which only has one ideation item. (IOM, 2010 ) 
The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the Baseline/Screening scale and 
since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale.  
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS ) (Overall  & Gorham , 1962): The BPRS is an 18 -item 
clinici an rated scale that is used to assess a range of psychotic and affective symptoms, rated 
from both observation of the subject and the subject ’s own report.  It has been widely used to 
measure change in pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment trials and  provides a rapid 
and efficient evaluation of treatment response in clinic drug studies and in clinical settings. Only 
the 4 -item positive symptom subscale BPRS+ (i .e., suspiciousness, hallucinations, unusual 
thought content, and conceptual disorganization ) will be used in this study. It is highly sensitive 
to change, and excellent inter -rater reliability can be achieved (i.e., ICC>.80) with training and a 
standard interview procedure.   Concurrent validity has been established by r=.92 between the 
positive symptom subscale and the corresponding subscale of the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale, and sensitivity to change has been demonstrated by significant associations in 
change between the BPRS total score and the CGI and the HDRS.  
Concise Health Risk Tr acking – Self Report (CHRT -SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT -C) 
scales (Trivedi et al, 2011): This is both a subject  self-report assessment of suicidality and 
related thoughts and behaviors , with a corresponding clinician rated scale . The scale s are 
designed to quickly and easily track suicidality in a manner consistent with the Columbia 
Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C -CASA) (Posner et al, 2007). The CHRT -SR 
is a 16-item self -report suicidal ideation scale and the CHRT -C is a 9-item clinician -rated 
behavioral module. Items are rated on a fully anchored 5 -point Likert scale with responses 
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The time frame is the past seven (7) 
days.  The CHRT -SR has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alp ha 0.88-0.90), convergent 
validity with MADRS suicide item (r=.60) and QIDS suicide item (r=0.59), and divergent 
validity with the YMRS (r=.02).  Predictive validity was established by prospective prediction of 
suicidality -related serious adverse events am ong 482 patients with bipolar disorder in a 
multicenter trial (Reilly -Harrington et al, 2016).  
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (SIBQ): The pur pose of this instrument is to 
ensure clinicians properly assess and document suicidal ideation and be havior as well as any 
study decisions (study exclusion of subject, filing of a serious adverse event) pertaining to 
suicidality. It will be completed by site investigators during all visits.

 8.2.6.2  Safety Measures  
 
In addition to the measures described under e fficacy, including CSSR -S, BISS (MADRS) 
CHRT -SR and CHRT -C and SIBQ, the following safety measures will be employed:  
Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE): The self -reported PRISE questionnaire will 
be used for the specific symptoms considered b y the patients as more or less tolerable drug side 
effects. The nine domains (gastrointestinal, heart, skin, nervous system, genital ⁄ urinary, sleep, 
sexual functioning, and other symptoms) will be individually and cumulatively evaluated using a 
paired t -test with each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P to assess the 
mean side effect or adverse event.  Reasons for premature discontinuation and dose reduction, 
including intolerable side effects, will be recorded.  Drug interactions b etween DCS and 
lurasidone will be examined.  
Clinician -Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) : The CADSS is a 23 -item scale 
(Bremner et al 1998). It is a reliable, valid instrument. The severity of each dissociative symptom 
ranges from 0 (not presen t) to 4 (extreme). The CADSS total score will be calculated as the sum 
of the individual item scores. For the CADSS, change from the first time point  to each  
subsequent  time point will be calculated as the 40-minute, 80 -minute, and 120 -minute 
assessment  minus the 0 (-5 minutes)  score.  The scale is  administered at  0 (-5 minutes), 40, 80, 
and 120 minutes from the start of the infusion. The timeframe is “at this moment ”.  The CADSS 
has been validated in healthy subjects and patients with psychiatric illness.  
Barnes Akathesia Scale (BA RS): The Barnes Akathesia Scale (Barnes TR,  1989) is a clinician -
rated scale to assess drug -induced akathisia and classify it as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. It 
comprises items for rating the observable, rest less movements wh ich characteriz e the condition, 
the subjective awareness of restlessness, and any distress associated with the akathisia. In 
addition, there is an item for rating global severity. It is the scale used most commonly in trials 
comparing incidence and severit y of akathisia between antipsychotic medications and placebo.  
The time frame is “at this time”. With trained raters, the BARS has demonstrated strong inter -
rater reliability (Kappa= 0.74 -0.95) (Barnes , 2003).  The BARS has been used to support the 
concur rent validity of actigraphic monitoring in akathisia (Barnes, 2003).   
 
8.2.6.3  Other Diagnostic Instruments  
MINI 7.0.2 : The M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) is a short, 
structured diagnostic interview developed initially in 1990 by psy chiatrists and clinicians in the 
United States and Europe for DSM -III-R and ICD -10 psychiatric disorders. The tool has been 
updated to map to DSM -5 diagnostic criteria in the MINI 7.0.2.

 8.2.7 Reliability Training  
All clinicians  chosen to be involved in the asse ssment of study subjects are experienced using  
standardized clinician -rated measures. They will have all received extensive training in the use of 
these instruments in coordination with MGH CTNI . Raters will be certified in the use of the C-
SSRS  and the BI SS prior to participation in the study.  
8.2.8 Subject  Adherence to Protocol  
Every effort will be made to encourage subject s to comply with the procedures and the 
assessments involved in study. Subject s will be compensated for their time at each visit, at a rate 
determined appropriate by the sponsor and the IRB (estimated compensation:  $20/hour). We 
believe that this level of subject compensation, while non -coercive, facilitates adherence to 
assessments and procedures that require frequent, inconvenient visits.

 9. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS  
9.1   Investigational Drug Dose and Administration  
In our planned study, physicians will have the ability to increase the lurasidone at any point  after 
the initial titration period for control of agitation , or decrease both the DCS and lurasidone dose 
according to the titration table below, in response to somnolence or extrapyramidal side effects. 
This titration will be effected while main taining a  blinded study design. The ti tration strategy is 
outlined in Table 6.

9.2   Treatment Compliance  
Subject s who miss one visit will be allowed to make up that visit at the end of the dosing week.  
Subject s who miss more than one visit will be discontinued from the study.   
Subject s will be allowed to titrate up or down, as outlined above, in the event of intolerable side 
effects. No other dose modifications will be allowed.  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.

Page 52 of 103  
 A statement has been added to the Product Monograph specifying the contr aindication of 
lurasidone with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) and strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g., rifampin). Lurasidone  dose should not exceed 40 mg/day if co -administered with moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. DCS has never been reported to have an y interaction with lurasidone.  
It is anticipated that subjects entering the study will be receiving concurrent disorder -directed 
treatment with various combinations of medications including:  
1. Approved antidepressants ( e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TeCAs, fluoxetine),  but no 5 -HT-2a 
antagonists (lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine).  
2. Mood stabilizers ( e.g., lithium, carbamazepine, valproic acid)  
Subjects will be permitted into the study if they are treated with no more than 1 from each 
category of the indicated classes . Approved antidepressants and mood stabilizers will be 
maintained at pre -existing dosages throughout the study . This is both to ensure continued 
treatment and to prevent withdrawal symptoms that may occur if such drugs are rapidly 
discontinued . Subjects tak ing either olanzapine or quetiapine will have these medications 
discontinued in order to avoid overlap with lurasidone . Subjects taking more than 66 mg of 
lurasidone per day at baseline will be maintained on this higher dose as a protocol exception.  
Subjec t compliance with dosing will be monitored using HIPAA -compliant, visual imaging 
technology allowing for confirmation of oral dosing of investigational product and date/time  of 
the dosing.  
9.3   Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
 
Followin g the documented observance of a therapeutic response to intravenous ketamine as 
defined by a 25% or greater reduction in the MADRS score and a score of ≤3 on the C -SSRS, at 
24 hours post infusion, patients will be randomized 2: 1:1 to either a fixed dose c ombination of 
DCS + lurasidone (NRX -101), to an identical capsule containing placebo+lurasidone, or to an 
identical capsule containing placebo.  Site blocking  will be used to ensure that treatment and 
control groups are balanced per site.  
9.4   Blinding  
The in vestigator, subject , and study staff will be blinded. Packaging and labeling of the study 
drugs will be performed in a way to ensure blinding throughout the study.  
No member of the study team at study sites  nor the CRO (the group responsible for study data  
management and site monitoring) will have access to the randomization scheme during the 
conduct of the study with the exception of the group responsible for maintaining the IWRS. That 
group will be able to identify patient -specific treatment according to the uniquely assigned kit 
number.  
 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 53 of 103  
 The unblinding of specific kits will be performed by the sponsor’s Chief Medical Officer . 
 
No treatment groups or kits will be otherwise u nblinded after database lock.  
 
Breaking the blind in a clinical trial on an emergen cy basis by the site should only occur when 
knowledge of the treatment to which a subject was allocated would have implications for the 
medical management of the subject in case of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) . However , subjects 
that relapse or experience  a SAE will require real -time interaction with the medical monitor  to 
confirm the event and to decide if the event must be r eported to regulatory agencies or IRBs.  
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  (refer to Section 14.2) can request a code break , 
either for an individual subject or on a g roup basis as described in the DSMB charter. The 
DSMB  may request to break the blind if:  
• There is an imbalance in safety parameters between groups  
and/or  
• In case of single or multiple significant AEs/SAEs that mi ght be drug -related.  
In such a case, the chair of the DSMB  would request unblinding , either of an individual subject or 
on a group basis, and the C RO would then request unblinding from the third party keeper of the 
randomization codes.  
 
9.5   Dose Adjustment a nd Stopping Rules  
Subject s will be allowed to titrate up or down, as outlined above, in the event of intolerable side 
effects. No other dose modifications will be allowed.  
Every effort will be made to keep the subject  in the study for the full study period  consisting of 
7 days of acute treatment plus 6 weekly follow -up assessments (Days 10, 14, 21, 28, 35 , and 42). 
Acceptable reasons for early discontinuation include the following: 1) non -response to ketamine 
treatment, 2) request of subject , 3) decision of  physician, 4) SAE , 5) and protocol violation.  
A subject  who decides to discontinue the investigational product will always be asked about the 
reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an 
investigator. Adverse ev ents will be followed up (see Section  12.6) until resolution.  
If a subject  discontinues from the study before randomization  to Stage 2 , then no further follow -
up will be expected. However, if the subject  discontinues after rand omization,  to Stage 2  but 
before receiving any study treatment, the subject  will be asked to return for a final study visit, 
during which the procedures outlined in the Early Termination Visit procedures will be 
completed, including AEs and concomitant med ication assessments.

 If a subject  discontinues from the study before completion of Stage 2 and has received at least 1 
dose of study drug, the subject  will be asked to return for a final study visit, at which the 
procedures outlined in the Early Terminatio n Visit will be completed. Every effort will be made 
to follow up with subject s who discontinue from the study prior to Visit 1 0 (Day 42). If subject s 
refuse to return to the clinic for the study -related assessments, a modified follow -up through, for 
examp le, regular telephone contact or a contact at study closure will be arranged, if agreed to by 
the subject  and in compliance with local data privacy laws/practices. If the subject  refuses 
follow -up, the reason for the refusal and last contact date will be d ocumented in the eCRF and 
source documents.  
Subject s who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

 11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as a return to  a score of  >4 on the 
C-SSRS, and/or a score of 20 on the MADRS subset of the BISS. The RAC will adjudicate each 
site reported instance of relapse for compliance the protocol definition of time to relapse.  
Relapse is a time -to-event outcome reflective of this multi -component disorder. Time to relapse 
is more sensitive measure than an a ssessment at a fixed time. Time to relapse will be displayed 
using a Kaplan -Meier lifetable with the treatment groups compared using a two -sided Wilcoxon -
Gehan test and a proportional hazard model to include the above cited covariates .  
Titration of DCS or  lurasidone within the dosing range will not be considered to be a relapse .  
All of the instruments used to measure ASIB or depression constitute serial continuous and 
ordinal outcomes which will be analyzed using MMRM, which accounts for missing data and 
early discontinuations . These instruments include the following:  
• C-SSRS (and the retrospective C -CASA component)  
• CHRT (CHRT -SR and CHRT -C) 
• BISS  
• SIBQ  
• BPRS  
The models will include treatment group, study visit, the interaction between study visit and 
treatmen t group, the baseline of the variable being analyzed, C -SSRS 24 hours post infusion (1, 
2), age (<25 yrs, 25 -39 yrs, >40 yrs), and gender as fixed effects . The reason for missing data 
will be evaluated as a condition of MMRM analysis.  
Means, mean changes,  standard deviations, and ranges will be presented separately for Stage 1 
and then for each Stage 2 treatment group over time . These endpoints will be evaluated within 
the three study treatment groups for the change from Stage 1 and Stage 2 baselines using  a paired 
t-test and between study treatment groups using an unpaired t -test at each time; these p -values 
will be presented as descriptive statistics.

 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1 Suicidal Ideation and Clinical Management  
The documentation and proper management of  suicidal ideation by sites will be documented 
with the use of the Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (SIBQ), completed by site 
clinicians during all visits, and by remote, independent third party  raters during the screening 
period.  
Any subject  who, based on the investigator’s judgment, poses an imminent risk of suicide should 
be discontinued from the study (see Section 9.2). All efforts will be taken to minimize the risk of 
suicide and the investigator will carefully monitor the subject . If durin g the course of the study, 
subject s show evidence of suicidal behavior, the subject s will be evaluated immediately or 
referred to their attending psychiatrist , a local emergency room , or another appropriate clinical 
setting  for further evaluation to see if  they are safe to continue in the study.  The site will have the 
ability to direct any subject  who requires emergency hospitalization to an emergency room or 
inpatient psychiatric unit that is within a 50 -mile radius of the site. In addition, the subject  will 
be able to contact someone at the site 24 hours a day should they have serious worsening of their 
condition.  
Suicide and attempted suicide, irrespective of the method, but occurring in connection with the 
use of IP, will be reported as AEs (all suicides  are SAEs; attempted suicides can be either serious 
or non -serious AEs). The event will be identified as suicide or attempted suicide, and the method 
of the suicide or attempt will be provided. If an attempted suicide meets the criteria for an SAE, 
the eve nt must be reported according to the guidelines in Section s 12.3 and 12.6.1.1 . If a suicide 
attempt does not meet the criteria for an SAE , it will be considered a reportable AE and a 
Suicidal  Ideati on and Behavior Reportable Event Form  will be completed by the  investigator.  
All events of suicidal ideation and behavior will be carefully monitored. These include events of 
suicide attempts, emergence or significant worsening of suicidal ideation, comple ted suicides, 
and suicidal behavior. As described in Section 8.3.5.1.1 , the C-SSRS and MADRS items of the 
BISS, as well as the clinician’s judgment, will be used in the assessment of suicidal risk by the 
investigator. The investigator’s clinical judgment a nd conclusion regarding suicidal risk will be 
documented in the SIBQ for that visit. Clinically significant (in the opinion of the site 
investigator) emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation  and/or behavior will be considered 
reportable events  and docum ented as AE s, and a Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Reportable 
Event Form will be completed and submitted to  medical monitor within 24 business hours of the 
site’s knowledge of the ideation or behavior. The subject should be withdrawn from the study 
and the  event will be adjudicated by the RAC as a potential endpoint event.  
If suicidal behavior meets the criteria for a SAE, according to the guidelines in  Section  12.3, 
investigators are required to report the event according to th e guidelines for SAEs in 
Section s 12.3 and 12.6.1.1  and submit the completed SAE form to  the medical monitor within 24 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 64 of 103  
 business hours . The subject should be withdrawn from the study and the event wi ll be 
adjudicated by the RAC as a potential endpoint event.  
The SAE Form will include the exact nature of the event and the circumstances of the subject  at 
the time of the event , in addition to the usual information required to document AEs or SAEs . 
Data o n all of the above will be collected on separate eCRF pages.  
The latest version of the AE dictionary, MedDRA , will be used by the CRO for the classification 
and analysis of AEs entered in the study database.  For regulatory reporting, SAEs will be 
processed  in the E lectronic Data Capture (EDC)  System and coded using MedDRA.  
If a subject (or subject’s partner) becomes pregnant during the study, it must be  reported  within 
24 business  hours of the time the investigator becomes aware of the event  and in accordan ce with 
the procedures described on the Pregnancy Report Form.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an 
SAE/ AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness 
of a contraceptive medication . Any pregnancy that occur s from Visit 1  to 30 days following the 
last dose given will be followed for gestational outcome and the outcome will be  reported to the 
sponsor . The female subject will be discontinued from study medication.  
12.2 Definition of Adverse Even ts 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a  medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) 
product, whether or not  related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) pr oduct. 
(Definition per  ICH). 
This definition  includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the  baseline condition, or abnormal results of d iagnostic procedures, including 
laboratory test  abnormalities.  
The followi ng variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date and time when the AE started and stopped  
• Maximum intensity or intensity or changes in intensity  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Expectedness  
• Investigator causality rating against study dru g (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to the Investigational Product (IP)  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 65 of 103  
 • AE caused subject ’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)  
• Outcome  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by 
the investigator fo r as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
MGH CTNI or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any 
subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
12.3 Definiti on of Serious Adverse Even ts 
The following criteria define a Serious Adverse Event:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  
• Inpatient hospitalization >24 hours or 
• Prolongation >24 hours of inpatient hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Cong enital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important event, as defined in this protocol*  
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that ma y not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
These will usually be considered serious.  
If a serio us and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis), the event must 
be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of 
the study endpoint (e.g., all -cause mortality).  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
• Date AE met criteria for SAE  
• Date investigator became aware of SAE  
• AE is serious due to  
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 66 of 103  
 • Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s)  
• Causality assessment in relation to study drug  
• Causality assessment in relation to other medication  
• Description of AE  
Intensities will be reporte d for each AE in the following categories: a) Mild (awareness of sign or 
symptom, but easily tolerated); b) Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with 
normal activities); c) Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activitie s). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the se criteria . An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily 
be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered 
severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  
Worsening symptoms of the primary study condition (i.e. , bipolar depression ) will not be 
recorded as an AE.  However, if inpatient hospitalization results from worsening psychiatric 
symptoms  or suicidal ideation , the hospitalization will be recorded as an SAE in the eCRF.  
Study drug abuse is an SAE, even when t here are no symptoms or additional AEs, and  will be 
reported according to the guidelines in Section  12.5. Misuse of IP is an AE, but is not considered 
an SAE unless accompanied by serious sequelae.  
Should an overdose of study d rug occur, it must be reported in accordance with the procedures 
described in Section  12.5. An overdose associated with symptoms must be reported as an AE, 
while an overdose without associated symptoms, must be reported only on  the separate Clinical 
Study Overdose Report Form.  
12.4 Relationship to Study Drug s 
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time of signature of informed consent 
throughout the treatment period.  Unsolicited SAEs will be collected 30 days post last st udy 
treatment.  
The investigator will assess the causal relationship (i.e., the relationship to study treatment) 
between the IP and AEs, and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is 
a reasonable possibility that the event may have  been caused by the investigational product?”  
Causal relationship in cases where the depression or suicidal ideation  has deteriorated due to lack 
of effect will be classified as no reasonable possibility.  For SAEs, causal relationship will also be 
assessed . Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as “yes.”   
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 67 of 103  
 An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the IB, or the nature or severity is not 
consistent with the applicable reference in  the IB.  
12.5 Record ing of Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the subject in response to the open question from the study 
personnel: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?” or revealed by 
observation will be collected  at each visi t; classified as mild, moderate, or severe ; and recorded 
in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symp toms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.  
Subjects shall be encouraged to contact the investigator or a member of the clinical site  staff at 
any time between visits concerning AEs or worsening of symptoms.  
Abnormal and clinically significant lab values will be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the 
SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. The principal 
investigator and the study bios tatistician will establish the rules for what will constitute abnormal 
and clinically significant lab values based on established site -specific lab normal ranges. Adverse 
events, including abnormal lab values (clinically significant and clinically non -significant), will 
be reviewe monthly for trends by the principal investigator and the medical monitor. Should any 
abnormal lab values exceed rates described in the IB, the FDA will be notified within regulatory 
timelines. If deterioration in a laboratory valu e/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible, the reporting 
investigator will use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations in non -mandated parameters will be reported as AE(s).  
Any new or aggravated clinicall y relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the study d rug is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the 
disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of 
worsening bipolar depression will be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events 
(except for suicidal ideation or behavior) which are unequivocally due to disease progression 
will not be reported as an AE during the study.

 12.6 Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non -serious, will be  reported fr om 
the time a signed and dated Informed Consent Form ( ICF) is obtained until completion of the 
subject ’s last  study -related procedure (which may include contact for follow -up of safety). 
Serious adverse  events, including those spontaneously reported to the  site-investigator from the 
time a signed and  dated ICF is obtained until within 30  days after the last dose of study drug , 
must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  CRO  will evaluate any safety 
information that  is spontaneously reported by a site investigator beyond the  time frame specified 
in the protocol.  
All events that meet the definition of a SAE  will be reported as SAE s, regardless of whether they 
are protocol -specific assessments.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presume d relationship to study drug,  must be 
recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the  eCRF. Whenever  possible, 
diagnoses will be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology  (e.g., cough, 
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, a nd head congestion  will be reported as “upper  respiratory 
infection ”). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the  relationship of the 
AE to study therapy.  All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source 
documen t and reported according to CRO instructions.  
The sponsor  assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory  authorities. 
CRO , on behalf of the sponsor, will also report to  site investigator s all SAE s that are unlisted 
(unexpected) a nd associated  with the use of the study drug. CRO  will report these  events to the 
designated IRB, on behalf of the sponsor.  
12.6.1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The EDC platform will provide a mechanism for sites to report SAE s, and for the site 
investigato rs and medical monitor to sign off on the SAE reports. Reportable SAEs will be sent 
to the FDA by the sponsor . CRO will notify sites of reportable SAEs, as outlined in 
Section  12.6.1.1 . 
When a SAE is discovered, it will be repo rted immediately (within 24 business hours) to the 
Medical Monitor, as described below. Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 business 
hours of the site’s knowledge of the event to the IRB (see below). Reportable events which do 
not meet the cr iteria for an SAE will include (but will not be limited to): (a) pregnancy, and (b) 
clinically significant (in the judgment of the investigator) severe psychiatric complications .  The 
site P rincipal Investigator  will determine whether the event is study -related. All SAE s and 
reportable events will be reported within 48 business hours of [ CRO ] receipt of an SAE or other 
reportable event form to the sponsor, Medical Monitor , and the study site investigators.

 12.6.1.1  Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
Throughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse 
events.  All adverse e vents (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, 
whether observed by the Investigator or by the subject, and whether or not thought to be drug -
related, will be reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable.  
The description of the adverse event will include description of event, start date, stop date, 
intensity, if it was serious, relationship to test drug, change in test drug dosage, if the subject died, 
and if treatment was required.  
Events will be coded to on e of the following intensity categories below:  
Severity  Definition  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity  
Moderate  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing)  
Severe  Event causes inability to work or perform usual activities 
(unacceptable)

Page 70 of 103  
 Events will be coded into one of the following causality categories as defined below:  
Category  Definition  
Unrelated  Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does 
not meet criteria listed under poss ible or probable.  
Unlikely  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. 
May have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by 
environmental factors or other therapies administered.  
Possible  Follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration, but 
may have been also produced by the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental factors or other therapies administered.  
Probable  Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement 
on cessation of investigational medicinal product or reduction in 
dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known pattern of 
response to the investigational medicinal product.  
Adverse events with the causality assessed as unrelated or unlikely are categorized as not related 
to study m edication.  
Adverse events with the causality assessed as possible or probable are categorized as related to 
study medication and are called adverse drug reactions.  
All SAEs must be reported immediately (no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
event).  The investigator must complete the SAE Report Form and  notify  according to the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form Instructions.

 13. STATISTICS  
The study analyses will be conducted in a GCP environment (ICH E6). All analyses will be pre -
specified in a Sta tistical Analysis (SAP) prior to beginning subject  enrollment.   
13.1 Study Design  
This is a two -stage design with two pre -defined interim looks during the second stage.  The first 
stage is a direct assignment to Ketamine while the second stage is a randomized  phase for those 
subjects following a documented Ketamine response.   
13.2 Randomization  
Following the documented observance of a therapeutic response to intravenous ketamine as 
defined by a 25% or greater reduction in the MADRS score and a score of < 3 on the C-SSRS, at 
24 hours post infusion, patients will be randomized 2: 1:1 to either a fixed dose combination of 
DCS + lurasidone (NRX -101), to an identical capsule containing placebo+lurasidone, or to an 
identical capsule containing placebo. Site blocking  will be used to ensure that treatment and control 
groups are balanced per site.  
13.3  Study Populations  
The study will have prospectively defined study populations including separate evaluability rules 
for the Ketamine treatment (Stage 1) and randomized treatment (S tage 2).  
For Stage 1, the Intent -to-Treat population will include all subjects who received the Ketamine 
infusion and they have the 24 hours post -infusion efficacy assessments.  The Per -Protocol 
population will include the subset of ITT subjects who were e ligible, who had the 24 hour post -
infusion efficacy assessments within 18 to 30 hours post the start of the initial infusion, and who 
had no major protocol violations.  The Safety Population will include all subjects treated with 
Ketamine and with any post -baseline safety data.  
For Stage 2, the Intent -to-Treat population will include all subjects who received the randomized 
study treatment and have any post -baseline efficacy assessments.  The Per -Protocol population 
will include the subset of ITT subjects w ho were eligible, who have any post -baseline efficacy 
assessments within 1 day of scheduled visits through Day 7 and within 3 days of scheduled visits 
through Day 42, and who had no major protocol violations.  The Safety Population will include 
all subject s as treated with study treatment and with any post -baseline safety data.  
The ITT population will be used for the primary analyses.  If <5% are to be excluded from the ITT 
population, then the analysis will not be performed for the PP population.     
Every  effort will be made to encourage patients to comply with the procedures and the assessments 
involved in study. Non -compliance will be tracked.  Protocol violations will be reviewed in real 
time; prospective rules will be set for exclusions from the PP pop ulation.

 13.4 Hypothesis Tests  
 
13.4.1  Primary  Hypotheses  
The primary study hypothesis (alternative hypothesis) is that Ketamine  and experimental drug 
NRX -101 (K/N) delays the time to documented relapse as compared to both lurasidone (L) and 
placebo (P) as measured by the hazard ratio (h) versus the null hypothesis of no delay in time to 
relapse for either comparator treatment (Ketamine/lurasidone [K/L] and Ketamine/placebo [K/P]) 
as follows:  
• H0: h NRX -101 < h L and h P 
• Ha: h NRX -101 > h L and h P 
13.4.2  Secondary  Hypotheses  
The secondary study hypotheses relating to secondary ASIB and BPD endpoints (alternative 
hypotheses favoring K/N vs. K/L and K/P) are the following:  
1. K/N will favorably separate from both K/L and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained 
difference between groups thereaf ter. 
2. All cause discontinuation (including discontinuation for continued suicidal ideation) will 
be lower for K/N than both K/L and K/P.  
3. K/N will favorably separate from K/L and K/P starting at day 7, with sustained difference 
thereafter.   
4. Improvements wit hin the K/N group observed at Week 2 will remain stable to end of 
study.  
5. C-SSRS scores will remain <4 for 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation (i.e. any 
“crisis” will resolve within the 6 week time period with more favorable outcomes in the 
K/N gro up as compared to K/L and K/P.  
13.5 Efficacy Endpoints  
13.5.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as the need to implement a new 
treatment plan (not a dose increase, decrease, or suspension) or as a return to  a score of ≥4 on the C -
SSRS, and/or a score of 20 on the MADRS subset of the BISS 
13.5.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by assessing changes in the secondary 
outcome measures : C-SSRS, CHRT, BISS  (MADRS) , and BPRS .  These measures will be 
assessed at the times specified on the Study Activity Schedule, Table 3. 
The C -SSRS (and the retrospective C -CASA component), CHRT (CHRT -SR and CHRT -C), BISS 
and B PRS (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and betw een study 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 73 of 103  
 treatment groups.  The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the 
Baseline/Screening scale and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale. Mean differences 
will be evaluated using a paired t -test with each study grou p and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.  
 
13.5.3  Diagnostic Metrics  
The following metrics will be evaluated at baseline:  
• MINI 7.0. 2 
13.6 Additional Endpoints  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed for both study phases:  
• Study dose pe r treatment group  
• All-cause discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  
• Suicide rates  
• Incidence of hospitalization and ER visits for disease -related outcomes  
• Proportion of subjects who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proporti on of subjects who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages.  
13.7 Safety Endpoints  
13.7.1  Overall Adverse Events  
Separate safety analyses will be performed for the two stages for the Safety population.  Safety 
endpoints will include adverse events (AE), vital si gns (VS), and relevant clinical chemistries and 
hematology parameters.  
 
The principle of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of AE data.  Treatment 
emergence is defined to be any event that occurred during the observation period and was n ot 
present at baseline, or one which represents an exacerbation of a condition present at baseline.   
 
Events emerging during Stage 1 will be counted during Stage 2 if not resolved by the start of 
randomized treatment initiation.  Unresolved adverse event outcomes at the end of Stage 2 will be 
followed for an additional seven days or until resolution, whichever occurs earlier.  
 
Adverse events will be classified by MedDRA.  For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed per stage or unt il treatment -emergent adverse events are resolved.  The 
type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of AEs will be reported for 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 74 of 103  
 treatment -emergent and SARs.  Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will also be reported.  
Narratives wil l be written for every AE classified as serious or associated with death.  Safety results 
will be displayed separately for each stage and combined.  
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using two -sided Fisher Exact tests to compare K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.   Mean changes from baseline will be displayed for each serum chemistry and hematology 
parameter as well as the shift; unpaired t -tests will be used to compare K/N vs. K/L and K/P; in 
addition, paired t -tests will be performed for the change from baseline for each study treatment 
group.     
13.7.2  Other Safety Measures  
The study is being conducted in a population who would likely have been admitted to a psychiatric 
hospital, if they did not have a positive response to ketamine.  Moreover, it is expected that some 
subjects in the K/L and K/P treatment groups will have recurrence of their depression and, possibly 
suicidality. The timing and incidence of adverse findings will be compiled following planned 
surveillance of all study subjects by a designated safety monit or.  The number of such episodes 
will be evaluated using a Poisson regression model to compare study treatment groups controlling 
for C -SSRS 24 hours post infusion (1, 2), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender.  
 
Vital signs and ECGs will also be evaluated with in and between study treatment groups.  Mean 
differences in heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT, and QTcF. QTcF intervals 
will be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Puddu et al, 1988).  The overall interpretation will 
be reported a s normal or abnormal; if abnormal, then the percents clinically significant will be 
reported. Abnormal values shall not be recorded as AEs unless deemed clinically significant. 
McNemar paired comparison tests will be performed within study treatment groups  for the 
abnormal percents while Fisher Exact tests will be performed between treatment groups.  
 
While  symptom improvement will be evaluated by assessing changes in the secondary outcome 
measures : C-SSRS, CHRT, BISS  (MADRS) , SIBQ and BPRS, safety measures in the PRISE, 
CADSS and BARS (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and between 
study treatment groups.  The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the 
Baseline/Screening scale and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale. Mean differences 
will be evaluated using a paired t -test with each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.

 13.8 Sample Size  Calculations  
13.8.1  Allocation  
To encourage study participation, a  2:1:1 randomization will be use d where at most half as many 
subjects will be assigned to the lurasidone and placebo arm s as compared to the K/N study arm.  
The goal will be to have 62 subjects randomized to K/N and 31 subjects randomized to each of 
K/L and K/P for a total of 124 randomi zed subjects .  The randomization takes place among 
Ketamine responders once confirmed by  Medical Monitor .     
13.8.2  Stage 1  
The study goal is to achieve a total of 1 24 Ketamine responders for the Stage 2 evaluation.  A total 
of 192 subjects are projected to be e nrolled but this number may be reached sooner if the 
cumulative effect of the Ketamine response rate exceeding 70%, if the Stage 1 loss rate being less 
than 8% (1 5 subjects), or if the Stage 2 loss rate being less than 8% ( 9 subjects). Thus, there would 
be 177 subjects who complete Stage 1 before considering Ketamine response.  The literature and 
prior experience suggests that 70% of those treated with ketamine will have an adequate reduction 
in depression and suicidality which equates to 1 24 Ketamine respo nders (1 77 x 0.7) who would 
be available for randomization.  More subjects will need to be enrolled if the Ketamine response 
rate was lower than 70% or the randomization refusal rate was higher than 8%, considered to be 
part of Stage 2 losses.    
13.8.3  Stage 2  
Stage 2 will investigate the study hypotheses . The primary efficacy hypothesis is that K/N will 
delay the time to relapse relative to K/L and K/P . The goal will be to have 62 subjects 
randomized to K/N and 31  subjects randomized to K/ L and K/ P. These number s are based on the 
Ketamine Responders . See Error! Refe rence source not found.  for the total number of K/N and 
K/L subjects required to test the primary efficacy hypothesis . The sample size requirements are 
shown ju st for K/N and K/L . . 
The study is powered based on the number of subjects randomized to K/N vs. K/L . In order to 
achieve 90% study power with two -sided 0.0 5 Type I error, a total of 56 K/N subjects, 28 K/L 
subjects, and 28 K/P subjects  must be evaluated f or time to relapse over the full 6 weeks . This is 
based on the assumption of a 30% relapse rate in the K/N treatment group and a 70% relapse rate 
in the K/L and K/P treatment group s. A larger gap in the relapse rate is expected based on the 
literature, so this is believed to be a conservative assumption . These calculations assume a loss of 
8% during Stage 2 .

The secondary efficacy hypotheses will also be evaluated using a hierarchical testing strat egy 
where testing to support labeling claims continues as long as two -sided p=0.0 5 is reached . The 
first such hypothesis to be tested for the depression endpoints if whether K/N separates from K/L 
and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained difference between grou ps thereafter  (see Error! Reference 
source not found. ). There will be 90% power and two -sided 5% Type I error to detect a 0.75 4 
effect size for the comparison of the K/N against the  K/L and K/P treatment groups.

Next, all -cause discontinuation (including discontinuation for continued suicidal ideation) will be

13.9 Overall Type 1 Error Control  
The overall Type I error is two -sided 5% .  No interim analyses are planned.  
A hierarchical testing plan is in place to control Type I error to extend labeling claims in the 
following pre -defined testing or der where statistic al significance (two -sided p<0.0 5) is required 
at each step:  
1. Primary: K/N will delay time to relapse relative to K/L and K/P  
2. Secondary: K/N will separate from K/L and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained difference 
between groups thereafter  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 79 of 103  
 3. Secondary: All -cause  discontinuation (including discontinuation for continued suicidal 
ideation) will be lower in K/N than K/L and K/P.  
4. Secondary: K/N will separate from K/L and K/P starting at Day 7, with sustained 
difference thereafter   
5. Secondary: Improvements within the K /N group observed at Week 2 will remain stable to 
end of study.  
13.10  Analysis Approach  
13.10.1  Software  
All calculations will be performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.1 or later, and 
StatXact, version 10 or later.   
13.10.2  Display Formats  
All efficacy and safet y data will be displayed in tables and listings.  Separate analyses will be 
performed for Stage 1, Stage 2, and for combined stages (primary efficacy endpoint).  Post -Text 
TLFs will be provided in collated electronic MS Word .rtf files (i.e. table columns and rows appear 
in MS Word Table format).  
13.10.3  Conventions  
Means, mean changes, standard deviations, and ranges will be presented separately for Stage 1 and 
then for each Stage 2 treatment group over time. These endpoints will be evaluated within the three 
study treatment groups for the change from Stage 1 and Stage 2 baselines using a paired t -test and 
between study treatment groups using an unpaired t -test at each time; these p -values will be 
presented as descriptive statistics.  
 
For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum will be 
presented, together with the total number of observations and the number of missing and non -
missing values. Unless otherwise specified minimum and maximum values will be reported to the 
same num ber of decimal places as the recorded measurements, mean and median are reported to 
one more decimal place and standard deviation one additional decimal place more than the mean.  
 
For ordinal and categorical variables, absolute and relative frequencies wil l be reported. Relative 
frequencies will be based on all observations and reported as percentages to one decimal place. 
Unless otherwise specified percentages will be based on the number of subjects with data and will 
not be calculated for missing categori es. 
 
Adverse events, medical histories and concomitant medications will be reported on a subject and 
an event basis. The percentages will be calculated using the number of subjects in the population 
Analysis Set as the denominator.  
 
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 80 of 103  
 All hypotheses will be tested at 5% (final analysis) level of significance using a two -sided test 
unless otherwise specified.   
P-values will be rounded to four decimal places. If a p -value is less than 0.0001 it will be reported 
as “<0.0001.” If a p -value is greater than 0.9999  it will be reported as “>0.9999”.  
13.10.4  General Methodology  
Time to event analyses will be performed using a Kaplan -Meier lifetable, two -sided Wilcoxon -
Gehan test, and proportional hazard models (PHREG) including the following covariates: study 
treatment,  C -SSRS 24 hours post infusion (1,2 , or 3 ), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender.   The 
proportional hazard model results for the Intention -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered to 
be the primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint while the MMRM resu lts for the ITT 
population will be considered to be the primary analysis for the secondary efficacy endpoints.        
All of the instruments used to measure ASIB or depression constitute serial continuous and ordinal 
outcomes wh ich will be analyzed using  Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) to 
account for missing data and early discontinuations.  The models will include treatment group, 
study visit, the interaction between study visit and treatment group, the baseline of the variable 
being analyzed, C -SSRS 24 hours post infusion (1, 2 , or 3 ), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender as 
fixed effects.  The reason for missing data will be evaluated as a condition of MMRM analysis.   
An autoregressive (AR1) variance covariance structure will be assumed for this a nalysis. To 
account for mis -specification of the covariance structure, the Liang and Zeger’s “sandwich” 
estimator (via the EMPIRICAL option in SAS PROC MIXED) will be used. Restricted maximum 
likelihood (REML) will be used to estimate all parameters and wi ll be the basis for all hypothesis 
testing (SAS default).  For the primary model including the interaction term, the hypothesis test to 
perform on the fixed effects will be Type III (SAS® option htype = 3). SAS® PROC MIXED will 
be used.  
13.10.5  Primary Efficacy E ndpoint  
The primary endpoint in the study will be the time to relapse measured from the day that Ketamine 
infusion was started.  
Relapse is a time to event outcome reflective of this multi -component disorder. Time to relapse is 
more sensitive measure than a n assessment at a fixed time. Time to relapse will be displayed using 
a Kaplan -Meier lifetable with the treatment groups compared using a two -sided Wilcoxon -Gehan 
test and a proportional hazard model to include the above cited covariates.   
Relapse will be  judged in real -time by the study physician using baseline measures of depression 
and suicidality as a guide.

Page 81 of 103  
 13.10.6  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
All of the instruments used to measure ASIB or depression constitute serial continuous and ordinal 
outcomes which wi ll be analyzed using MMRM, which accounts for missing data and early 
discontinuations.  These instruments are listed in Section 11.  
The models will include treatment group, study visit, the interaction between study visit and 
treatment group, the baseline of the variable being analyzed, C -SSRS 24 hours post infusion (1, 
2), age (<25 yrs, 25 -39 yrs, >40 yrs), and gender as fixed effects.  The reason for missing data will 
be evaluated as a condition of MMRM analysis.  
13.10.7  Other Endpoints  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed for both study phases:  
 
• Dose per treatment group  
• All-cause discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  
• Suicide rates  
• Incidence of hospitalization and ER visits for disease -related outcomes  
• Proportion of subjects  who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proportion of subjects who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages.  
 
Dose per treatment group will be displayed graphically over time per study treatment group.  The 
percents decreasing and increasing over time relative to starting dose will be displayed per study 
treatment group.  
 
Time to all -cause discontinuation will be displayed using a Kaplan -Meier lifetable and compared 
between treatments using a Wilcoxon -Gehan test.  
 
Suicide rates  will be evaluated using a Fisher Exact test to compare K/R vs. K/L and K/P.  
 
The incidence of hospitalization and ER visits will be evaluated using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test 
to compare each study treatment group.  
 
The proportions of subjects discontinuing SSRIs or reducing SSRI dosages will be displayed 
graphically over time per study treatment group.  The percents discontinuing SSRIs and reducing 
SSRI dosages relative to starting dose will be displayed per study treatment group.   
13.10.8  Safety Endpoints  
Separate  safety analyses will be performed for Stage 1, Stage 2, and combined across stages.  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 82 of 103  
 Adverse events will be classified by MedDRA.  For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed while on Stage 1 or Stage 2 treatment or until treatmen t-emergent adverse 
events are resolved.  The type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of 
AEs will be reported for treatment -emergent and SAEs.  Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will 
also be reported.  Narratives will be writte n for every AE classified as serious or associated with 
attempted suicide or death.   
Planned surveillance findings according to the designated safety monitor will also be analyzed.  
Adverse event timing will be displayed graphically.  Overall incidence wi ll be compared using a 
two-sided Fisher Exact test.  The cumulative number of such episodes will be evaluated using a 
Poisson regression model to compare study treatment groups controlling for C -SSRS 24 hours post 
infusion (1, 2), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), an d gender.  
Vital signs and ECGs (means and mean changes from Stage 1 and Stage 2 baselines) will also be 
evaluated within treatment groups using paired t -tests and between study treatment groups using 
unpaired t -tests.  Percents with abnormal vital signs, h eart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR 
interval, QT, and QTcF will be reported. McNemar paired comparison tests will be performed 
within study treatment groups for the abnormal discordant percents while two -sided Fisher Exact 
tests will be performed to c ompare incidences between treatment groups.  
Blood draws for chemistries and hematologies will be evaluated within and between study 
treatment groups. Abnormality rates will be presented relative to established site -specific normal 
ranges and whether or not  the abnormality is clinically significant.  McNemar paired comparison 
tests will be performed within study treatment groups for the abnormal percents while two -sided 
Fisher Exact tests will be performed to compare incidences between treatment groups.

 14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE  DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1 Study Monitoring  
Potential study sites will be evaluated by the sponsor  in conjunction with the CRO to determine 
suitability for the proposed study.  Information reviewed will include, but is not limited to, 
facility deta ils and site capabilities, past performance in similar studies, investigator, and staff 
experience, ongoing studies at the site, projected enrollment in this study, and FDA or other 
agency audit findings.  Study sites may be asked to complete a study -specif ic Site Selection 
Questionnaire and other documents for consideration for participation and CRO clinical study 
monitors may make a Site Qualification Visit prior to completing the evaluation process.  
Upon completion of this evaluation, the sponsor  will inv ite the chosen sites for participation.  
Prior to subject enrollment, a study initiation visit will be completed at each investigational site 
to ensure the following: IRB approval has been obtained and documented prior to subject 
screening, the investigator s and study personnel are appropriately trained and clearly understand 
the study, the investigators and study personnel accept the obligations incurred in undertaking 
this clinical investigation.  
Raters proposed by each site will be evaluated on the basis of experience and education for each 
instrument used in the study. Raters with the appropriate levels of experience and education will 
be trained by an independent third party i n the use of each instrument, and approved to 
administer that instrument in the  study. Sites will not be approved to begin enrollment activities 
until they have at least one rater approved for each clinician -administered instrument.  
Qualified clinical monitors or qualified contract monitors will conduct investigational site 
monitorin g visits to ensure that all investigators conduct the study in compliance with the 
protocol and applicable regulations.  The site will receive notification prior to each monitoring 
visit during the course of the study.  It is expected that the investigator a nd/or sub -investigator 
and other appropriately trained study staff are available on the day of the visit in case any 
questions might arise.  
Periodic monitoring visits will be made in accordance with the approved monitoring plan at all 
active study sites th roughout the clinical study to assure that the investigator obligations are 
fulfilled and all applicable regulations and guidelines are being followed. These visits will assure 
that the facilities are still acceptable, the protocol and investigational plan  are being followed, the 
IRB has been notified of approved protocol changes as required, complete records are being 
maintained, appropriate and timely reports have been made to the sponsor,  CRO,  and the IRB, 
and the site Principal Investigator  is executing  all agreed activities.  
The s ponsor  retains the right to remove either the  site-investigator or the investigational site from 
the study for issues of non -compliance with the protocol or regulatory requirements.  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 84 of 103  
 On one or more occasions, the study site may be inspected or audited by the sponsor  
representative or a third party. The investigator will be informed in advance of this visit.  
Upon completion of the clinical study (when all subjects at the site have completed follow up 
visits, all data has been ente red in EDC and cleaned, all queries resolved, and final electronic 
signatures have been obtained) , a study closeout visit will be performed. Any unused study 
materials and equipment will be collected and returned to sponsor. The monitor will ensure that 
the investigator’s regulatory files are up to date and complete and that any outstanding issues 
from previous visits have been resolved. Other issues which will be reviewed at this visit 
include: discussing retention of study files, possibility of site audit s, publication policy, and 
ensuring that the investigator will notify the IRB regarding study closeout.  
14.2 Audits and Inspections  
Subcontracts with study sites will specify that sponsor  or its representatives will have direct 
access to source data and documen ts for study monitoring.  Additionally,  the IRB and FDA may 
review source data following appropriate guidelines for this process.  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) functions include, among others , ongoing 
assessment of masked  data to determine whe ther any of the treatment arms show increased risk 
for AEs. The main purpose of the DSMB is to assess safety of the intervention by determining 
whether an increased number of AEs are occurring among study participants in any one of the 
treatment groups . Data will be reviewed every 4 months after the DSMB approval of the DSMB 
Charter.  Frequent interim review of the data for SAE s does not require statistical adjustment for 
repeated testing or analyses.  
The Medical Monitor for this trial will be designated by sponsor /CRO . The Medical Monitor will 
review and approve the eligibility of all screened subject s, review all AEs, assess the benefits 
and risks of protocols on an ongoing basis, and work in collaboration with the IRB and RAC  to 
identify safety signals and  trends.  
In addition, the Medical Monitor will be available for site questions. The Medical Monitor will 
be available to sites for questions regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, protocol conduct, and 
safety. Trained and qualified physicians will be avai lable to provide coverage during times when 
the medical monitor is unavailable. Sites will be provided with the Medical Monitor’s cell phone 
number for emergency situations. Otherwise, sites are instructed to contact the Medical Monitor 
through email. All conversations with sites will be documented by the Medical Monitor and 
reviewed periodically by the sponsor.  
Each month the Medical Monitor will receive a listing of protocol violations for review and 
identification of possible trends.   
Serious adverse eve nts will be reported  to the CRO by the site  within 24 business  hours  of the 
site’s knowledge of the event . For reportable unexpected and/or related SAE s, the Medical 
Monitor will contact NeuroRx within 48 business hours of the notice by the site.  In additi on, the 
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 85 of 103  
 Medical Monitor may request individual subject  records, including laboratory data, clinical 
records, and other study related data, to evaluate these events against the known safety profile of 
the study treatment and the disease. Any records sent to  the Medical Monitor by the site will be 
redacted for any identifying information before transmission. The Medical Monitor may 
recommend actions including partial or complete unblinding, and/or modifying or terminating 
the study.  
Urgent Clinical Situation s: During the course of the study, a subject  will be reassessed for 
continued participation based on clinical judgment of the investigators. All subjects will be 
offered access to 24/7 coverage for medical emergencies through the clinical staff at each sit e. 
Treatment options and their risks and benefits, including continued study participation and other  
treatme nt options, will be sensitively explained. All study investigators have extensive clinical 
experience in the treatment of BPD and suicidal ideation , and can make the decision (while 
blinded) as to removal of subjects from the trial, particularly in the event of clinical deterioration 
or emergence/worsening of suicidal ideation. When a subject  is removed from the trial based on 
clinical judgment, inves tigators will implement an appropriate treatment plan and arrange for 
follow -up for the subject . 
14.3 Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  
The study protocol and any amendments will be reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
The IRB will review the informe d consent form, their updates (if any), and any written materials 
given to the subjects. A list of all IRBs and contact information will be included in the study report.  
IRB approval will be obtained and documented prior to subject enrollment  and screening . Before 
study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval from the  IRB for the 
protocol, consent form, subject  recruitment materials/process (e.g., advertisements), and any 
other written information to be provided to subject s. 
The investigator will provide  the IRB with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., Safety 
Updates, Amendments, and Administrative Letters) according to regulatory requirements and 
Institution procedures.  
A detailed list of required regulatory documents , also to be submitted to the CRO and/or sponsor , 
will be sent upon final approval of the protocol.  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 86 of 103  
 15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
15.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copies of original records  of 
clinical findings, observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by the sponsor or other 
activities in the study, which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The 
investigator will permit study -related monitoring, au dit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records.  
All study records will be retained for a period of time as defined by the regulatory authority for 
the country in which the investigation is conducte d.  Generally, this means at least 2 years 
following the date on which the drug is approved by the regulatory authority for marketing for the 
purposes that were the subject of the investigation.  In other situations (e.g., where the investigation 
is not in  support of or as part of an application for a research or marketing permit), a period of 2 
years following the date on which the entire clinical program is completed, terminated or 
discontinued or the investigational application under which the investigat ion is being conducted is 
terminated or withdrawn by the regulatory authorities.  
In the event the Investigator retires, relocates or for any other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the records may 
be transferred to any other person who will accept responsibility for the records.  Notice of such a 
transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor.  The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior 
to disposal of any records related to th is study.  
15.2 Reporting of Results  
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF 
must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must be 
kept current to reflect patient s tatus during the course of the study.  Only a patient screening and 
randomization number will be used to identify the patient.   
The monitor is responsible for performing on -site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to t he protocol; verify adherence to local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the 
CRF.  
The CRO will monitor completed Case Report Forms (CRFs).  A case report form will be provided 
for each screened patient.  
All protocol -required information collected during the study must be entered by the Investigator, 
or designated representative, in the Target e*CRF , an Internet -based electronic data collection 
system.  All details of t he CRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator.  
The management module of Target e*CRF  includes edit check and query systems that 
seamlessly integrate with the data entry system.  All modifications to the data in the eCRF are 
track ed by an electronic audit trail (date and identity of the person making the change are 
instantaneously recorded).  Target e*CRF  is 21CFR Part 11 compliant.  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 87 of 103  
 If the Investigator authorizes other persons to make entries in the CRF, the names, positions, and 
signatures of these persons must be supplied to the sponsor.  
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examina tion, 
treatment, or any other study procedure.  Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately 
after the final examination.  By design, an explanation must be provided for all missing data, 
altered data, and/or out of range data.  
The completed case report form must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator named in the 
study protocol or by a designated sub investigator.  
Final monitored and audited eCRFs will be provided by the Sponsor to the sites at the end of the 
study in the format of a PDF file.  
15.3 Confidentiality of Subject Data  
The risk of loss of privacy is judged to be minimal. Confidentiality will be maintained by 
numerically coding all data, by disguising identifying information, and by keeping all data in 
locked file drawers or on password -protected databases on password -protected and encrypted 
computers in locked offices. Subject information will be accessible only to research staff. 
Information about study participants will not leave our institution in any form that would identify 
individual  subjects. Sites will enter subject data directly into the  EDC  system , which will be 
managed by the [CRO/data management]  team. Subjects will be assigned study ID numbers.  
Potential risks to data confidentiality will be mitigated by requirements for the de -identification 
of all study data and by security protocols for all data capture systems.  All users of the EDC 
system will be tracked and provided access in a secure fashion following established Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for this process.  
As wi th all research data, information gathered by the study will be used only for aggregate 
analysis; it will not be released with any information that identifies research participants.  
Pharmacogenetic information, in particular, will be coded and unlinked to individual respondent 
identifiers.  The data managers, biostatistician, and study sponsor  do not have access to the 
identities of subject s. That information is retained only at the clinical sites. Uses and risks related 
to data collection will be outlined i n the informed consent and reviewed with the subjects.

 16. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
16.1 Ethics Review  
Anticipated  benefits of the research to participants and others: This study will potentially help 
individuals with BPD and acute suicidal intention . If we discover that this intervention is 
effective, these results will lead to a full clinical development program of this treatment for BPD 
and acute suicidal intention . 
Risks to subjects relative to the anticipated benefits to research participants and others: The 
treatment has been selected with consideration of safety in mind. Additionally, adequate 
protections are in place to  carefully  monitor the medical wellbeing of participants.  In contrast, 
the morbidity and mortality associated with BPD and suicidal ideation  are known to be very 
high.  
Risks to subjects in relation to the importance of the knowledge that reason ably may be expected 
to result:  The benefit to society from the development of efficacious interventions with rapid 
onset for BPD and acute suicidal ideatio n would be a substantial public health benefit.  
Vulnerable populations will not be included, except for adolescents  ages 18 to 21. Pregnant 
women will not be included in the study. Prisoners will not be included. Subjects under the age 
of 18 years will not  be included.  
16.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in compliance with the approved protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
Participants must be capable of understanding the nature of this study, its potential risks, 
discomforts and benefits. Study physicians will obtain consent after they have fully explained the 
study purpose and its procedures, and potential participants hav e demonstrated an understanding 
of the protocol, willingness to participate, and compete ncy to consent .   
All subject s will receive monitoring for clinical deterioration, support, attention, and reassurance 
in the context of a therapeutic alliance. By defi nition, the target population is one in which 
subjects have not responded to available antidepressant therapies. Both active treatment and 
placebo/control groups in each trial will receive comprehensive evaluation and careful 
monitoring. Close monitoring b y a trained psychiatrist is beneficial for individuals with mood 
disorders. If subject s are in need of more intensive psychiatric treatment at any time during the 
course of the trial, study personnel will assist in needed evaluation and referral to appropr iate 
treatment settings. Subjects will be carefully monitored regarding depressive and other 
psychiatric symptoms. Non-responders to study treatment will be offered referrals for treatment 
at the end of the trial.  
Protocol NRX -101-001 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 89 of 103  
 The investigators recognize that although DCS has been used in millions of individuals without 
report of significant safety concerns, DCS has thus far been used in 21 subject s at the 1000mg 
dose in formal studies of psychiatric illness . Therefore, the investigators will appoint a 
designated safety  monitor to surveil for any safety signals that may arise in the course of the 
study .  
Lurasidone is an FDA -approved medication which is indicated in the treatment of bipolar 
depression and is a member of a class of medications (5 -HT2A antagonists) that is  routinely used 
in treating bipolar depression . Neither lurasidone, nor any other member of this class has 
successfully demonstrated efficacy against suicidality – in fact the medication bears a warning 
about potential suicide risk . However, its efficacy a gainst bipolar depression is established . 
16.3 Subject Information and Consent  
Participants must be capable of understanding the nature of this study, its potential risks, 
discomforts and benefits. Study physicians will obtain consent after they have fully expl ained the 
study purpose and its procedures and the potential participant has demonstrated an understanding 
of the protocol, willingness to participate and competency to consent.  
The investigator must ensure that subject s are clearly and fully informed abo ut the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they volunteer to 
participate.  Preparation of the  site-specific  consent form is the responsibility of the site Principal 
investigator and must include all element s required by CFR 21 Part 50.25 and the IRB. 
All subjects will receive the consent form for the study.  These documents will be read by the 
subject s and also reviewed by the subject  with a clinician on the research staff prior to 
participating in the study.  Any questions, concerns, or ambiguities will be clarified by the site’s 
site investigator  or another study clinician prior to the subject  signing consent.  Subject s will sign 
informed consent and only then will begin participation in the study.

 17. DATA HANDLI NG AND RECORDKEEPING  
17.1 Data Capture  
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated 
with the investigational  product or entered as a control in the investigation.  
17.2 Retention  of Records  
The investigator must retain investigational product disposition records, case report forms, and 
source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guid elines, or 
Institution procedures, and at least for 10 years.  
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB , sponsor ). Notic e 
of such transfer will be given in writing to sponsor . 
17.3 Use of Information and Publication Policy  
All publications will be reviewed by the sponsor for accuracy before submission to peer 
reviewed journals or scientific meetings. Abstracts should be submitte d for review at least 10 
days before submission, and publications should be submitted for review at least 30 days before 
submission . The study will be posted to Clinicaltrials.gov and results reported in accordance with 
Clinicaltrials.gov guidelines.

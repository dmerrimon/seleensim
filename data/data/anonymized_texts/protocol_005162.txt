 1 BACKGROUND  
The purpose of this investigational  study is to assess the ability of Tympanoseal  
(sodium/calcium alginate ), an investigational  device , to act as a scaffold  during healing of 
the tympanic membrane.  Tympanoseal  is intended for use following removal or extrusion of 
indwelling tympanostomy tubes or traumatic injury of the tympanic membrane.    
 
 
Formulation of  Tympanoseal  
 
Tympanoseal is formulated from a hydrogel consisting of sodium and calcium mixed salt of 
alginic acid.  
 
Grace Medical, in cooperation with Cliff Megerian MD of Case Western Reserve University 
has developed Tympanoseal, a sodium/ calcium alginate tympanic membrane scaffolding 
device  to address the issues in existing state of the art technologies.  It will be available as 
one device that can be trimmed to four different sizes.  
 
Tympanoseal devices  were constructed using an injection molding 
technique which results in gels composed of  2.7% PronovaTM calcium 
alginate  and 1.8 % PronovaTM sodium alginate (Melvik et al.,  United States 
Patent 7,790,600, September 7,2010 ). This gelling methodo logy is 
proprietary to NovaMatrix, AS of Drammen, NO , and is marketed as a self -
gelling alginate. Upon solidification the hydrogel appears very light, 
opaque beige.  
 
Different sizes as measured by the diameter of the inter -flange shaft will be available 
including 2mm, 3mm, 4mm and 5mm.  Tympanoseal will be  provided lyophilized in a special 
capsule made of medical -grade transparent Nylon 12 which has been proven to be both 
sterilizable and non -contaminating to medical devices.  The device is removed by breaking 
tabs on the bottom section, taking off the top s ection and removing the contents with 
forceps .  The product comes in a Christmas tree shape.  The physician selects the correct 
size and removed by cutting  what is not needed.

The publication describes the  comparison of alginate hydrogel grafts  versus application of a 
paper patch in a chinchilla model of tympanic membrane perforation.  The alginate treated 
perforations demonstrated signifi cantly improved healing rates over both the untreated 
control group and the paper patch control group.  Nine of thirteen healed in the alginate 
group, two of nine in the paper patch group and one of eleven in the control group.   It was 
concluded that calci um alginate tympanic grafts offer significant advantages in the treatment 
of chronic tympanic membrane perforations over traditional methods.

Ototoxicity testing of calcium alginate samples using Grace Medical’s proprietary method 
was performed by Dr. Hinrich Staecker and Jennifer Nelson Brantley of the University of 
Kansas Medical Center.   The Auditory & Vestibular Neuroscience Lab  tested the o totoxicity 
by using an in - mouse model when exposed to Grace Medical’s a lginate formulation via 
surgical implantation.   
 
Conclusions:  “There was no evidence of any hearing loss either in the acute or late period 
after alginate placement. No evidence of b alance problems were seen on behavioral 
evaluation. Evaluation of animals after termination of experiment demonstrated that all the 
material had absorbed. ”

 1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies  
 
Adverse Events Associated with NovaMatrix Self Gelling Alginate  
 
Clinical trials of Algisyl (Lone Star Heart, Laguna Hills, CA) a cardiac repair gel made with 
NovaMatrix self gelling alginate have demonstrated adverse events in 21.4% of test 
subjects.  None of these events have been related to alginate itself but to development of 
infections or worsening of hear t conditions  No other occurrences of adverse events from 
use of NovaMatrix self gelling alginate have been found.  
 
 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
This study will provide data on the  safety and the  ability of sodium/ calcium alginate gels to 
act as a scaffold  capable of occluding a tympanic membrane perforation over the duration 
of complete healing.   Tympanoseal  could be used in cases where cartilage or fat graft 
tympanoplasty would be indicated.  
 
 
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 13 of 30 
 The anticipated benefits of Tympanoseal are as follows:  
 
1. Potential improvement in perforation repair rate indicated by chinchilla study.  
 
2. Calcium alginate has been proven to increase fibroblast proliferation needed to produce 
collagen in the creation of a stable lamina propria layer.  No current perforation seal repair 
material enables regeneration of the natural lamina propria.  
 
3. Ease of application which will be similar to vent tube placement.  
 
4. Calcium ions in the seal will exchange for sodium ions in exudates of the tympanic 
membrane wound potentially enhancing hemostasis and allowing collagen deposition to 
establish a stable lamina propria.  
 
5. No risk of lateralization found in underlay techniques of tympanoplasty which may result 
in hearing loss and cholesteatoma . 
(Jung TT,  Park SK. Mediolateral graft tympanoplasty for anterior or subtotal tympanic 
membrane perforation.  Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg .  2005  Apr;132(4):532 -6). 
 
6. No need for Gelfoam to be placed under the seal to support it and eliminates the risk of

7. Supplying surgeons with an FDA approved device to act as scaffolding  for tympanic 
membrane perforation repair.   Currently all other products act as simple films and do not 
occlude  a perforation.  
 
The p otential benefits described outweigh the low l evel of risk.  
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to assess the safety of Tympanoseal when used as scaffolding  
during the healing process.   
 
3.2  Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective is to determine ability / if any adverse events arise from 
implantation of Tympanoseal  such as colonization by microorganisms or diminution of 
hearing by damping of tympanic membrane vibrations.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
This study will be a  non-blinded, non -randomized trial .  There will be two (2) sites with a 
limit of fifteen (15) subjects at each si te. (Up to t hirty (30) total subjects are planned. )  Each 
subject will have Tympanoseal  placed during a surgical procedure.

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 14 of 30 
 Evaluations will be taken at baseline and up to three evaluations at 4, 10 and 16 weeks.   If 
tympanic healing is noted at any visi t, then the subject may exit the study without need for 
additional follow -up evaluations.  
 
Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  Subjects who meet all 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into t he study.  All 
subjects will be treated with surgically implanted  Tympanoseal, either unilater ally or 
bilaterally as needed.  
 
Total duration of subject participation will be up to 16 weeks post-procedure and total study 
duration is estimated  to be 6 months . 
 
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
 
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the healing of the tympanic membrane perforation. In 
chinchillas this occurred between 1 and 2 months.  
 
5.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary study endpoint at 16 weeks will establish that the Tympanoseal has fully 
resorbed and is no longer visible.  
 
5.3  Safety Evaluations  
Examination during follow -up visits will establish an incidence of adverse events to the 
implantation of Tympanoseal.

8 STUDY TREATMENT  
 
All subjects will receive the investigational  device, Tympanoseal.  
 
8.1 Blinding  / Randomization  
 
This is a non -blinded , non -randomized study.  
 
8.2 Formulation of  Tympanoseal  
 
Tympanoseal  is formulated from a hydrogel consisting of sodium and calcium mixed salt of 
alginic acid.   The sodium/calcium alginate devices  were constructed using an injection 
molding technique which results in gels composed of  2.7% PronovaTM calcium alginate  and 
1.8% PronovaTM sodium alginate (Melvik et al ., United States Patent 7,790,600, September 
7,2010).  This gelling methodology is pr oprietary to NovaMatrix, AS of Drammen, NO , and is 
marketed as a self -gelling alginate.  Additional information was provided in Sec tion 1.

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 16 of 30 
 8.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Packaging:  
Tympanoseal  is provided sterile in a protective, transparent nylon capsule inside a 
transparent moisture barrier pouch.  
 
Labeling:   
Each package  of study device will be labeled with the required FDA warning statement, the 
catalog and lot numbers, the name of the sponsor, and directions for patient use and 
storage.  Instructions for Use will also be included.  
 
8.4 Device Usage  
One device will be us ed per treated tympanic membrane.  
8.5 Dispensing  
The approved investigator at the site will store the device and control  the use of the test 
article.  
8.6 Instructions for Use  
Operative Technique  
This technique description is the suggested treatment for the  uncomplicated procedure. The 
preferred treatment is that which addresses the needs of the specific patient.  The 
perforation site is evaluated under the operating microscope and the edges of the 
perforation are manipulated with a small pick so as to fresh en the margins of the 
perforation.  
 
A perforation sizing device will be  provided with each device which will allow the surgeon to 
estimate the diameter of a hole in the tympanic membrane in order to choose a repair 
construct of appropriate size.  
 
The lyop hilized device is provided in a protective capsule with four sizes each attached to 
the other with progressively smaller flanges along its length.  The capsule is opened by 
bending  the lateral tabs on it s larger bottom portion with one hand while carefully  removing 
the smaller top portion  with the other hand .  The device can be easily extracted with 
forceps.  
 
The proper size for a given perforation is excised with surgical scissors or scalpel.  One 
flange will be of a larger diameter than the other; the sur geon will implant the device with 
the larger flange laterally.  Insertion of Tympanoseal  is similar to the placement of a 
tympanostomy  tube.  Immediately after insertion normal saline should be instilled in the 
external auditory canal to swell the device a nd completely occlude the perforation.  
 
After Tympanoseal is in place, wax earplugs should be in place during showers and 
swimming.

 8.7 Supply of Study Device at the Site  
 
The Sponsor will ship Study Device to the investigational sites.  The initial study device 
shipment will be made  after site activation (i.e., all required regulatory documentation has 
been received by the Sponsor and a contract has been executed). Subseque nt study device 
shipments will be made a t site request for resupply.  
8.8  Study Device Accountability  
Study device s should be stored by the study site at room temperature.  
An accurate and current accounting of the dispensing of study devices will be maint ained  on 
an ongoing basis by a member of the study site staff .  The number of study devices 
received and used will be recorded on the Investigational Device Accountability Record.  
The study monitor will verify these documents throughout the course of the study.  
8.9 Measures of Treatment and Compliance  
Subjects are required to return for follow -up visits.  Each will be instructed to contact 
investigator’s office for questions or need for unscheduled visit.  
 
9 STUDY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES  
Prior to conduct ing any study -related activities, written informed consent and the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and 
dated by the subject or subject’s legal guardian   If appropriate, assent must also be 
obtained prior to conducting any  study -related activities.  
The preoperative visit will include a medical history, physical examination , prior ENT history, 
concomitant medications  and otomicroscopy with photograph of th e tympanic membrane 
perforation  prior to use of Tympanoseal .  A photograph will also be taken after product has 
been inserted.  
Subjects enrolled in the study will be required to return for up to three follow -up evaluations 
after surgery at 4 weeks, 10 week s and 16 weeks.  If tympanic healing is noted at any visit, 
then the subject may exit the study without need for additional follow -up evaluations.    
It is expected that the product will have resorbed (dissolved) prior to 16 weeks.  However, if 
Tympanoseal is visible at the 16 week visit, the subject should have additional follow -up 
visits scheduled until no product remains at 20 weeks ( + 14 days), 24 weeks ( + 14 days), 
and 36 weeks ( + 14 days).   Subjects may exit study at any interval  when  Tympanoseal is 
no longer present.  Additional visits may be scheduled per investigator discretion.  
  
If the Tympanoseal product appears ‘dry’ to the Investigator, 3 -5 drops of saline may be 
added to keep it moist.   (This should be noted in the comments section of the CRF. )

11 ADVERSE E VENT  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of  a 
medical device  and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
investi gational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.   
The Investigator will determine with the subject, the occurrence of AEs during each subject 
visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be  
recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by duration (start and stop 
dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study d evice , or if unrelated, 
the cause.    
 
AE Severity Grading  
The guidelines below  should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the 
term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  (A 
‘severe’ headache may not be a ‘severe’ AE.)  
The collection period for all AEs will begin after device is impl anted and ends at Subject 
Exit. 
 
Protocol  2015.01 - Rev. B Tympanoseal Research Protocol, Grace Medical, Inc.  Confidential  
 
Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 22 of 30 
 AE Severity Grading  
Severity  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of 
the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required ,, hospitalizations possible.  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Device  
The relationship of an AE to the study d evice  should be assessed usi ng the following the 
guidelines.  
Relationship  
to Device  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from use of the device; that follows a known or expected 
response pattern  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from use of device; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern  and that is unlikely to be 
explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by 
other interventions.  
Possibl y An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from use of the 
device; that follows a known or expected response; but that could readily 
have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to h ave no relationship to the 
study device.  
11.2 Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1.  Death 
2.  A life-threatening adverse experience  
3.  An inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
4.  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5.  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6.  Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage  
 
Protocol  2015.01 - Rev. B Tympanoseal Research Protocol, Grace Medical, Inc.  Confidential  
 
Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 23 of 30 
 Emergency room visits that do not  result in admission to the hospital should be evaluated 
for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., life -threatening; required intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important event).  
 
 
Other important medical eve nts may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed.  
11.3 Serious Adverse E vent Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (w hether or not related to study device).  The 
collection period for all SAEs will begin after device is implanted and ends at Subject Exit.  
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), the site investigator wi ll report SAEs to the IRB    within timeframe 
required.   Please notify Grace Medical within 5 working days.  
 
11.4  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
If an SAE is also an unanticip ated adverse device effect, the investigato r must submit to 
Grace Medical (within 3 business days) and reviewing IRB a report but within 10 working 
days.  
 
12 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
12.1 Early Discontinuation  
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject, the 
investigator, or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  The 
following is a partial list of possible reasons for study treatment discon tinuation:  
1.  Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
2.  Lost to or refused follow -up 
3.  Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event  if investigator feels that it is in the best interest 
of the patient.  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has 
resolved or stabilized.   
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in  for an early discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspe cified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents.

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 24 of 30 
 12.2  Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the sub ject, the investigator, or the 
sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.    
The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will  be specified in the subject’s 
source docume nts as well as Study Exit Form  
 
12.3  Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced up to a total of 15 for the site .   
 
13  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation occurs when the subject, investigator, or Sponsor fails to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and 
primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol deviations for this study include, but a re not limited to, 
the following:  
1.  Failure to Obtain Informed Consent  
2.  Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  (Eligibility)  
3.  Failure to maintain study evaluation time  frames for follow -up visits   
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
deviation.  The Sponsor will determine if a protocol deviation will result in withdrawal of a 
subject.  
When a protocol deviation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Deviation Fo rm detailing the deviation will be completed.  This form will be signed by a 
Sponsor representative and the Investigator.  A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s 
regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.    
Protocol deviations should also be rep orted  as required  to the site’s IRB . 
 
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
 
As this study is for safety and utilizing a small number of subjects, no statistical analysis will 
be completed.  Information will be presented to the FDA in tabular format.  
 
Adverse event rates will be coded by body system will include the number of patients for 
whom the event occurred, the rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study 
device.    
14.1  Sample Size and Randomization  
Up to 30 subjects wi ll be enrolled in this non -randomized study.  The number of subjects 
was determined by discussion with the FDA.

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 25 of 30 
 15 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING  
15.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the 
study device.    
 
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source docum ents corresponding to a 
subject’s visit into the Case Report Forms (CRFs) provided when the information 
corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by name in the study 
database or on any study documents to be collected by th e Sponsor (or designee), but will 
be identified by subject number and initials.  
 
If any correction is made on a CRF, the study staff member will line through the incorrect 
data, write in the correct data and initial and date the change.  
 
The Investigator i s responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this 
study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator.  Copies  of the completed CRFs will remain 
at the Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.  
15.2 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB, and Re gulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) 
inspectors upon request.  A file for each subject must be maintained that includes the 
signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and Assent Form and copies of all source 
documentation related to that subject.  The Investigato r must ensure the reliability and 
availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study 
File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a p eriod of two years following marketing of 
the investigational product or for two years after centers have been notified that the study 
has been discontinued.  There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is 
required to maintain study records and,  therefore, the Sponsor should be contacted prior to 
removing study records for any reason.

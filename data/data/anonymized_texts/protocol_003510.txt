1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
In this phase II study, we aim to improve outcomes for untreated mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL) patients by incorporating the highly active agent, lenalidomide, to a standard induction 
chemotherapy backbone including RCHOP and high -dose cytarabine. Traditionally, patients 
with MCL have been treated based upon age or transplant -eligibility status with “younger” 
patients receiving multi -agent chemother apy followed by high -dose therapy and autologous 
stem cell transplant (HDT -ASCT) while “older” patients typically receive less toxic 
chemotherapy combinations, like bendamustine and rituximab. However, this paradigm may 
no longer be applicable in MCL with the advent of highly active, biologically -targeted 
therapies, such as lenalidomide, and emerging data that suggests an unclear benefit of 
consolidation with HDT -ASCT.  In this study, we will enroll both “younger” and “older” 
patients with untreated MCL. Le nalidomide has known clinical activity in both untreated and 
relapsed/refractory MCL. With increasing data demonstrating the benefit of maintenance 
after initial therapy, in this study, patients will receive 6 months of rituximab and lenalidomide 
maintenan ce therapy. In addition, we will assess early biomarkers for response, including 
PET/CT and minimal residual disease assessment using a novel deep -sequencing platform, 
and correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcomes. In particular, we are interested in 
assessing what proportion of patients convert to MRD - and PET -negativity after each phase 
of therapy , Len -RCHOP, R -HiDAC, and after  Len-R maintenance, to assess the kinetics and 
depth of response with the three phases of treatment. The primary outcome i n the study will 
be 3-year progression -free survival and the study will enroll a total of 45 patients.

conclusion of  maintenance therapy, and 6 months after completion of Len -R maintenance) .    
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Mantle Cell Lymphoma  
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an unco mmon B -cell Non -Hodgkin lymphoma, comprising 
approximately 6 -8% of all Non -Hodgkin lymphomas.1 Mantle cell lymphoma often presents 
with advanced stage disease and common sites of extranodal involvement include the bone 
marrow or GI tract. The median age of presentation for mantle cell lymphoma is 68 years and 
more commonly presents in men versus wo men.  
 
Morphologically, MCL is comprised of small to intermediate sized cells with a characteristic 
immunophenotype of CD5+, CD10 -, BCL6 -, CD20+, CD23 -, CD43+, and cyclin D1+. There 
are different morphologic variants of MCL including blastoid, pleomorphic,  small cell, and 
marginal zone -like variants. Blastoid and pleomorphic variants are composed of larger cells, 
similar to lymphoblasts, and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.2 Mantle cell 
lymphoma is classically characterized by the presence of the reciprocal chromosomal 
translocation t(11;14) betw een the proto -oncogene CCND1 and the immunoglobulin heavy 
chain (IgH) locus.3 This translocation leads to the deregulation of the gene CCND1 and to the 
overexpression of its protein product cyclin D1, an important regulator of the G1 -S phase 
transition of the cell cycle. There are rare cases of cyclin D1and t(11;14) negative MCL. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15-196 A(15) 
Approval date: 17-Feb-2022 
 
 
    
           Page 5 of 50 
 These cases typically over express cyclin D2 or D3 and can be associated with 
rearrangements invol ving the CCND2 gene.4,5 Recently, expression of the transcription factor 
SOX11 has been described to be present in the majority of cases of conventional MCL, as 
compared to indolent MCL which lacks SOX11 expression, and the presence of SOX11 
expression can be a useful diagnostic tool in cyclin D1 negative cases.6,7       
 
Prognostic Impact of Proliferative Index  
 
The clinical behavior of mantle cell lymphoma is highly variable.  A clinical prognostic score 
called the mantle cell international prognostic index (M -IPI) comprised o f four clinical 
baseline characteristics including age, performance status, lactate dehydrogenase level, and 
white blood cell count is an effective risk stratification tool in MCL, recently validated 
demonstrating the 5 -year overall survival rates in low, intermediate, an high -risk groups to be 
83, 63, and 34%.8,9 An important biologic prognostic marker in MCL is increased cell 
proliferation. Gene expression profiling defined a "proliferation signature" that is associated 
with inferior survival in MCL.10  Immunohistochemistry tests that are routinely applicable in 
the clinical setting for MIB -1 expression or Ki -67 proliferative index can also provide an 
estimate of the cell proliferation and have been shown to have prognostic  impact in multiple 
studies.11,12 For example, in the 2nd Nordic MCL trial (MCL -2) of rituximab -maxi-CHOP 
alternating with rituximab -high-dose cytarabine followed by high dose therapy and stem cell 
transplant, event -free survival w as significantly different when comparing groups of patients 
defined by Ki -67 index <10%, 10 -29%, and >29%, see figure below.11 Visual estimatio n of Ki -
67 is subject to interobserver variability and a study determining the proliferative index by 
quantitative analysis also found that Ki -67 was a powerful prognostic tool with a Ki -67 cut -off 
of 30% defining risk groups with statistically significant  differences in PFS and OS.12  
Based on these data, we will plan to compare outcomes with our novel treatment program 
across prognostically significant clinical risk groups including 1) low risk:  Ki-67<10%, 2) 
intermediate risk: Ki -67 10 -30%, and 3) high risk: Ki -67≥30% or blastic/blastoid/pleomorphic 
morphology. In particular, we are interested in assessing whether the addition of 
lenalidomide will improve outcomes for the poor -risk group defined by elevated proliferative 
index.  
Induction chemotherapy for MCL  
Traditionally, patients with MCL have been separated into two groups “younger” or 
“transplant -eligible” versus “older” or “transplant -ineligible.” These two groups have been 
treated different ly with “younger” patients receiving multi -agent chemotherapy followed by 
HDT-ASCT while “older” patients typically receive less toxic chemotherapy combinations, like 
R-CHOP followed by maintenance rituximab or bendamustine and rituximab. However, this 
paradigm may no longer be applicable in MCL, particularly with the development of novel 
therapies and with growing evidence that maintenance therapy may be equivalent to HDT -
ASCT.   
Cytarabine is a highly active drug in MCL and for the proposed treatment prog ram it was 
important to ensure that high -dose cytarabine was included in the induction chemotherapy 
program. The addition of cytarabine to induction chemotherapy for younger mantle cell Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

           Page 6 of 50 
 lymphoma patients has been associated with improvements in progression  free and overall 
survival in multiple studies. The R -HyperCVAD regimen with alternating high dose cytarabine 
and methotrexate demonstrated a high CR rate of 87% and with median follow up of 8.3 
years, the median time to treatment failure among patients yo unger than 65 years was 5.9 
years and median OS not yet reached.13,14 Another treatment program including high dose 
cytarabine was the Nordic MCL -2 trial that treated patients with augmented RCHOP 
alternating with R -high-dose cytarabine followed by HDT -ASCT in responding patients.11 The 
6-year OS, EFS, and PFS were 70%, 56%, and 66% respectively. Updated results with 
median observation time of 6.5 y ears, yielded a median EFS of 7.4 years and median OS 
was not reached.15 A similar phase II trial from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de 
l'Adulte utilized R -DHAP instead of R -high-dose cytarabine in an induction chemotherapy 
regimen consisting of seq uential R -CHOP/R -DHAP followed by HDT -ASCT.16 This study 
reported an ORR of 95% with median EFS of 6.9 years and a 75% survival rate at 5  years. 
Finally, a randomized study from the EU MCL Younger Network reported at American 
Society of Hematology (ASH) 2012 conference, definitively compared RCHOPx6 cycles 
induction chemotherapy to cytarabine -containing alternating RCHOPx3 cycles and 
RDHAPx 3 cycles induction chemotherapy and found that the RDHAP induction 
chemotherapy arm was associated with improved CR rate, TTF, and OS.17 In this study, 
responding patients in both arms received consolidation with HDT -ASCT. After a median of 
51 month s, time to treatment failure (TTF) was longer in the DHAP -containing arm (46 vs 88 
months; p=0.038, HR 0.68) and OS was also superior (not reached vs 82 months, p=0.045). 
A recent MSKCC trial (11 -095) utilized a cytarabine -containing induction chemotherapy  
backbone with 4 cycles of dose -dense RCHOP followed by 2 cycles of R -high-dose -
cytarabine with excellent preliminary results. For the current study, we plan to add 
lenalidomide to a cytarabine -containing induction chemotherapy backbone consisting of 4 
cycles of RCHOP chemotherapy followed by 2 cycles of high -dose cytarabine.  
Lenalidomide in Mantle Cell Lymphoma  
Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corporation.  IMiD® compounds 
have both immunomodulatory and anti -angiogenic properties w hich could confer antitumor 
and antimetastatic effects.  Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess anti -angiogenic 
activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF -alpha induced endothelial cell migration, 
due at least in part to inhibition of Akt pho sphorylation response to bFGF.18  In addition, 
lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory  effects.  Lenalidomide stimulates T cell 
proliferation, and the production of IL -2, IL-10 and IFN -gamma, inhibits IL -1 beta and IL -6 
and modulates IL -12 production.19   
Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a number of 
mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity against multiple 
myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell proliferation, which leads to an 
increase in IL -2 and IFN -gamma secretion.  The increased level of these circulating 
cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and enhance natural kill er cell 
activity to yield an increase in multiple myeloma cell lysis.20  In addition, lenalidomide has 
direct a ctivity against cancer cells  and induces apoptosis or G1growth arrest in multiple 
myeloma cell lines.21 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent demonstrating antiproliferative effects in MCL. 
Several studies demonstr ated promising activity with single -agent oral lenalidomide as well 
as lenalidomide and rituximab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL. Lenalidomide 
was administered at a dose of 25 mg daily in a subset of 57 relapsed/refractory MCL patients 
includ ed in the NHL -003 study and was associated with an ORR of 35% with a median 
duration of response of 16.3 months after approximately 20 months median follow up.22 The 
larger international, multi -center, phase II EMERGE study of single -agent lenalidomide in 
patients who relapsed after or were refractory to bortezomib demonstrated an ORR of 28% 
(7.5% CR/CRu) with a similar median duration of response of 16.6 months.23 This study led 
to the FDA approval of lenalidomide in MCL patients whose disease relapsed or progr essed 
after two prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib. In combination with rituximab, 
lenalidomide was well -tolerated and associated with improved response rates, ORR 57% 
(36% CR/CRu).24  
Lenalidomide has also been used for the upfront treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. A 
recent study reported by Ruan et al at the ASH 2014 conference included data from 38 
previously untreated advanced stage MCL pa tients treated with induction and maintenance 
lenalidomide and rituximab.25,26 Durin g the induction phase, lenalidomide was administered 
at 20 mg daily on days 1 -21 of a 28 -day cycle for a total of 12 cycles, with dose escalation to 
25 mg daily if tolerated.   Rituximab was administered weekly x 4 during cycle 1, then once 
every 2 months, for a total of 9 doses.   During the maintenance phase which starts with cycle 
13, lenalidomide is administered at 15 mg daily on days 1 -21 of a 28 -day cycle, with 
rituximab maintenance every 2 months until progression of disease. The majority of patients 
had favorable disease biology with Ki67 index of <30% in 68% of patients (26/38). The ORR 
for all patients was 84.2% with 52.6% achieving a CR. With median follow up of 24 months, 
the estimated 2 -year PFS rate is 83.9% and median PFS was not reached. The de pth of 
responses improved over time with an increased number of patients achieving a complete 
response by 12 months compared with 3 months. In this study, neither MIPI score nor Ki67 
index correlated with response. The preliminary data from this study is v ery promising, 
showing high response rates and an excellent 2 -year PFS with the combination of 
lenalidomide and rituximab for the initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.  
Lenalidomide -RCHOP  
Given the excellent activity of lenalidomide in mantle cell lymphoma both for newly 
diagnosed patients as well as in relapsed, refractory patients, incorporation of lenalidomide 
into a standard chemotherapy backbone for untreated mantle cell lymphoma is li kely to result 
in the increased efficacy of the induction program. We hypothesize that the induction 
regimen of Len -RCHOP followed by R -HIDAC will result in a higher complete response rate 
and higher proportion of patients with absence of minimal residual disease, as well as 
improvements in PFS and OS.  
Lenalidomide has been safely combined with RCHOP in a phase 1 studies of B -cell Non -
Hodgkin lymphomas and in two large phase 2 trials in diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL).27-30 Two different dosing schedules for the lenalidomide have been used in DLBCL: 
1) lenalidomide 15mg orally daily on days 1 -14 and 2) lenalidomide 25 mg orally daily on 
days 1 -10. Although both were safe, the lenalidomide dose of 15 mg days 1 -14 versus 25 mg Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15-196 A(15) 
Approval date: 17-Feb-2022 
 
 
    
           Page 8 of 50 
 days 1 -10 was associated lesser myelosuppression (22% vs. 75% grade 4 neutropenia; 13% 
vs. 44% grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia; 4% vs. 9.4% febrile neutropenia, respectively) .29 
The VTE rates were low in both studies, range 1.6 – 4%. Therefore, we plan to use the 
dosing schedule of lenalidomide 15mg orally daily on days 1 -14 in conjunction w ith standard 
RCHOP. In addition, all patients with receive pegfilgrastim support and aspirin VTE 
prophylaxis.   
Maintenance therapy in MCL  
In the current study, after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients will receive 
maintenance therapy with lena lidomide and rituximab. Lenalidomide and rituximab 
maintenance therapy was effectively applied in the aforementioned study by Ruan et al and 
there are a growing number of studies that underscore the important of maintenance therapy 
in MCL. Although several  phase II studies that have supported the role of HDT -ASCT after 
induction chemotherapy in younger patients with MCL, there is no phase III randomized trial 
data to support the use of HDT -ASCT in first remission in MCL. Furthermore, there is data to 
sugges t that HDT -ASCT may be deferred to a later time point in the disease course of MCL. 
A recent registry study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research demonstrated that HDT -ASCT performed at a later time point, not after first 
remission, is an effective strategy resulting in a 5 -year overall survival of 44%.31 A recent 
study reported at ASH 2014 of the first interim analysis of the phase III randomized Lyma 
Trial showed a significantly improved EFS and PFS after rituximab maintenance versus 
observation. In this study, patients were treated with R -DHAP x 4 cycles and if CR/PR, then 
patients received HDT -ASCT with subsequent randomization to rituximab maintenance 
versus observation.  Finally, there are several studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of 
maintenance therapy after induction chemotherapy in  mantle cell lymphoma. In the EU MCL 
Elderly phase III study, patients ≥ 60 years of age underwent two randomizations: first to R -
FC versus R -CHOP chemotherapy and next to maintenance therapy with rituximab or 
interferon alpha until progression.32 Overall survival was significantly improved in the RCHOP 
versus R -FC arm, and among responding patients who received RCHOP, administration of 
maintenance rituximab was associated with improved overall survival with a 4 -year overall 
survival of 87%. These results for RCHOP followed by maintenance rituximab are among the 
best outcomes reported for the upfront trea tment of MCL in the elderly and suggest that the 
maintenance phase is important for prolonging PFS and OS and likely improves the depth of 
response after initial therapy. Another study including maintenance therapy for untreated 
MCL is the Eastern Cooperat ive Oncology Group phase 2 study of rituximab, bortezomib, 
modified hyper -cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone (VcR -CVAD) 
induction chemo immunotherapy with maintenance rituximab for 2 years.33 Seventy -five 
patients were included and transplant -eligible patients had the option of HDT -ASCT 
consolidation instead of maintenance rituximab. The primary end point was the CR rate to 
VcR-CVAD. The ORR was 95% and a CR was achi eved in 68% of patients. After a median 
follow -up of 4.5 years, 3 -year PFS and OS were 72% and 88%, respectively. No substantial 
difference in PFS or OS was observed between patients treated with maintenance rituximab 
(n = 44) vs HDT -ASCT (n = 22). Althoug h the study was not designed or powered to 
compare maintenance rituximab and HDT -ASCT, these data raise the possibility that a 
maintenance phase post -induction may be equivalent to HDT -ASCT.34 Taken together, these 
data suggest that maintenance therapy is highly efficacious in MCL and that HDT -ASCT, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 particularly in light of its associated toxicities, may not be a necessary component of initial  
therapy for MCL patients.  
The lenalidomide maintenance dose of 15 mg day on days 1 -21 of 28 -day cycle with 
rituximab every 2 months is the same maintenance dose used in the Weill Cornell Medical 
College study of untreated advanced stage MCL patients with  induction and maintenance 
lenalidomide and rituximab.25 Lenalidomide maintenance has been extensively studied in 
multiple myeloma and the maintenance dose ranges from 10 -15 mg days 1 -21 of a 28 -day 
cycle continued indefinitely post -ASCT and is generally well -tolerated and associated with 
prolonged time to disease progression.35,36 The optimal duration of maintenance therapy is 
unclear in MCL, and, therefore, we are interested in studying an abbreviated maintenance 
period of 6 months and utilizing MR D assessments to gain insight into the optimal duration of 
lenalidomide -rituximab based upon conversion from MRD -positivity to negativity.  
Minimal Residual Disease in MCL  
Several strategies for the detection of minimal residual disease in lymphoid maligna ncies 
have been developed. A molecular marker for MRD in B -cell lymphomas is the presence of a 
unique immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement associated with a malignant clone 
(clonotypic DNA sequence). Allele -specific oligonucleotide PCR (ASO -PCR) a mplification of 
immunoglobulin genes has been previously employed, however, a novel DNA sequencing -
based technique for detecting MRD has been developed with advantages over ASO -PCR.  
The Sequenta LymphoSIGHT™ platform is a high -throughput DNA sequencing me thod that 
can detect minimal residual disease (MRD) of lymphoid malignancies in peripheral blood that 
has a higher sensitivity of one lymphoma cell per million leukocytes, efficient turn -around 
time, and the ability to detect and monitor multiple clones.37,38 
MRD detection has been found to be prognostically significant in MCL.39,40 Using the ASO -
PCR technique, MCL patients treated on 2 randomized trials (MCL Younger and Elderl y) had 
MRD status assessed after induction therapy and after HDT/ASCT (MCL Younger) or during 
maintenance therapy (MCL Elderly).39 Achievement of molecular remission (MRD -negative) 
after induction therapy and HDT/ASCT was associated with significantly improved 
progression -free survival.    
In this study, we plan to test MRD status using the Sequenta LymphoSIGHT™ platform after 
lenalidomide -RCHOP chemotherapy, a fter R -HiDAC therapy, at the conclusion of  
maintenance therapy, and 6 months after completion of Len -R maintenance .   
Adaptive  Biotechnologies will be using the data to seek regulatory approval and development 
of the assay for treatment purposes.

Interim PET -CT in MCL  
Achievement of a negative PET -scan after induction chemotherapy prior to consolidation with 
HDT/ASCR has been shown to be prognostically significant. In the MCL -3 study of R -maxi-
CHOP alternating with R -high-dose Ara -C followed by Zevalin -ASCT, 77% of pati ents had a 
PET-CT scan performed after induction chemotherapy and interpreted using the Deauville 5 -
point scale with Deauville 1 -3 defined as negative. In this study, 85.6% (107/125) patients 
achieved a negative PET -scan and these patients had significantl y improved PFS compared 
to patients with an interim PET -positive scan, 4 - year PFS of 78% versus 27%, respectively 
(p<0.001).    
In this study, we plan to obtain PET -CT at baseline, after lenalidomide -RCHOP 
chemotherapy, after R -HIDAC therapy, and at the c onclusion of Len-R maintenance therapy. 
The PET -CT scans will be interpreted using the Deauville 5 -point scale.  
 
Based on these data, we will plan to compare outcomes with our novel treatment program 
across prognostically significant clinical risk groups  including 1) low risk:Ki -67<10%, 2) 
intermediate risk: Ki -67 10 -30%, and 3) high risk: Ki -67≥30% or blastic/blastoid/pleomorphic 
morphology. In particular, we are interested in assessing whether the addition of 
lenalidomide will improve outcomes for the p oor-risk group defined by elevated proliferative 
index.

This is a phase II clinical trial at MSKCC for mantle cell lymphoma patients previously 
untreated with systemic therapy. This will include bo th “younger” / transplant -eligible patients 
as well as “older” / transplant -ineligible patients. Patients will be treated with three phases of 
treatment: lenalidomide + RCHOP, rituximab + high -dose cytarabine, and lenalidomide + 
rituximab maintenance. The treatment schema is shown below:  
 
4.2 Intervention  
R-CHOP  
Patients will receive lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily on days 1 -14 with standard -dose R -
CHOP (375 mg/m2 intravenous rituximab, 750 mg/m2 intravenous cyclophosphamide, 50 
mg/m2 intravenous doxorubicin, and 1.4 mg/m2 intravenous vincristine on day 1, and 100 mg 
prednisone days 1 -5 or days 2 -6) every 21 days for four cycles.  
All patients will receive pegfilgr astim on day 2 of each cycle and aspirin 81 mg orally daily for 
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis throughout the four cycles.  
After four cycles of Len -RCHOP, the patients will undergo restaging PET/CT scans. Patients 
with evidence of disease progression will be treated off study.   
R-HIDAC  
After lenalidomide -RCHOP phase, patients without evidence of progressive disease will 
receive rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1 and then patients will be admitted for high -dose 
cytarabine (HIDAC). Recommended age -adjusted HIDAC  doses are as follows: ≤70 years: 2 
g/m2 every12 hours X 4 doses  and >70 years: 1 g/m2 every12 hours X 4 doses. Physician 
discretion will dictate the choice of HIDAC dose, ranging from 1 g/m2 – 2 g/m2 every 12 hours 
X 4 doses.   
Patients will receive two cycles of rituximab -HIDAC every 3 weeks. After two cycles of R -
HIDAC, the patients will undergo restaging PET/CT scans. Patients with evidence of disease 
progression will be treated off study.

 After com pletion of induction chemotherapy with Len -RCHOP and R -HIDAC, patients will 
begin maintenance phase with lenalidomide and rituximab for 6 months. Lenalidomide will be 
administered at 15 mg orally daily on days 1 -21 of a 28 -day cycle for a total of 6 cycles  and 
rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks for a total of 3 treatments.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC /DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1  REVLIMID®  
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti -
angiogenic properties.  The chemical name is 3-(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-
yl) piperidine -2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:  
Chemical Structure of Lenalidomide  
  
3-(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3 -dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) piperidine -2,6-dione  
The empirical formula for lenalidomide is C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight 
is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in 
organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, 
ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can 
exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture  with a 
net optical rotation of zero.  
5.1.1 Clinical Pharmacology:  
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibit ed the 
secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased the secretion of anti -inflammatory 
cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation 
with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.   Of cell lines tested, 
lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma 
cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting 
growth of KG -1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, a lso with a deletion of one chromosome 
5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the 
expression of cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.

  Absorption:  
Lenalidomide,  in healthy volunteers, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with 
maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.625 and 1.5 hours post -dose. 
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce 
the maxi mal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. 
Multiple dosing at the recommended dose -regimen does not result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacok inetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to 
maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, 
and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  Plasma 
lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging from 2.8 to 
6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma concentra tions were 
dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg.21  Exposure (AUC) in multiple 
myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
 Distribution  
 In vitro (14C) -lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
 Metabolism and Excretion  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two -thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and theref ore is partially or entirely active.  
Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours. Supplier(s)Celgene Corporation will supply 
Revlimid® (lenalidomide) to study participa nts at no charge through Celgene’s Revlimid Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strate gy™ (REMS) (formerly known as RevAssist® Program).  
Dosage formLenalidomide will be supplied as capsules for oral administration.  
PackagingLenalidomide will be shipped directly to patients or to the clinic site for IND 
studies.   Bottles will contain a su fficient number of capsules for one cycle of dosing.    Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

5.2  CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE  
Mechanism of action : a nitrogen mustard derivative, is converted to polyfunctional alkylating 
metabolites by hepatic microsomal enzymes. It interferes with DNA replication and RNA 
transcription, and po ssesses potent immunosuppressive activity.  
Formulation:  The drug is supplied as a lyophilized powder in 100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, l g, 
and 2 g vials.  
Preparation/Storage:  It is reconstituted to result in a concentration of 20 mg/mL. It is stable 
for 24 hour s at room temperature or for 6 days refrigerated (2° -8° C).  
5.3  DOXORUBICIN  
Mechanism of action : An anthracycline antibiotic derived as a fermentation product of 
Streptomyces peucetius (caesius). The drug is tightly bound to DNA, preventing DNA -
directed DNA and RNA synthesis. The drug may also act via a free radical mechanism. It 
appears to be active in all phases of the cell cycle.  
Formulation:  The drug is supplied reconstituted in 10, 50 and 200 mg vials.  
Storage:  Reconstituted solutions are stable at r oom temperature for 24 hours and under 
refrigeration for 48 hours.  
Administration:  The drug is administered via a freely -flowing intravenous line over 15 
minutes. Care must be taken to avoid extravasation.  
5.4  VINCRISTINE  
Mechanism of action:  Vincristine is a member of the vinca alkaloid class of natural product 
anti-tumor agents. It exerts its antineoplastic effects by binding to tubulin, resulting in 
inhibition of microtubule assembly. This, in turn, blocks formation of the mitotic spindle 
resulting in t he accumulation of cells in mitosis.  
Formulation:  The drug is supplied reconstituted to a concentration of 1 mg/ Ml  
Preparation/Storage:  The drug is administered via a freely -flowing intravenous line over 1 -2 
minutes, with care taken to avoid extravasation . 
5.5  PREDNISONE  
Mechanism of action :  Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid.  It is often used to enhance 
the effects of other cancer agents when used in combination.  Given in pharmacologic doses, 
prednisone exerts anti -inflammatory and immunosuppres sive effects on the blood and 
lymphatic system.  At the cellular level, prednisone appears to halt DNA synthesis by 
mediating the inhibition of glucose transport or phosphorylation.  In consequence, this 
causes a decrease in available intracellular energy and thus, impedes mitotic division. 
Prednisone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when administered orally and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Per physician discretion , rituximab can be administered as a “split dose” over days 1 and 2 to 
reduce the likelih ood of a rituximab -related injection reaction in patients wit h leukemic phase 
disease.  
Lenalidomide Dosing:  
Patients with moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min but <60 mL/min) 
will receive a lower dose of lenalidomide of 10 mg PO Da ily on Days 1 -14.  
At investigator discretion, patients started with a reduced lenalidomide dose due to baseline 
calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min but < 60ml/min, may have their lenalidomide dose 
gradually increased in a step -wise manner at the st art of Cycle 2 or at the start of subsequent 
treatment cycles, if they tolerated the prior treatment cycle without requiring dose 
modifications, interruptions or delays due to toxicity.  Lenalidomide dose titrations are Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 permitted in 5mg increments on the s ame dosing schedule up to the maximum allowable 
target dose.   
Dosing will be at approximately the same time each day.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 
days for females of child bearing potential and 14 days for all other risk categories.  
Swallow len alidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day.  Do not break, 
chew or open the capsules.   
If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  
If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be ma de up.  
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to 
seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.

o Premedication will be given per institutional guidelines  
o Anti-emetics  will be given per institutional guidelines  
o Aspirin 81 mg PO Days 1 -21 (daily throughout every cycle) for venous 
thromboembolism prophylaxis. If aspirin is contraindicated, alternate anticoagulant 
agent for prophylaxis of VTE should be initiated per physic ian discretion and tailored 
to the patient’s individual risk/benefit profile by taking into account the patient’s 
thrombotic risk, bleeding risk, and other relevant factors. Aspirin can be deferred if the 
patient is already on prophylactic or therapeutic d ose anticoagulation.   
o Mandatory g rowth factor support will be pr ovided after each cycle of Lenalidomide -R-

21 days 
 
* Lenalidomide 5 mg daily on Days 1 -14 every 21 days is the minimum lenalidomide dose.  
Lenalidomide will be discontinued in patients who cannot tolerate this dose.  However, 
patients who experience toxicity requiring dose reduction while receiving lenalidomide 5 mg 
daily on Days 1 -14 every 21 days may , at the discretion of their physician, have their dose 
held until toxicity res olves  and then restart lenalidomide 5 mg daily.  If the same toxicity 
recurs at lenalidomide 5 mg daily, consideration should be given to discontinuing 
lenalidomide.  
 
Instructio ns for initiation of a New Cycle  
 
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if:  
 
 The ANC is ≥1,000  cells/ul ;  
 The platelet count is ≥  50,000  cells/ul;  
 Any drug -related rash or neuropathy that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 
severity;  
 Any other drug -related adverse events that may have occurred have resolved to ≤ grade 2 
severity.  
 
Same day results are not required from the comprehensive metabolic panel (including renal 
function and liver function testing) to assess for non -hematologic laboratory toxicity prior to 
treatment on day 1 of each new cycle. It is acceptable to review the c omprehensive 
metabolic panel results that were obtained within 23 days prior to day 1 of each cycle.  
 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated within a 
week  and a new cycle of treatment will not be initiated u ntil the toxicity has resolved as 
described above. If the cycle is delayed > 4 weeks, then the patient will be removed from 
study.

 o Aspirin 81 mg PO Daily throughout 6 months of lenalidomide maintenance therapy for 
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. If aspirin is contraindicated, alternate 
anticoagulant agent for prophylaxis of VTE should be initiated per physician d iscretion 
and tailored to the patient’s individual risk/benefit profile by taking into account the 
patient’s thrombotic risk, bleeding risk, and other relevant factors. Aspirin can be 
deferred if the patient is already on prophylactic or therapeutic dose a nticoagulation.   
 
 Prophylactic antibiotics :  
o Acyclovir 400 mg PO BID   
 
 Dose delays/reductions  
 
The lenalidomide starting dose will be based on baseline calculated creatinine clearance as 
follows:  
Lenalidomide Starting Dose Based on Renal Function at Study  Entry  
Baseline Calculated 
Creatinine Clearance 
(by Cockcroft -Gault)  Starting Lenalidomide Dose  
 60 ml/min  15 mg daily on Days 1 - 21 of each 28 -day 
cycle  
 30 and < 60 ml/min  10mg daily on Days 1 - 21 of each 28 -day 
cycle  
 
At investigator discretion, patients started with a reduced lenalidomide dose due to baseline 
calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min but < 60ml/min, may have their lenalidomide dose 
gradually increased in a step -wise manner at the start of Cycle 2 or a t the start of subsequent 
treatment cycles, if they tolerated the prior treatment cycle without requiring dose 
modifications, interruptions or delays due to toxicity.  Lenalidomide dose titrations are 
permitted in 5mg increments on the same dosing schedule  up to the maximum allowable 
target dose.   
 
The lenalidomide dose may only be increased once every 28 days (or less frequently), and 
may only be increased if the prior treatment cycle was completed without requiring dose 
modifications, interruptions or de lays due to toxicity.   
 
Dosing will be at approximately the same time each day.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7 
days for females of child bearing potential and 14 days for all other risk categories.  
 
Swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water a t the same time each day.  Do not break, 
chew or open the capsules.  If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon 
as possible on the same day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  
Patients who take more than the  prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed to 
seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.

 Peripheral neuropathy, constipation, alopecia, metallic taste in the mouth, mild nausea,  
paraesthesia and paresis. Extravasation may result in soft tissue necrosis  
Prednisone:  
Prednisone exerts numerous effects on the body: euphoria, mood swings, fluid retention, 
adrenocortical insufficiency, muscle pain or weakness, muscle wasting, increased  
susceptibility to infections, hypokalemia, hypercorticism, amenorrhea, decreased glucose 
tolerance, hyperglycemia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, increased appetite, weight gain, 
gastric ulceration, ulcerative esophagitis, insomnia, headache, restlessness, i ncreased motor 
activity, impaired wound healing, skin atrophy and thinning, acne, and increased sweating.  
Lenalidomide:  
Adverse Events  
Most frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with lenalidomide in 
oncologic and non-oncologic indications, regardless of presumed relationship to study 
medication include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, infections, sepsis, pneumonia, 
UTI, Upper respiratory infection, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, chest pain, weakness, hypotension, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, back pain, bone 
pain, generalized pain, dizziness, mental status changes, syncope, renal failure, dyspnea, 
pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, CVA, convulsions, dizziness, 
spinal cord compression, syncope, disease progression, death not specified and fractures.  
The following events have been reported during the use of l enalidomide in clinical studies and 
in the post -marketing setting:  
The r are adverse event of angioedema and serious skin reactions including Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported.  These events have 
the pote ntial to result in death.  Medical journals have reported patients with allergic skin 
reaction with thalidomide who also developed the same type of reaction with lenalidomide. The 
rare adverse event of rhabdomyolysis has been observed with lenalidomide.   
Tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare reaction have commonly been observed in patients with 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and uncommonly in patients with other lymphomas, 
who were treated with lenalidomide.  Fatal instances of TLS have been reported d uring 
treatment with lenalidomide.  There have been rare reports of TLS in patients with multiple 
myeloma treated with lenalidomide, and no reports in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome 
treated with lenalidomide.   
Second New Cancers  
According to resea rchers, patients with cancer have a higher risk of developing a second new 
cancer when compared to people without cancer. In clinical studies of newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma, a higher number of second cancers were reported in patients treated with 
lenalidomide as induction therapy (treatment for several cycles to reduce number of cancer 
cells) and/or bone marrow transplant  followed by lenalidomide  for a long period of time 
compared to patients treated with induction therapy and/or bone marrow transpla nt then 
placebo (a capsule containing no lenalidomide). Patients should make their doctors aware of 
their medical history and any concerns they may have regarding their own increased risk of 
other cancers.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

           Page 35 of 50 
 Complete and updated adverse events are available  in the Investigational Drug Brochure and 
the IND Safety Letters.  
Other Risks  
Patients should be instructed that if any physician other than the study doctor prescribes 
medication for another condition, or patients start to take any over -the-counter medic ations or 
vitamins, they must inform the study staff. This is important because the interaction of some 
medications may cause serious side effects.   
o Patients taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone for multiple myeloma 
should be careful taking drugs that may  increase chance of having blood 
clots.  
o Cases of transient liver laboratory abnormalities were reported in patients 
treated with lenalidomide.   
o Lenalidomide has been shown to increase the level of digoxin in the blood 
in some patients.  
 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Risk : 
Lenalidomide is related to thalidomide .  Thalidomide is known to cause severe life -threatening 
human birth defects.   Findings from a monkey study indicate that lenalidomide caused birth 
defects in the offspring of female monk eys who received the drug during pregnancy.  If 
lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or death to any unborn 
baby.   Females must not become pregnant while taking lenalidomide. Patients with multiple 
myeloma who take lenalidomid e and dexamethasone have a greater chance of having blood 
clots.  Because of this, it is recommended patients not take birth control pills or hormone 
replacement therapy before discussing with the investigator and considering the risks and 
benefits of thes e choices.     
When taking lenalidomide, the drug is present in semen of healthy men at very low levels for 
three days after stopping the drug.  For patients who may not break down the drug normally, 
such as patients who do not have normal kidney function,  lenalidomide may be present for 
more than three days.  To be safe, all male patients should use condoms when engaging in 
sexual intercourse while taking lenalidomide, when temporarily stopping lenalidomide, and for 
28 days after permanently stopping lenal idomide treatment if their partner is either pregnant or 
able to have children.   
Patients should not donate blood during treatment therapy or for 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
 
Reproductive risks:  
Patients should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs 
in this study can affect an unborn baby. A woman should NOT CONCEIVE A BABY while she 
or her partner is receiving lenalidomide.  A man should NOT DONATE SPERM OR 
IMPREGNATE HIS PARTNER while he is on l enalidomide.   
Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study. It is important that the patient 
understand that they will need to use birth control while on this study.   A list of acceptable Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 forms of birth control methods to use and how long to us e them is listed below.  Pregnancy 
testing will be required as per Table 7.   
  Pregnancy Risk – Females:  
If a patient is a female of childbearing potential*, she will be required to have two negative 
pregnancy tests: the first test within 10 -14 days before lenalidomide is prescribed and the 
second test within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed.  
 
   * For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is a 
sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the 
surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical 
removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not bee n naturally postmenopausal 
for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time 
during the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
The female patient will be required to use TWO reliable forms of birth control, one highly 
effective method and one  additional effective method at the same time or practice complete 
abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this 
study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout lenalidomide therapy, 
including interruptions in therapy; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation of 
lenalidomide.  The following are the acceptable  birth control methods:  
Highly Effective Method:  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, im plants)  
 Tubal ligation   
Male p artner’s vasectomy Additional Effective Methods:  
 Latex condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervical cap  
A female patient must not breastfeed a baby while participating in this study and for at least 28 
days after the discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
Females of childbearing potential with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have 
pregnancy tests week ly for the first 28 days and then every 28 days while taking lenalidomide, 
at the time lenalidomide is discontinued, and at day 28 following discontinuation of 
lenalidomide.  If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for 
the first 28 days and then every 14 days while taking lenalidomide, at discontinuation of 
lenalidomide, and at days 14 and 28 following discontinuation of lenalidomide.   
If the patient has any reason to suspect that they are pregnant, the patient must IMMED IATELY 
stop taking lenalidomide and contact the physician investigator.   
All Patients:  
Patients must NEVER  share lenalidomide with someone else. The patient must receive 
counseling and complete phone surveys as required by the RevAssist®  program.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 The patient should be instructed to swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the 
same time each day.  They should not break, chew or open the capsules.   
If the patient misses a dose of lenalidomide, they should take it as soon as they remember on  
the same day.   
If they miss taking the dose for the entire day, they should take the regular dose the next 
scheduled day ( they should NOT take a double regular dose to make up for the missed dose ).   
If they take more than the prescribed dose of lenalido mide they should seek emergency 
medical care if needed and contact the study staff immediately.  
Females of childbearing potential that might be caring for you should not touch the 
lenalidomide capsules or bottles unless they are wearing gloves.  
Any unused Revlimid® (lenalidomide) should be returned as instructed through the 
RevAssist® program.  
 
Rituximab:  
Common: Fever, chills, fatigue, headache; less common: nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus, 
hypotension; rare: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, arrhythmia, tumor lysis 
syndrome, shock, angioedema, acute respiratory distress, arthritis, vasculitis, lupus -like 
syndrome, pleuritis, bronchiolitis obliterans, uveitis, optic neuritis, and skin reactions such as 
toxic epidermal necrolysis and pemphigus.  
Hematologic Events : In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of 
patients treated with RITUXIMAB; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), 
leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of 
lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 
to 116 days).  A single  
occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of 
hemolytic anemia following RITUXIMAB therapy were reporte d. In addition, there have been 
a limited number of postmarketing reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, 
and late onset neutropenia (defined as occurring 40 days after the last dose of RITUXIMAB) 
in patients with hematologic malignancies.  I n reported cases of late onset neutropenia (NCI -
CTC Grade 3 and 4), the median duration of neutropenia was 10 days (range 3 to 148 days).  
Documented resolution of the neutropenia was described in approximately one -half of the 
reported cases; of those with  documented recovery, approximately half received growth 
factor support.  In the remaining cases, information on resolution was not provided.  More 
than half of the reported cases of delayed onset neutropenia occurred in patients who had 
undergone prior au tologous bone marrow transplantation.  In an adequately designed, 
controlled, clinical trial, the reported incidence of NCI -CTC, Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was 
higher in patients receiving RITUXIMAB in combination with fludarabine as compared to 
those recei ving fludarabine alone (76% [39/51] vs. 39% [21/53]). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some 
patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab. The majority of patient s 
received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 hepatitis was approximately 4 months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one 
month after the last dose. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML) associated 
with JC virus infection has been reported in patients treated with rituximab with hematologic 
malignancies or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  PML needs to be considered in 
any patient presenting with new onset neurologic manifesta tions including confusion, 
dizziness or loss of balance, difficulty talking or walking, and visual changes.  
Cytarabine :  
Cytarabine syndrome, characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain, chest pain, maculopapular 
rash, conjunctivitis, and malaise. May occur  6-12 hours following administration; may be 
managed with corticosteroids. Myelosuppression ( Potent myelosuppressive agent;  use with 
caution in patients with prior bone marrow suppression), pancreatitis, tumor lysis syndrome, 
Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; may be at higher 
risk for CNS toxicities and dosage adjustments may be required . Can cause renal 
impairment and must be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. Can 
cause CNS toxicities and dosage adjustments may be required. May also lead to 
pancreatitis: There have been reports of acute pancreatitis in patients r eceiving continuous 
infusion and in patients previously treated with L -asparaginase. Tumor lysis syndrome has 
been described as well. With high dose therapy, tumor lysis syndrome and subsequent 
hyperuricemia may occur; consider allopurinol and hydrate acco rdingly.  
Neupogen or Neulasta:   
Bone pain, exacerbation of preexisting autoimmune disorders, transient and reversible 
changes in alkaline phosphatase, uric acid and LDH, splenic rupture.  
11. 1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is any untow ard medical occurrence in a subject participating in an 
investigational trial or protocol regardless of causality assessment. An adverse event can be 
an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
syndrome or diseas e associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational 
product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
 
Toxicities will be graded on a scale of 0 -5 as described by the NCI - Common Terminology for 
Adverse Events (CTCA E), version 4.0. Only grade 3 -5 laboratory toxicities will be reported and 
attributed with regard to relationship to the investigational treatment.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
Criteria for interim FDG -PET/CT  assessment  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15-196 A(15) 
Approval date: 17-Feb-2022 
 
 
    
           Page 39 of 50 
 A five-point scale for visually assessing response on the interim and end -of-treatment FDG -
PET/CT scans, referred to as the “Deauville criteria”, was developed by international experts 
in the field at the First International Workshop on interim -PET in Lymphoma  in Deauville in 
2009.42 The 5 -point scale is displayed in the following table.  
Score  FDG-PET/CT  scan result  
1 No residual uptake  
2 Uptake ≤ mediastinum  
3 Uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver 
4 Uptake moderately > liver  
5 Markedly increased uptake at any site or 
progression  
 
A positive or abnormal interim FDG -PET/CT scan will be defined as a score of 4 or 5. All 
scores (1 through 5) will be recorded for each FDG -PET/CT scan and scans will be reviewed 
by Dr. Schöder . 
End of treatment FDG -PET/CT assessment  
The updated response criteria entitled “The Lugano Classification” system will be applied to 
define end-of-treatment complete response, partial response, and progr ession of disease in 
this study.38 The definitions are  detailed in the table below:  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the time of initiation of therapy.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
Patients will be followed on active follow up for three years after completion of therapy. After the 
active followup period, survival, relapse, and new anti -lymphoma therapy information will be 
collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 6 
months un til death, loss to follow up or consent withdrawal, whichever comes first.  
The following patients will be removed from study:  
• Patients who have progression of disease while on treatment. These patients may be 
offered alternate treatments.  
• Patients wh o develop unacceptable toxicity.  
• Patients who request that they be removed from study. This will not compromise the care 
they receive at this institution.  
• Patients who are non -compliant with treatment or follow -up.

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
Primary Ob jective:  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine the 3 -year 
progression -free survival (PFS) for patients treated with induction chemotherapy consisting 
of lenalidomide with RCHOP and rituximab and high -dose cytarabine followed by 
mainte nance therapy with rituximab and lenalidomide. The defining interval for PFS starts at 
enrollment date, and progression of disease or death from any cause will be counted as 
failures. Our past experience suggests that very few patients who have completed t he 
induction chemotherapy will be lost to follow -up or withdraw from the study by the end of the 
third year (about 5%). If such rare situations occur, however, they will also be counted as 
failures as well in this study. For this cohort of patients, we wil l set acceptable 3 -yr PFS as 
75% or higher, and unacceptable rate as 6 0% or lower.  
To this end we will employ a one -stage design. Fourty -seven  newly diagnosed MCL patients 
treated with induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance will be enrolled for t his study. 
If 33 or more patients are being followed, alive and progression free at the end of the 3rd 
year, this treatment regimen will be declared effective. This decision rule has a type I error 
(declaring the new treatment regimen promising while it is  actually not) less than 0.1 and a 
type II error (declaring the new treatment regimen not promising while it actually is) rate less 
than 0.2.  
The above decision rule is based upon an expected proportion of high -risk and low -risk 
patients of 65% and 35%, re spectively. “High risk” patients are defined by Ki -67≥30% or 
blastic/blastoid/pleomorphic morphology. “Low risk” patients are those with Ki -67<30% and 
lack of blastic/blastoid/pleomorphic morphology. Of note, the “low risk” category defined here 
includes a  combination of low and intermediate risk groups that were previously discussed in 
Section 2.0. Historical data predicts that the expected 3 -year PFS of high -risk patients is 
approximately 50% whereas the expected 3 -year PFS of low -risk patients is 75 -80%.  To 
ensure enrollment of the expected proportion of high -risk and low -risk patients and, 
therefore, ensure that the decision rule is appropriate, we will fix the num ber of high risk 
patients as 31 and the number of low risk patients as 16.  If the maximum number of patients 
has been enrolled for either the high risk group or low risk group, enrollment will continue 
only for group in which enrollment has not yet been met.  
If a patient is enrolled and unable to complete induction treatment, that patient will be 
replaced.   
We aim to enroll 47 patients in 1.5 years (accrual rate is 2 -3 patients per month).   
Secondary Objectives : PFS and OS of treated patients (overall and in different clinical risk 
subgroups) will be evaluated by survival analysis tools such as Kaplan -Meier and compared 
by the log -rank test. The prognostic value of M -IPI on PFS and OS will be evaluated by 
surviva l regression models such as the Cox model. The rate of PET -negativity at various 
time points will be estimated by sample proportions and their confidence intervals will be 
computed. Their correlate with PFS will be evaluated by landmark Cox regression). MR D 
status at various time points will also be correlated with PFS using landmark Cox model.

the attention of the study team for discussion and action.  
Random -sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be conducted by the stud y 
team, at a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if indicated.  
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 20 01. The plans address the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -guidelines . The DSM Plans at MSKCC 
were established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSKCC Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intrane t at: 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%
20Plans.pdf  
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, safety 
and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic re sponse, and staff 
education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus 
there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our 
clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and S afety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board.  
During the protocol development an d review process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) Will be addressed 
and the monitori ng procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
MSKCC affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy.  In compliance 
with United States federal regulations, Celgene requires t he Investigator to permit 
representatives of Celgene Corporation and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or 
other regulatory authorities to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study 
in accordance with local laws.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Should direct ac cess to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.  
17.1 Privacy  
MSK’s Pri vacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research  
Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be completed by the Principal 
Investigator and approved by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).   
The consent indicates that individualized de identified information collected for the purposes  
of this study may be shared with other qualified researchers. Only researchers who have  
received approval from MSK will be allowed to access this information which will not include  
protected health information, such as the participant’s name, except for dates. It is also  
stated in the Research Authorization that their research data may be shared with other  
qualified researchers.  
 
17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
 
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse event  
 An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization A persistent or signific ant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered seri ous when, based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Note:  Hospital admission for a planned procedure/disease treatm ent is not considered an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required as soon as the participant starts investig ational treatment/intervention. 
SAE reporting is required for 30 -days after the participant’s last investigational 
treatment/intervention. Any event that occur after the 30 -day period that is unexpected and at least 
possibly related to protocol treatment must be reported.  
 
Please note: Any SAE that occurs prior to the start of investigational treatment/intervention and is 
related to a screening test or procedure (i.e., a screening biopsy) must be reported.  
 
All SAEs must be submitted in PIMS. If an SAE requires submission to the HRPP of fice per IRB 
SOP RR -408 ‘Reporting of Serious Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be submitted within 5 
calendar days of the event. All other SAEs must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the event.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15-196 A(15) 
Approval date: 17-Feb-2022 
 
 
    
           Page 46 of 50 
  
The report should contain the following informatio n:  
 
 The date the adverse event occurred  
 The adverse event  
 The grade of the event  
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment(s)  
 If the AE was expected  
 Detailed text that includes the following o An explanation of how the AE was handled  
 A description of the participant’s condition  
 Indication if the participant remains on the study  
 If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or consent form  
 If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem  
 
For IND/IDE protocols: The SAE report shoul d be completed as per above instructions. If 
appropriate, the report will be forwarded to the FDA by the IND Office .

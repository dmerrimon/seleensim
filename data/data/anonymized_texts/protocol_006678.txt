Brief Description:  
 
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, with estimated 
direct and indirect costs exceeding 70 billion dollars per year.  Depression is common after 
stroke, occurring in approximately 25% of all  patients.  Depression has been associated with 
lower quality of life, higher mortality, increased healthcare utilization and higher costs.  Cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have been shown, in small studies, to both treat and 
prevent the d evelopment of post -stroke depression.  CBT based interventions therefore have 
the potential to improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs after stroke.  Unfortunately, 
there are significant barriers to the widespread use of CBT in the stroke popul ation, including 
limited access to licensed providers, high costs of treatment, and limited mobility.  Alternative 
methods for delivering CBT have the potential to improve access and reduce costs and may 
make widespread dissemination of CBT based treatment  possible.  We aim to test the feasibility 
of an internet -based CBT (iCBT) program combined with a telephone/email based coaching 
servive in patients with recent stroke.  We will do this by partnering with Joyable.  Joyable is an 
existing, commercially ava ilable iCBT program.  Joyable’s  iCBT Program for Depression  
combines 42 brief online activities with a telephone/email based coaching service, which is 
designed to motivate and encourage individuals to complete the online modules.     
 
Objectives : 
 
1. Determ ine the feasibility of internet -based CBT in patients with recent ischemic stroke 
and depressive symptoms, by quantifying adherence to the program in a pilot population 
of 20 subjects.   
 
2. Quantify changes in depressive symptoms and quality of life in subjects pre - and post -
program participation, to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of internet -based 
CBT to improve outcomes after stroke.  
 
 
Primary Outcome variables  
The primary outcomes will be the number of activities in the iCBT program comp leted by 
participants and reduction in depressive symptoms , measured the 9 -item Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ -9).   
 
Secondary Outcome variables  
Secondary outcome variables will include: completion of the iCBT  program, number of 
telephone/email based coaching interactions, quality of life, measured using the EuroQOL -5D 
 
Protocol V 43 13DEC 27JULY 2018 (EQ-5D), healthcare utilization, measured using the Stanford Health Care Utilization Survey, 
and subject satisfaction with the program.

Depression after stroke  
Depression is  common after stroke, occurring in up to one -third of all stroke patients .1  A recent 
American Heart Association ( AHA) scientific statement on post -stroke depression highlighted 
the importance of this condition, noting that it was “under -recognized, under -investigated, and 
under -treated.”2   Individuals with depression  after stroke have been shown to have lower 
functional status and lower quality of life than those without depression , irrespective of stroke 
severity, although the independent contribution of depression  on outcomes is still not fully 
understood.  
 
Traditi onal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for common mood 
disorders.  Studies have shown a beneficial effect of CBT for both the treatment and prevention 
of depression after stroke.3, 4  There is also evidence suggesting that CBT may provide a more 
durable and lasting treatment effect than pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors.5    
 
Despite the promise of CBT, its role in routine clinical pract ice is limited.  There are significant 
barriers to widespread use of CBT.  First, access to experienced CBT practitioners is limited.  
6  Second, the time and travel requirements to compl ete a course of CBT, which may require  2-3 
visits per week for 10 -12 weeks, are onerous  for many patients.  This may be even more difficult 
for patients with mobility limitations, which are common after s troke.  Third, the cost of CBT  may 
be prohibiti ve, particularly if providers do not accept insurance .6  Finally, patients may  be 
resistant to in -person CBT because of stigma or fear of sharing deeply personal feelings with a 
therapist.    
 
Technology and CBT  
Technology provides an exciting alternative to traditional CBT.6-8  Internet -based CBT has the 
potential to lower cost s and improve accessibility.  Internet -based CBT eliminates the 
challenges of finding a therapist and/or arranging transport to/from visits. There is  also limited 
data to suggest that technology has the potential t o reduce the stigma and fear associated with 
in-person therapy sessions, and subjects may actually be more likely to disclose symptoms 
when they believe they are interacting with a computer  rather than a human .9     
 
Although internet -based CBT interventions may provide a lower intensity of treatment than 
traditional in -person CBT, they still have the potential to  be effective.  An individual patient -data 
meta -analysis of 3876 subjects from 13 studies concluded that internet -based CBT is effective 
at treating depressive symptoms in general.10  Encouragingly  Internet use is now common 
among older adults in the U.S. The Pew Research Center reported that in 2016 87% of 50 -64 
year olds and 64% of adults 65 years or older use the Internet.11 The few studies of i nternet-
based CBT interventions among older adults have demonstrated their efficacy  in reducing 
depressive symptoms among  adults 50 years or older and among adults 45 years or older with 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors for CVD .12, 13 14 Thus, an Internet -based CBT 
intervention among stroke survivors has the potential to reduce depressive symptoms.  
However, because p atients with strok e have experienced a structural brain i njury  and may have 
residual cognitive and physical disability , dedicated study within the stroke population is 
necessary .   
 
Protocol V 43 13DEC 27JULY 2018 Joyable: Internet -based CBT with personalized coaching  
Joyable offers an iCBT program for Depression which is an 8 -week, internet -based cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) program for depression, developed alongside Rob ert DeRubeis PhD, 
a clinical  psychologist with research expertise in the processes and outcomes of treatments for 
depression.  Joyable users complete brief interactive modules (42 total activities) on a 
smartphone or computer.  Most of these modules can be completed in 5 -10 minutes a nd cover 
the core elements of CBT: psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral activation. 
In addition to its digital programs, users receive unlimited guidance and support from coaches 
via phone, text, and email. Coaches both respond to and p roactively reach out to 
participants.  They are trained extensively in motivational interviewing, with the goal of driving 
participants toward completion of the CBT program.  Joyable's depression program has shown 
symptom reduction of 40%, as measured by th e PHQ -9, with satisfaction and completion rates 
that exceed face -to-face therapy (unpublished data, from Joyable).  
 
Joyable monitors the subjects’ mood through weekly assessments of the PHQ -9.  There are 
built-in escalation protocols, designed with Dr. Lan ny Berman, the former President of the 
American Association for Suicidology. Joyable identifies safety risks both through its software 
and through extensive training of coaches. All coaches are trained with how to respond to at -risk 
clients, including prov iding emotional support and informing clients about appropriate resources 
to support them, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line. In 
urgent cases, Joyable can also connect clients with a licensed professional by phone.  
 
Study Design  
 
Design: A pilot single arm clinical trial is proposed.  Adults (18 years or older) with ischemic 
stroke will be enrolled within 63 months of their event.  All subjects will be enrolled in Joyable’s 
iCBT program for Depression.   
 
Duration: The study will plan to enroll 20 subjects.  Each subject will be in the study for 90 
days.  The project will begin immediately after IRB approval.  The study is expected to take 
approximately 1 year to complete.   
 
Resources for human research protection: The clinical research section of the 
comprehensive stroke center at the University of Pennsylvania will conduct the study.  This 
team has extensive experience conducting both observational and interventional studies in 
stroke patients.  The clinical research t eam consists of four full time clinical research 
coordinators, 1 nurse practitioner, 3 vascular neurology fellows, 2 vascular neurology research 
fellows, and 7 vascular neurology attendings.  All members of the clinical research team will be 
required to co mplete CITI training and maintain up to date certification while the study is 
underway.  The research team will maintain training records, including copies of all pertinent 
certificates.  Prior to initiation of the study, the research team will have an in -service session to 
review the study protocol and procedures in detail.  While the study is underway, the research 
team will meet weekly to discuss the study, including enrollment, follow -up, and any other 
issues which may arise. Dr. Mullen will be primaril y responsible for overseeing the study.

follow -up.  
 Pregnant women and prisoners are excluded  
Vulnerable populations: Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, and prisoners are not 
included in this research study.   
Sample Size: 20 subjects will be enrolled.  
 
Accrual:  The comprehensive stroke cent er at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 
(HUP) is a tertiary referral center for acute ischemic stroke, with annual case volumes of 
approximately 600 strokes per year on the inpatient stroke service.  Additionally, the stroke 
team sees patients  in the outpatient clinic both in follow -up from their acute hospitalization and 
in consultation to provide second opinions for patients treated elsewhere.  Due to the broad 
inclusion criteria of this study, it is expected that many of the patients seen, b oth inpatient and 
outpatient, will be eligible for participation in this study.  We expect that we will be able to enroll 
1-2 patients per week and will complete enrollment within 6 months.   
 
Recruitment: A stroke physician evaluates all patients with acu te ischemic stroke who present 
to HUP.  All stroke team physicians will be trained investigators in this study, and they will 
screen patients for eligibility during routine clinical care.  Study physicians will also screen for 
potentially eligible subjects  during outpatient clinic sessions.  All eligible subjects will be 
informed of the study, and if they are interested in participation, a study physician will obtain 
informed consent. The original signed consent form will be kept in the study binder. A copy  of 
 
Protocol V 43 13DEC 27JULY 2018 the signed consent form will be given to the patient and another copy will be placed in the 
medical record.   
 
Procedures  
Consent: A member of the study team will approach eligible patients.  The consent form will be 
described in plain language.  The p atient will be given a hard copy of the consent form for their 
reference.  Written informed consent will be obtained.  Judgements about capacity to provide 
informed consent will be made by the physicians caring for the patient and the person obtaining 
informed consent.  All patients with acute ischemic stroke received detailed neurologic 
assessments, including assessments of cognition, language function, neglect/anosognosia, and 
other domains of neurologic function.  Additionally, during the consent process  the subject will 
be asked open -ended questions about the study such as: “Would you explain to me what you 
think we are asking you to do?” and “what are the possible benefits and risks to you of 
participating in this study?”  If either the clinical team fe els that the patient cannot provide 
informed consent, or the patient’s responses to these open -ended questions fail to demonstrate 
sufficient comprehension to provide informed consent, in the judgment of the investigator, the 
patient will be excluded from participation.  The subject will have the ability to withdraw consent 
at any time.  
 
Study Procedures:  
 
Baseline  
After consent is obtained, the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9)15 will be admin istered to 
the subject .  This is a simple, 9 -item survey which has been validated to identify depression 
after stroke.  Patients who score between 5 -19 inclusive will be enrolled in the study.  Subjects 
who score 0 -4 or 20+ will receive education  about post -stroke mood disorders and local 
psychiatry/psychology resources, including the contact information for regional crisis centers, 
but will not be enrolled.  Subjects who screen 20+ will have their attending physician notified so 
that appropriate referrals or treatments can be initiated by the clinical team.   
 
For patients who are enrolled, basic demographic and clinical information will be collected 
including: age, sex, race/ethnicity, past medical history (including history of hypertension, 
hype rlipidemia, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, prior history of TIA/Stroke, 
prior history of anxiety, depression, or PTSD, other medical history), educational attainment, 
insurance status, marital status, number of people living in the home, medication history 
(current/prior use of an antidepressant medication), current/prior participation in psychotherapy 
or counseling for mental health problems, tobacco history (current smoker, former smoker, 
never smoker), alcohol use history (current alcoh ol use yes/no and if yes, number of drinks per 
week), stroke location, stroke mechanism (large vessel atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, 
cardioembolism, other, cryptogenic), discharge disposition (home, acute rehab).   
 
Additional assessments will incl ude the NIHSS, a structured neurologic examination used to 
quantify neurologic deficits,16, 17, modified Rankin Scale ,18 the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 
(PHQ -9) to assess mood,15 and the abbre viated Duke Social Support Index .19  We will also ask 
the subject  a series of questions regarding availability of internet and mobile device usage , 
including how they  interact with the internet and frequency of internet use (See attached 
appendix) .   
 
After baseline data collection, the subjects will be enrolled in Joyable’s iCBT program.  For 
subjects who would like to participate in the program using their smartphone, the CBT 
application will be installed on their device and they will be encouraged to  complete the initial 
 
Protocol V 43 13DEC 27JULY 2018 evaluation and activities at the time of enrollment.  Subjects without their own devicewill be 
enrolled via a study specific tablet using the web -interface.  Subjects will be given their login 
information and information on how to acc ess the program via the internet and install the 
program on their mobile device.  Subjects will be asked to complete the initial evaluation and 
CBT activities at the time of enrollment.   
 
Joyable is a commercially available 8 -week program that consists of  5-6 online activities per 
week, for a total of 42 activities.  Most activities can be completed within approximately 5 -10 
minutes.  Activities cover the core elements of CBT: psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, 
and behavioral activation. In addition  to the digital program,  as a part of the Joyable product,  all 
participants will be assigned a coach.  The role of the coach is to provide accountability, 
motivation, emotional support, and guidance, leading clients to get the most out of the iCBT 
program.  They provide this support through a combination of phone, text, and email interactions 
determined by the client.  Joyable coaching is defined by 3 pillars: Motivational Interviewing 
(MI), Program Knowledge, and Client Experience.   All coaches are trained to competency in MI, 
an evidence -based method for structuring conversations to harness a person’s intrinsic 
motivation to change.   MI has been shown to increase engagement and improve client 
outcomes.   Coaches attend a rigorous 1 -month training course, biw eekly booster sessions, and 
submit tapes of client communications until they reach competency.   In addition to MI, coaches 
are trained in the iCBT program and how to support clients with obstacles that may arise and 
effectively deliver program knowledge to  drive client success.   At the time of study enrollment, 
we will assist the subject in scheduling their first contact with their assigned coach.   
 
 
72 Hour Telephone Encounter  
Subjects will be contacted  by the study team  in person or by telephone 72+/ - 24 hours after 
enrollment to troubleshoot any technical difficulties accessing the Joyable program.  
 
30 Day Telephone Encounter  
Subjects will be contacted by  the study team  phone or in person at 30 days +/ -7 days after 
enrollment to assess technical difficu lties using the Joyable program, functional status using the 
modified Rankin scale, and quality of life using the Euroqol EQ -5D.   
 
90 Day In -person Visit  
Subjects will be seen  by the study team  90 days +/ - 14 days after enrollment to assess their 
neurologic function using the NIHSS, mood using the PHQ -9, functional status using t he 
modified Rankin Scale, Quality of life using the Euroqol EQ -5D,20, 21 healthcare utilization  using 
the Stanford Health Utilization survey ,22 whether any other treatment for mental health problems  
was received  (including medication and psychotherapy) and perceived utility of Joyable  iCBT for 
depression  as well as perceived barriers to successful use of internet -based CBT .

Analysis Plan  
 
The baseline demographic variables of the study population will be summarized using means, 
medians, and proportions as appropria te.  For each subject, we will calculate the total amount of 
time spent interacting with the Joyable program and the total number of Joyable activities that 
the patient successfully completed.  We will then calculate averages across the study 
population.  These metrics will provide important information on the average “dose” of CBT 
received.  In an exploratory analysis we will look for relationships between baseline clinical and 
demographic factors and number of activities completed.  
 
We will calculate the average PHQ -9 score at enrollment and 90 days. We will compare the 
PHQ -9 score from enrollment to day 90.  The statistical power of this test is uncertain.  In Table 
2 we present estimated study power (with α=0.05) across a range of a ssumptions about both 
the change in PHQ -9 over time and the standard deviation of the difference in PHQ -9 over time.  
These calculations show that although this is a small pilot study, we have >80% power to detect 
a difference in PHQ -9 of 3 or more points across a range of assumptions. The PHQ -9 will also 
be administered to subjects weekly via through the Joyable program. We will examine whether 
there are significant changes in score over time using repeated measures analysis (generalized 
estimating equatio ns, GEE) with PHQ -9 score as the dependent variable and week as the 
independent variable.  
 
In an exploratory analysis, we will divide patients into two groups based on PHQ -9 at study 
completion ( high depression symptoms , defined as median or above and low depression 
 
Protocol V 43 13DEC 27JULY 2018 symptoms , defined as below the median score).  Healthcare outcomes, including modified 
Rankin scale, health related quality of life, and healthcare utilization will be compared across 
groups. We hypothesize that patients with high depression sym ptoms will have worse functional 
outcome, lower quality of life, and higher healthcare utilization.  We will also divide patients into 
groups based on their participation in the Joyable program and compare outcomes (e.g., PHQ -9 
score, quality of life, heal th utilization) between subjects who showed high engagement in the 
program and those who showed low engagement.

Data Confidentiality  
Internet -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.  Paper -based records will be kept in a locked, secure 
location and only accessible to study personnel.  Prior to access to any study -related 
information, personnel will be required to sign statements agreeing to protect the security and 
confidentiality of identifiable information. Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from 
study -related information.   
 
No clinical information obtained by the research team will be se nt to Joyable.  De-identified data 
from Joyable will be sent to the research team, which will include the number of Joyable 
activities completed by the subject, the number coaching interactions, and results of Joyable 
administered PHQ -9 and satisfaction as sessments.  This data will be organized by subject 
identification number, which can be used to link to the data collected by the research team.  The 
research team will maintain a password protected file on a secured computer at the University 
of Pennsylvan ia which will link subject identification number to identifying information for each 
subject (name, medical record number, date of birth).  Access to this file at the University of 
Pennsylvania will be limited to the PI and the study research coordinator.  A Microsoft Excel 
document will be created which will include subject name, date of birth, and study identifier.  
This document will be uploaded to Penn+Box.  The study team at Joyable will be given access 
to the file via Penn+Box.  They will use this inf ormation to link the Joyable data elements 
described above to each subject.  Joyable will then upload a Microsoft Excel file containing this 
data and subject identifier to the study Penn+Box, where it will be downloaded by the research 
team.       
 
Patients who enroll in the study will all participating in Joyable’s iCBT Program for Depression.  
During enrollment in the study, patients will create an account with Joyable.  As a part of this 
process, subjects register with Joyable using the same proce ss as they currently use for their 
commercially available program.  Registration requires the subject to submit the following PHI: 
name, date of birth, gender, and email address .  Access to PHI will be limited to those who need 
it.  This may include the in dividual coach who is assigned to each subject, coach managers who 
have access to subject data for the coaches that report to them, Joyable’s analytic team which

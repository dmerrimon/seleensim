8 1. Introduction  
1.1 Study Overview  
The Communication and Education in Tumor Profiling (COMET) study consists of 
two major components, divided into two steps, each occurring by itself or 
sequentially. Only a subset of participants and select sites will participate in the 
Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy.  
1. Primary Intervention Study – Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) of Web -based 
Pre-disclosure  Genetic Education  v. Usual Care (Step 1)  
A randomized substudy of pre-disclosure  genetic education v. usual care in 
tumor pr ofiling for advanced cancer  
2. Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy - Genetic Counseling for Incidental 
Germline Findings  (Step 2)  
A pilot substudy of remote genetic counseling for participants with potential  
germline mutations identified on tumor profiling  
1.2 Hypotheses  
1. The provision of web -based genetic education prior to receipt of tumor 
profiling results will be associated with greater increases in genetic 
knowledge and less increase in distress  (Primary  Intervention Study : RCT ) 
2. Participant  factors , suggested by the Self-Regulation Theory of Health 
Behavior (SRTHB; e.g. test result, sociodemographic factors, health literacy,  
baseline knowledge or distress) will identify subgroups of patients wh o benefit 
more or less from the intervention (web -based pre-disclosure  genetic 
education).  (Primary Intervention Study: RCT)  
3. The majority of participants with potential  incidental germline mutations 
identified through tumor profiling will be willing to participate in: a) remote 
genetic counseling  and b) genetic testing for potential  germline mutations . 
(Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy)  
4. The uptake of remote counseling and testing among advanced cancer 
patients with potential  germline incidental findings will be associated with 
patient factors (e.g. distress, uncertainty, family history, etc .) predicted by the  
Self-Regulation Theory of Health Behavior  (SRTHB ).  Additionally, we 
hypothesize that remote pre - and post -test counseling with a genetic 
counselor will be associated with increases in knowledge, decreases in 
uncertainty and distress and increases in communication to at -risk relatives.  
(Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy)  
1.3 Background  
1.3.1  Primary Intervention  Study  (RCT) : 
How and when to best communicate limitations of tumor profiling and 
the potential for incidental findings is unknown.  Cancer has long been 
recognized as a genetic  disease, driven and sustained by the 
accumulation of alterations in genes that code key signaling 
pathways41-43. With the advent of next -generation sequencing (NGS), 
in which multiple genes, even the entire genome, can be sequenced 
rapidly and at relatively accessible costs, we have entered an era of 
precision cancer care3,43,44. We can now readi ly identify numerous Rev. 2/17 
Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
9 acquired genetic  aberrations in tumors, which can be used to identify 
targeted therapies with the hopes of improving patient outcomes44. 
The implementation of NGS in cancer care has raised a range of 
practical, ethical, and legal challenges for patients, providers, and the 
health care system as a whole1,2.  As we move from “discrete” tests 
(e.g., single -gene or single -marker tests) to “bundled” (targeted 
sequencing of a panel of cancer genes) or “broad” tests (e.g., whole -
exome or whole -genome sequencing), there is an increasing 
possibility of increasing confusion, distress or disappointment given 
the limitations of our current knowledge13,46. Equally important, tumor 
profiling has the potential to identify incidental germline findings2,3,4. In 
small qualitative studies, patients have reported confusion between 
somatic and germline testing and 71% reported potential psychosocial 
risks including unwanted information, germline implications for 
relatives and the potential for loss of hope with no actionable or 
targeted mutations based on testing13.  Additionally, many patients 
have high expectations of benefit with tumor profiling and some 
experience disappointment if there are no actionable mutations are 
identified14. Additionally, while many patients report interest in 
incidental germline findings, some patients identify this as an 
additional burden, given a diagnosis of advanced cancer14. These 
studies highlight the potential risks and limitations associated with 
clinical implementation of tumor profiling in advanced cancer patients 
and the need to further understand patient outcomes and delivery 
models to enhance the benefits and minimize the risks of tumor 
profiling in cancer care4. 
Pre-disclosure (i.e. prior to the disclosure of test results to patients) 
genetic education has the potential to improve understanding, 
minimize negative responses to receipt of tumor molecular profile 
results and identification of incidental germline findings.  How to best 
address these clinical challenges to benefit patients and their families 
remains unknown. The traditional approach to informed consent for 
germline genetic testing has been to share the risks, benefits and 
limitations of testing with patients prior to testing and to honor their 
preferences for receipt genetic information*. Recent guidelines from 
the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues and 
the American College of Medical Genetics suggest that the potential 
to identify incidental findings with tumor profiling be shared with 
patients in advance of testing so that they can consider and share 
their preferences for receipt of incidental germline information1,7. Yet, 
how to achieve this remains unknown, and there is pressing need for 
empiric studies to evaluate communication and delivery strategies1,4. 
Traditional provider -mediated genetic counseling is not feasible for 
every patient undergoing tumor profiling for therapeutic intent. Thus, if 
pre-disclosure education is required, alternative scalable models for 
provision of education and assessment of preferences will be needed 
as tumor profiling is widely adopted for the care of cancer patients.  
In some settings the frequency of incidental findings may be relatively 
low4. For example, in the setting of tumor only sequencing (i.e. rather 
than paired tumor and germline platforms) a potential germline finding 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
10 may be identified but secondary germline confirmation would be 
necessary.  This provides a second opportunity to assess patient 
preferences for germline findings. In this proposal, we hypothesize 
that pre -disclosure genetic education in this setting will improve 
understanding of germline implications and other risks, benefits and 
limitations of tumor profiling and reduce distress and uncertainty. 
Nonetheless, it remains possible that providing extensive genetic 
education and counseling at pre -disclosure may be overwhelming or 
lack salience for patients, and could even be associated with greater 
confusion and potential distress. Thus, we propose a randomized 
study to evaluate the relative advantages of on -line pre -disclosure 
education compared to usual care in order to address the pressing 
need for empirical studies to evaluate how to best communicate and 
deliver cancer genetic education and counseling in the setting of 
tumor profiling.  
1.3.2  Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy : 
How to best address incidental germline findings in the setting of 
clinical tumor profiling remains unknown.  The implementation of NGS 
in cancer care has raised a range of practical, ethical, and legal 
challenges for patients, providers, and the health care system as a 
whole1,2.  One of the most pressing challenges in the field is how to 
address incidental or secondary germline findings identified in 
advanced cancer patients undergoing tumor profiling for therapeutic 
intent2-4. Studies have shown that patients undergoing sequencing for 
therapeutic intent differ in their preferences for secondary germline 
information5,6. Obligations to intentionally interrogate germline data to 
return incidental findings in potential  clinically important germline 
mutations  (e.g. germline mutations with established clinical utility)  
remain uncertain. In recent clinical guidelines, the ACMG argued that 
laboratories intentionally seek and report  clinically important  germline 
findings in a list of detected gene  mutation results7. Such an obligation 
to seek  clinically important  germline findings in the setting of tumor 
profiling has been debated, but there is a growing consensus that 
patients (in research and clinical settings) should be informed about 
the potential for incidental or secondary germline findings and that 
their preferences for these should be honored1,8-10. Yet, how to 
accomplish this in clinical patient care, and particularly in the setting of 
advanced cancer patients undergoing tumor profiling to inform 
therapeutic decisions remains unknown. Many have highlighted that 
additional research to evaluate outcomes and delivery models 
designed to honor preferences is crucial to this ongoing debate and 
the implementation of tumor profiling1,8,11. 
While the potential for germline findings has been greatly debated, 
many practicing clinicians are utilizing tumor profiling but report 
variable confidence in their genetic knowledge12. Additionally, there is 
variability in how clinicians describe tumor profiling and how frequently 
they discuss potential germline implications is unknown4,12. In small 
qualitative studies, patients have reported confusion between somatic 
and germline testing and 71% reported potential psychosocial risks 
including unwanted inf ormation, germline implications for relatives and Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
11 the potential for loss of hope with negative tumor profiling13.  
Additionally, while many patients report interest in incidental germline 
findings, some patients identify this as an additional burden, given a 
diagnosis of advanced cancer14. These studies highlight the need to 
both develop clinical care models which assist practicing physicians to 
facilitate identification of patients who may be candidates for further 
germline testing and to further evaluate how to best honor patient 
preferences for incidental or secondary germline information and the 
outcomes of identifying incidental germline findings among patients 
undergoing tumor for sequencing for therapeutic intent.  
In light of the clear gap in knowledge concerning the risks for returning 
potential germline findings, any effort to provide this kind of 
information to patients should only be undertaken by an experienced 
team of genetic providers. Our team has experience with remote 
cancer genetic counseling with community sites in a NCI funded 
feasibility study (R21 CA164121: Bradbury, Bradbury et al. Utilizing 
remote real -time videoconferencing to expand access to cancer 
genetic services in community pr actices, JMIR, in press, 2015), and 
additional community sites in an ongoing randomized study of remote 
counseling v. usual care for cancer genetic testing (funded through 
the Basser Center for BRCA1/2 Research). These studies include 
both patients without cancer and patients with advanced cancer, 
specifically patients with metastatic breast cancer. Thus, the PENN 
telegenetic counselors have clinical experience counseling patients 
with advanced cancer at community sites and are sensitive to the 
unique issues facing patients with advanced cancer undergoing tumor 
profiling. Further, counseling patients with potential germline findings 
is within the scope of cancer genetic counseling practice.  
Additionally, the cancer genetics team at PENN has experience with 
cancer genetic counseling for patients with potential germline findings 
in tumor profiling both through COMET pilot work in metastatic breast 
cancer patients and other clinical tumor profiling, The PENN cancer 
genetics team and weekly case conference will be an additional 
resource for the genetic counselors participating in the COMET  
remote counseling substudy.  
1.4 Summary and Rationale for the Study  
The study has  been designed to address the need for empirical studies to 
evaluate how to best communicate and deliver cancer genetic education and 
counseling in the se tting of tumor profiling.  
1.4.1  Primary Intervention Study  - RCT of Web -based Pre-disclosure  
Genetic Education v. Usual Care  for Patients Undergoing Tumor 
Profiling for Cancer Treatment  (Step 1):  
The proposed randomized study will evaluate the utility of a scalable 
web-based pre-disclosure  genetic education compared to the current 
usual care communication prior to receipt of tumor profile results . If 
this pre-disclosure  education model successfully improves cognitive 
and affective responses to tumor profiling, it has the potential to be 
widely implemented in clinical care to benefit advanced cancer 
patients and their families. Given that COMET  will recruit cancer Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
12 patients with a wide spectrum of tumor types and in both academic 
and non -academic centers, the web -based intervention and findings 
are expected to be broadly applicable to the advanced cancer 
population.  
Additionally, secondary analyses evaluating groups that benefit more 
and less from the intervention will provide crucial data to enhance the 
intervention for future use in clinical practice. Even if the study finds 
no difference between intervention groups, these secondary analyses 
are likely to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit more from 
the intervention, or alternative modifications or interventions to 
maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with 
widespread clinical adoption of tumor profiling in cancer care. Thus, 
we expect this work to be highly relevant to clinical practice.  
1.4.2  Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy - Genetic Counseling for 
Incidental Germline Findings  (Step 2):  
The proposed genetic counseling substudy will evaluate the feasibility 
and preliminary outcomes of remote genetic provider mediated 
counseling for the subset of patients with potential germline mutations 
incidentally identified through molecular tumor profiling.  If successful, 
this substudy will provide key preliminary data to support further 
research evaluating delivery models for potential incidental germline 
findings. While this may include remote counseling to provide access 
to genetic counselors for the subset of patients with incidental 
germline findings where additional germline testing is indicated, given 
a limited genetic counselor workforce and the anticipated broad 
application and use of tumor profiling in cancer care, alternative 
scalable models will need to be evaluated. These could include web -
based delivery that could be combined with provider mediated 
counseling in select cases.  
The proposed substudy seeks to evaluate patient preferences for, and 
outcomes of genetic counseling and testing in the setting of the 
identification of potential incidental germline findings, which are key 
first steps to developing scalable delivery models for the future. In 
related work and the proposed COMET randomized study of pre -
disclosure  genetic education , we have experience adapting provider 
mediated counseling and education to on -line patient -mediated 
delivery, providing expertise for th e proposed subsequent research.  
As an example, in the ongoing RESPECT study (R01 -
CA190871:Bradbury/Patrick -Miller), we have adapted provider -
mediated tiered -binned pre -disclosure  counseling for return of 
individual research results to an on -line genetic education followed by 
remote counseling with a genetic counselor at the time of result 
disclosure to address patient burdens associated with in -person visits. 
The ongoing multi -site RESPECT study will evaluate the outcomes of 
receipt of individual germline research results with this altern ative 
delivery model. Thus, this genetic counseling substudy and the 
anticipated subsequent work are expected to contribute significantly to 
the ongoing debate over how to best communicate and deliver genetic 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152

13 information with the delivery of tumor profiling in cancer care and how 
to honor patient preferences for incidental germline information.  
1.5 Current Supporting Data  
1.5.1  Primary Intervention Study - RCT of Web -based Pre-disclosure  
Genetic Education v. Usual Care  (Step 1) : 
To address the need for empirical studies to evaluate how to best 
communicate and deliver cancer genetic education and counseling in 
the setting of tumor profiling, we have been conducting a pilot study of 
pre-disclosure genetic education delivered by a health educator 
among breast cancer patients undergoing tumor profiling on a related 
clinical trial (COMET Pilot Study). This genetic education is designed 
to educate patients regarding the benefits, risks and limitations of 
tumor profiling for cancer treatment, including the potential for 
incidental germline findings, which would need to be confirmed 
through additional germline genetic testing. In related studies 
evaluating germline multiplex testing for cancer susceptibility (R01 
CA160847:Bradbury; R01 -CA190871:Bradbury/Patrick -Miller), we 
have developed a novel tiered binned approach to genetic counseling 
and informed consent to address the increasing complexity of genetic 
testing in the era of multiplex and whole genome sequencing15,44,46. 
We have adapted the tiered binned approach for genetic education in 
the setting of tumor profiling for advanced breast cancer given the 
complexity of information and the need for efficient education in the 
setting of patients undergoing active treatment and testing for 
treatment decisions.  
The goals of the COMET pilot study are:  
1. To obtain patient feedback and conduct audiotape review of 
session to inform modifications to our  tiered binned genetic 
education for tumor profiling and  
2. To obtain preliminary outcome data to inform future studies 
evaluating outcomes of genetic education and counseling delivery 
models in the setting of tumor profiling.  
While the original education was delivered via a health educator, this 
approach was chosen to maximize patient feedback regarding key 
elements and content. We had originally envisioned that it could be 
adapted for delivery by alternative modalities (e.g. print, web), if 
acceptable to patients. As an example, in the ongoing RESPECT 
study (R01 -CA190871:Bradbury/Patrick -Miller), we have adapted 
provider -mediated tiered -binned pre -disclosure counseling for return 
of individual research results to an on -line genetic education followed 
by remote counseling with a genetic counselor at the time of result 
disclosure to address patient burdens associated with in -person visits. 
The ongoing multi -site RESPECT study will evaluate the outcomes of 
receipt of individual germline research results with this alternative 
delivery model.  
To date, 25 breast cancer patients have enrolled in the COMET pilot 
study. 20 have completed genetic education and post -education 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
14 surveys. 14 have received results and have completed post -
disclosure surveys.  
Key preliminary findings relevant to this proposal include:  
1. Many patients reported a limited understanding of the difference 
between germline and somatic genetics and the limitations of 
tumor profiling (e.g. the potential for no drug gable targets).  
2. Participants reported greater interest in web -based administration 
as an alternative to provider -mediated counseling than print 
materials. Patients reported advantages to web -based education 
included convenience, the ability to revisit information, faster 
access and the individual ability to select information to view. 
Many reported no disadvantages to a web -based alternative, while 
some identified losing the personal interaction, getting confused or 
not knowing what to view on a website.  
3. Preliminary data suggests pre -disclosure genetic education may 
be associated with increases in knowledge and decreases in 
depression and general and state anxiety from baseline to post -
disclosure.  
In this pilot , there was no comparison arm, so changes in these 
outcomes need to be evaluated in a randomized study.  
1.5.2  Seconda ry Genetic Counseling Substudy - Genetic Counseling f or 
Incidental Germline Findings  (Step 2) : 
In four NIH and foundation funded studies, we have been evaluating 
telephone and real -time videoconferencing counseling as alternative 
delivery models to increase the efficiency and improve access to 
genetic providers (R01 CA160847:Bradbury; R21 -CA-
164121:Bradbury) and for return of individual genetic research results 
(R01 -CA190871:Bradbury/Patrick -Miller Conquer Cancer Foundation 
Advanced Clinical Research Award: Bradbury). These studies have 
established that remote counseling is a feasible alternative for further 
evaluation15-17. Benefits include expanded patient access to services 
and centralized provider expertise, particularly in the setting of a 
limited genetic counselor workforce. Communication protocols utilized 
in these ongoing studies will be adapted for use in the proposed 
genetic counseling substudy.  
As described above, in our related studies utilizing telephone and 
videoconferencing to provide more efficient and accessible genetic 
services, particularly in populations where genetic providers are not 
available, we have found remote counseling to be feasible, acceptable 
to patient and providers and associated with increases in genetic 
knowledge and comparable affective outcomes to in -person 
counseling.  Two recent randomized studies evaluating germline 
testing for BRCA1/2  have reported similar findings39,40. Given related 
ongoing research and clinical activities in telegenetics, our genetic 
counselors are already licensed in several states with plan for 
licensure across over 20 states (Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative 
APOE4 Trial. 1UF1AG046150 -01: Reiman. A randomized substudy of 
telephone versus videoconferencing disclosure of APOE genotype ).

implementation of this substudy.

of this site.  
The ECOG -ACRIN Outcomes and Economics Assessment 
Unit can be contacted for Patient Reported Outcome 
Questions via email at comet -help@stat.brown.edu . An 
EASEE -PRO instructional guide for both sites and patients 
can be found on both the E -A and CTSU websites.  
Please see below for additional details on the EASEE -PRO 
system.  
1) A secure environment for control of user records, 
information, and transactions (SECURIT): Provides a 
secure – limited access point for entering data into the 
restricted secure PII Database, for management of 
user data, creating user accounts, and reporting. The 
SECURIT web management interface requires the 
secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) to ensure 
encryption of transmitted data.  
a) PII database: is a dedicated secure limited access 
database, used to store protected PII.  
i) Secure: All communications to the PII database 
through SECURIT are encrypted. The database 
resides behind a firewall and cannot be reach 
from outside the OEAU.  
ii) Limited access: this database is restricted not 
only by username and password but is also 
restricted to specified internal OEAU computers 
by IP address, so that only authorized users 
logging in at the OEAU from pre -specified 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
27 computers may access/enter PII.  At no time is 
outside access allowed to this database . 
iii) Protected restricted PII (e .g. SSN) are 
encrypte d at the time of data entry and  double 
data entered for verification.  All users 
regardless of their security level are blinded to 
this protected data, and it cannot be decrypted 
without the encryption key, housed in a safe, in 
a loc ation separate from the OEAU. This type of 
data is generally collected for long term follow -
up where it may be needed to be decrypted for 
select patients in order to search registries like 
the national death index to determine survival 
status of lost part icipants. In these instances, 
with appropriate approvals, the Database 
Administrator will decrypt this data in 
accordance with the approved retrieval 
specification.  
b) User records: This functionality allows OEAU 
personnel, using specific computers within the 
OEAU, to create user records, enter user 
information into the PII database, and establish 
user web accounts in the separate user database. 
Allows the management of users and their data, 
including the ability to update a participant’s  
preferred contact method, address , and 
participation status (e .g. no longer wishes to be 
contacted with respect to the PRO component of 
the study).  
c) Information: This functionality allows the OEAU to 
record all participant contact, document any 
changes to the participant, and make any important 
notes related to the participant.  
d) Transactions: SECURIT provides a reporting and 
monitoring interface to the PRO database, which is 
used to store non -PII patient reported survey 
responses.  
i) Allows OEAU to monitor per patient form 
completion status using th e tracking 
management facility.  This facility reports on 
what data is currently expected from 
participants, CRAs, and the OEAU interviewers.  
ii) Aggregate reporting: this series of reports 
allows the OEAU to monitor the distribution of 
patients over data completion methods and 
form completion methods (both overall and by 
site).  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
28 2) Database utility and control environment  (PRO -DUCE ):  
This utility interfaces with the main clinical database 
containing CRF/trigger data (Medidata RAVE), 
monitors the clinical database for events 
(eg., participant registrations, scheduled procedures, 
and other triggers) and establishes event scheduling.  
The system sets up e -mail reminders to CRAs, 
participants  [and SMS text message reminders, when 
applicable to the study], and OEAU personnel to 
ensure timely completion of surveys.  
3) Web entry systems  (PROWESs): a Web site where 
participants complete online surveys  
a) PROWESs provides a front facing web portal for 
participants to complete questionnaires and have 
those results stored in the PRO database.  
b) Secure site using HTTPS and requiring a username 
and password login.  
c) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; 
including approx. time for completion, number of 
questions to be completed in this session, any 
important information regarding this survey 
(including help and contact information)  
d) PROWESs is a one -way interface, data cannot be 
returned from the PRO -DB to the user.  
4) Valet  Interface and data entry system  (PROVIDES).  
a) The PROVIDES system is a web interface that 
allows site CRAs to act as a valet and enter a 
participant’s responses to a survey into the PRO 
database should the survey be completed on 
paper. This allows Site CRAs to enter forms 
completed by the patient on site.  
b) Secure site using HTTPS and requiring a username 
and password login.  
c) Which forms can be entered is restricted by 
username, site affiliation, and role, thus Sites RAs 
can only enter surveys predesignated as on -site 
data collection surveys a nd only for their own 
patients.  
d) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; is 
requested to select the protocol, case number, 
timepoint and verify the case Id by providing the 
participant birthdate.  
e) PROVIDES is a one -way interface, data cannot be 
returned from the PRO -DB to the user.

4.3 Instructions for Patients  who Do Not Complete Baseline Survey and/or Do Not 
Start Assigned Study Intervention  
If a patient is randomized in the Primary Intervention Study ( Step 1 ) but the 
baseline survey  (T0) is not completed , patient is considered off study and no 
additional data will be requested and patients will not be available to register to 
the Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy (Step 2).  
Patients registered to Step 1 and further registered to Step 2, but who do not 
proceed with the genetic counseling, are to complete the requirements for Step 
1. Specifically, Step 1 follow -up data will still be collected and must be submitted 
through Medidata Rave and the EASEE -PRO System  according to the schedule 
in the EAQ152  Forms Completion Guidelines . 
For Step 2 participants, if the patient does not complete the baseline survey 
(T0SS) for Step 2, patient is considered off the substudy and no additional data 
will be requested for Step 2.  Rev. 2/17 Rev. 7/17

32 5. Methodology  
5.1 Randomization  
5.1.1  Primary Intervention Study - RCT of Web -based P re-disclosure  
Genetic Education v. Usual Care  (Step 1) : 
We will use a permuted block design for the randomization scheme. 
We will have 1:1 randomization between arms.  
5.1.2  Secondary Genetic Counseling Substudy - Genetic Counseling for 
Incidental Germline Findings (Step 2) : 
Single arm pilot study  (no randomization)  
5.2 Interventions  
5.2.1  Primary Intervention  Study  (RCT)  (Step 1) : 
As shown in the study schema, participants will be randomly assigned 
to web -based genetic education or a control group receiving usual 
care.  
• Genetic education website ( Arm A – intervention  group ): 
Upon complet ion of the baseline survey, Arm A participants will 
receive an access code to enter and complete the online 
education module. Adapted for COMET  participants from the 
COMET pilot study materials, the module is designed to provide 
information on what can be learned through tumor testing, 
including the differences between genetic tumor changes and 
potential germline findings, and next steps including confirmation 
testing should a germline mutation be suspected. The module, 
which will be content and usability tested with patients of varied 
background and cancer diagnosis, features simple text, graphic, 
and video components.  
Arm A participants will be offered access to the web -based 
genetic education module at the study site following completion of 
the baseline survey, and will be able to revisit the site using any 
computer with web access, including a smart phone . 
• Usual care ( Arm B - control group):  
Participants in the usual care arm will not initially have access to 
the web -based genetic education. Rather their education will be 
consistent with usual care including conversations with the 
treating physicians, interaction with and information from clinical 
and/or MATCH research staff and any additional information they 
seek out through usual resources. This is intended as a “real 
world” comparison group. All usual care arm participants will be 
provided access to on -line genetic web education three months 
after receiving their tumor genetic testing results. These patients 
will be e -mailed a link to the website and a code to access the 
materials, which are viewable on any web -enabled device.  Rev. 2/17 
Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
33 • Both Arms (A & B) : 
Patients on both Arms A and B will be asked to complete a total of 
four surveys electronically  (see Section 0). A baseline survey (T0) 
will be administered immediately following registration to COMET.  
A second survey (T1) will be administered following the 
intervention/usual care. An electronic link to the T1 survey will be 
emailed to all patients at 7 days following completion of the 
baseline survey (T0). A third survey (T2) will be sent to all patients 
within three days following their receipt o f their tumor profile 
results. An electronic link to a fourth survey (T3) will be emailed to 
all patients three months following receipt of tumor profile results.  
All patients will receive periodic email reminders to complete 
surveys.  
We will coordinate COMET study activities closely with MATCH or 
other tumor profile procedures to ensure that surveys do not alter 
the treatment schedule. If participants have not completed 
surveys, this will not prevent next steps in their care or other tumor 
profile  activities.  
We will test surveys and assess burden and completion rates. If 
there is evidence of burden, we will revisit length and prioritize 
outcomes and constructs of interest.  
5.2.2  Secondary  Genetic Counseling Substudy  (Step 2  – Arm D  and Arm 
E): 
As shown in the study schema, all participants who meet inclusion 
criteria and criteria for a potential germline mutation identified with 
molecular tumor profiling at a participating substudy site will be 
offered the study  (up to accrual of 100 patients) . 
• Genetic Counseling:  
Patients who meet criteria for the remote counseling substudy will 
complete remote counseling visits and surveys as outlined in the 
study schema. Visit 1 will be standard pre -test counseling; if 
patients agree to confirmatory germline testing, Visit 2 will consist 
of result disclosure and review of implications for relatives, 
consistent with clinical standards in the field. Genetic counselors 
will be licensed to practice (if necessary) in the states where sites 
reside consistent with state laws.  Similar to our other remote 
counseling studies, standardized counseling checklists will be 
utilized by genetic counselors to ensure fidelity to the 
communication protocols15,17,18. All sessions will be audiotaped to 
evaluate fidelity and to inform potential future modifications for 
alternative delivery models. Genetic counselors will collaborate 
with the patient’s treating physician as they will be the ordering 
provider. Thus, test results and recommendations will be 
communicated to the patient’s treating physician and genetic 
counselors will collaborate with the treating physician as needed. 
Implications of germline findings for relatives will be 
communicated to patients, including how relatives can obtain 
clinical genetic testing.  Rev. 2/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
34 There will be no genetic counselors providing counseling services 
in the primary randomized study. A large number of genetic 
counselors from the PENN cancer genetics team will be involved 
in development of the web -based genetic education.  
For the sub -study, we will utilize genetic counselors from the 
PENN cancer genetics team, as this pool of counselors has 
cultivated extensive experience in conducting genetic counseling 
with advanced cancer patients in the context of tumor profiling.  
• Germline Genetic Testing:  
All confirmatory germline testing will be completed through a 
commercial CLIA -approved lab. The genetic counselor will provide 
recommendations for testing and the treating physician will be the 
ordering provider for clinical germline testing. The genetic 
counselor will disclose the genetic test results to patients  during 
Visit 2  and will collaborate with the treating physician to provide 
recomm endations for testing relatives .  
• In summary, the Step 2 procedures for both Arm D and Arm E 
(per Section 6.2) will include the completion of up to 4 surveys and 
the associated interventions, as listed below:  
• All Step 2 participants will complete:  
• a baseline survey (T0SS)  
• a visit with a genetic counselor for germline mutation 
counseling (GC Visit 1)  
• a post GC Visit 1 survey (T1SS)  
• Additionally, if a participant agrees to confirmatory testing, this 
individual will also have:  
• a second visit (GC Visit 2) with a genetic counselor  
• a post GC Visit 2 survey (T2SS)  
• and a 3 month survey (T3SS)  
• For Arm D patients (i.e., those from Step 1 Arm A or Arm B), 
information taken from T2 (see Sec. 6.1) will be used to pre -
populate T0SS, and only the remaining items in T0SS will 
need to be completed.  
• Participants with email access will be directed to complete 
surveys online. Those without email access may complete 
paper surveys instead.  
5.2.3  Alternative pathway to Substudy (Step 1 - Arm C, then Step 2 – Arm 
E): 
In an effort to reduce the length of time to recruitment and completion 
of the substudy, we have included an alternative pathway for entry 
therein.  
• As indicated in the study schema, following enrollment in 
screening for MATCH, a subgroup of patients who receive their 
tumor molecular profile results (report of any actionable mutations) 
from their treating physician, and who meet criteria for potential 
actionable germlne mutation (AIM 2), will be consented to the Rev. 2/17 Rev. 7/17 
Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
35 COMET substudy. These individuals will not be required to 
complete the main study (Step 1  - Arm A or B ) to be eligible for 
the substudy (Step 2).  
• Patients who are eligible and consent to participate in the 
substudy, and who were not enrolled on either Arm A or Arm B, 
will be registered to Arm C (Step 1; substudy only). These 
individuals will not participate in or complete any primary study 
(Arm A or B) education or surveys.  
• Arm C participants will immediately be registered to Arm E (Step 
2) and complete all of the Step 2 procedures (per Section 6.2), 
including the completion of up to 4 surveys and the associated 
interventions (see Section 5.2.2  above). For Arm E patients, the 
entire T0SS will be completed as the baseline survey.  
5.3 Patient Recruitment  
All eligible patients will be recruited to Step 1 by MATCH site research staff at the 
time that they enroll in the M ATCH  Master ( Screening ) Protocol  or will be 
undergoing clinical tumor profiling at a select expansion site . 
Potential participants at expansion sites will be approached by site research staff 
after permission of the treating physician.  
At sites participating in the Substudy (Step 2), potential Substudy participants will 
be identified according to the selection criteria (see Section 3.2). MATCH or other 
site research staff will notify potential participants, introduce the study and 
consent interested participants.  
We will collaborate with the ECOG -ACRIN Underserved Populations Recruitment 
and Retention Subcommittee to develop recruitment strategies to facilitate the 
enrollment of a diverse sample of participants. Dr. Edith Mitchell is chair of this 
subcommittee, and she is also involved in an initiative to facilitate minority 
accrual to the MATCH trial (“Impact”) and will contribute her expertise to facilitate 
diverse patient participation for the proposed COMET trial.  
5.4 PRO/QOL Data Collection Process  
Patient completed outcomes:  
Patients will be recruited at the time of registration into the COMET study. At the 
time of registration at the sites, the patient's contact information should be 
collected on the Patient Contact (PC) form by the site CRA for all participants 
who do not have  email/internet access (Note: all RCT Step 1 participants are 
required to have email/internet and thus no PC should be collected for these 
individuals). The completed PC should then be fax it to the OEAU and stored in a 
secure locking file storage location.  Participants with email/internet access will 
be asked to enter this information themselves directly into the OEAU servers 
when they activate their EASEE -PRO account. The contact information is stored 
in a Biostatistics Center (BC) database and IS NOT  linked to the master ECOG -
ACRIN database. The OEAU RA will not have access to the main ECOG -ACRIN 
database that contains screening results.  
Administration of web -based questionnaires will be coordinated by the OEAU. 
Administration of the questionnaires will be triggered based on completion of 
study milestones.  Rev. 2/17 Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
36 Questionnaire completion  
Patients on Step 1, and those with e -mail access on Step 2, will be prompted to 
complete web -based forms via an e -mail. These e -mails will include a link to the 
web site for questionnaire completion. Each participant will be required to log in 
with their unique user ID and password to complete the requested instruments. 
The web site will reference a study -specific e -mail address and a toll -free phone 
number that patients can use to reach the OEAU staff should they have 
questions or need assistance. All participant data will be stored on a secure 
server.  
Because the timings of survey completion in relation to events lie in very narrow 
windows, patients who do not complete the web questionnaires within 3 working 
days of the initial request e -mail will receive additional e -mail reminders. These 
reminder e -mails, like the initial e -mail, will provide a link to the current surveys, 
ask the participant to confirm that they have been able to access the web site, 
and provide both the e -mail address and the toll free help number for support.  
If patients still have not responded within 12 days of the original e -mail, the 
OEAU Research Associate may attempt to telephone the patient and administer 
the questionnaire over the telephone. If questionnaires are telephone -
administered, they will be marked as such in the data base. All surveys, while 
desired within 3 days of the event, will remain available for participants until 
either the surveys are completed or they are off -study.  Since the completion 
date is recorded for all surveys, the study team will be able to make relevant 
determinations for inclusion of this data in specific analyses.  However, after 
telephone follow -up, no additional or extraordinary means will be employed to 
collect overdue/missing questionnaires.  
Only participants on Step 2 without email access may complete paper survey. 
The timing of administration will be the same as the web -based surveys.  
Participants unable to enter their survey responses may designate a “scribe” to 
relay their responses. Participants will be able to indicate whether the survey was 
filled in by the participant or the designated scribe.  
5.5 Study Instruments  
NOTE:  All participants  of the Genetic Counseling substudy  will complete 
surveys as shown in the Study Schema. Surveys will evaluate the 
primary and secondary endpoints informed by our theoretical models 
grounded in the Self Regulation Theory of Health Behavior18 and 
Diffusion of Innovation Theory17. 
The study instruments are as follows:  
5.5.1  Knowledge of Genetic Disease (T0 -T3; T0SS -T3SS ): 
This will be evaluated using an adapted version of the Cancer 
Genetics Knowledge Scale and clin seq knowledge scale 19-21. 
Adaptations  were made for Somatic Testing.  This scale is composed 
of items evaluating the differences between somatic and germline 
testing (3 items); the limitations of somatic testing (7 items), the 
limitations of germline testing (3 items) and relationship between 
tumor testing and clinical trials (1  item).   Rev. 12/17  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
37 5.5.2  Knowledge of Germline (i.e. inherited) G enetic Disease ( T0SS -T3SS ): 
This will be evaluated using an 8 -item scale adapted from the Cancer 
Genetics Kno wledge s cale (Cronbach’s α=0.58 -0.60)21. This scale 
includes  items evaluating mechanism of inheritance (3 item), meaning 
of positive (2 items) and negative results (3 items).  
5.5.3  Health Literacy (T0 and T0SS):  
Health literacy  is asses sed using a 3 -item scale f or identifying patients 
with inadequate or marginal health literacy49. 
5.5.4  Promis (assessments of emotional distress anxiety/emotional distress 
depression) (T0-T3; T0SS -T3SS ): 
Emotional distress anxiety and depression are each assessed with 
the 4 -item short Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS), a system of highly reliable, precise 
measures of patient –reported health status for physical , mental, and 
social well –being50, 51. 
5.5.5  State Anxiety (T0 -T3; T0SS -T3SS ): 
Measured with the 20 -item State Inventory of the State -Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI). The state scale is a sensitive indicator of transient or 
situational changes in anxiety  (see Project 3, Section B.3.d)24-27. 
5.5.6  Cancer  Specific Distress (T0 -T3; T0SS -T3SS ): 
Measured using the Impact of Events Scale (IES)28,29. The 14 item 
IES is compromised of the Intrusion subscale (7 items) and the 
Avoidance subscales (7 items), which can be summed for the Total 
scale. Although the IES was developed to assess stress reactions 
following non -cancer -related traumatic events, it has more recently 
been utilized to assess response to cancer -related stressors, such as 
being at hereditary risk for cancer, which have been conceptualized 
as a continuous, rather than event -specific stressor 25,30,31. Thus, the 
IES has been used in the context of learning of one’s genetic status, 
to assess cancer -specific distress over time 25,26,31 -34.  The IES has 
been validated in individuals experiencing many different kinds of 
stressors 28,29,35.  On the bases of our preliminary studies, we have 
chosen not to use one item that did not have good face validity in our 
population.  Thus, our modified IES will include 14 items (7 Intrusion; 
7 Avoidant).  
5.5.7  Uncertainty  About Genetic Testing  (T0-T3 for tumor; T0SS -T3SS for 
germline ): 
Assessed using a 3 -item scale adapted from the uncertainty subscale 
of the Multi -dimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment Question 
(MICRA)36. This subscale has had high internal consistency in our

38 5.5.8  Perceived Utility of Genetic Testing (T0 -T3 for tumor; T0SS -T3SS for 
germline ): 
This novel construct was developed to evaluate patient perceptions of 
the utilit y of germline and tumor genetic information for various 
aspects of their life and the life of their family members. It is 
comprised of 10 -items and has had high internal consistency in our 
related research (Cronbach’s α=0.90)18. 
5.5.9  Preferences for Germline  (i.e. inherited) Risk  Information and Delivery 
(T2 only):  
We will assess preferences for learning germline information querying 
patients about interest in germline information if additional testing was 
needed and in the hypothetical situation where germline information 
was available as part of somatic testing. We will also assess 
preferences for delivery of germline information assessing provider 
(e.g. with a genetic counselor, medical oncologist) and mode of 
delivery (e.g. phone, videoconference, web -based genetic 
portal).These will be novel items developed specifically for the 
purpose of this study.  
The genetic counselor will make recommendations for testing and will 
work with the local oncologist to facilitate germline confirmation testing 
through a contract with a commercial lab (likely Ambry Genetics 
based on an existing relationships). The local oncologist will be the 
ordering doctor.  
We will use the standardized remote counseling communication 
protocols utilized in related research (COGENT R01  
CA160847:Bradbury, RESPECT R01 CA190871:Bradbury) and 
adapted for this context. Communication to at risk -relatives will be 
included in the standardized counseling protocols, which will be 
developed and finalized during the development period.  
5.5.10  Satisfaction with Receipt of Tumor Genetic Test Results (T2 only)  
This is a 9 -item satisfaction with communication scale that evaluates 
participants’ perceptions of their tumor profile test experience and of 
their experience receiving their tumor profile test results, including 
cognitive, affective and time/attention items. These scales w ere 
adapted for somatic testing52, 53, 54. 
5.5.11  Preferences for Receipt of Tumor Genetic Test Results (T2 only)  
We will assess patient preferences for receipt of tumor profile test 
results, including queries related to the actual modes of sharing and 
receiving results, satisfaction with receiving results using these 
communication modes, and alternatives thereto. These will be novel 
items developed specifically for the purpose of this study.  
5.5.12  Satisfacti on with Genetic  Counseling  Services (T1 SS and T2 SS only):  
Assessed with a 9 -item satisfaction with communication scale 
items27,36,37 utilized in our prior and related studies and has 
demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α= 0.73 -80)15,16.

39 5.5.13  Regret and Disappointment Regarding Genetic  Test Result ( T2 and 
T3 for tumor; T2SS and T3SS for germline ): 
Assessed with the 7 -item Regret and Di sappointment Scale (RDS) 
which has been utilized in the general population to assess regret and 
disappointment in decision making48. This instrument has been 
adapted to address both germline and tumor genetic testing. 
5.5.14  Communication about Germline (i.e. inherited) Genetic Test R esults  
(T2SS, T3SS)  
Psychosocial intention (T2SS) will be assessed using a 4-item 
measure of intent to communicate genetic  test results previously 
developed and utilized in our COGENT study to assess intent to share 
genetic test results with health care providers, family members and 
other third parties.  
Performance of psychosocial behaviors (T3SS) will be assessed 
using a 4-item measure of communication of genetic  test results as 
described in the psychosocial intention.

43 7. Statistical Considerations  
The primary objective of the p rimary Intervention Study  (RCT, Step 1)  is to evaluate the 
efficacy of web -based pre -disclosure genetic education (i.e. before receipt of tumor 
profile results)  on knowledge (genetic knowledge and knowledge of test benefits and 
limitations)  and distress (anxiety, depression and cancer specific worry) compared to 
usual care services in patients undergoing tumor profiling for advanced cancer . The 
primary analysis will , thus,  be based on patients who have survey data evaluable at both 
T0 (baseline) and T1  (post-genetic e ducation ) (or T2, post-disclosure of  test results ). 
Given the survey completion rate for both T0 and T1 is approximately 60% (as analyzed 
in May 2018), the accrual goal of the primary intervention study needs to be increased 
from 400 to 670 patients in order to maintain sufficient power for evaluating the effect of 
web-based pre -disclosure genetic education.  
As MATCH has approach ed its goal of sequencing ~6000 patient tumors, this section 
incorporates changes to expand eligibility criteria (effective since Addendum #3) to allow 
patients from select sites who potentially undergo tumor profiling through non -MATCH 
assay s and to increase the accrual goal (effective since Addendum #6) . In this section, 
patients who enter COMET through MATCH Step 0 (prior to or after the activation of this 
addendum allowing for eligibility expansion) will be referred as the MATCH cohort, and 
other patients (who enter after the corresponding addendum activates) will be referred 
as the non -MATCH cohort . 
7.1 Primary Study: Randomized Study of Web -based Pre-disclosure  Genetic 
Education versus Usual Care  (Step 1 – Arms A & B)  
NOTE:  Patients on  Arm C (see Section 
 ) will not participate in or 
complete any primary study  (Step 1) education or surveys , and will 
immediately be registered to Arm E and complete all of the substudy 
(Step 2) procedures.  
7.1.1  Primary endpoints will include change in knowledge and distress 
(state anxiety, Promis  anxiety, Promis  depression and cancer specific 
distress) from baseline to post-education  (T0 to T1) and baseline to 
post-disclosure  (T0 to T2).  
The following  10 analyses are of primary interest: c hange scores from 
T0 to T1 , and T0 to T2 of each of the following five outcomes : 
knowledge, state anxiety, cancer specific distress, Promis  anxiety and 
Promis  depression , which correspond to 10 primary analyses. To 
account for the 10 primary analyses, A Bonferr oni correction is 
considered here , setting the nominal p -value to declare statistical 
significance of p<  0.005 (5% Typical Type I error rate / 10 
comparisons = 0.5% nominal p -value for declaring stat istical 
significance). Preliminary data from the  COMET pilot study  (State 
Anxiety, IES -Total, Knowledge)  is used to calculate  power. As there 
was no preliminary data for Promis Depression/Anxiety in a similar 
setting, power calculation for these two measurements are based on 
data reported in Hinds et al. (2012).  A sample size of 200  (with 
evaluable paired data) /arm is chosen here, which provides at least 
85% power for all short -term outcomes (e.g. T0 -T1) and changes in 
knowledge and cancer specific distres s after receipt of tumor profiling 
results (e.g. T0 -T2), using t test at two -sided 0.005 significance level . Rev. 2/17 Rev. 7/17 
Rev. 7/17 Rev. Add6  
Rev. Add6  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
44 With the complet ion rate for both T0 and T1 surveys  at approximately 
60% (as analyzed in May 2018)  and the goal of evaluable sample size 
at 200/arm (at least for the analysis of changes between T0 and T1) , 
the accrual goal of the  primary intervention study needs to be inflated  
from 400 to 6 70 patients in order to maintain  sufficient power for 
detecting proposed changes from T0 to T1 and changes in knowledge 
and cancer specific from T0 to T2 (as described in the preceding 
paragraph). With  the completion rate for both T0 and T2 surveys at 
approximately 45%  (as analyzed in May 2018), the projected 
evaluable sample size of 15 0 patients/arm can give the power of 72%  
for changes in knowledge and 95% for changes in cancer specific 
distress from T0 to T2 . These 670 patients will be randomized 1:1 
between the two arms, and the randomization will be stratified by 
gender, race, age (> 65 vs. ≤ 65), and education level. As of this 
analysis time, 320 patients have been enrolled into the primary 
intervention study. The current COMET accrual rate is approximately 
15 patients per month ( based on the last 3 months ). Assuming 15, 20 
or 25 patients per month  (as more expansion sites are added over 
time)  can be accrued to COM ET from the select sites,  it is expected to 
take 23, 17  or 14 additional months , respectively,  to complete Step 1 
accrual of 670 patients . 
The original accrual plan  posed a limitation on White patients at 80% 
of the accrual goal to ensure diversity of patients. Given that the  
accrual of this study might terminate early if the funding of this study 
ends, the accrual limitation on White patients is  being  lifted to ensure 
the maximal number of patients enrolled before funding ends .

46 Power for Promis Depression and Promis Anxiety  
With 200 evaluable patients per arm, there is 91% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.33 (as fraction of standard deviation), using t -test at 
two-sided significance level 0.005. Based on data from 92 
children/adolescents, Hinds et al. (2012) reported standard deviation 
of 10.74 for Promis Depression and 12.5 for Promis Anxiety, 
respectively. Assuming the standard deviations for these two 
measurements in our proposed study are similar, the following table 
gives the absolute difference that can be detected with 91% power, 
under different assumptions for the correlation between the 
measurements across two timepoints, at two -sided significance level 
0.005 .

7.1.2  Analysis Plan  
Outcome change scores (primary endpoints) between time points for 
each study participant  will be calculated. Two-sample T -tests will be 
conducted first to evaluate whether there is any difference in outcome 
change scores (with respect to the primary endpoints) between 
MATCH  patients and non -MATCH patients. If differences are 
observed, the analysis described below will be performed separately 
for each cohort.  
Two-sample T -tests assuming  unequal variances will be used for the 
primary analyses  of the chan ge scores between arms. An intention -to-
treat approach will be used in which the effect between randomized  
arms  is evaluated , regardless of any treatment crossover. In 
secondary analyses of the primary endpoints , demographic 
characteristi cs between the two  arms will be evaluated using T -tests 
and Fisher’s Exact Tests to investigat e if the arms were unbalanced 
with respect to  potential confounders. If any potential confounders (in 
particular age, race/ethnicity and health literacy) are found to have 
means/proportions th at are different between the arms at a p -value of 
less than 0.1, we will examine the treatment effect in multiple linear 
regressions of the outcomes in which the randomized arms will be 
included as a binary (0/1) dummy indicator and all potential 
confounders that have a p -value < 0.1 will be included as covariates. 
These analyses will be repeated using the as -treated approach  in 
which we compare differences between  the intervention s the patient  
actually received (for example, patients  were randomized to the on -
line p re-disclosure  genetic  education but instead received usual care).  Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
47 There is no plan to perform interim outcome monitoring for this study. 
Participating patient will be at minimal risk given the nature of the 
study. The study will be closely mon itored for feasibility (Section  
7.1.4 ), and if feasible, information/data gathered would be useful and 
informative in patient care.  
7.1.3  Exploratory analysis  will be longitudinal changes in cognitive (e.g. 
genetic knowledge), affective (cancer specific distress, state anxiety, 
general anxiety and general depression, perceived utility, uncertainty). 
In these analyses, multiple linear or logistic regression s will be fit to 
investigate temporal changes in the randomization arm effect , using 
the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for correlated 
data over time. Unstruct ured working correlation matrices for GEE will 
first be considered unless there are model convergence problems, in 
which case exchangeable working correlation matrices will be used 
instead. In the regressions, survey wave and the randomized  arm will 
be included as dummy indicator (0/1 variables) covariates. As there 
are four survey time points, we include t hree dummy indicators for T1 , 
T2 and T 3. In analyzing the change of scores (T1 -T0, T2 -T0, T3 -T0), 
two dummy indicators will be needed. We will also include interactions 
between the survey wave i ndicators and the arm indica tor to see if the 
arm effect changes over time . We will also include potential baseline 
confounding variables that were not balanced between arms at a p -
value < 0.1 (using T -Tests and Fisher’s Exact Tests). These analyses  
will be repeated using the as -treated approach as well . 
To evaluate potential moderators  as described in Section 2, we will 
add relevant interaction terms to the GEE -estimated multiple linear 
and logistic regressions described above. Of most interest are 
interactions between the potential moderators (e.g . test result, 
sociodemographic factors, health literacy, baseline knowledge or 
distress) and the arm indicator.  
Other exploratory endpoints include satisfaction and 
regret/disappointment related to tumor genetic test results, and how to 
better deliver tumor genetic test results and germline information in 
the future. Summary statistics will be provided and comparison may 
be explored between arms using T -Tests or Fisher’s Exact Tests  at 
two-sided significance level of 0.05.  
7.1.4  Feasibility  
Monitoring enrollment on the primary study:  
Accrual will be closely monitored after the  addendum expanding 
eligibility criteria  activates , A formal evaluation will start at 6 months 
after the addendum expanding eligibility criteria activates, allowing 
some time for the select sites to get ready for enrolling patients. If the 
rate of enrollment on Step 1 of EAQ152 is < 5 patients per month , the 
data will be discussed with the study team and the NCI to reevaluate 
the feasibility of the study.  
Monitoring rate of compliance and questionnaire response:  
Primary analysis will be based on randomized arms. Patients who 
have survey data at T0, and at least one of the follow -up timepoints Rev. 7/17 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ152  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 14, 2019  
48 (T1 or T2), will be considered as evaluable. Among the first 100 
patients who are enrolled on Step 1 for the primary study, if proportion 
of evaluable patients is < 60%, the data will be discussed with the 
study team and the NCI to re -assess the feasibility. Proportion of 
patients who cross -over, and proportion of the patients on Arm A who 
complete the web -based education, will also be reported.  
7.2 Secondary Germline Genetic Testing & Counseling Substudy  (Step 2  – Arm D  
and Arm E ) 
7.2.1  The primary endpoint s for the substudy  will be uptake of remote 
genetic counseling and uptake of clinical germline testing.  
This substudy will be exploratory in nature. We will evaluate, 
separately,  the proportion of individuals who complete  a) remote 
genetic counseling and b) germline testing, among patients (whose 
hospital sites open accrual to COMET Step 2) with a potential  
clinically significant  incidental germline mutation identified through  
MATCH or non -MATCH  tumor profiling . The current COMET Step 2 
accrual rate through MATCH is 1 -2 patients per month. The substudy 
will stop patient accrual either when the accrual goal of 100 patients is 
met or 4 months after the primary study is closed to accrual (allowing 
the tumor profiling results  to be returned  back to the sites and  so any 
remaining  qualifying patients can be enrolled into the substudy), 
whichever is earlier.  
7.2.2  Analysis Plan  
The proportions of individual uptake of remote genetic counseling and 
uptake of clinical germline testing will be calculated  separately , along 
with the 95% confidence intervals.  
Changes in knowledge and distress (state anxiety, general anxiety, 
general depression and cancer specific distress) from baseline to 
post-pre-test genetic counseling (T0 SS to T1 SS) and baseline to post -
test for those who proceed with confirmatory genetic testing (T0 SS to 
T2SS) will be described using descriptive statistics (e.g. means, 
standard deviations, proportions, 95%  confidence intervals). Multiple 
linear regressions will be fit to further investigate temporal changes. 
Again, regression parameters will be estimated using GEE to account 
for correlated data over time. Unstructured working correlation 
matrices for GEE will be considered first unless there are model 
convergence problems, in which case exchangeable working 
correlation matrices will be used instead. In the regre ssions, survey 
wave as  dummy indicator (0/1 variables) will be included as 
covariates. As there are three survey time points, we include two 
dummy indicators for T1 and T2 (leaving T0 as the baseline reference 
time period). We will also include potential baseline confounding 
variables in the models (e.g. age, sociodemographic variables).  
Other exploratory endpoints include communication to others, 
satisfaction and regret/disappointment related to genetic counseling 
service or germline genetic test results. Summary statistics will be 
provided.  Rev. 2/17

7.3.1  Primary Study: Randomized Study of Web -based P re-disclosure  
Genetic Education versus Usual Care  (Step 1)  
Assuming the number of enrolled patients will be approximately 670, 
based on the past 2 years of accrual to ECOG -ACRIN coordinated 
therapeutic studies by any participating group, excluding leukemia 
and myeloma, the anticipated accrual in subgroups by gender and 
race is as follows : 
Racial Categories  Ethnic Categories  
Total  Not Hispanic/Latino  Hispanic/Latino  
Female  Male  Female  Male  
American Indian or 
Alaskan Native  2 2 0 0 4 
Asian  15 7 0 0 22

American  28 25 0 0 53 
White  275 291 15 10 591 
Total  320 325 15 10 670 
The accrual targets in individual cells are not large enough for  
definitive subgroup analyses. Therefore, overall accrual to the study 
will not be extended to meet individual subgroup accrual targets.  
7.3.2  Secondary Germline Genetic Testing & Counseling Substudy  (Step 2)  
Assuming  the number of treated patients will be approximately 100, 
based on the past 2 years of accrual to ECOG -ACRIN coordinated 
therapeutic studies by any participating group, excluding leukemia 
and myeloma, the anticipated accrual in subgroups by gender and 
race is as follows:

Dear [PATIENT SALUTATION],  
 
Thank you for agreeing to take part in this important research study. Many questions 
remain unanswered in cancer. With the participation of people like you in clinical trials, 
we hope to  improve treatment and quality of life for those with your type of cancer.  
We believe you will receive high quality, complete care. I and my research staff will 
maintain very close contact with you. This will allow me to provide you with the best care 
while learning as much as possible to help you and other patients.  
On behalf of [INSTITUTION]  and ECOG -ACRIN, we thank you again and look forward to 
helping you.  
 
 Sincerely,

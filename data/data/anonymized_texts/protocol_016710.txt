of a site number (which is provided by the sponsor) and a sequential subject number and the subject 
initials (first and last names).  
5.2.1 Subject Discontinuation Criteria  
If possible, every subject should remain in the study until completion of the required follow -up period.

In those instances, the investigator will attempt to obtain a final clinical assessment and an adverse device effect evaluation for the subject prior to this withdrawal. A subject will be considered 
lost to follow -up only after three unsuccessful, documented attempts to contact the subject have been 
made.    
In addition, a subject can be discontinued for any of the following reasons: the Principal Investigator 
decides that continuing in the study would not be in the subject’s best interest, a subject is

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations , and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Thyroid hormone is important for multiple physiologic 
functions, and insufficiency and excess of thyroid hormone 
are each pathologic conditions. Thyroid hormone is tightly 
regulated through a feedback loo p between the hypothalamic 
hormone thyrotropin relea sing hormone ( TRH), the pituitary 
hormone thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH), and the thyroid 
hormones thyroxine ( T4) and triiodothyronine ( T3) (Fig. 1, 
from [1]). Individuals with normal thyroid function maintain 
TSH levels in a narrow range, though the setpoint for thyroid 
hormone levels varies between individuals.  
 
With increasing age, there is a progressive shift 
toward higher TSH levels in people who have no 
detectable underlying thyroid disease  
(Fig. 2, from [2]). This leads  to a higher  prevalence of 
subclinical hypothyr oidism in older people. 
Subclinical hypothyroidism  is defined as elevated 
TSH levels with normal levels of thyroid hormones . It 
is a common clinical diagnosis  affecting 10 -15% of 
individuals age d 65 years and older  and up to 20% of 
those 85 years and older .[1-5] The purpose of this 
study is to examine mechanisms to explain th e age-
related increase in TSH levels  and resulting 
subclinical hypothyroidism .  
 
In addition, it is not clear if individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism benefit from 
replacement of thyroid hormone. Some argue that subclinical hypothyroidism should be 
treated as a form of mild hypothyroidism, whereas others argue that it may be adaptive.  
The question is whether, in older people, a  TSH level just outside the reference range 
should be considered a pathologic finding. We hypothesize that slightly elevated TSH 
result s from an age -related decrease in the function of TSH that leads to an adaptive shift 
in the pituitary -thyroid setpoint , rather than an early sign of thyroid failure . That is, the 
TSH that is produced by the pituitary gland may become less bio logically active with older 
age. More TSH would then be required to keep thyroid hormone level production 
constant.  
 
There is evidence  to support the biologic plausibility of a decline in TSH bioactivity with 
age. TSH with decreased bioactivity  has been detected using cell -based methodologies, 
and has been reported in conditions of thyroid axis dysfunction, ranging from primary and

sponsor  secon dary hypothyroidism to TSH -producing pituitary adenomas .[3-6] An inverse 
correlation between TSH bioactivity and age was  also found in 11 he althy men and 
women aged 28 -52 years. [4]  
 
Changes in TSH structure including glycosylation patterns affect its biologic activity. [7] 
These changes in glycosylation could be due to alterations in TRH output from the 
hypothalamus , as is found with age  for other hypothalamic hormones such as GHRH and 
GnRH. [8, 9] Unfortunately, TRH cannot be measured directly; however, TSH bioactivity 
can be measured before and after TRH stimulation testing to provide indirect evidence of 
this mechanism . We can then create perturbations to the system such as adding back 
thyroid hormones to understand these hormonal feedback loops. Together the TRH 
stimulation testing and the crossover design with T4 and T3 add back  will provide insight 
into the dynamics of the hypothalamic -pituitary -thyroid axis in older people with subclinical 
hypothyroidism.  
1.2 Interventional Agent s 
TRH, a naturally occurring  hypothalamic neuro peptide in humans, is an endogenous 
ligand for the TRH receptor. It is composed o f three amino acids and stimulates  the 
release of TSH and prolactin from the anterior pituitary.  The release of TSH then 
stimulates the release of thyroid h ormones, T4 and T3  (Fig. 1).  Synthetic TRH has been 
used for over 40 years i n the diagnostic assessment of  pituitary  or hypothalamic 
dysfunction.  
 
Intravenous  TRH ha s a short half -life with a mean of approximately 5 minutes in normal 
subjects. Bassiri and Utiger administ ered 400 µg TRH  to 8 healthy men  and noted that 
plasma TRH levels rose from <0.4 ng/mL to 33 ± 7 ng/mL (mean ± SEM) 2 minutes after 
injection and linearly fell to 2.9 ng/mL 20 min after injection. The mean half -life of TRH 
was found to b e 5.3 ± 0.5 min. [10]. TSH levels rise rapidly; reach a peak, and later decline 
after TRH administration. Anderson et al administered 100 -800 µg TRH to 79 healthy men 
and found that TRH -stimulated TSH levels peaked after 30 min and fell to baseline levels 
in approximately 3 hour s.[11] 
 
Levothyroxine (LT4 ) and liothyronine (LT3) are synthetic forms of T4 and T3, which are 
endogenous hormones produced by follicular cells of the thyroid gland  in response to  
stimulation by TSH  from the anterior pituitary . The majority of circulating thyroid hormone 
in the blood is in the form of T4 . T4 is then converted to T3 in target tissues , with T3 being 
the mo re physiologically active  hormone . Both T4 and T3 bind to the thyroid receptor in 
cell nuclei  and regulate DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Human studies show 
that thyroid hormone levels can also alter TSH bioactivity . [4, 6, 12] T4 is metabolized 
slowly with eighty percent of circulating T3 derived from T4 through deiodination. The 
half-life of LT4 is six to eight  days. The half -life of LT3 is one to two  days. [13-15]  
 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Slightly elev ated TSH may result from an age -related alteration  in the function of T RH, 
analogous to the age -related alterations found in other hypothalamic hormones such as 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 5 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  GHRH  and GnRH. [8, 9] Preclinical data show that alterations  to the structure and 
packaging of the TSH molecule  may affect its function . TSH is a glycoprotein composed 
of an alpha and a beta subunit that requires glycosylation of three asparagine residues in 
order to have maximal function at the TSH receptor. [16] When the glycosylation pattern 
is abnormal, TSH bindin g to its receptor is less efficient, resulting in decreased bioactivity. 
These changes in glycosylation could be due to alterations in TRH output from the 
hypothalamus, as suggested by animal models .[7, 17-19] Taylor et al. showed that 
hypothalamic as compared to primary hypothyroidism caused by lesions in the rat 
paraventricular nuclei alters  carbohydrate structure of secreted thyrotropin. Taylor and 
Weintraub later showed that this alteration in TSH carbohydrate structure could be 
corrected by administering TRH in vivo. [19] Hypothalamic TRH output cannot be 
measured directly. However, TSH bioactivity can be measured before and after TRH 
stimulation testing to provide indirect evidence of this mechanism.  
 
In addition to TRH, there is evidence that thyroid hormones themselves c an alter the 
bioactivity of thyroid stimulating hormone. T hyroid hormone status has been shown to 
modulate glycosyltransferase mRNA levels in mouse thyrotrophs. [20] This has been 
postulated to result from a direct action of T3 on thyroid hormone responsive elements in 
the upstream regulatory region of the sialyl transferase gene. If so, TSH glycosylation 
could be affected by the observed age -associ ated decline in T3 levels.   
 
Rodent data indicate that replacement therapy with LT4 alone does not achieve adequate 
levels of T3 in all tissues. [21] However, combine d replacement therapy of LT3 to LT4 
completely restored euthyroidism in thyroidectomized rats at much lower doses of LT4 
than those needed to normalize LT3 in most tissues when L -T4 alone was used. The LT4 -
LT3 cross -over design will give us insight into th is mechanism.  
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
In men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study with a mean age of 74 years at 
the time of the initial TSH , we found a gradual increase in TSH levels over a 13-year 
period , with an average increase of 0.28 mU/L (p<0.01)  and no change in free T4 levels, 
suggesting a shift in the pituitary -thyroid set point. These data parallel the 0.32 mU/L TSH 
increase over a 13 -year period published in a younger population (mean age 58 y ears at 
the second TSH), also without chang e in free T4 levels. [22] NHANES data  also illustrate 
a progressive shift toward higher TSH levels with increasing age [2] and another study 
has shown higher TSH in people with exceptional longevity. [23] 
 
The hypothes es that there is a decline in TSH bioactivity with age  and that thyroid 
hormone supplementation can  alter bioactivity  are supported  by data in humans [4, 6, 
12]. Oliveira et al. evaluated in  vitro serum TSH bioactivity and found  a strong inverse 
correlation between serum TSH bioactivity and age  in 11 normal controls . This study also 
showed a decrease in TSH bioactivity in  patients with primary hypothyroidism. The 
bioactivity improve d with levothyroxine supplementation  and was positively  correlated 
with change in  T3 levels  but not free T4 levels. Evaluation of TSH glycosylation patterns 
showed a higher proportion of sialylated TSH molecules in patients with decreased  
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 6

molecule was also shown in patients with central hypothyroidi sm due to Sheehan’s 
syndrome [3] and c hronic TRH administration in patients with central hypothyr oidism has 
been shown to improve TSH bioactivity .[24] These data suggest that hypothalamus -
pituitary -thyroid feedback loops are regulated by TSH bioactivity and thyroid hormone 
levels.  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
TRH stimulation testing:  
TRH has a short half -life and does not exhibit a sustained biological effect after a single 
intravenou s bolus . For decades, TRH has been intravenously administered to a variety 
of study populations, including patients with thyroid, pituitary, and hypothalamic 
disorders .[10, 11, 25] In this study  we will be using the standard clinical dose of 200 µg 
at three time points . This dose has been  used in studies of  dynamic pituitary testing 
utilizing TRH stimulatio n testing. [25, 26] Side effects  have been reported in about 50% of 
patients , but side effects are generally minor and persist for only a few minutes following 
injection.  
 
These side effects  include [27]: 
 
Most frequent: transient nausea, flushing, palpitations  (without change i n heart rate) , 
lightheadedness , bad taste in mouth, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth,  and an urge to 
urinate  
 
Less frequent: anxiety, sweating, tightness in throat  (without change in oxygenation or 
respiration) , pressure in chest, tingling sensation, and dr owsiness  
 
Uncommon: change in blood pressure , seizure  
 
The mean  elevation of blood pressure reported wa s 16 mm of mercury. The peak blood 
pressure elevation occu rred between one and five minutes , with a return to baseline blood 
pressure levels within ten minutes. [11] Participants with uncontrolled blood pressure or 
history of ischemic cardiac disease or stroke will be excluded.  
 
Seizures have only been reported in those with a history of seizure disorder . Individuals 
with a hist ory of seizure will be excluded.  
 
No direct benefits a re expected to result from TRH administration.  
 
 
LT4 and LT3:  
 
LT4 and LT3 have each been in therapeutic use for more than 50 years. Adverse 
reactions to either drug are exclusively related to excessiv e thyroid hormone, which can 
produce iatrogenic  thyrotoxicosis. No serious adverse events were reported in  a 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 7

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  published  LT4/LT3 crossover study, and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism  or 
hypothyroidism were reported. [25, 28] Participants will be asked about hyperthyroid 
symptoms, and a TSH level will be checked prior to the planned date if a patient reports 
any hyperthyroid symptoms.  
 
Administration and monitoring of LT4 and LT3 will be modeled off of a published 
protocol .[28] The dosing of thyroid hormone will be based on published studies of 
thyroid hormone replacement in subclinical hypothyroidism. The literature supports  a 1 
mcg/kg/day  dose for initiation of therapy. [29-34]  We will tailor the thyro id hormone dose 
to each subject  using  a weight -based dosing scheme  that is also based on how far the 
subject’s TSH level is from goal. The dosing scheme is conservative . 1mcg/kg is the 
dose reported in the literature. T he initial dose in our study will be lower than  that - 
0.7mcg /kg/day given that we are studying  subjects  70 years and older . We will use 
thrice daily dosing due to the short half -life of LT3.  
 
LT4 
Each participant will start on 0.7mcg/kg/day divided into three daily doses.  
The dose will be adjusted according to subject weight and how far the TSH level is from 
goal.  There will be a medication cap such that no dose adjustment will exceed 25 mcg 
per day.  
 
LT3 
The starting dose of liothyronine wi ll be 1/3 of that of levothyroxine divided into three 
daily doses. We will  titrate the dose according to subject weight and how far the TSH 
level is from goal.  No dose adjustment  will be greater than 8.3  mcg per day.  
 
The total daily dose of study medications will be adjusted to a TSH of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L  
using the adjustment scheme to avoid excess thyroid hormone replacement.  
 
At the ti me of crossover of study drug, p articipants will undergo a 4 week wash -out period 
from the study drug. This is to avoi d over -replacement when switching from LT4 to LT3, 
given the longer half -life of LT4. Following Visit 2 , participants will stop all study drug for 
4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks they will begin the secon d study drug at the equivalent 
dose as they were taki ng at Visit 2 , divided into 3 equal doses.  TSH level will not be 
checked at the end of the wash -out period.  A TSH level will be checked 4 weeks after 
crossing over to the new study drug.  All further TSH level evaluations and medication 
adjustments will fo llow the titration protocol.  
 
No direct benefits a re expected to result from LT4 and LT3 administration.

3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
The study design is a randomized, double -blind, cross -over study in which we will 
examine the pituitary -thyroid axis in older subclinical hypothyroid individuals in response 
to TRH stimulation and to daily LT4 or LT3 supplementation over a m inimum period of 14 
consecutive weeks. Physiologic responses to LT4 and LT3 supplementation will also be 
examined. Thirty participants will receive a total of three TRH stimulation tests and one 
course each of LT4 and LT3 in randomized order.   
 
 
All study visits will be at the University of Pennsylvania’s Clinical and Translational 
Research Center ( CTRC ). There will be a screening visit (Day -60 to Day -1), a baseline

sponsor  study visit ( Visit 1; Day 1), and a final study visit while taking t heir first thyroid preparation  
(Visit 2) . Following the completion of Visit 2 , participants will cross -over to the second 
thyroid prepara tion and complete  Visit 3, as above.  
 
On Day 1 (baseline study visit , Visit 1 ) the participants will undergo their first TR H 
stimulation test and receive written instruction on thyroid hormone dosing by a study team 
member. The participant will begin oral thyroid supplementation as divided doses three 
times per day for four weeks starting the morning after the baseline study v isit. After four 
weeks, the participants will have their TSH level checked at  a Penn outpatient laboratory , 
after which LT4 or LT3 will be titrated to a target TSH level  of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L by a  blinded 
study investigator . TSH levels will continue to be checke d at four -week intervals  until the 
TSH level is at goal, after which, Visit 2 will be scheduled. At Visit 2, a TRH stimulation 
test will be performed and participants will cross -over to the other  thyroid preparation. The 
sequence of TSH assessment and thyroid preparation titration will occur with this thyroid 
preparation. At Visit 3, a  TRH stimulation test will be performed and the participant will 
complete the study . Physiologic endpoints will be measured at each stud y visit .  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints

visit: 
1. TSH a rea under the curve ( AUC )  
2. TSH max 
3. Free T4  
4. Total T3  
5. TSH bioactivity measured by an in-vitro cell-based bioactivity assay  [35]  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The following endpoints  will be measured  at each study visit : 
1. Unstimulated TSH bioactivity  
2. Resting energy expenditure ( REE) evaluation by indirect calorimetry  
3. Weight   
4. Body composition  including body fat (percent and total), free fat mass, and bone 
density measured by dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA)  
5. Lipid  profile via laboratory measurements

Exogenous estrogen and testosterone is not an exclusion, but all  participants will be 
required to  remain on the same dose throughout the study.  
4.3  Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Study participants will be recruited from the general medicine, geriatrics, and endocrine 
clinics of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. We will use the Penn Data Store, 
a data warehousing and reporting entity containing patient related informati on extracted 
from five major clinical electronic systems. The Data Store can be queried by tailored 
request using multiple different parameters, including age, diagnosis, medication, 
laboratory result, and clinic over a specified time frame. Selected provi ders of individuals 
who meet our inclusion criteria and are not taking thyroid medication will be contacted by 
the Investigator about the study protocol and recruitment efforts in order to obtain 
potential participants.   Penn Research Trial Advisory (elect ronic alerting in EPIC) will also 
be used for contacting potential participants. The pop -up would appear in EPIC screens 
of participating practice providers during patient visits. If the potential subject agrees, their 
information would be relayed to the s tudy coordinator via the EPIC system.   I-connect, a 
novel Clinical Trial search and match technology will also be utilized.   A study recruitment 
poster will be displayed on University bulletin boards and at University physician 
practices. The Penn Medicine  biobank will be utilized as a source of subject identification. 
Once identified by way of these recruitment methods,  verbal contact with potential 
participants, utilizing incoming and outgoing telephone recruitment scripts will be 
followed.   
4.4 Early Withdra wal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
The protocol defined follow -up period per subject will range from 14-78 weeks . A subject 
may be withdrawn from the study prior to his or her expected completion date for the 
following reasons:  
 
1. If the investigator discovers a condition(s) which indicates unacceptable risk to the 
subject  
2. If the subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements  
3. If the subject withdraws consent from participation in the study  
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for With drawn Subjects  
Attempts will be made to obtain at least survival data on these subjects up to the end of 
the subject follow -up period. In the case where the subject withdraws consent from 
participation in the study, permission to collect survival data will  be obtained first. A 
subject will be labeled as “Lost to Follow -Up” only after the following has been 
documented:

5 Study Drug s  
5.1 Description  
TRH is a n endogenous hormone that is a ligand for the TRH receptor  and is involved in 
regulating TSH release  from the pituitary . TSH stimulates release of T4, which can be 
converted to T3 , a more active form . Both T4 and T3 regulate metaboli sm in humans . 
 
TRH will be purchased from  American Peptide , which will produce a pharmaceutical 
grade (cGMP) formulation of TRH  appropriate for human use . The TRH we will use is a 
tri-peptide and has a molecular weight of 362.3 . TRH is supplied as a white to clear 
crystalline and powder. Syringes  contain ing 200 mcg of TRH will be made by the 
University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service . TRH is intended for intravenous 
administra tion. 
 
Synthetic forms of T4 (levothyroxine, or LT4) and T3 (liothyronine, or LT3) will be 
purchased and shipped to  the IDS pharmacy at Penn . Each of these medications is FDA 
approved for treatment of conditions of hypothyroidism. LT4 has a molecular weight of 
776.87  and LT3 has a molecular weight of 650.98 . LT4 and LT3 will be supplied as dose -
tailored capsule s filled with pharmaceutical grade powder. The capsules will be provided  
by the IDS .  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
On Day 1 ( Visit 1 ) participants will receive an IV injection of 200 µg TRH  by a CTRC nurse 
plus ver bal and written instructions on thyroid hormone dosing and sufficient study 
medication for 6 weeks. On the same day , participants will receive LT4 or LT3 in 
randomized order. Each will be titrated to a target TSH level of 0.5 -1.5mU/L. 
Administration of LT4  and LT3 and monitoring in this study will be performed in a similar 
fashion to  a published protocol  and based on the literature of thyroid hormone 
replacement in subclinical hypothyroidism .[28-34] 
 
LT4 
Each participant will start on 0.7mcg/kg/day divided into three daily doses.  
The dose will be adjusted according to subject weight and how far the TSH level is from 
goal.  There will be a medication cap such that no dose adjustment will exceed 25 mcg 
per day.  
 
LT3 
The starting dose of liothyronine will be 1/3 of that of levothyroxine  ( 0.23 mcg/kg/day of 
LT3) divided into three daily doses. We will  titrate the dose according to subject weight 
and how far the TSH level is from goal.  No dose adjustment will be greater than 8.3  
mcg per day.

sponsor   
The total daily dose of study medications will be adjusted to a TSH of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L  
using the adjustment scheme to avoid excess thyroid hormone replacement.  
 
 
At the ti me of crossover of study drug, p articipants will undergo a 4 week wash -out period 
from the study drug. This is to avoid over -replacement when switching fro m LT4 to LT3, 
given the longer half -life of LT4. Following Visit 2 , participants will stop all study drug for 
4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks they will begin the secon d study drug at the equivalent 
dose as they were taking at Visit 2 , divided into 3 equal d oses.  TSH level will not be 
checked at the end of the wash -out period.  A TSH level will be checked 4 weeks after 
crossing over to the new study drug.  All further TSH level evaluations and medication 
adjustments will follow the titration protocol.  
 
 
No direct benefits a re expected to result from LT4  and LT3 administration.

Identical coded dose -tailored capsules containing LT4 or LT3, will be produced at Penn’s 
Investigational Drug Service (IDS).  All therapeutic adjustments will be performed every 
four weeks by a blinded  study  physician and an IDS pharmacist. Identical amounts of 
study medication will be provided in each of the three daily doses. Subjects will receive  1 
capsule  per dose , and the dose of each capsule will depend  on the total daily dose 
requirement.  New study medication will be mailed overnight to participants within 5 days 
of the  receipt of interim lab results . Interim TSH level checks  will continue every four 
weeks until the target TSH is achieved.  
After the target TSH level is achieved , participants will attend Visit 2. They will receive a 
second IV injection of 200 µh TRH . Subjects will stop taking study drug for 4  weeks after 
the study visit 2. D uring this wash -out period o nce every two weeks a phone contact will 
continue to be made by one of the study team members to inquire if the participant has 
experienced any adverse events. Specifically, the participant will be asked if they have 
any symptoms of palpitations or shortness of breath. A six week supply of  crossover study 
drug will either be sent home with the participant from study visit 2 or it will be mailed to 
them . Subjects will be instructed to be beginning  this study drug 4 weeks after study visit 
2. TSH level will be checked 4 weeks after starting th e new  study drug .  All study 
measures for the other thyroid preparation will be repeated as above and Visit 3 will be 
identical to Visit 2, without administrati on of additional thyroid medication . 
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The order in which LT4 and LT3 are received will be randomized. A randomization list will 
be created by the IDS at Penn using a web -based program. The IDS will subsequen tly 
perform randomization assignment, and all study investigators, staff, and participants with 
direct contact with participants will be masked to treatment assignment.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
TRH in powder form must  be stored at -20 degrees Celsius or cooler . LT4 and LT3 must 
be stored  at room temperature . Storage, preparation, labeling and dispensing of all study 
drugs (TRH, LT4, and LT3) will be done by the IDS (available  at 215 -349-8817 or, for 
after-hours emergencies, 800 -670-3151) in accordance with HUP’s Pharmacy Policy and

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  Procedures. Each drug label will include the subject’s unique identification number, date 
dispensed, and di rections for use.  
 
One prefilled syringe  containing 200 µg TRH will be administered to participants by a 
CTRC nurse in the CTRC at each study visit . 
 
TRH should be administered with the patient in the supine position. It will be administered 
as an intravenous bolus  over 1 minute. The patient sho uld remain supine until all of the 
post-injection blood draws have been completed. The patient should urinate prior to the 
procedure as th ey may feel an urge to urinate after the TRH is administered.   
 
The LT4 and LT3 will be packaged in identical coded dose-tailored capsules containing 
either LT4 or LT3. The participants will be given sufficient study medication for 6 weeks 
at the start of each treatment regimen (LT4 or LT3) . Participants will obtain TSH level 
checks at 4 -week  intervals, after which they will be provided with additional study 
medication as needed . If a dose change is required, new study medication will be mailed 
overnight to participants within 5 days of review of the lab results . Unused capsules will 
be returned to IDS at Visits 2 and 3 . 
5.5 Subject Compliance Monitorin g 
Adherence will be assessed by direct questioning of study participants. Any evidence of 
noncompliance will be recorded  and subjects who are significantly noncompliant  with the 
study treatment regimen may be withdraw n from the study . Determination of 
noncompliance will be based on investigator judgment. To avoid unnecessary 
adjustments, blinded study physicians involved in any medication adjustments  will be 
made aware by study team members  of the participants’ self -reported adherence to the 
regimen.  
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Prior and concomitant medication history will be collected for each subject. Medications 
that are used on a daily basis, and are used to treat medical conditions t hat do not meet 
exclusion criteria will be permitted. Excluded prescription medications include thyroid 
hormone preparations, antithyroid drugs, corticosteroids, medication that interferes with 
the TRH stimulation test , and medication that interferes with the absorption or metabolism 
of LT4 or LT3  (Appendix 3). 
5.7 Packaging  
TRH will be shipped in bulk. IDS will prepare syringes for intravenous injection.  
 
LT4 and LT3 will be shipped in bulk and packaged by IDS in identical coded capsules 
containing LT4 or LT3 .

to take home. Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document drug 
assigned, drug con sumed, and drug remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the 
drug reconciliation form, and signed and dated by the study team.  
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
All study participants will return unused capsules of study drug to study staff at Visits 2 
and 3 , which will be given to IDS . At the completion of the study, there will be a final 
reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation 
will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any di screpancies noted 
will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused 
study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Screening Visit  (Day -60 to Day -1) 
Upon arrival at the CT RC, the participant will review and sign the IRB -approved consent 
form. The participant will also review an optional exploratory genetics research study IRB -
approved consent form and sign only if they agree to parti cipate in the optional study. 
They will t hen be assigned a unique screening visit identification number. Participants will 
be asked for a thorough history detailing their past medical history, current medications, 
and social habits. They will perform the MMSE. The research nurse will measure weig ht, 
height, blood pressure, heart rate, and perform a 12 lead ECG. A study investigator  will 
perform a physical examination. Subjects will have blood drawn to evaluate lab 
parameters for eligibility criteria. A free thyroxine (FT4) level in conjunction wit h a TSH 
level will be sent to confirm subclinical hypothyroidism. The t hyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) test obtained during the screening visit is measured at least 4 weeks  after the last 
elevated  TSH.  Instructions for use of the activity and heart rate monitor s will be given to 
each participant.  Participants will then be discharged to home.  If participants are eligible 
for the study, an activity  and heart rate  monitor will be mailed to their home . Participants 
will be advised to wear the act ivity and hea rt rate monitor  for 4 days ) prior to the first study

sponsor  visit. The heart rate band will be moistened with either water or gel per the activity monitor 
instructions. Participants will also be given a log to record when they place their heart rate 
and activity monitors on and off.  
6.2 Visit 1  (Day 1)  
Participants will arrive at 7:30 am after a 12 -hour fast. Weight and vital signs including 
heart rate, rectal temperature, and blood pressure will be measured . The a ctivity and 
heart rate monitor s will be collected . An REE eva luation by indirect calorimetry  will be 
completed .  
 
An IV will be inserted into the forearm and blood will be collected at times -5 and 0, 
followed by injection of 200 µg TRH.[28] Additional blood will be collected at 5, 10, 15, 
20, 30, 60, 120, a nd 180 minutes, immediately processed, and stored at -80 degrees for 
measures of TSH, free T4, and total T3 (all time points ), prolactin , alpha subunit , reverse 
T3 (0, 60, and 180 minutes) , and a lipid profile (time 0). Additional samples at the 0, 120, 
and 180 time points  will be processed and saved for TSH bioactivity measurements  and 
TSH structure evaluation.  If the participant consents to the optional exploratory genetic 
research study, t hen a sample will be collected, processed and saved for genetic testing 
at one study visit only  (time -5). 
 
Blood pressure will be monitored before administration of TRH, and at 5, 15, 30 , 60, 120,  
180 minute s.  
 
Question s about  health status, quality of l ife, and hypothyroid symptoms will be 
completed. Digit symbol substitution test will be completed.  
 
Participants will be provided with lunch  and undergo a DXA scan .  
Participants will then undergo arterial tonometry and Doppler echocardiography testing. 
Assessment of arterial load will be made from this data.   
Arterial tonometry:  We will use a commercially available system (SphygmoCor, AtCor 
Medical) that uses a high -fidelity applanation tonometer (Millar Instruments; Houston, 
TX). The tonometer will be used to record carotid, radial and femoral arterial pressure 
waveforms. Mean b rachial pressure will be obtained from a radial waveform calibrated 
with brachial systolic and diastolic pressures, measured with a validated oscillometric 
device. Diastolic and mean pressures will then be used to calibrate the carotid pressure 
waveform. C arotid -femoral and carotid -radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be computed 
from the time delay between the waveform foot on these arterial sites and the distance 
between the sites (measured on the body surface), where PWV = distance/time.  
Doppler echoca rdiography : will be performed using a standard protocol, which will include 
parasternal views and apical views of the left ventricle. It will also include pulsed -wave 
Doppler interrogation of flow velocities in the LV outflow tract, mitral inflow and mitra l 
annular velocities. Flow volume will be computed by multiplying LV outflow tract flow 
velocity by the LV outflow tract cross -sectional area measured with 3D echocardiography.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  Diastolic function will be assessed using standard parameters from mitral inflo w and mitral 
annular tissue velocity profiles.  
 Assessment of arterial load  will be performed via pressure -flow analyses and will include 
assessments of proximal aortic characteristic impedance, total arterial compliance, and 
reflection magnitude computed  using linear wave separation analysis, using central 
pressure and flow waveforms measured via arterial tonometry and Doppler 
echocardiography, respectively.   
 
Arterial tonometry  is non -invasive and does not have any known risks.  
During various procedures  (arterial tonome try, echocardiography), we will use 
 adhesive electrodes  attached to the participant’s skin to record the electrical  
signal from the heart. These may occasionally cause skin itching and irritation.  
 
Arterial tonometry and Doppler echocardiographic examinations will only be performed 
by appropriately trained personnel as per our institutional standards.  
 
Prior to the end of the visit the participant will receive verbal and written instructions on 
thyroid hormone dosing and provided with sufficient study medication for 6 weeks. The n 
they will be discharged home.  
6.3 Day 2 -Week 4 
Participants will consume coded capsules of either LT4 or LT3 supplements as divided 
doses three times per day in the morning, afternoon, and evening.  
6.4 Medication  Titration  (Q4Weeks ) 
Participants will have TSH testing every 4 weeks  (acceptable range 4 -8 weeks)  at a Penn 
outpatient laboratory facility  until TSH is at goal , and then the participant will be scheduled 
for Visit 2 . This visit can be scheduled  up to four  weeks from the date of the last TSH 
level.  
 
Symptoms of palpitations and shortness of breath  will be ascertained  at the reminder calls 
prior to TSH level checks. The total daily dose of study medications will be adjusted by 
blinded study  investigators to a TSH of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L. New study medication for 
adjustment dosing will be mailed overnight to participants within 5 days of receipt of the 
interim lab results . Once the TSH is at goal, an activity  and heart rate  monitor will be 
mailed to the participant to wear one week prior to the next study visit.  
6.5 Visit 2   
Participants will repeat all measures from Visit 1  at this study visit o n their first thyroid 
preparation (LT4 or LT3). Subjects will stop taking study drug for 4 weeks after the stud y 
visit 2. During this wash -out period once every two weeks a phone contact will continue 
to be made by one of the study team members to inquire if the participant has experienced 
any adverse events. Specifically, the participant will be asked if they have  any symptoms

sponsor  of palpitations or shortness of breath. A six week supply of crossover study drug will either 
be sent home with the participant from study visit 2 or it will be mailed to them. Subjects 
will be instructed to be begin this study drug 4 weeks a fter study visit 2. TSH level will be 
checked 4 weeks after starting the new study drug , and all study procedures  for 
medication titration and TSH checks will be repeated as above.   
 
6.6 Visit 3  
Participants will repeat all measures from Visit 2 at this final study visit on their second  
thyroid preparation (LT4 or LT3). The study will be complete.  
6.7 Phone Contacts  
Once during the first week , a phone contact will be made by one of the study team 
members to inquire if the participant has experience d any adverse events following LT4 
or LT3 supplementation. Thereafter, once every two weeks a phone contact will be made 
by one of the study team members to inquire if the participant has experience d any 
adverse events following drug supplementation. Specifically, the  participant will be asked 
if they have any symptoms of palpitations or shortness of breath. Additionally, one day 
following each TRH administration (study Visits 1, 2, and 3 ) a phone contact will be made 
by one of the study team members to inquire if the pa rticipant has experienced any 
adverse events following study drug injection. If the participant experiences any adverse 
events following the final phone contact, they will have an emergency phone number to 
contact , which is 954 -464-8588 as noted on the fro nt of the informed consent document 
and utilized throughout the entire study.  
6.8 Assays  
All screening blood assays will be performed at William Pepper Laboratory, and will 
include a CBC, TSH, FT4,  TPO antibodies , and a complete metabolic panel including live r 
function tests to exclude hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency,  or hepatic insufficiency.  Total 
blood volume drawn at the screening visit is approximately 12 ml. This will be drawn as 
two gold -serum separator tubes  and one lavender -top tube each containing  4 ml of blood. 
If a hemoglobin A1C level has not been checked on diabetic particpants in the last 6 
months, a hemoglobin A1C level will be added on to the screening labs.  
 
During the baseline study visit  and study visit on each treatment arm,  blood will be 
collected and batched for biochemical assays for TSH, free T4, total T3, prolactin, and a 
lipid profile , to be performed by the  Pepper lab oratory . Reverse T3 and alpha -subunit will 
be measured  using available kits . TSH bioactivity will be mea sured under the guidance  
of Dr. Gershengorn’s laboratory at NIDDK.  A sample for genetic testing will be collected 
at one study visit  if the participant consents to the optional genetic research study . At the 
completion of the subject participation portion of the study, the optional genetic 
specimens, de -identified, will be sent to Dr. Francesco Celi at Virginia Commonwealth 
University for analysis.  When complete, the samples and analysis will be sent back to 
Penn for incorporation into the study database.   
Total blood volume drawn at each study visit is approximately <90 mL. Total  blood drawn 
at these three visits  combined is approximately <270  mL.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  For interim thyroid hormone titration, a TSH level will be performed every 4 weeks until  
TSH is at goal . These TSH levels have  a turnaround time of <24 hours.  Total blood drawn 
at each titration draw is approximately 4 mL and will not cumulatively exceed 52 mL.  
 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
We plan to enroll 30 subjects with an anticipated 15% dropout rate . With an alpha of 0.05 
and 80% power and 15% dropout, we will be able to detect a 0.58 standard deviation 
(SD) change in outcome from baseline. A 3 SD improvement in unstimulated TSH 
bioactivity has been reported after treatment of overt prima ry hypothyroidism .[4] No 
previous studies have measured TSH bioactivity in subclinical hypothyroidism.  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
All statistical analyses will be performed under consul tation with  Dr. Cucchiara, Ph.D., a 
CTRC biostatistician . Our primary  goal will be to assess changes in TRH stimulation test 
parameters at baseline compared to each thyroid hormone supplementation (LT4 or LT3) 
and our secondary goal will be to compare phys iologic responses to LT4 and LT3 therapy 
from baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for TRH -stimulated TSH response will be 
calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The maximum serum TSH concentration following 
TRH administration (TSH max) will be obtained  by direct inspection of the serum 
concentration -time profiles. Changes in TSH bioactivity, free T4, and total T3 will be 
determined using the higher of the 120 or 180 minute post -TRH values. Paired t -tests will 
be used to examine change from baseline for each preparation, and two -tailed tests will 
be used to compare data between treatment arms. Nonparametric tests will be employed 
as needed. The primary outcomes will be the changes in TRH stimulation test parameters 
(AUC, TSH max, ∆ TSH bioactivity, ∆ free T4, ∆ total T3). Additional outcomes will include 
changes in unstimulated TSH bioactivity, REE, body temperature, weight, b ody 
composition, lipids, physical actigraphy  and heart rate , cognitive testing, symptom s, 
arterial tonometry, and Doppler echocardiog raphy.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Any subject with study data at Baseline visit or later will be subjected to study analysis.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc.) 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 22 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor   Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research)  
 Suggests that the resear ch places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of t he study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospital stay  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are tho se that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abuse,  a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospitalization  or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be 
considered serious.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded a s 
non-serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as 
the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment 
follow -up.  For thi s study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as 30 days following 
the last administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 23 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded  as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as 
an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject t o report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any ti me after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of 
the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a su bsequently conceived 
offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one 
of the following  conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormal ity is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequen t follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement 
for the study.

sponsor   Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalizatio n for therapy of the target disease of the 
study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as 
judged by the clinical investigator.  
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek info rmation on adverse 
events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all 
adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).   All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source 
document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followe d up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period 
and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation 
should be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adve rse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor must conform to the adverse event reporting 
timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible, 
but at a minimum those events that must be r eported are those that are:  
 related to study participation,  
 unexpected, and  
 serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided 
at the  time of the initial report includes:  
 Study identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset   Current status  
 Whether study treatment was 
discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
 Investigator assessment of  the 
association between the event and study 
treatment  
 
8.3.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and 
any type of serious adverse event, must be reported to the s tudy sponsor by telephone 
within seven days of becoming aware of the event .  To report such events, a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by the investigator and emailed or faxed

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  to the study sponsor within 10 days of becoming aware of the e vent  The investigator will 
keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  Report serious adverse events by 
phone and  email or  facsimile to:  
 
Susan Zieman, MD, PhD,  Phone: 301-496-6949 , email:  ziemans@nia.nih.gov  
 
Within the following 48 hours, the investigator must provide further information on the 
serious adverse event or the unanticipated problem in the form of a written  narrative .  This 
should include a copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event form, and any other 
diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new 
information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the study 
sponsor . 
8.3.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
This section descr ibes the requirements for safety reporting by investigators who are 
Penn faculty, affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety 
reporting to the Penn IRB. The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires 
expedited reportin g of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and 
indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not 
acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the 
criteria o utlined below.  The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the 
following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the event:  
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -
site or off -site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the 
opinion of the principal investigator is:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol -related d ocuments, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -
approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research 
procedures” if in the opinion of the principal investigator or sponsor, the event was 
more likely than not to be caused by the research procedures.)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported 
to the Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or 
Others Including Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including 
a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, 
follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation).  
 
Copies of each report and documentation of IRB notification and receipt will be kept in 
the Clinical Investigator’s study file.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor   
Reporting Deaths :  more rapid reporting requirements  
Deaths that occur during the course of a research study and that are:  
 Unexpected; AND  
 Related to the research study; AND  
 When other participants are believed to  be at an increased risk of harm  
 
Must be reported to the IRB within 3 days from the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the death .  
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause th e sponsor to modify  protocol or informed 
consent form, or would prompt other action by the IRB to assure protection of 
human subjects.  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, 
in terms of severity or frequency . For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Chang e to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to 
remain on the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by the research team.  
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the  IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opinion of the investigator placed one or more 
participants at increased risk, or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.3  Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
The study sponsor is required to report certain study even ts in an expedited fashion to 
the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 27 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  reports. The following describes the safety reporting requirements by timeline for 
reporting and associated type of event:  
 
 Within 7 calenda r days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life-threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when 
event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory ani mals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, 
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning  
similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the 
previous reports.  
 
Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format. If supplied 
as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above at the 
beginning of section 8.3. The contact information for submitting IND safety reports is 
noted below:  
 
Contact information pending IND submission  
 
8.4 Unblinding Procedures  
Any intentional breaking of the blind prior to study completio n, which may be necessary, 
for example, in the case of an SAE,  will be done in conjunction with the IDS, whose 
responsibility it will be to notify a designated member of the research team of the individual 
subject’s treatment assign ment. Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind prior 
to study completion will be documented and reported to the PI, CTRC, and the IRB within 
24 hours and the FDA within seven calendar days.  
8.5 Stopping Rules  
The study will be stopped if the fol lowing criteria occur:

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study 
sponsor  1. The PI discovers a condition or conditions that indicate unacceptable risk to the 
subjects.  
2. There is evidence of harm of study -related treatments or procedures to the subjects.  
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the  Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at 
his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and 
implementation of a site data an d safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the 
number and type of serious adverse events.  Additional medical monitoring will be 
performed by an external study monit or who is not an investigator in this study.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who wil l use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use a ll information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive) a t the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source d ata are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, 
and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records,

10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
Internal medical monitoring will be performed by Dr. Cappola, who will oversee the safety 
and validity of the study, according to the University of Pennsylvania Sponsor -Investigator 
Standard Operating Procedures. In addition, an external medical monitor who is not a 
study investigator will perform safety monitoring.  
 
Safety monitoring will include careful real -time assessment and appropriate reporting of 
AEs and SAEs. Safety assessments will be performed by the internal medical monitor 
after each subject has completed the study (baseline study visit through final visit  on 
treatment 2), and by the external medical monitor after the first, fifteenth, and thirtieth 
participants have completed the study. All subjects who experiences and/or discontinued 
due to AEs will be reviewed for key safety data. A final safety assessme nt will be 
performed within 3 months of when the last subject has c ompleted the study.  
 
As the Study Sponsor, the PI assumes responsibility to assure that study activities are 
being carried out as planned so that deficiencies can be identified and correcte d. This 
study will in addition be monitored by a clinical research professional from the staff of 
Clinical Research Coordinators working for other investigators at the University of 
Pennsylvania  who will be responsible to complete a monitoring process for this study .  
The designated monitor is not an active member of this stu dy team .  A CV for the monitor 
will be obtained and updated annually.  The CV will be kept on file in the Regulatory 
Binder.  The monitor  will receive a current protocol, most recent ly approved Informed 
Consent Form, and Case Report Forms prior to each monitoring visit.      
 
All CRFs for the first two subjects completed will be 100% source data verified.  In 
addition, CRF’s for the 10th, 20th, and 30th  subjects will be 100% source data verified  
upon study completion .  If a greater than 10% error rate is noted during the data review, 
the monitor will source data verify 100% of the data on a larger sample of active subjects  
following the monitoring visit.   The following variables will be 1 00% source data verified 
during the monitoring process:  
 Informed Consent  
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events  
 Prohibited concomitant medications.    
 Drug accountability ( IDS will be responsible for drug accountability. Resea rch 
staff will return all unused study drugs to IDS.

In addition, all subjects who discontinued for “lost to follow -up” or other reasons will be  
100 % source data verifi ed.  All monitoring activities completed by the internal study 
monitor will be record ed on the OHR approved subject review checklists. Monitoring  
activities cited above will be documented by the monitor in a written report to the PI so 
that appropriate corrective actions may be implemented as indicated and the report 
submitted will be filed in the Regulatory Binder.  
 
 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the 
EC/IRB, the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and 
quality assurance groups of all stu dy related documents (e.g. source documents, 
regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will 
ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc .). 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality 
assurance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted acc ording to US and international standards of Good 
Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization 
guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
 
This protocol and an y amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted 
independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement 
with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of 
the EC/IRB concerning th e conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator 
and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this 
study.  The investigator should provide a list of EC/IRB members and their affiliate to the 
sponsor.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and 
providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.  See Attachment 1 for a copy of the Subject Informed Consent 
Form.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by 
the EC/IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB -approved 
consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the 
investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.

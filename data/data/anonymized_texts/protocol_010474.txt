 2 PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Two signatures of the microenvironment were recently identified that are predictive of 
outcome in patients with newly diagnos ed DLBCL treated with R -CHOP. These 
signatures, called ‘stromal 1’ and ‘stromal 2’, are associated with genes expressed by 
infiltrating mononuclear cells. The stromal 2 signature, which includes genes associated 
with angiogenesis, is predictive of an infer ior outcome. Based on these observations, we 
are interested in targeting the reactive cells in the microenvironment as a therapeutic 
strategy in patients with relapsed and refractory DLBCL. Along the same principles, we 
are also including patients with rel apsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The surrounding 
reactive cells around Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells are now not thought to be 
bystander cells and they appear to provide important survival signals to HRS cells.  
• CD52 is one such promising target that is h ighly expressed in most of these infiltrating 
cells and on most DLBCL although not on HRS cells specifically. Anti -CD52 antibodies 
may have therapeutic value by depleting reactive B and T  cells, and monocytes from the 
microenvironment.  
• The dose of alemtuzu mab in combination with DA -EPOCH is 30 mg IV, as determined 
by a prior study done in patients with untreated peripheral T -cell lymphoma. The main 
toxicities of this combination are myelosuppression and opportunistic infections.  
• An important component of th is study will be to obtain tumor tissue for gene expression 
profiling and to assess microenvironment signatures and look at other molecular 
signatures and targets before treatment and in patients who progress and ultimately 
correlate response and outcome w ith these various end -points.  
Objective:  
• Assess response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL and Hodgkin Lymphoma.  
Eligibility:  
• Previously treated or refractory classical large B -cell lymphomas, Grey -zone lymphoma 
and Hodgkin lymphoma , including  Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin  Lymphoma 
(LPHL) . 
• Age ≥ 18 years with adequate organ functions.  
• HIV negative and no active CNS lymphoma.  
Study Design:  
• Patients will receive 30mg of Alemtuzumab on day 1 of therapy, followed by Rituximab 
on day 1 and dose -adjusted EPOCH chemotherapy days 1 -5, up to six cycl es of therapy.  
• Tumor biopsies will be done before treatment, after 1 cycle of therapy and at relapse.  
• It is anticipated that up to 10 -15 patients per year may be enrolled onto this trial. Thus, 
accrual of up to 52 patients is expected to require approximat ely 4-5 years .

 5 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective   
Assess response , progression free survival  (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in relapsed/refractory 
DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objective  
Correlate clinical outcomes with  microenvironment/stromal molecular signatures by gene 
expression profiling and i mmunohistochemistry on study and at rel apse after DA-EPOCH -RC. 
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Hypothesis   
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non -Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL) – although the addition of rituximab to anthracycline -based chemotherapy has 
significantly improved th e outcome of patients with the disease, it remains incurable in up to 
50% of cases. We are interested in building upon insights from the molecular characterization of 
DLBCL, which includes the identification of three distinct subtypes (ABC, GCB and PMBL) b y 
gene expression profiling – these subtypes are associated with different prognoses  1. This has 
paved the way for the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific pathways. 
Indeed, we recently demons trated that the ABC type may be preferentially targeted (when 
compared to the GCB type) by the addition of bortezomib to anthracycline -based c hemotherapy 
2.  
Recent work led by Dr. Staudt’s group has identified two signatures of the microenvironment 
that are predictive of R -CHOP outcome in DLBCL3. These signatures, called stromal 1 and 
stromal 2, are associated with genes expressed by infiltrating mononuclear cells including 
macrophages, natural killer cells, T -cells and myeloid cells. The stromal 2 signature,  which 
includes genes associated with angiogenesis, is predictive of an inferior outcome.  Based on 
these observations, we are interested in targeting the microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy.  
 
The microenvironment is  usually tumor  dependent and ma y involve  tumor -induced interactions. 
It is comprised of tumor cells, stroma, blood vessels, infiltrating inflammatory cells and a variety 
of other associated tissue cells. Potential strategies include targeting the infiltrating “normal” 
cells and/or tumor  angiogenesis. We hypothesize that targeting the infiltrating cells more 

Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 6 specifically is a potentially important strategy because  the microenvironment may  promote 
tumor survival through multiple mech anisms, such as  angiogenesis  and pro -survival signals.  
Immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment include those mediating adaptive 
immunity, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells and occasional B cells, as well as effectors of innate 
immunity, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and natural killer cells4. Although 
various immune effector cells  (e.g. cytotoxic T lymphocytes)  are recruit ed to the tumor site , their 
anti-tumor functions may be downregulated  in response to tumor -derived signals. This is because 
the tumor microenvironment is enriched in regulatory T cells (T reg), tumor -associated 
macrophages  (TAM)  as well as myeloid suppresso r cells (MSC )5-7. All three immune cell types 
act in concert to  promote tumor growth and suppress immune cell functions.  It has been 
proposed that NF -κB pathway plays a key role in activation of signaling in cancer  cells as well as 
tumor -infiltrating  leukocytes. NF -κB activation in these cells lead s to secretion of TNF -α or 
other pro -inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. IL-6 and IL -8) which are responsible for cell 
proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor -cell migration (see f igure below)  8, 9. 
 
 
Regulatory T cells (T reg) are capable of suppressing proliferation of other T cells in the 
microenvironment through contact -dependent mechanisms or IL -10 and TGF - secretion10-12. 
Likewise, TAMs inhibit lymphocyte functions through release of inhibitory cytokines such as 
IL-10, prostaglandins or reactive oxygen species (ROS)  13, 14. Myeloid suppressor cells (MS C) 
are bone marrow -derived immature dendritic c ells15. They , on the other hand,  promote tumor 
growth and suppress immune cell functions thr ough copious production of an enzyme involved 
in L-arginine metabolism, arg inase 1, which synergizes with inducible nitric oxide synthase  
(iNOS)  to increase superoxide and nitric oxide  production , thereby blunting lymphocyte 
responses16

A promising therapeutic target is CD52 which is highly expressed on most DLBCL, including 
both ABC and GCB types, and on many of the infiltrating cells (monocytes, macrophages , 
dendritic cells  and myeloid precursors ) in the mic roenvironment (Gene Expression Profiling of 
CD52 shown below). Furthermore, Rodig et al.  reported CD52 expression by 
immunohistochemical techniques in 75% of DLBCL17. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We are also interested in investigating the efficacy of this combination in patients with relapse d 
or refractory  Hodgkin lymphoma  (HL) . Hodgkin's lymphoma is characterized by an infiltration 
of many different types of cells of the immune system into the lymphoma tissue, including T 
cells, B cell s, plasma cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells, such that the Hodgkin reed 
Sternberg (HRS) cells themselves usually represent only about 1% of cells in the tumor . There is 
evidence that many of the cells are actively attracted by HRS cells. For e xample, HRS cells 
secrete CCL5 (RANTES), CCL17 (TARC) and CCL22, which attract T H2 cells and T reg cells18-
20. The secretion of IL -5, CCL5, CCL28 and granulocyte –macrophage colony -stimulating factor 
by HRS cells pre sumably causes the recruitment of eosinophils into the Hodgkin's lymphoma 
microenvironment. CCL5 additionally attracts mast cells. HRS cells also secrete IL -8, which 
attracts neutrophils. These reactive cells are not bystander cells, as previously thought.  By 
contrast, they frequently provide survival signals to HRS cells21.  The role of the 
microenvironment in supporting the survival and growth of HRS cells is best illustrated by the 
difficulty of establishing HRS -derived cell lines. Several observations indicate that HRS cells are 
dependent on survival signals received from other cells: it is difficult to grow HRS cells in 
culture; HRS cells do not survive in immunodeficient mice; HRS cell s are rarely found in 
peripheral blood; and, even when they metastasize into non -lymphoid organs, they are embedded

Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 8 in their typical microenvironment22. Some examples of these survival signals include triggering 
of CD40 signalling23, activation of transmembrane activator and cal cium -modulator and 
cyclophilin -ligand interactor (TACI) and B -cell maturation antigen (BCMA) through production 
of their ligand APRIL by neutrophils 24, and perhaps activation of CD30 through CD30L -
expressing mast cells and eosinophils 25 26.  
    
HRS cells also orchestrate their cellular microenvironment to evade an attack by cytotoxic T 
cells or natural killer cells. A considerable fraction of infiltrating CD4+ T cells are Treg cells, 
which have been shown to have immunos uppressive activity on Hodgkin's lymphoma -infiltrating 
cytotoxic T cells  27. HRS cells may further modulate their cellular microenvironment by shifting 
the T H response from an anti -cellular T H1 response to a humora l TH2 response, which often has 
tumor -promoting activities. HRS cells also produce the immunosuppressive cytokines IL -10 and 
TGF , and galectin 1 and prostaglandin E 2, which inhibit T -cell effector functions 28, 29 30. 
Therefore, it is ironic that the host’s own immune cells are providing survival factors to the 
malignant  cells, creating an ‘immune -betrayal’ phenomenon. Elimi nating these reactive cells 
from the microenvironment may deprive HRS cells from critical survival factors and may lead to 
their growth arrest and death. CD52 is not expressed by HRS cells; however, anti -CD52 
antibodies may have therapeutic values in HL by  depleting reactive B and T  cells and monocytes 
from the microenvironment. Therefore, alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to CD52, is a very 
interesting drug to investigate in both these diseases, given the high CD52 expression in DLBCL 
tumor cells and in t he surrounding microenvironment of both these tumors.  
Over the past few years, we have been conducting a study of alemtuzumab in combination with 
DA-EPOCH in untreated peripheral T -cell lymphoma (PTCL) and have determined the safe dose 
of alemtuzumab in co mbination with DA -EPOCH to be 30 mg IV31. The main toxicities were 
myelosuppression  and opportunistic  infections.  
Based on our hypothesis, we wish to investigate this combination (DA -EPOCH -RC) in patients 
with relapsed/refrac tory aggressive DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma . An important component 
of this study will be to obtain tumor tissue for gene expression profiling and to assess 
microenvironment signatures and look at other molecular signatures and targets bef ore treatment , 
after 1 cycle of therapy  and in patients who progress. Ultimately, we would like to correlate the 
 
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 9 response s and outcome s with these various end -points. Of the DLBCL subtypes, we are 
particularly interested in investigating the efficacy of th is combination in T -cell rich DLBCL and 
in elucidating the molecular signature of these tumors and correlating that with response. These 
tumors have not been well molecularly characterized and may significantly benefit from the 
addition of alemtuzumab.  
1.2.2 EPOCH in Relapsed lymphomas  
The dose-adjusted EPOCH  (DA-EPOCH)  regimen was initially studied  in 131 patients with 
relapsed or re sistant  lymphomas32.  46% of the  group gen erally had a poor prognosis as 
determined by a  high-intermediate or high International Prognostic Index ( IPI) scores. All 
patients were extensively pretreated having received a median  of 8 (1 -17) different  drugs . 57% 
of patients had received all 5  drugs of the DA-EPOCH regimen  and 88% had received at least 4 
of the agents.  All but 4 (6%) patients had previously received doxorubicin. Among 125 
assessable patients, 93 (74%) achieved objective responses, including 30 (24%) complete and 63 
(50%) partial responses.  To determine  if the infusional schedule increased efficacy, we analyzed 
the response to EPOCH in patients who showed no response to their last combination regimen 
(i.e. resistant disease) . In this group of 42 patients, 57% responded to EPOCH. Among patients 
with chemotherapy -sensitive disease, 8 3% responded with 33% complete responses as shown in 
the table  below.    
 
 
 
 
 
High -dose therapy with stem -cell transplant (SCT) is generally believed to provide the best 
outcome for patients with chemosensitive relapsed aggressive lymphomas . Hence  a clini cally 
important role for salvage chemotherapy is to cyto -reduce patients who  are candidates for SCT . 
In this study,  28 patients with aggressive lymphomas who had relapsed after CR, 89% responded 
to EPOCH, including 54% who had complete responses, and becam e potential candidates for 
SCT. Notably, a mong the 33 patients with sensitive aggressive lymphomas who did not receive a 
stem cell transplant, 18% were event -free and 37% were alive at 5 years, suggesting that EPOCH 
alone may provide effective salvage for a proportion of patients. Furthermore, 19 patients who 
had chemotherapy -resistant disease, 7 (37%) responded to EPOCH, including 1 CR.  Overall, 
patients had a median OS of 17.5 months with 41% and 26%, respectively, alive at 3 and 6 years, 
and a median EF S of 7 months, with 15% and 10%, respectively, event -free at 3 and 6 years . The 
main toxicities included  brief neutropenia, usually less than 4 days and occurring around day 10 
to 14 of treatment, and minimal gastrointestinal toxicity. Thrombocytopenia bel ow 50,000/ L 
occurred on 24% of cycles, and neutropenia occurred on 48% of cycles with hospitalization for 
neutropenia with fever on 18% of cycles.  There were three infection -related deaths. 
Neurological toxicity necessitating vincristine reduction occurr ed in 10% of cycles . Cardiac 
toxicity, a major limitation of doxorubicin, was rarely seen (3%  of patients ) despite no maximum 
allowable doxorubicin exposure. We observed a modest and clinically insignificant decline in the 
median EF over multiple cycles of  EPOCH; a paired t test (p 2) analysis comparing cycle 0 -1 vs. 
cycle 2 -3, cycle 4 -5 and cycle  6 revealed a difference of -2.58%, (0.13); -5.5%, (0.0038) and -

of EPOCH allow s delivery of 71%, 92%, 92% and 93% of planned cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine and etoposide, respectively.  
1.2.3 EPOCH -Rituximab in Relapsed lymphomas  
With the advent of Rituximab  and its addition to CHOP, that significantly improved  the outcome 
of DLBCL and R -CHOP soon became the new standard  in untreated DLBCL33-35. At our 
institution we have also shown that DA -EPOCH -R to be an effective therapy in untreated 
DLBCL. Jermann et al. reported th e use of EPOCH -Rituximab combination as salvage  therapy  
in a phase II study36. Patients with relapsed or refractory CD20 -positive large B -cell and mantle -
cell lymphoma were offered treatment with rituximab 375 mg/m 2 intravenously (i.v.) on day 1, 
doxorubicin 15 mg/m2 as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 2 -4, etoposide 65 mg/m2 as a 
continuous i.v. infusion on days 2 -4, vincristine 0.5 mg as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 2 -4, 
cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 i.v. on day 5 and prednisone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 -14. Fifty 
patients, with a median age of 56 years (range 23 -72), entered the study. Twenty -five had 
primary diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, 18 transformed large B -cell lymphoma and seven 
mantle -cell lymphoma. T he median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 1.7 (range one 
to four). The median number of treatment cycles was four (range one to six). Objective responses 
were obtained in 68% of patients (28% complete responses, 40% partial responses). Nineteen 
patients received consolidating high -dose chemotherapy with autologous stem -cell 
transplantation. The median follow -up was 33 months. Three patients developed a secondary 
myelodysplastic syndrome. The median overall survival was 17.9 months; the projected o verall 
survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 66, 42 and 35%, respectively. The median event -free survival 
was 11.8 months; the projected event -free survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 50, 30 and 26%, 
respectively.   
1.2.4 EPOCH -Bortezomib in Relapsed DLBCL  
We ha ve publis hed our results correlating the outcomes of the different molecular subtypes of 
DLBCL with DA -EPOCH -R37. We analyzed 72 untreated patients with GCB and ABC DLBCL. 
Similar to recent findings with R -CHOP, the ABC sub type tended to be associated with a worse 
PFS compared with GCB DLBCL.  These findings suggest that  DA-EPOCH -R outcome is 
impacted by the biology assoc iated with ABC subtype, possibly driven by NFκB  activation1, 38, 
39. 
To further study the hypothesis that inhibition  of NFκB might sensitize ABC but not GCB 
DLBCL to chemothera py. We did a study combining bortezomi b, a proteasome inhibitor, with 
DA-EPOCH  (DA-EPOCH -B) in 49 patients with relapsed  or refractory  DLBCL  to investigate if 
ABC compared to GCB DLBCL was more responsive to DA -EPOCH -B2. In vitro , bortezomib  
block s degradation of phosphorylated IκBα and consequently inhibited NFκB activity in ABC 
DLBCL c ell lines. The study was divided into 2 parts (see figure below) , in Part A patients 
received bortezomib alone if they were clinically able ; patients who progressed or was too ill to 
justify  bortezomib alone , they received DA -EPOCH -B in part B.

Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 11  
Among 23  patients in part A, there was only 1 partial response, indicating bortezomib alone has 
no activity. Overall, all 44 patients in Part B, 15 (34%) responded including 8 complete 
responses. Similar response rates were also seen in  the 27 patients with de nov o DLBCL . Among 
all patients with de novo DLBCL, the median survival was 8 months. However, when we 
analyzed the responses and overall survival in the de novo GCB and ABC DLBCL patients who 
received DA -EPOCH -B, there were significant differences between the  2 groups. The overall  
response rate was 13% in GCB DLBCL compared to 83% in ABC DLBCL (P = 0.0004). It was 
particularly striking that 41.5% of patients with ABC DLBCL achieved complete remission 
compared to only 6.5% for those with GCB DLBCL. The median o verall survival was 3.4 and 
10.8 months, respectively (P = 0.0026) for the ABC and GCB subtypes (see figure below). This 
study highlights the fact that because of genetic differences between the DLBCL subtypes, 
preferential activity to a targeted agent may  be seen in one particular subtype over another. This 
further underscores the importance of pairing molecular characterization and clinical outcome in

1.2.5 EPOCH -Alemtuzumab in untreated T-cell lymphoma s 
Alemtuzumab is a humanized antilymphocyte monoclonal antibody engineered by grafting the 
rodent hypervariable complementarily  determining regions into a human immunoglobulin 
molecule. It is directed at CD52, a 12 amino acid protein that is  highly glycosylated and linked to 
the cell membrane by phosphytidylinositolglycan linkage. CD52 is highly expressed on 
membrane lipid shafts of all B and T lymphocytes at most stages of differentiation (except 
plasma cells), as well as on monocytes, macro phages, eosinophils, natural killer cells and 
dendritic cells40-42. However, monocytes appear to be resistant to Alemtuzumab -mediated lysis. 
Monocytes disappear from the peripheral circulation but reappear shortly after treatment

 12 suggesting a sequestration without lysis or regeneration from a precursor pool that is CD52 -
negative. It is estimated that there are 5 x 105 antibody sites per lymphocyte and the antigen does 
not modulate from the cell surface. Alemtuzumab is thought to mediate cell lysis through 
complement43, 44 or antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity45-47. Recent studies have also 
shown Alemtuzumab may induce rapid  cell death in vitro through both a non -classic caspase -
independent48, 49 and caspase dependent pathways50, 51. The function of CD52 is not known but a 
recent paper suggest ed that CD52 may contribute to the activation of T -regulatory cells52.  
The combination of  Alemtuzumab and DA -EPOCH chemotherapy  has been studied in 29  
patients with untreated CD52 -positive T -cell lymphomas6. A sin gle infusion of Alemtuzumab 
(30, 60, or 90 mg) was given over 12 hours before each cycle of chemotherapy; patients were 
premedicated with prednisone 12 hours before the Alemtuzumab infusion was initiated. DA-
EPOCH was initiated immediately following comple tion of the Alemtuzumab infusion. Toxicity 
during the first cycle of treatment was used to determine Alemtuzumab dose escalation.  Patients 
were treated with escalated doses of Alemtuzumab in cohorts of three patients; 4 patients were 
treated with 30 mg, an d subsequent cohorts were treated with 60 and 90 mg. All but 3 were stage 
III or IV at presentation.  
Among the 28 patients evaluated for response there were 15 complete remissions, 8 partial 
remissions, 2 progressive disease s and 4 who were not evaluable for response.  The median 
duration of complete response is 9 months with nine patients in continuous complete remission 
for 3 -58 months.   Most patients experienced grade 1 –2 allergic and infusional reactions 
manifested as fever, chills, and urticaria. How ever, 4 patients developed  bone marrow aplasia 
that prevented further treatment,  1 patient at the 30mg dose level, 1 patient at the 60 mg dose 
level (cycle 3 and 5) and 2 p atients at the 90 mg dose level (cycle 4 and 5) of Alemtuzumab. 
Three of these four patients were CMV antigen positive and were treated with oral or intravenous 
ganc iclovir. There was more myelosuppression in patients treated with campath and EPOCH 
compa red with those treated with EPOC H alone, 29% vs. 8% had platelet counts of less than 
25K, 100% vs. 60% for grade 4 neutropenia, 35% vs. 15% incidence of febrile neutropenia. But 
with the 30 mg dose of Alemtuzumab myelosuppression was equivalent to that observed with 
EPOCH alone or in combination with rituximab.  
We evaluated the ability to dose escalate EPOCH chemotherapy in patients treated with 
Alemtuzumab and found that there was no significant difference in dose escalation or reduction 
with the regimen.  All but one patient developed grade 4 lymphopenia. Documented infections 
were common  and the most common pathogens detected were viral with 20 patients 
experiencing viral infection or reactivation.  The most common virus detected was 
cytomegalovirus that was generally asymptomatic and detected only by a positive CMV PCR 
reaction.  Another  viral pathogen not commonly seen with EPOCH alone or with rituximab was 
hemorrhagic cystitis associated with BK virus infection in the urine, occurring in 8 patients, 
which resolved despite continued treatment. Four patients had rising EBV DNA titers in t he 
blood but there were no cases of EBV lymphoproliferative disease.  Two patients had 
reactivation of HSV despite prophylaxis.  Other viral infections included influenza, rotavirus and 
respiratory syncytial virus.  Bacterial infections, both gram positive  and gram negative, occurred 
in 11 patients with staphylococcal infections as the most common organism isolated.  Four 
patients had fungus isolated but only one was thought to have tissue invasion. Four patients died 
during treatment with Alemtuzumab and E POCH.  Two patients died of neutropenic sepsis, one 
died of disseminated toxoplasmosis, and one had a witnessed cardiac arrest during EPOCH

 13 chemotherapy infusion that was thought to be related to cardiac arr hythmia. The 30 mg dose 
level of Alemtuzumab appe ars safe to administer in combination with DA -EPOCH and there has 
been no bone marrow suppression that prevented completion of therapy in any patient treated at 
the 30 mg dose of Alemtuzumab.  Based on the results of this study, the 30mg dose was chosen 
as the treatment dose for Alem tuzumab in our current study and we have also incorporated CMV 
and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis routinely for all patients.  
1.2.6 EPOCH in Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma  
The EPOCH infusional regimen has also shown to be effective and well to lerated and should be 
considered as salvage therapy prior to stem cell transplant or for palliation in patient with 
incurable Hodgkin lymphoma. We performed a study in 54 patients with relapsed/refractory 
Hodgkin lymphoma53. Patients received fixed dose EPOCH chemotherapy (etoposide 200 
mg/m2, vincristine 1.6 mg/m2 (no cap) and doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 CIVI x 96 -hrs D1 -4; 
cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV D5 and prednisone 60 mg/m2 daily  D1-6) with G -CSF q21 
days.  Histology included nodular sclerosis 34 (64%), mixed cellularity 3 (25%), and lymphocyte 
depleted 5 (9%) classical HL, and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL 1 (2%). Most of the 
patient had advanced disease, with stage III  in 11 (21%) and IV in 30 (56%). In addition, 24 
patients (45%) had more than 2 prior regimens. Overall, 44% of patients achieved complete 
remissions, and a progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 41% and 21% 
respectively, with a media n follow -up of 68 months. The median progression -free (PFS) and 
overall survivals (OS) are 10 and 40 months at 68 month s median follow -up. Among 33 pts who 
underwent stem -cell transplant , median PFS was 15 mo nths. 
Combination of Rituximab and chemothera py in Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma : CD20 antigen is 
infrequently expressed by HRS cells . The approach of using rituximab to deplete the CD20+ B 
cells from the HL microenvironment  was studied by investigators from MD  Anderson . A total of 
22 heavily pretreated pat ients with classical HL were treated with 6 -weekly doses of rituximab, 
of whom six demonstrated CD20 expression by HRS cells. In all, five  patients (22%) achieved 
partial or complete remissions and eight additional patients had stable disease54. In a follow -up 
study, the same investigators combined rituximab with ABVD chemotherapy to treat patients 
with newly diagnosed classical HL, and with gemcitabine to treat patients with relapsed classical 
HL In the first study , 52 patients with classical HL were treated with rituximab plus ABVD55. 
With a median follow -up of 32  months, the estimated event -free survival (EFS) was 82% and 
overall survival  100%. Importantly, the EFS was improved for all risk categories:  for patients 
with a prognostic score of 0 –1 the EFS was 92%, for scores 0 –2, EFS was 86% and for scores 3 –
5, it was 73%. These data are encouraging, but has not been confirmed in a randomized trial. In 
the second study, rituximab was combined with gemcita bine for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory classical HL56. The median number of prior treatment regimens was four 
(range one to six) and 17 (65%) were refractory to their last regimen. Of the patie nts studied, 
14 patients (54%) had received prior SCT, and 21  patients (81%) were previously treated with 
platinum -based therapy. Treatment was reasonably well -tolerated, with the most frequent 
toxicity being thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. A total of 13  patients (50%) responded to 
rituximab plus gemcitabine therapy, regardless of CD20 expression by HRS cells. These results 
compared favorably with the reported single agent activity of gemcitabine in less heavily 
pretreated patients.  
Targeting the microen vironment with DA -EPOCH -R-C is a novel approach. We hypothesize that 
eliminating the reactive cells from the microenvironment may deprive malignant cells from

 14 critical survival factors leading to cell death. Therefore, an important aspect of this study is to 
further understand these interactions which may lead to the identification of new molecular 
signatures and targets. Ultimately, the goal of this approach is to improve outcomes in patients 
with relapsed/refractory aggressive DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma.

 16 3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a phase II trial of Alemtuzumab  in combination with DA-EPOCH -R given every 21 days 
for a total of 6 cycles of treatment .  Six cycles of therapy will be administered based on clinical 
response evaluation.  If a patient has progressive disease at any point during therapy, he/she will 
be removed from protocol treatment.  Patients who are eligible for transplant will receive 2 
cycles beyond stable disease or stop when they achieve CR. Patients not eligible for transplant 
will receive 2 cycles beyond stable disease, or 6 cycles if they achieve CR.  
 
3.2 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION (VIA CENTRAL CATHETER ) 
3.2.1 DA-EPOCH -R-Alemtuzumab  Chemotherap y 
See also Appendix  1. 
Alemtuzumab  will be given on day 1 of each treatment cycle.  Patients will receive each 
treatment cycle  until unacceptable toxicity, documentation of disease progression,  complet ion of 
six cycles of therapy  or other reasons for patient withdrawal, whichever comes first.   
Patients should be pre -medicated as described in section 3.2.4 .  Alemtuzumab  will be 
administered as an IV infusion  over approximately 12 hours . Alemtuzumab  must not be 
administered via IV push or bolus.  If infusional toxicities are observe d, the infusion may be 
stopped for up to 60 minutes and resumed when toxicity resolved to baseline, or to grade 1 or 
less. If the p atient has not had resolution of infusional toxicities within 60 minutes, contact the 
investigator for guidelines on when to resume infusion.  
If anaphylaxis (Grade 4) hypersensitivity reactions occur, further treatment with Alemtuzumab  
will be discontinued .  Hypersensitivity reactions should be managed according to procedures 
outlined in Table 1. Meperidine  25 mg IV should be administered for treatment of patients with 
severe rigors.

 Treatment Guidelines  
Severity of Symptoms  Alemtuzumab  
Mild  • Stop Alemtuzumab infusion until the patient is evaluated.  
• Following evaluation, the infusion may be restarted under 
observation and monitor subject; complete Alemtuzumab infusion 
at the in itial planned rate.  
• Additional diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg oral may be administered at 
the discretion of the treating physician. Chills without rigors can be 
managed with warm blankets.  Localized cutaneous reactions 
such as mild pruritus, 
flushing, rash and  chills  
Moderate  
Generalized pruritus, 
flushing, rash, dyspnea, fever, 
chills, rigors, and hypotension 
with systolic blood pressure 
>80 mmHg  • Stop Alemtuzumab infusion  
• Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and monitor patient until 
symptoms resolve. Resum e Alemtuzumab at one -half the initial 
infusion rate after recovery of symptoms; if symptoms develop after 
restarting the infusion, the infusion should be stopped and no 
additional Alemtuzumab should be administered at that time.  
• Additional oral or IV antih istamine may be administered. A 
maximum dose of diphenhydramine of 100 mg in a 6 hour period 
should not be exceeded.  Rigors should be managed with IV 
meperidine 25 mg every 5 -10 minutes to a maximum of 100 mg.  
• Give oral diphenhydramine, 50 mg and acetami nophen 650 mg 30 
minutes prior to the next scheduled dose of Alemtuzumab.  
Severe or Any reaction such 
as bronchospasm, generalized 
urticaria, angioedema, or 
systolic BP 80 mmHg)  • Immediately discontinue Alemtuzumab infusion  
• Bronchospasm, hypotension unres ponsive to intravenous fluids, or 
angioedema may require administration of epinephrine 1 mg 
subcutaneously and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV or dexamethasone 20 mg IV, as 
needed, as well as supplemental oxygen.  
• Hypotension s hould be managed with intravenous fluids but if 
unresponsive may require more aggressive intervention such as 
phenylephrine infusion.  
• Monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.   
Anaphylaxis  
Defined as a reaction that is 
life threatening and requires 
pressor and/or ventilator 
support or shock associated 
with acidemia and impairing 
vital organ function due to 
tissue hypoperfusion  • Discontinue further treatment with Alemtuzumab  
3.2.2 Dose -Adjusted EPOCH -RC Regimen  
All patients initiate therapy at Dose Level 1 of DA -EPOCH -RC shown below.  Subsequent 
treatment doses are determined by hematological toxicity experienced on the previous cycle 
according to the dose -adjustment paradigm in Section 3.3.2 . Dose adjustment is ba sed on

Prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome will be administered at the discretion of the Principal 
Investigator according to institutional practice.  Hydration and ur ine alkalinization will be 
administered according to the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  
Premedicate 30 -60 minutes before rituximab infusion with  
• 650 mg acetaminophen PO  
• 50 mg diphenhydramine PO  
Rituximab infusion should begin immediately after t he Alemtuzumab  infusion has completed.  
See Section 9.2.4 for specific Rituximab administration instructions.  There will be no dose 
adjustments for Rituximab.  
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES  
3.3.1 Discontinue Alemtuzumab for : 
• Grade 4 non -hematological toxicit y other than easily correctable metabolic toxicities or 
infection.  
• Grade 3 infusional  or allergic  toxicity  
3.3.2 EPOCH Dose Adjustments   
3.3.2.1  Hematological Toxicity  
No dose adjustments at cycle 1 will be made for patients that have low neutrophil count or 
platelet count due to bone marrow involvement of disease. Drug doses may be modified from the 
following algorithm at the discretion of the investigator for severe life -threatening toxicity such 
as ICU admissions for sepsis. When two different rules give different a nswers for a particular 
dose decision, use the lower of the two dose options.  
3.3.2.2  Dose -Adjustment Paradigm  
            
• Dose adjustments above starting dose level  (level 1) apply to etoposide, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide  
• Dose adjustments below starting do se level  (level 1) apply to cyclophosphamide only.  
• Drug Doses based on previous cycle ANC nadir:  
 
➢ If Nadir ANC  500/l on all measurements   :         1 dose level above last cycle  
➢ If Nadir ANC  500/l on 1 or 2 measurements  :        Same dose level as  last cycle   
➢ If Nadir ANC  500/l  3 measurements (see* *) :         1 dose level below last cycle  
Or 
➢ If nadir platelet  25,000/l on 1 measurement  :         1 dose level below last cycle.  
• Proceed with the next cycle of therapy if  ANC  1000/l and pl atelets  75,000/l on day 21, 
and filgrastim was stopped 24 hours before begin ning treatment.  
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 20 • If ANC < 1000/ l or platelets < 75,000/ l on day 21, delay up to 1 week.  Filgrastim  480 
mcg every day may be started for ANC < 1000/ l and stopped 24 hours befo re treatment.  If 
counts still low after 1 week delay,  1 dose level below last cycle.  
**Important : Measurement of ANC nadir based on twice  weekly CBC only  and must be 3 
days apart .  Only use t wice  weekly CBC for dose -adjustment, even if additional CBC’s  are 
obtained.  
3.3.2.3  NON -HEMATOLOGICAL TOXICITY  
a. Sensory neuropathy

4  0 
b. Motor neuropathy  
Grade  Vincristine Dose (%)  
1 100 
2 75 
3 25 
4 0 
If neuropathy resolves to a lower grade, doses for that lower grade ma y be reinstituted at 
investigator discretion. If the grade of neuropathy increases after being re -escalated, doses must 
be reduced for the appropriate toxicity grade and may not be re -escalated, even if neuropathy 
resolves again to a lower grade.  
c. Hepati c Dysfunction   
Vincristine dose will be decreased for elevated bilirubin as follows:  
Bilirubin (mg/dL)  Vincristine Dose  
>1.5 - <3.0 decrease by 25%*  
≥ 3.0  decrease by 50%*  
Vincristine dose will be re -escalated as hyperbilirubinemia improves.  
d. Ileus  
Constipation commonly occurs in patients receiving vincristine so patients should 
receive stool softeners as indicated.  Occasionally, symptomatic ileus may occur and 
this should be treated with a vincristine dose reduction.  Because the severity of ileus 
is dose related, it is usually unnecessary to stop the vincristine altogether.  
Furthermore, because the therapy administered in this study is potentially curative, 
every effort should be made to not unnecessarily reduce vincristine doses.  The 
following gu idelines for symptomatic ileus on a previous cycle should be followed.       
1. Clinical ileus < 8 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting >2 days: Reduce vincristine dose 25%.  
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 21 2. Clinical ileus 8 -12 days with abdominal pai n requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting > 2 days: Reduce vincristine dose 50%.         
3. Clinical ileus > 12 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting > 2 days: Hold vincristine on next cycle.  May restart  at 50% 
reduction on subsequent cycle.  
Recommended Bowel Regimen – goal of at least one soft bowel motion every 24 
hours while on study  
Adults: Sodium Docusate 100mg capsule; take one to two capsules once a day Day 
1-7 of each cycle. If needed can double t he frequency to two capsules every 12 
hours. If needed add oral lactulose 15 -30 ml prn/ q 6 hourly  
e. Renal  dysfunction secondary to lymphoma  
Etoposide should be reduced 25% on cycle one for creatinine clearance < 50 
cc/min.  Etoposide should be returned t o full dose (or escalated if indicated) once 
creatinine clearance > 50 cc/min.  No other dose modifications for abnormal renal 
indices will be made for enrolled patients.  
f. Other Non -Hematological Toxicity  
Symptom grade  Management  
 grade 2  Treat symptoma tically  
 grade 3  Hold next dose until  grade 1 and, if  further therapy is 
medically indicated  
• Reduce by 1 dose level  
If further toxicity at the reduced  dose level  
•  reduce by another dose level  
After 2 dose reductions  
• patient will be removed from study  
 
3.3.3 Dose Modification for Obese Patients  
All dosing is based on the patient’s BSA as calculated from actual weight. There is no clearly 
documented adverse impact of treatment of obese patients when dosing is performed according 
to actual body weight.  Failure  to use actual body weight in the calculation of drug dosages will 
be considered a major protocol deviation.  
3.3.4 Rituximab Infusional -related Adverse Events  
Pretreatment for rituximab with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen using standard medical 
practice will be used in all patients. Side effects of rituximab may be infusion rate related and 
may be reduced by slower administration or premedication. Thus, dose reductions of rituximab 
will not be made. Rituximab will be discontinued for the duration of the cycles  in patients with 
grade 4 allergic reactions.  At the discretion of the PI, rituximab may be administered on the 
following cycles using slower infusion rates.

surgery  or requirement for general anesthesia . Standard techniques will be used for 
biopsies which may include CT and/or ultrasound guided biopsy. The pretreatment lymph 
node  biopsy will be used to perform all standard diagnostic tests. In addition , we will 
extract RNA and protein for research studies such as microarray.  If patient consent is 
obtained, t umor tissue may be stored for future research assays which are related to  this 
study and do not pose an increase in patient risk.  General anesthesia will not be 
performed to obtain biopsies for research purposes but may be necessary when biopsies 
are medically indicated. However, conscious sedation may be used to obtain researc h 
biopsies. If a biopsy needs to be performed for medical reasons under general anesthesia, 
the obtained sample might be used for research purposes.  
3.5 CONCURRENT THERAPIES (CONTINUED UNTIL CD4  COUNT IS >100 POST -TREATMENT )  
3.5.1 Pneumocystis jiroveci and Toxoplas mosis prophylaxis : Recommend ations:  
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 1 DS P.O. twice daily  for three days each week. 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday is the preferred schedule.   
• For patients who are allergic to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole : Alternatives include , 
in this order:  aerosolized pentamidine administered every 3 -4 weeks , atovaquone  
1500 mg orally once a day and lastly Dapsone 50 - 100 mg orally once a day  or 100 
mg orally  2x/week . Atovaquone should be taken with food for improved absorption.  
• Patients with p ositive toxoplasm a antibodies  should receive atovaquone  1500 mg 
orally once a day (instead of  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ) and have  their blood 
monitored on a weekly basis  for Toxoplasma gondii by PCR . Atovaquone should be 
taken with food for improved ab sorption .

4.2 CMV  ANTIGENEMIA  
Patient management will be handled on a case -by-case basis in conjunction with the inf ectious 
diseases service.  
4.3 FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA  
Febrile neutropenia is a life -threatening complication requiring urgent broad -spectrum 
antibiotics .  Management may be as an inpatient or outpatient depending on the clinical situation.  
4.4 SYMPTOMATIC ANEMIA  
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with appropriate red blood cell support, and is 
recommended if the hemoglobin falls below 8 mg/dl. Only irradiated leukodepleted blood 
products should be used.   
4.5 THROMBOCYTOPENIA  
Thrombocytopenia should be treated conserv atively.  In the absence of bleeding or planned 
invasive procedures, platelet transfusions should be given for platelets < 10,000/mm3.  If 
invasive procedures are planned or the patient develops bleeding, platelet transfusions should be 
administered in acc ordance with standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet count > 
50,000/mm3. 
4.6 CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS  (REQUIRED FOR EPOCH  ADMINISTRATION ) 
Possible lines include:  
• temporary internal jugular line (preferred);  
• PICC lines via the brachial vein;

 26 4.7 TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME (DOSE 1 ONLY )  
At the discretion of the principal i nvestigator, patients with high tumor burden may be treated 
with allopurinol 600 mg p.o. x 1 dose  followed by 300 mg p.o. daily for up to 7 days. 
Hospitalization with aggressive IV hydration and urinary alkalization may be used.  
4.8 GI PROPHYLAXIS  
Omeprazole 2 0mg p.o. daily is given to patients for the entire duration while patient is on 
chemotherapy.  
5 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTI ON 
5.1 PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLE COLLECTION  
Sample collection is outlined in Section 3.   
5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION  
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol.  Samples will be 
ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system .  Should a CRIS 
screen not be available, the CRIS downtime pr ocedures will be followed .  Samples will not be 
sent outside NIH without IRB notification and an executed MTA .  
5.2.1 Procedures for stored serum specimens   
The Clinical Support Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc ., processes and cryopreserves 
samples in  support of IRB -approved, NCI clinical trials.   All laboratory personnel with access to 
patient information annually complete the NIH online course in Protection of Human 
Subjects.   The laboratory is CLIA certified for CD4 immunophenotyping and all laborat ory areas 
operate under a Quality Assurance Plan with documented Standard Operating Procedures that are 
reviewed annually.  Laboratory personnel are assessed for competency prior to being permitted 
to work with patient samples.  Efforts to ensure protectio n of patient information include:  
• The laboratory is located in a controlled access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by 
laboratory staff at all times.    
• Hard copy records o r electronic copies of documents containing patient information are 
kept in the locked laboratory or other controlled access locations.     
• An electronic database is used to store information related to patient samples processed 
by the laboratory.    
• The dat abase resides on a dedicated program server that is kept in a central, locked 
computer facility.    
• The facility is supported by two IT specialists who maintain up to date security features 
including virus and firewall protection.    
• Program access is limite d to specified computers as designated by the laboratory 
director.   Each of these computers has a password restricted login screen.    
• The database sample entry program itself is accessed through a password protected entry 
screen.    

Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 27 • The database program has  different levels of access approval to limit unauthorized 
changes to specimen records and the program maintains a sample history.    
• Upon specimen receipt each sample is assigned a unique, sequential laboratory accession 
ID number.   All products generated by the laboratory that will be stored either in the 
laboratory freezers or at a central repository facility are identified by this accession ID.  
• Inventory information will be stored at the vial level and each vial will be labeled with 
both a sample ID and a vial sequence number.   
• Vial labels do not contain any personal identifier information.    
• Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transferred 
to the NCI -Frederick repository facilities for long term storage.  These  facilities are 
operated under subcontract to Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc .    
• Access to stored clinical samples is restricted.  Investigators establish sample collections 
under “Source Codes” and the investigator responsible for the collections, typica lly the 
protocol Principal Investigator, specifies who has access to the collection.  Specific 
permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples from a collection. 
Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by anyone ot her than 
the repository source code owner are submitted to the source code owner for approval.  
The repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted requests 
for sample withdrawal.   
• It is the responsibility of the Source Code h older (generally the NCI Principal 
Investigator) to ensure that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being 
used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.   
• The Clinical Support Laboratory does perform testing services that may be requested by 
clinical investigators including, but not limited to, immunophenotyping by flow 
cytometry and cytokine testing using ELISA or multiplex platforms.   
• When requests are submitted by the NCI investigator for shipment of samples outside of 
the NIH it is the po licy of the laboratory to request documentation that a Material 
Transfer Agreement is in place that covers the specimen transfer.  The laboratory does not 
provide patient identifier information as part of the transfer process but may, at the 
discretion of the NCI investigator, group samples from individual patients when that is 
critical to the testing process.    
• The NCI investigator responsible for the sample collection is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate IRB approvals are in place and that a Material Transfer Agreement has been 
executed prior to requesting the laboratory to ship samples outside of the NIH.   
5.2.2 Procedures for Collecting, Processing and Storing of Tumor Biopsies and/or Peripheral 
Blood Cells  
• Orders for tumor biopsies and research blood sam ples collections should be placed in 
CRIS (Clinical Research Information System, Clinical Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, 
MD)  
• Tumor biopsies will be submitted in native condition to the Department of Pathology, 
NCI, NIH and handled according to routine pro cedures. Material released for research 
studies will be documented on form NIH 2803 -1. Initial processing of samples for 
research will depend on the size of the tumor biopsy. For core biopsies the research 
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 28 sample will typically consist of 2 cores in a micr ocentrifuge vial snap frozen on dry ice. 
Surgical lymph node biopsies may in addition be processed for single cell suspension, 
additional vials of snap frozen tissue and OCT embedded tissue.  
• Tumor and normal blood cells may be viably frozen, typically at c oncentrations of 20 -
100x106/mL in FCS with 10% DMSO using a temperature controlled freezing process to 
optimize sample viability. Samples will be transferred to Nitrogen tanks for long term 
storage.  
• Tumor and normal blood cells can be further processed. A dditional purification may be 
carried out by selection with magnetic beads binding to appropriate surface molecules, 
typically CD19. For analysis cells may be lysed to obtain RNA (using Qiagen 
manufactured kits are similar) or proteins (salt and/or triton containing buffers with 
addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Integrity of RNA is monitored by gel 
electrophoresis and concentration of RNA or protein is measured spectrophotometrically.  
• Research sample inventory and storage: All research samp les are assigned a unique 
number and cataloged. Viably frozen cells are stored in a temperature controlled, alarm 
secured Nitrogen tank. Tumor biopsies and processed biologic material (RNA, protein) is 
stored at -80C in a temperature controlled, alarm secu red -80C freezer.  
• Tumor tissue may be stored by the NCI Department of Hematopathology for future 
research assays which are related to this study and do not pose an increase in patient risk.  
Tissue that is given to the technician will be assigned an acces sion number (HP#) in the 
HP Case Log book.    A Patient background sheet will be filled out and filed with any 
accompanying paperwork in the black notebook.   Final reports and any supplemental 
reports that follow will be added to these notebooks which are l ocated in Room 2N110.   
• Frozen Specimens:  Tissue snap frozen or embedded in OCT is wrapped in aluminum foil 
labeled with the patient's name and accession number (HP#), put into a zip -lock bag, and 
stored in liquid nitrogen freezer.   The liquid nitrogen fre ezers are monitored daily for 
temperature variations.  A FileMaker Pro data base  called HP Patient Information and 
Specimen Inventory is used for tracking the samples.  
5.2.3 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
Any specimens that are remaining at the completion  of the protocol will be stored in the 
conditions described below for an indefinite amount of time.  
The PI will report destroyed samples to the IRB if samples become unsalvageable because of 
environmental factors (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shipping container) or if a patient 
withdraws consent. Samples will also be reported as lost if they are lost in transit between 
facilities or misplaced by a researcher.  Freezer problems, lost samples or other problems 
associated with samples will also be reported to the IRB, the NCI Clinical Director, and the 
office of the CCR, NCI.  
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION  
6.1 DATA COLLECTION   
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in -house password protected 
electronic system (C3D) and ensu ring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The principal 
investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 29 with the data management efforts. All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be 
kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security 
standards. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be 
attributed to an individual human subject participant.  
All patients m ust have signed an Informed Consent and an on -study confirmation of eligibility 
form will be filled out before entering on the study.   
Complete records must be maintained on each patient; these will consist of the hospital chart 
with any supplementary inf ormation obtained from outside laboratories, radiology reports, or 
physician's records. These records will serve as the primary source material that forms the basis 
for the research record.  The primary source documentation will assure the following:  on -study 
information, including patient eligibility data and patient history; specialty forms for pathology, 
radiation, or surgery; and off -study summary sheet, including a final assessment by the treating 
physician.   
All adverse events ( AEs), including clinic ally significant abnormal findings on laboratory 
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until  return to baseline or stabilization of 
event. Patients will be followed for adverse events for a minimum of 30 days after removal from 
study  treatm ent or until off -study, whichever comes first. Serious adverse events that occur more 
than 30 days after the last administration of investigational agent/intervention and have an 
attribution of at least possibly related to the agent/intervention should be recorded and reported 
as per sections 7.2.   
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by any of the following:  
• Results  in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
6.1.1 Data Collection/Recording Exceptions  
As the toxicity profile  of EPOCH -R is well defined and published, grade 1 clinical adverse 
events will not be recorded in the database.  All hospitalizations, regardless of reason, will be 
recorded in the database with the reason of hospitalization and the duration of hospitaliz ation 
noted.  
6.1.2 Other Information  
End of study procedures : Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data : Should we become aware that a major bre ach in our plan to protect 
subject  confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.

 30 6.2 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
From the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for non -Hodgkin’s 
Lymphomas. Responses must last for at least 4 weeks off treatment.  
Complete Remis sion (CR) : Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic 
evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease related symptoms if present before therapy 
and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (for example LDH) definitely assignable 
to the lymphoma.  All lymph nodes must have regressed to normal size (less than or equal to 1.5 
cm in greatest diameter if > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 
1.5 cm in greatest diameter must have decreased to l ess than or equal to 1 cm or by more than 75 
percent in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters.  The spleen, if considered to be 
enlarged before therapy, must have regressed in size and not be palpable on physical 
examination.  The bone marrow m ust show no evidence of disease by histology.  Flow 
cytometry, molecular or cytogenetic studies will not be used to determine response.  Response 
must persist for 1 month.  
Complete response unconfirmed (CRu):  As per complete remission criterion except that  if a 
residual node is greater than 1.5 cm, it must have decreased by greater than 75 percent in the sum 
of the products of the perpendicular diameters.   
Partial Response (PR):   50% decreased in SPD of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. 
No increa se in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease.  Splenic and hepatic 
nodules must regress by  50% in the SPD.  Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a 
PR.    
Relapsed disease (CR, CRu) requires the following : Appearance of any n ew lesion or increase by 
≥ 50% in the size of the previously involved sites. Greater than or equal to 50% increase in 
greatest diameter of any previously identified node > 1 cm in its shortest axis or in the SPD of 
more than one node.  
Progressive disease (PR, non -responders) requires the following : ≥ 50% increase from nadir in 
the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs or non -responders. Appearance of 
any new lesion during or at the end of therapy.  
Stable Disease (SD):   is defined as less t han a PR but not progressive disease.  
ALL assessment of clinical response will be made according to the NCI guidelines.  The major 
criteria for judging response will include physical examination and examination of blood and 
bone marrow.  All laboratory stu dies that are abnormal prior to study will be repeated to 
document the degree of maximal response.  
6.3 TOXICITY CRITERIA  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be uti lized for adverse event reporting.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A list of 
adverse events that have occurred or might occur (Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks) 
can be found in Section 8 (Pharmaceutical Information).  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). Effec tive 
with Amendment G version date 05/08/2014, t he CTCAE version to be used for adverse event 
reporting was changed from version 3.0 to version 4 .0.

 31 7 SAFETY REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS/DATA AND S AFETY MONITORING 
PLAN  
7.1 DEFINITIONS  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
Any untoward medic al occurrence in a human subject, including a ny abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the 
subject’s participation in the research .   
7.1.2 Suspected  adverse reaction  
Susp ected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship b etween the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse  event caused by a drug.  
7.1.3 Unexpected  adverse reaction  
An adverse event or suspected advers e reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been  observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk inf ormation 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or  as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.  
7.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a  Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event  
An adver se event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any  of the following:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A conge nital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pat ient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 32 7.1.6 Disability  
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
7.1.7 Life-threatening adverse drug experience  
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator  or sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more  severe form, might have caused death.  
7.1.8 Protocol Deviation  (NIH Definition)  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved  research protocol . 
7.1.9 Non-compliance  (NIH Definition)  
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Pr ogram (HRPP) 
policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research 
subjects . 
7.1.10  Unanticipated Problem  
Any incident , experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investig ator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND

7.2.3 NCI-IRB Reporting of IND Safety Reports  
Only IND Safety Reports that  meet the definition of an  unanticipated problem  will need to be 
reported to the NCI IRB.  
7.3 DATA AND SAFETY  MONITORING PLAN 
The clinical research team will meet on a regular b asis when patients are being actively treated 
on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely  manner and reviewed by the principal investigator or a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, 
new information that might affect either the ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or 
protocol deviations will be immediately reported to the IRB using iRIS . 
The principal investigator will review adverse event and response data on each patient to ensure 
safety and data accuracy. The principal investigator will personally conduct or supervise the 
investigation and provide appropriate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the 
research staff.  
The monitoring of this study will be done by the PI/Lead associate investigator on an ongoing 
manner so a DSMB or Safety Monitoring Committee will not be used.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary objectives of this study will be to determine if there is a moderately large fraction of 
patients who exhibit a clinical response to EPOCH -RC in relapsed or refractory DLBCL and to 
evaluate the safet y and toxicity of this regimen.  
The study will be conducted as a two -stage Simon optimal design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical 
Trials , 10:1 -10, 1989) in order to rule out an unacceptably low 25% clinical response rate 
(PR+CR: p0=0.25) in favor of a targeted  rate consistent with 45% (p1=0.45).  With alpha=0.10 
(probability of accepting a poor regimen=0.10) and beta = 0.10 (probability of rejecting a good 
regimen=0.10), the study will initially enroll 14 evaluable patients, and if 0 to 3 of the 14 are 
able to have a response then no further patients will be accrued. Response will be evaluated after 
6 cycles or 18 weeks.  If 4 or more of the first 14 patients have a response, then accrual would 
continue until a total of 44 patients have been treated.   A temporar y pause in the accrual may be 
necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage is warranted. If there are 4 to 14 patients 
with a response in the total of 44 patients, then this would be an uninterestingly low rate, while if 
there were 15 or more pa tients of the 44 who have a response, this would be sufficiently 
interesting to warrant further study of this agent in these patients. Under the null hypothesis 
(25% response rate), the probability of early termination is 52%.  
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 34 At the end of the study, pati ents will be determined as to whether they are of ABC or GCB 
subtype, and exploratory evaluations will be made of the response rates in the two subtypes. In 
addition to evaluating clinical response, progression free survival and overall survival will be 
estimated using a Kaplan -Meier curve.  The results obtained in this study will be compared in an 
informal manner to those of other previous studies.  
Toxicity will also be evaluated and monitored as patients are accrued to the trial. If at any point 
in the ac crual to the trial, there are greater than 1/3 of patients who have an SAE, then the trial 
will suspend accrual, and the study will either be terminated or have the drug regimen modified 
to allow a safer outcome. It is anticipated that up to 10 -15 patients  per year may be enrolled onto 
this trial. Thus, accrual of up to 44 evaluable patients is expected to require approximately 3 -4 
years.  In order to allow for a small number of unavailable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set 
at 47.  
Effective with Ame ndment G, version date 05/08/2014, the accrual ceiling will be increased to 
52 to allow for continued enrolment of patients with relapsed T cell histiocyte -rich Diffuse Large 
B cell L ymphoma and  advanced Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma . This will a llow 
access to this potentially lifesaving treatment, for patients with these two histologies.   
9 COLLABORATIVE AGREEM ENTS  
No collaborative agreements (e.g., MTA, CTA, CRADA, etc.) apply to this protocol at this time.   
10 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTE CTION  
10.1 RATIONALE FO R SUBJECT SELECTION  
Large cell l ymphomas and Hodgkin Lymphoma affect all races and genders.  However, males are 
more likely than females to be affected and this will be reflected in the gender distribution of our 
cases.  This trial is directed at assessin g Alemtuzumab in combination with EPOCH -R 
chemotherapy.  We have selected patients with relapsed disease and have developed the trial 
design to recognize that some may be potentially curable and others are not.  Additionally, 
pregnant or nursing mothers ar e excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects of therapy.  
10.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Patients under the age of 18 are excluded because inclusion of an occasional younger patient will 
not provide generalizable information that would justify their i nclusion on this study. Pediatric 
patients with recurrent large B cell lymphoma are extremely rare and are treated on pediatric 
studies. In addition, tumor biopsies will be performed.   
10.3 PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT  
Adults unable to give  consent were  excluded from enro lling in the protocol.  However, re-
consent may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become 
decisionally impaired. For this reason and because  there is the prospect of direct benefit to 
subjects from treatment, including ongoing follow -up for detection of early relapse, all subjects 
will be offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute 
decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Hea lth Care and Medical Research 
Participation” . 
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 35 Note: The PI or AI will contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team  (ACAT)  for 
evaluation as needed for the following:  an independent assessment of whether an individual has 
the capacity to provide conse nt; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate 
when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate .  For those subjects 
meeting the above criteria that become incapacitated and do not have pre -determined substitute 
decision maker, the procedures described in MAS Policy 87 -4 and NIH HRPP SOP 14E for 
appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and 
(b) who do not have a legal guard ian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
10.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The potential benefits to the subject are that the patient may achieve a partial or complete 
remission.  The benefits of combinations of chemotherapy and monoc lonal antibodies may 
produce remissions that cannot be achieved with either approach alone.  The main danger to 
participants in this study is drug toxicity. Chemotherapy may produce bleeding or infectious 
complications as a result of chemotherapy -induced m yelosuppression. Alemtuzumab causes 
immunosuppression which may be made more severe as a result of combining it with 
chemotherapy.  
10.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
Patients eligible for this protocol may derive benefit from DA -EPOCH -R based on prior research 
resul ts. However, they will also be subjected to the toxicity associated with EPOCH -rituximab 
infusional chemotherapy, which include myelosuppression, stomatitis, numbness or tingling in 
the extremities, motor weakness, and the need for transfusion or hospitali zation due to  
complications of treatment noted.  There may be adverse effects due to the combination of agents 
that is not seen when either is given alone. But this potential toxicity of this combination is 
reasonable in relation to the potential benefit t o this group of patients who have treatable 
diseases. Additionally, the knowledge that will be gained from this trial is potentially important 
and may be of direct benefit to patients. Patients will require biopsies both to determine the 
diagnosis as well as for research purposes. Needle biopsy is minimally invasive and is typically a 
very safe procedure. The benefits of percutaneous biopsy often far outweigh the risks. However, 
as with all invasive procedures, certain risks do exist. Depending upon the sit e being biopsied 
and the type of biopsy being performed, risks can include infection of the biopsy area, 
development of a hematoma and bleeding. Rarely more significant complications can occur 
when structures near the biopsy target are entered with the nee dle (for example, puncture of lung 
or bowel). As far as possible surgical biopsies will not be performed unless medically indicated 
and will not be performed for research purposes. Surgical biopsy has some additional risks 
versus needle biopsy. Surgical bi opsy carries a small risk of mortality (due to risks of anesthesia) 
and causes moderate chances of bleeding, infection, wound healing problems. General anesthesia 
will not be performed to obtain biopsies for research purposes but may be necessary when 
biopsies are medically indicated. However, conscious sedation may be used to obtain research 
biopsies.  
The risks and benefits of participation for adults who become unable to consent during 
participation are no  different than those described for less vulnerab le patients .

 36 10.6 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
All patients are thoroughly screened for eligibility prior to admission onto this study. All patients 
age 18 and over, will read and sign the informed consent document prior to enrollment. Members 
of the pr otocol team will describe the protocol, alternative therapies, and risks and benefits of 
each to the individual signing the consent. The specific requirements, objectives, and potential 
risks and benefits will be discussed.  The informed consent document i s given to the patient, who 
is asked to review the document, discuss it with his/her family and write down questions to 
discuss with the principal investigator or treating physician.  The patient is informed that 
participation is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw at any time without loss of benefits 
without consequence.  The patient or their legal representative must sign the consent document 
prior to receiving any protocol related treatment. The patient will receive a copy of the signed 
consent.  
10.6.1  Telep hone re -consent  
The informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date the informed con sent. A witness to the subject’s signature will 
sign and date the consent.  
The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who 
will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was obtained via telephone.    
A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by the consenting 
investigator . 
11 PHARMACEUTICAL INFOR MATION  
• Qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe 
disposal of chemotherapeutic agents i n a self -contained, protective environment.  
• Discard unused portions of injectable chemotherapeutic agents that do not contain a 
bacteriostatic agent or are prepared with unpreserved diluents (i.e., Sterile Water for 
Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride f or Injection USP) within eight hours of vial 
entry to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.   
• The total administered dose of chemotherapy may be rounded up or down within a 
range of 5% of the actual calculated dose.

 37 11.1.2  Formulation   
Alemtuzumab causes the lysis of lymphocytes by fixing to CD52, a h ighly expressed, non -
modulating antigen on the surface of lymphocytes. It mediates the lysis of lymphocytes via 
complement and antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms.  
Alemtuzumab is supplied as a clear glass vial containing 30 mg Alemtuz umab  in 1 mL of 
solution (8.0 mg sodium chloride, 1.44 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.2 mg potassium 
chloride, 0.2 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.1 mg polysorbate 80, and 0.187 mg 
disodium edentate dehydrate). No preservatives are added. Each carton c ontains three 
Alemtuzumab vials (NDC 50419 -357-03) or one Alemtuzumab vial (NDC 50419 -357-01). 
11.1.3  Storage & Stability  
Vials of Alemtuzumab should be stored at a temperature of 2 -8°C and protected from light. The 
desired dose of 30 mg. should be drawn up into a syringe from the ampoule and further diluted in 
250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. The vial contains no preservatives and is intended for single 
use only; the vial should be discarded with any unused portion after 6 hours. An internal NIH 
Pharmacy (Pharmace utical Development Section) conducted study demonstrated 24 hour 
stability of Alemtuzumab when diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration range of 6.67 
mcg/mL to 120 mcg/mL at room temperature (Goldspiel JT, et.al. Stability of alemtuzumab 
solution s at room temperature. Am J Health -Syst Pharm, accepted for publication 2012). 
Alemtuzumab solutions prepared in the concentration range described above may be stored at 
room temperature (15 -30°C) for up to 24 hours. Alemtuzumab solutions should be protect ed 
from light.  
11.1.4  Administration  
The Alemtuzumab solution should be given IV over approximately 12 hours. Patients should be 
premedicated with 50 mg of diphenhydramine, 650 mg of acetaminophen and two 60 mg/m2 
doses of prednisone as indicated in section 3.2.4  before the infusion. During the alemtuzumab 
infusion, the patient’s vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respirations, temperature) should be 
monitored as follows:  
• During Cycle 1: every 15 minutes times 4 or until stable and then hourly until the 
infusion  is discontinued.   
• During subsequent cycles: one hour after infusion starts; then every 4 hours for the 
duration of the infusion, as long as patient is stable and has no signs/symptoms of 
reaction.  
11.1.5  Toxicity  
The majority of adverse events seen in trial have  been administration related and of short 
duration. Serious adverse events, some of which fatal, have been observed in association with 
treatment of Alemtuzumab  
Infusional reactions  occur in most patients. They commonly consist of rigors, fever, headache,  
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, rash, pruritus , dyspnea and hypotension. Acute infusional 
reaction may also include chills, abdominal and back pain, bronchospasm, angioedema, 
tachyarrhythmia  etc. These reactions are most prominent during the first dose of Alemtuzumab 
administration and improve with subsequent treatments. To reduce the frequency and severity of

 40 considered inapp ropriate, may receive subsequent rituximab doses at the Standard Rate 
for Subsequent Infusions, which is as follows:  
 
Begin at an initial rate of 100 mg/hour (50 mL/h) for 30 minutes. If administration is 
well tolerated, the administration rate may be esca lated gradually in 100 -mg/hour (50 -
mL/h) at 30 -minute intervals to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hour (maximum rate = 200 
mL/h) . 
CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.   
11.2.5  Toxicity  
The most severe serious adverse events associated with ritux imab include severe infusion 
reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, and severe mucocutaneous reactions. Severe infusion reactions 
consisting of hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial 
infarction, ventricular fibrillation o r cardiogenic shock may be fatal. Most reported fatal 
reactions occurred within 24 hours of the first dose of rituximab.  
Tumor lysis syndrome resulting in renal failure has been described, and occasional fatalities 
noted. Tumor lysis syndrome is more likel y in patients with high numbers of circulating 
malignant cells (≥ 25,000/µL).  
Severe mucocutaneous reactions associated with rituximab include Stevens -Johnson syndrome 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of these reactions has been from 1 -3 weeks.  
Less severe infusion reactions are common with rituximab. These include fever, chills, and 
dyspnea. The mechanism of rituximab infusion reactions is thought to be secondary to release of 
cytokines. If a reaction occurs, then the infusion should be stopped un til the symptoms resolve, 
and then restarted at a 50% slower rate.  
Recent reports describe hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and 
death in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab. The majority of 
these patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. The median time to 
diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after starting rituximab and approximately 1 
month after the last dose.  
11.3 DOXORUBICIN HCL

sensitivity to sunlight.  
Gastrointestinal:  nausea and vomiting (doxorubicin is generally considered moderately to highly 
emetogenic), anorexia, diarrhea, mucositis (stomatitis, esophagitis).  
Abbrev iated Title:   EPOCH -RC in recurrent lymphoma  
Version Date:   08/03/2018  
 41 Cardiovascular:  cardi omyopathy may occur and is related to total cumulative lifetime dose. The 
risk for cardiomyopathy increases with total doses > 450 mg/m2. ECG changes and less often, 
arrhythmias, are seen. Rarely, sudden death has occurred.  
Other:  Red discoloration of urin e for 24 -48 hours after drug administration. Doxorubicin is a 
vesicant and can cause tissue necrosis if extravasated, especially at the concentration usually 
employed for bolus injections (i.e., 2 mg/mL).  
Fluconazole should not be given during EPOCH infusi onal chemotherapy because of 
pharmacologic interactions

11.4.2  Toxicity  
Myelosuppression, predominantly neu tropenia and thrombocytopenia, is the most common 
toxicity associated with etoposide. Nausea and vomiting range from mild to severe in severity, 
depending on the dose. Mucositis is also more common at the dose used in this study. Alopecia 
is likely. Hypote nsion is associated with too rapid administration of etoposide. This would be 
unlikely to occur in this trial.  
Fluconazole should not be given during EPOCH infusional chemotherapy because of 
pharmacologic interactions  
11.5 VINCRISTINE SULFATE  
11.5.1  Availability  
Comm ercially available as a 1 mg/mL solution for injection in 1, 2, and 5 mL vials . Each ml 
contains 100 mg mannitol, 1.3 mg methylparaben, and 0.2 mg propylparaben. Drug should be 
stored at 2 -8oC and should be protected from light.  Please refer to the FDA -approved package 
insert for vincristine sulfate for product information, extensive preparation instructions, and a 
comprehensive list of adverse events.  
11.5.2  Toxicity  
The most common toxicity associated with vincristine is neurotoxicity. Peripheral manifestations  
of neurotoxicity include: numbness of extremities, paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes, 
neuropathic pain and muscle weakness. GI manifestations of neurotoxicity include constipation, 
and adynamic ileus. Cranial nerve manifestations include: diplopi a, hoarseness, tinnitus, jaw pain 
(the latter usually occurring with the first dose of vincristine). Orthostatic hypotension & SIADH 
may also be seen. Vincristine is a vesicant and may cause tissue necrosis upon extravasation. 
This is more likely with bolu s injections as opposed to dilute infusions.  
Fluconazole should not be given during EPOCH infusional chemotherapy because of 
pharmacologic interactions

 42 11.6 ADMINISTRATION OF VINCRISTINE /DOXORUBICIN /ETOPOSIDE  
Stability studies conducted by the Pharmaceutical De velopment Section, Pharmacy Department, 
NIH Clinical Center, have demonstrated that admixtures of vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
etoposide in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.9%NS) at concentrations, respectively, of 
1, 25, and 125 mcg/mL; 1.4, 35, an d 175 mcg/mL; 2, 50, and 250 mcg/mL; and 2.8, 70, 350 
mcg/mL are stable for at least 36 hours at room temperature when protected from light. Also, 
admixtures containing vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide concentrations of 1.6, 40, and 200 
mcg/mL are s table for at least 30 hours at 32°C.  
For this study, etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine comprising a daily dose (a 24 -hour 
supply) will be diluted in 0.9%NS. Product containers will be replaced every 24 hours to 
complete the planned duration of infusi onal treatment. Product volumes will be determined by 
the amount of etoposide present in a 24 -hour supply of medication. For daily etoposide doses 
≤130 mg, admixtures will be diluted in approximately 500 mL 0.9%NS.  For daily etoposide 
doses >130 mg, admix tures will be diluted in approximately 1000 mL 0.9%NS.  
Etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine admixtures will be administered by continuous IV 
infusion over 96 hours with a suitable rate controller pump via a central venous access device.  
11.7 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE  
11.7.1  Availability  
Commercially available as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in 100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, 1 
gram, and 2 gram vials . Please refer to the FDA -approved package insert for cyclophosphamide 
for product information, extensive preparation instruct ions, and a comprehensive list of adverse 
events.  
11.7.2  Preparation  
Reconstitute with appropriate amounts of Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9%NS) to produce a 
solution with final concentration of 20 mg/ml.   
11.7.3  Storage & Stability  
Intact vials should be stored at roo m temperature storage (not to exceed 30oC). Reconstituted 
solution is stable up to 6 days if refrigerated (2 -8oC).  Discard solution after storage for 24 hours 
at room temperature . 
11.7.4  Administration  
Cyclophosphamide will be diluted in 100 mL of 5% Dextrose In jection or 0.9%NS and infused 
over 30  minutes. Hydration Guidelines:   All patients should receive 0.9%NS  at the following 
volumes (based on cyclophosphamide dose levels) and rates with half the specified volume given 
before starting cyclophosphamide admini stration and half the volume given after completion of 
the cyclophosphamide administration.

 43 Cyclophosphamide  
Dosage Levels  Fluid Volume and Administration Rate  
1 & 2  1000 mL 0.9%NS  @ 300 – 500 mL/h  
Levels 3, 4, & 5  2000 mL 0.9%NS  @ 300 – 500 mL/h  
Leve ls 6 2500 mL 0.9%NS  @ 300 – 500 mL/h  
11.7.5  Toxicity  
Myelosuppression, hemorrhagic cystitis (patients must be well -hydrated before, during, and after 
treatment and have adequate renal function). Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 
(SIADH), fatigue, a lopecia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hyperuricemia, azo ospermia, 
amenorrhea, cardiotoxicity (myocardial necrosis) usually at doses higher than those used in this 
study.  
11.7.6  Drug Interactions  
Cyclophosphamide undergoes metabolic activation via cytochrome P450 3 A4 in the liver and 
may potentially interact with any drug affecting the same isoenzyme. Inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., 
itraconazole) could theoretically inhibit activation and inducers of 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin) could 
theoretically enhance activation of cyclophos phamide to active a lkylating species. For the most 
part, such interactions have not yet been documented clinically.  
11.8 PREDNISONE  
11.8.1  Availability  
Commercially available in a large number of oral dosage strengths including pills and liquid 
formulations. Please r efer to the FDA -approved package insert for prednisone for product 
information, and a comprehensive list of adverse events.  
11.8.2  Storage & Stability  
Tablets, solutions and syrup should be stored in tightly closed containers at temperature s 
between 15 -30oC. 
11.8.3  Admi nistration  
• Oral.  Prednisone utilization will be simplified by using only 20 - and 50 -mg tablets to 
produce individual doses and by stratifying prednisone doses by a patient’s body surface area 
(BSA), as follows:  
BSA (m2) Each Dose  
1.25 – 1.49 80 mg

 50 13.2 APPENDIX  2: EPOCH  ADMIXTURE , PREPARATION : AND ADMINISTRATION   
Preparation  
All 3 -in-1 admixtures dispensed from the Pharmacy will contain a 24 -hour supply of etoposide, 
doxorubicin, and vincristine, PLUS  40 mL overfill (excess) fluid and a proportion al amount of 
drug to compensate for volume lost in parenteral product containers and administration set 
tubing.  
Etoposide Dose  Volume of Fluid 
Containing a Daily Dose  Volume of Overfill  
(fluid + drug)  Total Volume in the Product  
(including overfill)  
≤ 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 568 mL 
> 130 mg 1056  mL 40 mL 1096  mL 
Before dispensing 3 -in-1 admixtures, Pharmacy staff will:  
 [1] Purge all air from the drug product container,  
 [2] Attach an administration set appropriate for use with a portable pump,  
 [3] The set will be primed close to its distal tip, and  
 [4] The set will be capped with a Luer -locking cap.  
Pre-printed product labeling will identify the ‘Total Volume To Infuse’ and the ‘Volume of 
Overfill (fluid + drug)’.  
Bags will be exchanged daily for four cons ecutive days to complete a 96 -hour drug infusion 
(unless treatment is interrupted or discontinued due to un -anticipated events).  
Administration  
Portable pumps used to administer etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine admixtures will be 
programmed to deliver  one of two fixed volumes at one of two corresponding fixed rates based 
on the amount of etoposide and fluid that is ordered (see the table, below).

≤ 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 22 mL/hour  
> 130 mg 1056  mL 40 mL 44 mL/hour  
* DO NOT attempt to infuse the overfill.  
 
At the end of an infusion, some residual fluid is expected because 
overfill (excess fluid and drug) was added; however, nurses are 
asked to retu rn to the Pharmacy for measurement any drug 
containers that appear to contain a greater amount of residual drug 
than expected.   
Example at right:  The amount of fluid remaining in a bag after 
completing a 24 -hour infusion (1056  mL delivered).

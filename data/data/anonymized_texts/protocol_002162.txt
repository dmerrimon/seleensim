SUMMARY OF CHANGES , AMENDMENT 3 
The main reason for amending the 5F9006 protocol is to remove the requirement 
that patien ts have received liposoma l doxor ubicin therapy prior to entering Part 2 
this study. 
The following substan tial change has been made to Section 4.1 ( Inclusion Criter ia): 
• Inclusion Criterion 1 for Study Part 2 has been modified to remove the 
requirement that patients have received prior liposomal doxorub icin therapy 
and spec ify that patien ts must have documented PD, as determined by 
Gyneco logic Cancer lnterGroup (GCIG ) Criteria (Rustin 2011 ), within 
1-6 months after the last day they received the last platinum contain ing 
chemotherapy. 
Rationale: To simpli fy the enrollment of a homogeneous group of patients 
with pl atinum resistant ovarian cancer and allow more patients to potentially 
participate in the study by remov ing the requirement for prior doxil therapy. 
The following additiona l changes have been made to the protoco l in this 
amendmen t: 
• Specified that T3 (T otal) is to be measured (Table 7-1 and Table 7-2) and 
added T3 (Total) and T4 (Free ) to the TSH assessment in Table 7-3 and the 
Analyte Listing (Table 7-5). 
Rationale: To accurately spec ify the tests being performed to measure 
thyroid function. 
• Reorganization and consolidation of safety language (Section 9, Assessmen t 
of Safety, and Table 7-3, Footno te "e"). 
Rationale: To provide more conc ise conten t and align language across 
Forty Seven Inc. protocols. 
Editoria l changes and updates to style and formatting have been made to improve 
clarity and consis tency throughou t the document. Changes made in sections of the

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor :  Forty Seven Inc.  
Investi gational Agents :  Hu5F9 -G4 in combination with avelumab  
Protocol Number :  5F9006  
Study Title :  A Phase 1b Trial of Hu5F9- G4 in Combination with Avelumab in Solid 
Tumor Patients and Checkpoint -Inhibitor -Naïve Ovarian Cancer Patients Who 
Progress within 6 Months of Prior Platinum Chemotherapy  
Scientific Rationale and Background  
Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of gynecologic cancer deaths in the 
United States.  Standard of care for this disease in the frontline and 
platinum -sensitive recurrent setting is platinum -based chemotherapy with or without 
antiangiogenic agents.  More recently, targeted agents such as poly adenosine- diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration for women with ovarian cancer (BRCA) mutations and/or alterations in the homologous recombination pathway.  Experience 
with newer immunotherapies in this disease, such as the checkpoint inhibitors, has 
not yet matured to impact clinical outcomes.  In women with recurrent ovarian 
cancer, the platinum -free interval (PFI), defined as the interval between the last 
platinum dose and the date of relapse ( Rustin 2011), is strongly correlated with the 
likelihood of response to subsequent chemotherapy.  Patients who initially respond 
to systemic therapy with a PFI greater than 1 month, but less than 6 months, have 
been historically referred to as platinum -resistant, and these patients have limited 
treatment options ( Davis 2014).  Thus, t he development of effective cancer 
treatments for this patient population would address a substantial unmet medical 
need.  
Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized anti -human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
to CD47 and blocks its interaction with its receptor, enabling phagocytosis of human 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 7 of 160  
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  cancer cells ( Liu 2015b ).  The  activity of Hu5F9 -G4 is primarily dependent on 
blocking CD47 binding to signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and not on the 
recruitment of Fc -dependent effector functions, although the presence of the IgG4 
Fc domain is required for its full activity.  For this reason, Hu5F9- G4 was engineered 
with a human IgG4 isotype that is relatively inefficient at recruiting Fc -dependent 
effector functions that might enhance toxic effects on normal CD47 expressing cells 
(Liu 2015b).  Preclinical studies using xenograft cancer models provide compelling 
evidence that Hu5F9- G4 triggers phagocytosis and elimination of cancer cells from 
human solid tumors and hematologic malignancies  (Liu 2015b).  Based on this 
mechanism of action (MOA) and its potent preclinical activity, Hu5F9- G4 is being 
developed as a novel therapeutic candidate for solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies.  
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have relapsed or are resistant to platinum -based chemotherapy have limited options for effective treatment and an 
overall poor prognosis ( Davis 2014).  Consequently, a well -tolerated immunotherapy 
combination that can induce anti -tumor responses  and prolong progression- free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) would be an important therapeutic advance in the management of disease in these patients.  Preliminary clinical data from 
Hu5F9- G4 monotherapy in patients with solid tumors suggest that  blockade of CD47 
may induce objective responses in heavily pretreated patients with ovarian cancer.  Furthermore, preclinical studies and our understanding of the mechanism of 
Hu5F9- G4 action suggest that targeting CD47 may generate substantial synergisti c 
anti-tumor activity when combined with programmed cell death- ligand  1 (PD -L1) 
checkpoint inhibitors.  Thus, the scientific rationale for exploring the efficacy of this 
combination in this setting is strong.

Hu5F9-G4 and avelumab in patients with solid tumors and checkpo int inhib itor-na'iVe 
ovarian cancer who progressed within 1-6 months of receiving platinum-containing 
chemo therapy . Checkpoint inhib itor-na'iVe patients are defined as those patients 
who have not been previo usly treated with an anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L 1, anti-PD-L2 , 
anti-CD137 , or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab , tremel imumab, or any 
other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-regulatory proteins ). 
in Part 2, mandatory 
pretrea tment and during -treatment biopsies will be collected as described in Protoco l 
Section 7.3.11. 
The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Evaluation /Safe ty Run-in) and 
Part 2 (Expansion in Ovar ian Cancer ), as follows: 
Part 1 -Dose Evaluation/Safety Run-in 
Patients with solid tumors will be treated at the starting dose with Hu5F9 -G4 + 
avelumab to examine the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of this study drug

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  combination.  The Safety Run- in Cohort will begin by treating 6 patients, up to a total 
of 12  patients evaluable for dose- limiting toxicity (DLT).  
The dose levels and schedules for both study drugs  are described in 
Synopsis  Table 2 .  Dose evaluation decisions will be made by the Clinical Trial 
Steering Committee (CTSC), and DLTs for the combination regimen will be 
monitored from administration of the priming dose on Day  1 to the end of Cycle 1 
(Day  35).  The first patient in each dose level cohort will be treated for 14 days prior 
to enrolling additional patients.  After the first 6 patients evaluable for DLT 
assessment have safely completed the Cycle 1 DLT evaluation period, and if no 
more than 1  DLT occurs, t he cohort will be deemed to be safe by the CTSC 
(Protocol Section  11.3) (Synopsis Table 2).  The recommended dose for patients in 
the Expansion Cohort must have a DLT rate less than 33% in at least 6 evaluable 
patients, and the final dose selection for Part 2 will be made by the CTSC after all available clinical, and PK data are reviewed.  Up to an additional 
6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in any cohort to further evaluate safety and PK.  
The first cycle will be 5  weeks in duration; subsequent cycles will last 4 weeks.  
Initial tumor response assessments will be performed at Cycle 3 and then after every 8 weeks of treatment (every 2  cycles).   
 
Dose -Limiting Toxicity Definition  
A DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater adverse event (AE) that is assessed as 
related to at least 1 study drug that occurs during the 5- week DLT Assessment 
Period, defined as the first 5  weeks of treatment for each patient. Additionally, any 
treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) that is, in the opinion of the CTSC, of 
potential clinical significance such that further dosing would expose patients to 
unacceptable risk, will be considered a DLT. Exceptions to the DLT definition are outlined in Protocol Section 3.2.1.2 . DLT assessment  is outlined in Protocol 
Section  3.2.1.

In Part  2, patients may be enrolled simultaneously without an observation period 
after the first patient starts treatment.  Based on review of ongoing dosing data, the 
CTSC may recommend testing of multiple doses in Phase 2 and each dose level 
tested will enroll a total of 20 patients .  In Part 2, mandatory tumor biopsies will be 
collected, where medically feasible, from all patients during the Screening Period 
prior to first dose and at Cycle 3, Day  1 (± 2 weeks).   
Efficacy will be evaluated using Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1; primary endpoint;  Eisenhauer 
2009) and Immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( irRECIST; 
secondary endpoint;  Bohnsack  2014).  Study treatment  may be continued until an 
unacceptable drug -related toxicity occurs or until disease progression according to 
irRECIST.  
Clinical Trial Steering Committee (CTSC)  
The CTSC will oversee the conduct of the clinical trial.  A  representative from the 
Sponsor, usually the Study Medical Monitor or designee, will chair the CTSC.  
The CTSC will have representation from each participating site in the study.  
The CTSC will review safety and efficacy data generated during the trial and make 
decisions about patient recruitment, trial management, initiation of protocol specific 
amendments, expansion of cohorts, using higher or lower dose levels, defining any 
new dose cohorts, identification of the recommended dose for Part 2

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Duration of Treatment  
Patients may continue treatment unless they develop unacceptable toxicities that 
cannot be clinically managed by dose or schedule modifications as outlined in 
Protocol Section  6.4, or if they have confirmed progressive disease (PD) according 
to irRECIST,  as described in Protocol Section  10.1.  Hu5F9- G4 and av elumab 
combination treatment may continue past the initial determination of disease 
progression according to irRECIST as long as the following criteria are met:  
• No new symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms  
• Tolerance of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab  
• Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (for example, central nervous system metastases)  
The decision to continue treatment should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 
and documented in the trial records.  
Overview of Assessments 
Assessments will be performed according to the schedules provided in Protocol 
Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table 7-2 , Table  7-3, and Table  7-4). 
Safety assessments include vital signs, physical exam, electrocardiograms, ECOG performance status score,  pregnancy testing (for female patients), AEs, laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum chemistries, urinalysis, and coagulation), monitoring of concomitant medications, and incidence of anti -drug (ADA) antibodies.  
Appropriate cancer staging assessments should be performed.  Response assessments will be by imaging to be conducted according to RECIST v1.1 and 
irRECIST as described in Protocol Section  10.1.  The same imaging modality used 
at Screening should be used throughout the study whenever possible.  
The first response assessment will occur at Cycle 3, Day 1 (±1 week).  After  Cycle  3, 
assessments will have a window of ±2 weeks.  Subsequent response assessments 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 15 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  will occur every 2 cycles.  Response assessment will be obtained at treatment 
termination, unless a prior radiographic assessment was performed within the past 
4 weeks or a prior response assessment showed documented confirmed PD.  
Tumor markers should be obtained at Sc reening ( Section 7.3.11).  If applicable, they 
should be obtained on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4.  From Cycle 5 and onward, they 
may be obtained every 2 cycles.

Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 kappa isotype 
containing a Ser -Pro (S -P) substitution in the hinge region (position 228) of the 
heavy chain to reduce Fab arm exchange.  Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized monoclonal 
antibody against CD47 which is administered intravenously (IV).  
Part 1 Dose:  The precise starting dose for Hu5F9- G4 wi ll be a priming dose of 
1 mg/kg in Week 1 followed by 30 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses.  Starting in Cycle 2, 
30 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 will be given every 2 weeks.  This Hu5F9- G4 dose will be 
combined with the full single- agent dose of 800 mg of avelumab given once  every 
2 weeks ( Synopsis Table 2).   Other doses and schedules may be tested as 
described above in Part 1:  Dose Evaluation/Safety Run- in. 
Part 2 Dose:  Once the Part 1 Safety Run- in Cohort of the trial is completed and the 
recommended expansion dose(s) is determined, the CTSC will open Part 2 of the 
study.  Part 2 of the study will treat up to 20 patients with ovarian cancer at the 
recommended dose (s) to confirm safety, PK, and to document 
preliminary efficacy in this population.   Each dose level tested in Phase 2 will enroll 
20 patients.

Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 22 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Combination Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Avelumab (BAVENCIO®) is a programmed death ligand- 1 (PD -L1) blocking 
antibody.  Avelumab is a human IgG1 lambda monoc lonal antibody that has a 
molecular weight of approximately 147 kDa.  
Part 1 Dose:  Avelumab will be administered IV at a fixed dose of 800 mg over 
1 hour ( ˗10 to +20 minutes) ( Synopsis Table 2).  Because of the different cycle 
lengths (due to the priming dose of Hu5F9- G4) Cycle  1 doses will be administered 
on Days 8 and 22, while doses in Cycles 2+ will be administered on Days 1 and 15.  
Drugs should not be co- administered through the same IV  line. 
Part 2 Dose:  Avelumab will be dosed based on the final dose selection that will be made by the CTSC after all available clinical,  and PK data are 
reviewed from Part 1.  
On days when both study drugs are given, Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at least 
1–2 hours after the completion of the avelumab in fusion.  
Study Endpoints  
The study objectives and endpoints are outlined above in Synopsis Table 1 . 
Statistical Methods and Analyses 
Safety :  The  statistical analysis will be descriptive, providing listings, graphical 
displays, frequencies, and percentages for discrete variables and/or the mean, 
standard deviation, median, and ranges for continuous variables.  Safety variables to be examined include DLTs for patients in Part 1, TEAEs (AEs 
worsening or occurring during or after a patient’s first exposure to study drug), 
study drug -related adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory, 
and ADA assessments.  AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA,  Version  19.0) and grouped by system organ 
class and preferred term.  Summary  tables will include the number and 
percentage of patients with AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), fatal  AEs, and 
other AEs of interest.

Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 23 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Data will be presented by Part 1 (Safety Run- in Cohort) and by Part 2 (Ovarian 
Cancer Expansion Cohort), and, where relevant, summarized across various 
dose cohorts.  
Efficacy :  The  efficacy analyses will include analysis of the outcome measures of 
overall response rate (ORR)  using RECIST and irRECIST , duration of response 
(DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression- free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS).  ORR will be summarized by frequency and percentages along 
with 95% exact confidence interval.  The time-to-event endpoints of DOR, TTP, 
PFS, and OS will be summarized using Kaplan- Meier methods.  Additional 
details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Pharmacokinetics:  Based on the distinct MOAs of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab, 
drug-drug PK interactions are not expected.  Thus, samples for PK analysis  for 
avelumab will be biobanked and will be analyzed based on CTSC recommendation.  Summaries of PK concentration data and PK parameters will 
be provided.  Due to the sparse sampling regime, it is anticipated that the 
maximum serum concentration (C
max) after the first dose will be the only 
calculable PK parameter in this population.  
Immunogenicity Analyses :  The  rate and magnitude of anti -Hu5F9 -G4 antibody 
positivity will be evaluated for all patients in Parts 1 and 2 of the trial, and for the pooled patient population.   
 
 
  Immunogenicity analysis may also be performed for avelumab.  
However, it is not expected that Hu5F9- G4 will impact the immunogenicity of 
avelumab and vice versa.

Sam
ple Size Determination : 
This trial will include a total o f up to 40  patients.  This sample size includes both 
Parts 1 and 2 of the study, allowing for patient replacement as defined in this 
protocol.  In Part 1, up to 12 - 18 patients will be treated in a Safety Run- in Cohort, 
assuming that no more than 2 DLTs in  each cohort of 6 patients occur.  Up to 
18 patients may be enrolled in Part 1 if some patients are ineligible for DLT 
assessment. 
Part 2 consists of a single expansion cohort in 20 ovarian cancer patients who will 
undergo safety, PK, .  Each dose level tested in 
Part 2 will enroll 20 patients.  This sample size will allow for confirmation of the 
safety profile of  Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab in this population, and the mandatory 
tumor biopsies .  The anti -tumor 
activity of this regimen will also be documented.  With this sample size, the lower 
bound of the 95% exact confidence interval would exclude 10% if the objective 
response rate is 30% or higher.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. Ovarian Cancer  
Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of gynecologic cancer deaths in the 
United States (US).  Standard of care for this disease in the frontline and 
platinum -sensitive recurrent setting is platinum -based chemotherapy with or without 
antiangiogenic agents.  More recently, targeted agents such as poly adenosine- diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for women with breast cancer 
susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations and/or alterations in the homologous 
recombination pathway.  Experience with newer immunotherapies in this disease, 
such as the checkpoint inhibitors, has not yet matured to impact clinical outcomes.   
In women with recurrent ovarian cancer, the platinum -free interval (PFI), defined as 
the interval between the last platinum dose and the date of relapse ( Rustin 2011), is 
strongly correlated with the likelihood of response to subsequent chemotherapy.  Patients who initially respond to systemic therapy with a PFI greater than 1 month, 
but less than 6 months, have been historically referred to as platinum -resistant, and 
these patients have limited treatment options ( Davis 2014).  Thus, the development 
of effective cancer treatments for this patient population would address a substantial 
unmet medical need.  
1.2. Study Drug:  Hu5F9 -G4, a CD47 -Blocking Antibody  
1.2.1.  CD47 Biology  
CD47 is a widely -expressed cell surface protein that regulates phagocytosis 
mediated by cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and dendritic 
cells.  CD47 binds to and activates a receptor on innate immune cells, signal 
regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which initiates a signal transduction cascade that 
blocks phagocytosis.  In this way, CD47 functions as a dominant inhibitor of phagocytosis by delivering a potent “don’t eat me” signal to phagocytic cells 
(Blazar  2001; Okazawa 2005) .  However, the complex process of phagocytosis 
depends on the relative balance of pro- phagocytic and anti -phagocytic inputs.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 37 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Most  normal cells, apart from aging red blood cells (RBCs) 
(Okazawa  2005; Oldenborg  2000), lack expression of corresponding pro- phagocytic 
signals ( Chao 2012; Jaiswal 2009; Majeti  2009), and, thus, are unaffected  by CD47 
blockade.  In contrast, most cancer cells express pro- phagocytic signals on their cell 
surface, many of which are not yet molecularly characterized ( Chao 2011b; 
Chao 2012).  As  a consequence, effective phagocytosis requires two distinct  events: 
a silenced CD47/SIRPα pathway coupled with a pro- phagocytic signal.  
CD47 is overexpressed in a broad range of human tumors, including ovarian cancer.  
The Weissman and Majeti laboratories originally identified increased CD47 
expression on leukemic stem cells (LSC) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
(Chao 2010b ; Majeti  2009).  The  increased expression of CD47 on cancer cells is 
presumed to prevent their phagocytic elimination by innate immune cells  
(Jaiswal 2009; Majeti  2009).  These observations have since been extended to a 
diverse range of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.  Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal (non- tumor) tissue revealed that CD47 is 
overexpressed by appr oximately  3.3-fold in a panel of solid tumors including ovarian, 
breast, bladder, glioblastoma, hepatocellular, prostate, and colon cancer 
(Willingham  2012).  In 2 distinct datasets derived from patients with ovarian canc er, 
tumor CD47 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels correlated with 
worse progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as shown in 
Figure  1-1.

B = Data from 83 ovarian cancer patients, hazard ratio for PFS = 6.6 (95% CI:  2.1—20.8).  
 
CD47 appears to be an indispensable means by which cancer cells, including 
cancer  stem cells, overcome intrinsic expression of their pro- phagocytic, “eat me,” 
signals ( Chao 2010b ; Chao 2012).  When CD47 is blocked from interacting with 
SIRPα (e.g., using an antibody to CD47), these pro- phagocytic signals dominate, 
enabling phagocytosis of the cancer cells, which results in the inhibition of tumor 
growth and metastasis ( Chao 2011b ; Chao  2010a ; Edris  2012a; Edris  2012b; 
Kim 2012 ; Majeti  2009; Willingham  2012; Liu 2015b).  In  addition to this direct 
anti-tumor effect, CD47 blo ckade also has the potential to induce an adaptive 
anti-tumor T -cell response through the cross -presentation of tumor antigens by 
macrophages and antigen- presenting cells following phagocytosis ( Tseng 2013; 
Liu 2015a ).  Thus, the inhibition of CD47 signaling is a promising therapeutic 
strategy for targeting tumors using the innate and adaptive immune systems.  
Most normal cells lack expression of pro- phagocytic signals and are unaffected by 
CD47 blockade.  RBCs are a notable exception because CD47 expression protects 
RBCs from elimination by splenic red pulp macrophages, as well as sinusoidal macrophages, in liver and bone marrow.  As RBCs age, they gradually lose CD47 
expression and reorganize membrane phospholipids in a manner that enhances 
pro-phagocytic signaling, ultimately leading to their elimination by phagocytosis.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  The Weissman laboratory explored the effect of CD47 blockade on erythrocytes in 
primates by using monoclonal antibodies that bind to and inhibit CD47 signaling 
(Liu 2015b).  Administration of CD47 -blocking antibodies accelerates the phagocytic 
process by substituting gradual loss of CD47 with immediate blockade of CD47 on aging RBCs, changing the bal ance between anti -phagocytic and pro- phagocytic 
signals in the RBC pool.  In nonclinical studies, the premature loss of aging RBCs is compensated by an ensuing reticulocytosis, and the initial anemia resolves as aged 
RBCs are replaced with younger cells.  Furthermore, in non- human primates, the 
risk of severe anemia is mitigated by the initial administration of a low, priming dose of anti -CD47 antibody that results in mild- to-moderate anemia and stimulates 
reticulocytosis.  In summary, antibody blockade of the CD47/SIRP α pathway serves 
as a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer.  
1.2.2.  Hu5F9 -G4 
Hu5F9- G4 is a humanized anti -human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds 
to CD47 and blocks its interaction with its receptor, enabling phagocytosis of human cancer c ells ( Liu 2015b ).  The  activity of Hu5F9 -G4 is primarily dependent on 
blocking CD47 binding to SIRPα and not on the recruitment of Fc -dependent effector 
functions, although the presence of the IgG4 Fc domain is required for its full activity.  
For this reason, Hu5F9 -G4 was engineered with a human IgG4 isotype that is 
relatively inefficient at recruiting Fc -dependent effector functions that might enhance 
toxic effects on normal CD47 expressing cells ( Liu 2015b ).  Preclinical studies using 
xenograft cancer mo dels provide compelling evidence that Hu5F9- G4 triggers 
phagocytosis and elimination of cancer cells from human solid tumors and hematologic malignancies ( Liu 2015b ).  Based on this mechanism of action (MOA) 
and its potent preclinical activity, Hu5F9- G4 is  being developed as a novel 
therapeutic candidate for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.  
1.2.3.  Preclinical Studies  
In preclinical models, anti -CD47 antibodies demonstrate anti -tumor activity against a 
broad range of human solid tumors (breast, ovarian, colon, glioblastoma and others)

(Majeti 2009; Chao 2011a; Chao 2010a; Chao 2011b; Kim 2012 ). In ovarian cancer 
laboratory models, anti-CD47 antibodies enhance the in vitro phagocytos is of 
ovarian canc er stem cells by macrophages and they also inhib it the in vivo growth of 
engra fted ovarian tumor cells (Figure 1-2).

1.2.4. Hu5F9-G4 Clinical Studies 
1.2.4.1. Summary of Hu5F9-G4 Clinical Safety 
As of 24 July 2017 , a total of 92 patients have been treated with Hu5F 9-G4 both as 
mono therapy and in comb ination. Dose levels evaluated to date are described in 
Section 1.6.1 , Starting Dose Rationale. 
Two mono therapy Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing. The first-in -human study, 
Study SCI-CD47-001 , is a Phase 1 dose esca lation trial of Hu5F 9-G4 in patients 
with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas . The Phase 1 study was designed to 
determine the optimal dose and schedule of Hu5F 9-G4 and to character ize its 
Forty Seven I nc. Confidentia l 
Hu5F9- G4

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics.  As of 24 July 
2017, this trial has treated 58 patients and dose escalation is ongoing.  The second 
study, Study  SCI-CD47 -002, is a Phase 1 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory 
AML and subsequently relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  
The second study was initiated to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to 
evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of Hu5F9- G4 in this patient 
population.  This trial has treated 14 patients as of 24 July 2017 and it is also 
ongoing.  
In monotherapy trials with Hu5F9- G4, the most common clinically relevant 
non-serious adverse drug reaction is an acute mild anemia observed after the fir st 
dose of study drug.  This clinical observation is consistent with the known MOA of Hu5F9- G4 and the physiologic role of CD47 in regulating the turnover of aging 
erythrocytes.  However, in solid tumor and lymphoma patients, the clinical impact of this anemia has been substantially mitigated using a priming and maintenance 
dosing strategy.  After an initial priming dose of 1 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 administered 
intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of Week 1, a rapid, predictable fall in hemoglobin level of 1.5 to 2  g/dL on average is observed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment.  
Beginning in Week 2, substantially higher maintenance doses of Hu5F9- G4 can be 
administered with no further effects on RBCs.  In solid tumor and lymphoma 
patients, this mild acute anemia is followed by a rapid, compensatory reticulocytosis 
and a gradual return of hemoglobin levels to baseline by Week  3 or 4, despite 
continued dosing.  In patients with AML with significant disease bone marrow infiltration, a similar mild acute anemia with an average hemoglobin decrement of 
0.5 to 2  g/dL is observed; however, these patients are easily managed with RBC 
transfusions despite continued treatment with Hu5F9- G4.  Other laboratory 
abnormalities associated with Hu5F9- G4 including reticulocytosis, spherocytosis, 
transient hyperbilirubinemia (predominantly unconjugated), and decreased 
haptoglobin are all indicative of extravascular hemolysis consistent with phagocytic 
removal of RBCs after CD47 blockade.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 42 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Another erythrocyte- associated drug effect is hemagglutination, which typically 
occurs within 24 hours of the first or second dose of Hu5F9- G4.  In solid tumor 
patients, this transient hemagglutination is observed less frequently beyond the first 
1 or 2 infusions.  The clinical relevance of this hemagglutination is uncertain, as it 
has not been correlated with any clinical signs or symptoms.  Because RBC 
agglutination may be related to the rapid rise in Hu5F9- G4 concentrations in 
treatment -naïve patients, the duration of the initial priming dose infusion may have 
relevance.  In solid tumor patients, a single 1- hour priming dose infusion of 1  mg/kg 
of Hu5F9- G4 was associated with hemagglutination in 6 out of 6 patients.  However, 
when the duration of the 1 mg/kg priming dose was extended to 3 hours in 
subseq uent patients, hemagglutination only occurred in 6 out of 14 patients.  
Currently, a 3- hour priming dose infusion duration is being used in all solid tumor 
and lymphoma patients; however, a shorter 2 -hour infusion duration is being used 
for subsequent maintenance doses.  In the AML trial, a 3- hour infusion is being used 
for all Hu5F9- G4 doses ≥1.0 mg/kg.  
Other common treatment -related adverse events (AEs) include headache, fatigue, 
nausea, photopsia, urine discoloration, low back pain, and abdominal pain.  
Common drug -related abnormal laboratory findings include transient reticulocytosis, 
spherocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia (predominantly unconjugated), D -dimer elevation, 
and decreased haptoglobin.  In solid tumor patients, the D -dimer elevation has not 
been any associated with any signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, microangiopathy, or thromboembolic disease.  
The majority of these findings occur following the first infusion with relatively fewer 
drug-related toxicities reported beyond the first cycle.  In solid tumor patients, 
maintenance doses of up to 30 mg/kg once weekly have been explored with dose 
escalation continuing.  Since the adoption of an Hu5F9- G4 priming and maintenance 
dosing strategy, no MTD level has  been identified.  In AML patients, twice- weekly 
treatments with Hu5F9 -G4 coupled with an intrapatient dose escalation scheme has 
also been well tolerated with no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) being reported to 
date.  Dose escalation is also ongoing in t he AML Phase 1 trial.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 43 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Two combination clinical trials have been initiated with Hu5F9- G4.  The first study 
(Study 5F9003) has treated 11 patients with NHL in combination with rituximab, 
while the second (Study 5F9004) has treated 9 colorectal cancer (CRC) or solid 
tumor patients with Hu5F9- G4 and cetuximab.  Both of these combination studies 
are continuing to escalate the doses of these agents in combination; an MTD has not been reached.  As of 24 July 2017, no new major toxicities of these 
combinations have been observed, and there is no evidence that Hu5F9- G4 alters 
the toxicity profile of rituximab or cetuximab.  
1.2.4.2.  Summary of Hu5F9 -G4 Clinical Pharmacology  
No formal clinical pharmacology trials have been completed with Hu5F9- G4; 
however, PK samples are being gathered from all patients in all ongoing studies 
after single and multiple doses.  As of October 2017, approximately 1200 PK 
samples from 58 patients in the ongoing solid tumor Phase 1 study (SCI -CD47 -001) 
had been analyzed using a validated enzyme- linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  
Samples are from Parts  A, B, or C of the protocol.  Hence, all patients were 
administered a single dose of 1 mg/kg (or less in Part A) on Day 1 of Week 1 
followed by the target dose (1, 3, 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg once weekly, thereafter) from 
Day 8 onward.  Patients in Part  C received 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 20 or 30 mg/kg in 
the week after priming dose followed by 20 or 30 mg/kg weekly afterwards.  Overall, 
the data indicated nonlinearity in the PK profiles over the dose range 0.3 –30 mg/kg; 
the terminal half -life was higher at the higher doses of 10– 30 mg/kg compared to the 
lower doses indicating potential target -mediated drug disposition.  Drug exposures 
were dose- proportional at doses ≥10 mg/kg and a typical antibody -like profile with 
extended hal f-life was seen at these doses.  
The PK also showed time- variance between the first and second doses at the dose 
of 1 mg/kg.  After the first dose of 1 mg/kg the maximum concentration (C
max) was 
approximately 0.7 mcg/mL, whereas that after the second dose of 1 mg/kg was 
approximately 10- fold higher.  On subsequent dosing, there were no further changes 
in the PK at this dose level.  Furthermore, at higher doses (3, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), the PK profile was roughly similar after the second and fifth doses, suggesting that 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 44 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  the time -variant PK only occurred at 1 mg/kg between the first and second weekly 
doses.  
As of June 2017, in the solid tumor Phase 1 study, 2 of 41 patients (4.87%) treated 
tested positive for anti -drug antibodies (ADA) against  Hu5F9- G4.  In AML 
(Study  SCI-CD47 -002), 1 out of 13 patients (7.69%) had confirmed ADA samples, 
but the impact on drug PK could not be ascertained due to the limited amount of 
available PK  data.  The samples have not yet been tested for neutralizing 
antib odies.  No unusual clinical toxicities have been observed in the patients with 
positive ADAs.  
1.2.4.3.  Summary of Hu5F9 -G4 Clinical Efficacy  
In the ongoing solid tumor Phase  1 clinical trial (SCI -CD47 -001), 5 patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer or related gynecologic tumors have been treated with 
doses of Hu5F9- G4 of 20 mg/kg or higher.  Doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg generate 
consistent trough Hu5F9- G4 serum concentrations greater than 100 mcg/mL, which 
was the minimum concentration threshold associated with preclinical anti- tumor 
activity (Forty Seven Inc., data on file).  Four of these five patients demonstrated a 
fall in CA125, commensurate with the start of Hu5F9- G4 monotherapy.  Two of 
these patients had confirmed objective partial responses (PRs).  Both were heavily pretreated with  including

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  shows monotherapy activity in ovarian and related gynecologic cancers; thus, an 
expansion of the clinical experience in this disease setting is warranted.  
In Study  SCI‐CD47 ‐002, 2 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated with 
Hu5F9- G4 10 mg/kg administered twice weekly have demonstrated marked 
reduction in bone marrow cellularity after 4 weeks of treatment.  One of these patients also had a greater than 50% reduction in the percent AML blasts in the 
bone marrow and this patient remains stable on treatment for over 44 weeks.  
Interestingly, this same patient demonstrated an increase in bone marrow infiltration 
by CD3 -positive lymphocyt es from 10 –15% to 40– 50% of bone marrow cells by 
Day 53 of treatment.  This provides preliminary support for the hypothesis that 
CD47 -blockade with Hu5F9- G4 may enhance an adaptive T -cell response to tumor 
antigens.  Such observations support the clinical evaluation of Hu5F9- G4 in 
combination with programmed cell death- ligand  1 (PD -L1) checkpoint inhibitors in 
clinical trials.  
Early evidence of anti -tumor activity for Hu5F9- G4 in combination with anti -tumor 
antibodies is also emerging.  In the 5F9003 NHL combination study, a heavily 
pretreated patient with follicular lymphoma treated with 10 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 
combined with standard doses of rituximab achieved a complete response (CR) and has remained on treatment for longer than 39 weeks.  In addition, objec tive 
anti-tumor responses were observed in 2 patients with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) treated with 20 mg/kg of Hu5F9 -G4 and rituximab including a CR and a 
PR.  Both previously received rituximab- containing regimens.  Finally, in the 5F9004 
solid tumor/CRC study, 1  CRC patient treated with 10 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 with 
400/250 mg/m
2 of cetuximab has achieved a confirmed PR.  Dose escalation in both 
the NHL and CRC combination trials are ongoing.  These emerging data suggest 
that combination regimens with Hu5F9- G4 are well tolerated and have potential for 
therapeutic benefit in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.  Thus, exploration of additional novel Hu5F9- G4 combinations with other monoclonal antibodies, 
including PD -L1 inhibitors, is warranted.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1.3. Preclinical Combination Studies  
Antibodies such as avelumab with an active Fc component may be optimal for 
combining with anti -CD47 targeting agents.  Avelumab can bind to PD -L1 on the 
surface of cancer cells, thereby providing an exogenous pro- phagocytic  signal that 
can be augmented by CD47 blockade.  In contrast, anti -PD-L1 antibodies that lack 
Fc component activity and anti -programmed cell death- protein 1 (PD -1) antibodies 
that do not bind directly to cancer cells do not provide enhancement of pro-
phagocytic signals.  This is demonstrated in preclinical studies, showing that the 
combination of avelumab with Hu5F9- G4 enhances antibody -dependent cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP) of PD -L1 expressing ES -2 ovarian cancer cells (Forty  Seven 
Inc., data on file;  Figure  1-3, left panel).  This occurs both at baseline and after 
treatment of cancer cells with interferon gamma (INFg) to enhance PD -L1 
expression.  However, when checkpoint signaling is blocked using other inhibitors 
such as an anti -PD-L1 antibody with a “dead” Fc component or an anti -PD-1 
antibody that does not bind cancer cells, no enhancement of phagocytosis occurs in combination with Hu5F9- G4 (Figure  1-3, right panel).  In contrast to avelumab, these 
other PD -L1/PD -1 inhibitors cannot provide additional pro- phagocytic signals.  
Currently this combination with avelumab has only been evaluated in this ovarian 
cancer model, but it has the potential to apply to other tumor types as well.  These 
data suggest that the unique combination of Hu5F9- G4 with avelumab may have 
additional beneficial anti -tumor properties that can be explored in the clinical setting.

1.4. Translational Studies Background  
Blockade of the CD47- SIRPα signaling axis on tumor cells by a monoclonal 
anti-CD47 antibody could lead to tumor elimination by activation of both the innate 
and adaptive immune system.  The anti-tumor activity of CD47 blocking antibodies is 
mediated by macrophages and other phagocytic cells of the innate immune system.  
Macrophages are a common immune cell infiltrate in many tumor types, with degree 
of intra -tumoral macro phage infiltrate correlating with clinical prognosis.  
The correlation between macrophage infiltration and clinical disease course is often 
dependent on the presence of either classically activated (M1) type macrophages 
that suppress tumor progression or alternatively, activated (M2) type macrophages 
that promote tumor progression ( Pollard  2004 ).  Given the frequent infiltration of

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  M2 macrophages in many tumor types and its role in promoting tumorigenesis, there 
is widespread interest in developing therapies that shift tumor macrophage 
polarization from the pro- tumorigenic M2 to the anti -tumorigenic M1 macrophages.  
In preclinical studies, anti -CD47 antibody -mediated tumor cell phagocytosis has 
been demonstrated to occur throug h both M1 and M2 macrophages ( Zhang  2016).  
In addition, in vivo treatment of human xenograft tumors with anti -CD47 antibody 
demonstrated increased M1 intratumoral macrophages post -treatment 
(Zhang  2016), suggesting that anti -CD47 antibody can also shift the phenotype of 
macrophages from the M2 towards the M1 phenotype in vivo.  Because the 
recruitment of macrophage effector cells is a key mechanism of anti -tumor activity 
for anti -CD47 antibodies, the characterization of macrophage tumor infiltration 
pre- and post -treatment may provide important insights into the degree of potential 
benefit seen in different patients and across various cancer subtypes.  
In addition to modulating the innate immune system, anti -CD47 antibody therapy 
also activates the adaptive immune system towards an anti -tumor response.  
Phagocytosis of tumor cells by phagocytes (macrophages and/or dendritic cells) 
leads to cross -presentation of tumor antigens to T  cells, enabling a T  cell anti -tumor 
response ( Tseng  2013 ; Liu 2015b).  In  one preclinical study, anti -CD47 antibody 
mediated a specific CD8 T  cell anti- tumor response without proliferation of regulatory 
T cells (which are generally thought to be tumor -promoting) ( Tseng  2013).  
Currently, there is intense interest in investigating the relationship between T  cell 
subsets that infiltrate the tumor and clinical response with the use of immune- oncology therapeutics.  Increased T  cell infiltration in th e tumor has been 
associated with clinical response in oncology patients treated with T  cell checkpoint 
inhibitors ( Tumeh 2014 ; Herbst  2014 ).  Given the role of anti -CD47 antibody in 
mediating an anti-tumor T  cell response, the clinical investigation of the contribution 
of T cell effectors to anti -CD47 antibody -mediated efficacy is important to define how 
the innate and adaptive immune systems interact in various patients.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1.5. Avelumab  
The PD -1 receptor and PD -1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD -L1, PD -L2) play integral roles in 
immune regulation.  Expressed on activated T cells, PD -1 is activated by PD -L1 and 
PD-L2 expressed by stromal cells, tumor cells, or both, initiating T -cell death and 
localized immune suppression ( Dong 1999; Freeman 2000; Dong 2002; Topalian 
2012a), potentially providing an immune- tolerant environment for tumor development 
and growth.  Conversely, inhibition of this interaction can enhance local T -cell 
responses and mediate anti -tumor activity as demonstrated in nonclinical animal 
models ( Dong 2002; Iwai 2002).  
In the clinical setting, treatment with antibodies that block the PD -1–PD-L1 
interaction have been reported to produce objective response rates of 7% to 38% in 
patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, with tolerable safety profiles 
(Brahmer 2012; Topalian 2012b; Hamid 2013).  Notably, responses appeared 
prolonged, with durations of 1 year or more for the majority of patients.  
Avelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 
isotype.  This anti -PD-L1 therapeutic antibody concept is being developed in 
oncological settings by Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany), its subsidiary, EMD Serono Research & Development Institute, Inc. (Billerica, MA, USA), and by Pfizer, 
Inc. (New York, NY, USA).  
Avelumab selectively binds to PD -L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with 
PD-1.  Compared with anti -PD-1 antibodies that target T -cells, avelumab targets 
tumor cells.  It is therefore hypothesized to have fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune- related safety issues, since the blockade of PD -L1 leaves the 
PD-L2 / PD -1 pathway intact to promote peripheral self -tolerance ( Latchman 2001).  
For additional details from the in vitro and nonclinical studies, refer to the current 
Avelumab Investigator’s Brochure (Avelumab IB).  
Avelumab is currently in clinical development in several ongoing Phase 1 to 3 clinical 
trials.  Avelumab is being investigated as a monotherapy or in combination with 
other anti -cancer treatments in patients with different types of malignancies.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 50 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  The clinical experience of avelumab, including its clinical activity, safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics, is currently based largely on data from Trial  EMR100070- 001, 
which is a Phase 1, open- label, multicenter trial being conducted in over 
1600 patients with solid tumors.  Study  EMR100070- 001 has 2 phases, a dose 
escalation phase and a treatment expansion phase, the latter recruiting patients in 16 different solid tumor expansion cohorts.  
Avelumab exposure parameters, including the C
max and the area under drug 
concentration curve (AUC), generally increased in an approximately 
dose- proportional manner.  The terminal half -life of avelumab increased with 
avelumab doses.  There was little accumulation of avelumab, which was consistent with the short half -life of avelumab.  
Clinical activity with avelumab has been observed in patients with different types of solid tumors.  In patients with recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer, avelumab 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and evidence of clinical activity 
(Disis  2016).  In 124 women participating in an ongoing Phase 1b avelumab study, 
12 achieved PR (9.7%) and 55 achieved SD (44.4%).  The median P FS was 
11.3 weeks and the OS was 10.8 months.  Additional details are provided in the 
Avelumab IB.  In addition, two large Phase 3 trials of avelumab in ovarian cancer are ongoing.  The first is a study of avelumab either in combination with or following 
carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in previously untreated epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer patients (JAVELIN Ovarian 100; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED];  Appendix A ). 
Available safety data for the avelumab program, which are summarized in the 
current IB, demonstrate an acceptable safety profile with 10 mg/kg of avelumab. 
The safety data from patients with different tumor types treated with avelumab 
suggest an acceptable safety profile of the compound.  Most of the observed events 
were either in line with those expected in patients with advanced solid tumors or with 
similar class effects of mAb blocking the PD -1/PD -L1 axis.  Infu sion-related 
reactions, including drug hypersensitivity reactions and immune- mediated adverse

hepatitis, immune- related endocrinopathies [thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency , 
new onset type I diabetes mellitus, pituitary disorders]), immune- related nephritis 
and renal dysfunction, and other immune- related AEs (myositis, myocarditis, 
Guillain -Barré syndrome, uveitis) have been identified as important risks for 
avelumab.  Detailed guidelines for the management of immune- related adverse 
events and infusion- related reactions have been implemented in all ongoing clinical 
studies with avelumab, including the current protocol ( Section 6.5.2 ). 
1.6. Starting Dose Rationale  
1.6.1.  Hu5F9 -G4 Dose  
The following starting Hu5F9- G4 dosing scheme is proposed for this study:  In Cycle 
1, a priming dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 of Week 1, followed by doses of 30 mg/kg on 
Day 8, 15, 22, 29 (Weeks 2- 5).  This is followed by doses of 30  mg/kg Q2W on Days 
1 and 15 beginning in Cycle 2.  
The safety and PK of Hu5F9- G4 has been explored in solid tumor and lymphoma 
patients using a priming and maintenance dose schedule (Forty  Seven Inc., data on 
file; Section 1.2.4).  In the ongoing solid tumor Phase 1 study, a dosing schedule 
that includes an initial priming dose of 1 mg/kg administered on Day 1 of Week 1, 
with 2  subsequent doses of 30 mg/kg in Week 2, followed by weekly doses of 
30 mg/kg beginning in Week 3, has been demonstrated to be safe as monotherapy.  
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been reached in any study with up to 
45 mg/kg of weekly dosing as monotherapy (Study SCI -CD47 -001; data on file at 
Forty  Seven Inc.).  Additionally, Hu5F9- G4 has been well -tolerated in combination 
with other monoclonal antibodies (including rituximab and cetuximab) with no MTD 
reached with up to 30 mg/kg  of weekly dosing.  After priming doses of 1  mg/kg, 
mean reduction of approximately 2 g/dL in hemoglobin was observed, followed by a 
rapid associated reticulocytosis.  CD47 receptor  occupancy (RO) assays also 
confirmed near 100% occupancy of CD47 on RBCs by Hu5F9- G4 at this dose.  
Thus, 1 mg/kg was identified as the optimal Hu5F9- G4 priming dose.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 52 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  In the solid tumor study (Study  SCI-CD47 -001), at doses of 30 mg/kg of circulating 
Hu5F9- G4, drug concentrations were in the range of 400 –1500 mcg/mL by the end 
of the first cycle —far exceeding concentrations associated with anti -tumor efficacy in 
preclinical xenograft models (100 mcg/mL; Forty Seven Inc. data on file) and also 
higher than the concentrations at 20 mg/kg (250 –900 mcg/mL), which was 
associated with objective responses in 2 patients.  Population PK modelling and 
simulation predicts that with the proposed dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg weekly 
loading doses followed by 30 mg/kg every 2 weeks maintenance doses, the 
steady -state concentrations will be in the range of 300 to 1000 mcg/mL.  This 
concentration range has been associated with objective response in 2 patients with ovarian cancer in Study  SCI-CD47 -001.  Model -predicted and observed receptor 
occupancy on peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) at these concentrations was 
near maximal.  The dose regimen of 30 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 every 2 weeks starting 
in Cycle 2  proposed for this study is expected to achieve optimal impact on the 
molecular target and be both safe and efficacious.  
This study proposes to evaluate the dose regimen described above, which is the recommended Phase  2 dose of Hu5F9- G4, in combination with standard approved 
doses of avelumab in a 12- patient Safety Run -in Cohort.  If the safety of this 
combination is confirmed, the regimen will be evaluated further in an expansion 
cohort of 20 ovarian cancer patients.  No synergistic toxicities for the 2 agents in 
combination are anticipated; however, if DLTs are observed at the initial starting dose, dose de- escalation of Hu5F9- G4 may be explored (as described in Section  3) 
to define an MTD.  
Further dose escalation to 45 mg/kg was performed in six patients and considered 
safe with no DL T’s in Study SCI -CD47 -001.  As such, if no DLTs are reported and 
Dose Level 1 is considered safe, the dose of Hu5F9 may be escalated to 45 mg/kg.  (See Table  3-1) in P art A.  The CTSC may recommend one or multiple doses and 
schedules to be tested in Part 2.  Each dose tested will enroll a total of 20 patients.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1.6.2.  Avelumab Dose  
To date, avelumab has been administered at the clinically active tolerable dose of 
10 mg/kg every  2 weeks  to more than 1800 patients across multiple indications.  
Furthermore, this 10 mg/kg every -2-week avelumab dosing regimen has been 
approved by the FDA as the first treatment for Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Urothelial 
Carcinoma .  Avelumab was originally dosed on a mg/kg basis in order to reduce 
inter participant variability in drug exposure.  However, emerging data for 
monoclonal antibodies, including the marketed PD -1 and PD -L1 immune checkpoint 
inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, r eveal that body 
weight -based dosing regimens do not result in less variability in measures of 
exposure over fixed (i.e., body -weight independent) dosing regimens ( Wang 2009; 
Freshwater 201 7; Zhao 2017 ).  Additionally, fixed dosing offers the advantages of 
less potential for dispensing errors, shorter dose preparation times in a clinical 
setting, and greater ease of administration.  
Population PK analysis was conducted based on the acquired data across 3 single -agent avelumab studies in more than 1700 patients with 14 different types 
of cancer.  Pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that exposures to avelumab across the available range of body weights are less variable with 800 mg every 2 weeks  
compared with 10 mg/kg every 2  weeks ; exposures were similar near the population 
median weight.  Low-weight participants tended towards marginally lower exposures 
relative to the rest of the population when weight -based dosing was used, and 
marginally higher exposures when flat dosing was applied.  However, the 
implications of these exposure differences are not expected to be clinically 
meaningful at any weight across the entire population.  Furthermore, the 800 mg 
every  2-week dosing regimen is expected to result in C
trough > 1 μg/mL required to 
maintain avelumab serum concentrations at > 95% target occupancy throughout the entire 2- week dosing interval in all weight categories.  
Therefore, in this clinical study, a fixed dosing regimen of 800 mg administered as 1-hour IV infusion every 2 weeks will be us ed for avelumab.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  1.7. Study Rationale and Risk -Benefit  
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have relapsed or are resistant or 
refractory to platinum -based chemotherapy have limited options for effective 
treatment and an overall poor prognosis ( Davis 2014).  Consequently, a 
well-tolerated immunotherapy combination that can induce anti -tumor responses and 
prolong PFS and OS would be an important therapeutic advance in the management of disease in these patients.  Preliminary clinical data from Hu5F9- G4 monotherapy 
in patients with solid tumors suggest that blockade of CD47 may induce objective responses in heavily pretreated patients with ovarian cancer.  Furtherm ore, 
preclinical studies and our understanding of the mechanism of Hu5F9- G4 action 
suggest that targeting CD47 may generate substantial synergistic anti -tumor activity 
when combined with PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors.  Thus, the scientific rationale for 
exploring the efficacy of this combination in this setting is strong.  
The clinically relevant overlapping toxicities that have been observed for both Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab are infusion- related reactions and immune- related AEs.  
Single -agent toxicity data are summarized in Section  1.2.4.1 for Hu5F9- G4 and in 
Section  1.5 for avelumab.  The safety risk of the proposed combination is not 
anticipated to be greater than that associated with the use of either of these agents as monotherapy.  However, because the preclinical safety experience with this 
combination is limited and there is potential for overlapping toxicity, data from a 
Safety Run- in Cohort will be evaluated before treating additional patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer.  
The combination of Hu5F9 -G4 and avelumab in patients with platinum -resistant 
advanced ovarian cancer has the potential to address an unmet medical need by enhancing anti -tumor activity with the expectation of a manageable safety profile.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open label, multicenter, Phase 1b trial investigating the combination of 
Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab in patients with solid tumors and checkpoint inhibitor -naïve 
ovarian cancer who progress within 1-6 months of receiving platinum -containing 
chemotherapy.  Checkpoint inhibitor -naïve patients are defined as those patient s 
who have not been previously treated with an anti -PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-L2, 
anti-CD137, or anti -cytotoxic T -lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) antibody 
(including ipilimumab, tremelimumab, or any other antibody or drug specifically 
targeting T -cell co -regulatory proteins).  The study will be conducted in 2  parts:  
Part 1 –Safety Run -in Cohort :  Patients with solid tumors will be treated at 
the starting dose with Hu5F9- G4 + avelumab to examine the safety and PK of 
this study drug combination.  
Part 2–Expansion Cohort :  Patients with checkpoint inhibitor -naïve ovarian 
cancer will be treated with Hu5F9- G4 + avelumab to evaluate the safety, 
efficacy, effects of this study drug 
combination.  
Patients may continue treatment unless they develop unacceptable toxicities that 
cannot be clinically managed by dose or schedule modifications as outlined in 
Section  6.4, or if they have confirmed PD according to Immune -related Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST;  Bohnsack 2014) as described in 
Section  10.1. 
Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab combination treatment may continue past the initial 
determination of disease progression according to irRECIST as long as the following 
criteria are met:  
• No new symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms  
• Tolerance of Hu5F9 -G4 and avelumab  
• Stable ECOG performance status  
CCI
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 58 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  • Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to 
prevent serious complications of disease progression (for example, central 
nervous system [CNS] metastases)  
If disease progression is due to brain metastasis, patients may continue avelumab 
treatment after the local treatment of the brain lesions provided that the above 
criteria are met in addition to the following and in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor:  
• Brain metastases have been treated locally and are clinically stable for at 
least 2  weeks prior to re- initiation of treatment with avelumab  
• There are no ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment 
of the brain metastases are acceptable)  
• Patients must be either off steroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 
mg daily prednisone (or equivalent)  
In addition, if disease progression is mainly due to a metastatic lesion (nodal  or 
visceral) which in the opinion of the Investigator may be surgically removed or 
treated with palliative radiation therapy, patients may continue avelumab treatment 
after the local treatment of such a lesion provided that:  
• It has been at least 2 weeks (post minor surgery) or 4 weeks (post major surgery) and the patient has fully recovered from the surgery  
• It has been at least 2 weeks since the patient’s last dose of radiation therapy 
and any toxicity related to the radiation therapy is recovered to <Grade 2  
The decision to continue treatment should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and documented in the trial records.  
A radiographic assessment should be performed after 4- 6 weeks of original PD to 
determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued PD.  
The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from 
continued treatment with avelumab.

Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 59 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  If the Investigator feels that the patient continues to achieve clinical benefit by 
continuing treatment, the patient should remain on the trial and continue to receive 
monitoring according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Section 7). 
Patients receiving avelumab who experience a CR should strive to be treated for a minimum of 12 months based on clinical judgement of benefit and/or until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, after confirmation of response.  In case a 
patient with a confirmed CR relapses after stopping treatment during long -term 
follow -up, but prior to the End of the Trial, 1 re-initiation of treatment is allowed at the 
discretion of the Investigator and agreement of the Medical Monitor.  To be eligible 
for re -treatment, the patient must not have experienced any toxicity that led to 
treatment discontinuation.  Patients who re- initiate treatment will stay on trial and will 
be treated and monitored according to the protocol and the “until progression” 
schedule in the Schedules of Assessments ( Section  7.1).  Patients who re- initiate 
treatment will not have to undergo a second screening visit.  
in Part 2, mandatory 
pretreatment and during treatment biopsies will be collected as described in Section  7.3.11.  
3.2. Part 1 Safety Run -in Cohort:  Study Design 
The Safety Run- in Cohort (Dose Level 1) will begin by treating 6 patients.  The 
precise starting dose for Hu5F9- G4 will be a priming dose of 1 mg/kg in Week 1 
followed by 30 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses.  Starting in Cycle 2, 30 mg/kg of Hu5F9-
G4 will be given every 2 weeks.  This  Hu5F9 -G4 dose will be combined with the full 
single -agent dose of 800 mg of avelumab given once every 2 weeks ( Table  3-1).  
The first patient in this cohort will be treated for 14 days prior to enrolling additional 
patients.  After the first 6 patients evaluable for DLT assessment have safely completed the Cycle 1 DLT evaluation period, and if no more than 1 DLT occurs, the 
cohort will be deemed to be safe by the Clinical Trial Steering Committee (CTSC; Section  11.3).  Dose Level 2 will begin by treating 6 patients with the Hu5F9- G4 
priming dose of 1 mg/kg in Week 1, followed by 45 mg/kg on Days  8,11,15, 22 and

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  29 for Cycle 1, continuing weekly in Cycle 2 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.  Starting in 
Cycle 3, 45 mg/kg of Hu5F9- G4 will be given every 2 weeks.  This  Hu5F9- G4 dose 
will be combined with the full single- agent avelumab dose of 800 mg given every 
2 weeks ( Table  3-1).  The first patient in each cohort will be treated for 14  days 
before additional patients are enrolled.  After the first 6 patients evaluable for DLT assessment have safely completed the Cycle 1 DLT evaluation period, the Clinical 
Trial S teering Committee (CTSC; Section  11.3) will again meet to determine the 
Part 2 dose. 
The recommended dose for patients in the Expansion Cohort must have a DLT rate 
less than 33% in at least 6 evaluable patients, and the final dose selection for Part 2 
will be made by the CTSC after all available clinical, and PK data 
are reviewed.  Up to an  additional 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled to further 
evaluate safety and PK.  The Part 1 dose levels are described in Table  3-1.  
Dose  evaluation decisions will be made by the CTSC, and DLTs for the combination 
regimen will be monitored from administration of the priming dose on Day  1 to the 
end of Cycle 1 (Day  35).  The first cycle will be 5  weeks in duration; subsequent 
cycles will last 4  weeks.  Initial tumor response assessments will be performed at 
Cycle 3 and then after every 8 weeks of treatment (every 2 cycles).   
  Additional assessments to 
evaluate pseudoprogression or to confirm objective responses, as required by irRECIST ( Bohnsack 2014), may also be impleme nted.  
The CTSC may designate additional lower or higher dose levels to explore beyond those described in Table  3-1 after reviewing all available clinical data.

3.2.1.  Dose -Limiting Toxicity Assessment  
Dosing decisions will be made by the CTSC based on the first 5 weeks of treatment 
for each patient, referred to as the “Dose- Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Assessment 
Period.”  
3.2.1.1.  Definition of DLT- evaluable Patients  
Patients in the Safety Run- in Cohort in Part 1 are considered evaluable for DLT 
assessment if they meet either of the following criteria during the DLT assessment 
period:  
• The patient experiences a DLT at any time after initiation of the first infusion 
of Hu5F9- G4 or any infusion of avelumab.  
• The patient completes the minimum safety evaluations (hematology, 
chemistr y, and clinical assessments) after the administration of the study drug 
combination during the DLT observation period and receives at least 
4 complete infusions of Hu5F9- G4 and 2  complete infusions of avelumab, 
unless a DLT is observed earlier.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 63 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Patients wh o withdraw before completing the 5- week DLT assessment period for 
reasons other than a DLT, or who do not fulfill either of the criteria above, will not be 
evaluable for assessment of DLT for dose review decisions and will be replaced in 
the cohort.  
3.2.1.2.  Defini tion of Dose -limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE;  Appendix C). 
DLT Definition:   A DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater AE that is assessed as 
related to at least 1 study treatment that occurs during the 5- week DLT Assessment 
Period (DLT exceptions are defined below).  Additionally, any treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) that is, in the opinion of the CTSC, of potential clinical 
significance such that further dosing would expose patients to unacceptable risk, will 
be considered a DLT.  
DLT Exceptions:  The following are exceptions to the DLT definition and will NOT 
be considered a DLT:  
• Grade 3 anemia; however, any Grade 3 hemolytic anemia is considered a DLT.  
• Grade 3 indirect/unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that resolves to ≤Grade 2 
with supportive care within 1 week and is not associated with other clinically 
significant consequences.  
However any occurrence of liver toxicity, as defined by Hy’s Law below, is 
considered a DLT:  
o The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher 
incidence o f 3-fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST, 
and 
o Total Bilirubin >2 ×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated 
serum alkaline phosphatase), and  
o No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
ALT/AST and tota l bilirubin.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 64 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  • Transient Grade  3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, local reactions, influenza- like 
symptoms, myalgias, fever, headache, acute pain, or skin toxicity that 
resolves to ≤Grade 2 within ≤72 hours after medical management (e.g., 
supportive care, including immunosuppressant treatment) has been initiated.  
• Grade 3 fatigue that resolves to ≤Grade  2 within 1  week on study.  
• Grade 3 Hu5F9- G4 or avelumab- related infusion reactions in the absence of 
an optimal pretreatment regimen, which is defined as acetaminophen or a comparable non- steroidal anti -inflammatory agent, plus an antihistamine and 
corticosteroids.  
• Grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome or electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, 
hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, etc.) that resolves to ≤Grade 2 or baseline 
within  1 week.  
• Grade 3 lipase and/or amylase elevation without clinical or radiological 
evidence of pancreatitis.  
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia not associated with other clinically 
significant consequences.  
• Grade 3 diarrhea or skin toxicity that resolves to Grade ≤1 in less than 7 days after medical management (e.g., immunosuppressant treatment) has been 
initiated.  
• Transient (≤48 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, flu- like symptoms, 
fever, headache, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea.  
• Other single laboratory values out of normal range that have no clinical 
correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤1 or to baseline within 7 days with adequate 
medical management.  
• Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or suspect ed tumor.  
3.3. Part 2 Expansion:  Study Design  
Once the Part 1 Safety Run- in Cohort of the trial is completed and the recommended 
expansion dose(s) is determined, the CTSC will open Part 2 of the study.  Part 2 of 
the study will treat up to 20  patients with ovarian cancer at the recommended 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 65 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  dose(s) to confirm safety, PK, and to document preliminary 
efficacy in this population.  
In Part 2, patients may be enrolled simultaneously without an observation period 
after the first patient starts treatment.  Based on review of ongoing dosing data, the 
CTSC may recommend testing of multiple doses in P art 2. 
Mandatory tumor biopsies will be collected, where medically feasible, from all 
patients during the Screening Period prior to first dose and at C ycle 3, Day  1 
(± 2 weeks).    
Efficacy will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 (primary endpoint;  Eisenhauer  2009) 
and irRECIST (secondary endpoint;  Bohnsack 2014).  Study treatment with study 
drug may be continued until an unacceptable drug -related toxicity occurs or until 
disease progression according to irRECIST.  Patients who experience initial PD may remain on study until they are deemed to have confirmed progressive disease 
according to irRECIST, provided all of the following conditions are met:  
• No new symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms  
• Tolerance of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab  
• Stable ECOG performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to 
prevent serious complications of disease progression (for example, CNS 
metastases)  
Patients who discontinue from treatment for reasons other than confirmed PD will undergo scheduled tumor assessments  until documentation of PD or initiation of a 
new line of anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
3.4. Number of Sites  
Approximately 5 to 8 sites located in the US will participate in this trial.  Additional 
sites may be included based on enrollment and study timelines.  
3.5. Estimated Study Duration  
It is anticipated that this study will take approximately 20 months to complete.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Patient participation will include Screening, Treatment, and Follow -Up.  Screening 
will last up to 30 days before first dose of study drug, during which time the patient’s 
eligibility and baseline characteristics will be determined.  Treatment with study drug 
may be continued until an unacceptable drug -related toxicity occurs or until disease 
progression.  After treatment, patients will be observed for survival for up to 5  years 
from date of enrollment, or until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.  Patients who discontinue from treatment for reasons 
other than confirmed PD will undergo scheduled tumor assessments until 
documentation of PD or initiation of a new line of anti -cancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first.  
Final study analysis may be implemented at the discretion of the CTSC once all 
Part 2 patients enrolled have come off study or have had at least 1  tumor efficacy 
assessment to allow for timely reporting of study results.  Treatment or long -term 
follow -up (LTFU) and Survival Follow -up will continue and be reported in an 
addendum to the Clinical Study Report.  
4. PATIENT SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT  
Only individuals who fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may 
be enrolled into the trial, with no exceptions.  The Investigator will ensure that the 
patient or the patient’s legal representative has provided written informed consent (in

Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 72 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  the patient throughout the clinical trial and must be used on all study documentation 
related to that patient, including if a patient is rescreened.  
Screening laboratory assessments may be tested repeatedly within the 30 days prior 
to the first dose of study treatment.  Patients who initially failed screening may 
repeat the screening process if the patient’s medical condition has changed.  
All patients who provide informed consent must be registered in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system, including any screen failures.  
A patient is defined as enrolled in the study once all eligibility criteria have been satisfied and the patient is assigned to a cohort or study arm assignment.  After 
signing the informed consent, eligible patients are expected to receive the first dose 
of Hu5F9- G4 (C ycle 1, Day  1) within 30 days.  
4.4. Informed Consent Process  
All participants must be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information for participants to make an informed decision regarding their 
participation.  Participants must sign the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Research 
Ethics Committee (REC) approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation 
in any study specific procedure.  Data from assessments performed as part of 
standard of care prior to ICF signature may be used if they are within the required 
Screening Period.  The  participant must receive a copy of the signed and dated 
consent documents.  A  signed copy (in paper or electronic format) of the consent 
documents must be retained in the medical record or research fi le. 
4.5. Registration Process  
Patient will be assigned the patient number at the time of consent.  The site will 
register the patient through IRT.  
Prior to being assigned to a dose cohort or treatment arm, patients must have 
signed the ICF and satisfied all of the study eligibility criteria.  The  Investigator will 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 73 of 160

cohort or treatment arm, they will be considered enrolled.  
4.6. Contraception Requirements  
4.6.1.  Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrollment must agree to use 1 of the following highly 
effective forms of contraception (defined as methods that can achieve a failure rate 
of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly) : 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner  
• Intra-uterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• C ombined hormonal contraception (estrogen - and progestogen- containing) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable)  
• Abstinence  
Defined as:  refraining from heterosexual intercourse for the entire period of 
risk associat ed with the study treatments.  Periodic abstinence is not 
acceptable (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), nor is the 
withdrawal method (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational 
amenorrhea method .  The  reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Contraception must be effective at the first administration of any of the study drugs (Hu5F9- G4 or avelumab), throughout the trial, and for 4 months after the last dose of 
Hu5F9- G4 or 1 month after the last dose of avelumab, whichever occurs latest.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 74 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  4.6.2.  Male Patients  
A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had 
a vasectomy must agree to use a highly effective barrier method of birth control 
(e.g., either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with 
occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) during the study,  and all men must also agree not 
donate sperm for the duration of the study treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of Hu5F9- G4 or 1 month after the last dose of avelumab, whichever occurs 
latest.  
Contraception must be effective at the first administration of any of the study drugs 
(Hu5F9- G4 or avelumab), throughout the trial, and for 4 months after the last dose of 
Hu5F9- G4 or 1 month after the last dose of avelumab, whichever occurs latest.  
It should be explained to the patient that if his partner is pregnant or breastfeeding 
when he is enrolled on the trial, the patient should use barrier method contraception 
(condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent the unborn fetus or the baby being 
exposed to investigational product.

6. TREATMENT ADMINISTRA TION  
6.1. Study Drug Administration Guidance:  Hu5F9 -G4 and Avelumab  
6.1.1.  Dosing 
The Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab dose levels and schedules are outlined above in 
Table  3-1 for Part 1, and also in the Study Schemas  for Part 1  and Part 2 .  The dose 
of Hu5F9- G4 will be calculated based on the weight of the patient measured within 
72 hours prior to enrollment and remains constant throughout the study, unless there 
is a >10% change in weight from baseline.  Modifications to the study drug dos es 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 76 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  administered should be made for a >10% change in body weight and for dose 
modifications as described in Section 6.4.  Dose  modifications for ch anges in body 
weight <10% may be made according to local institutional guidelines.  
Avelumab will be given at a fixed dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks for all patients.  
6.1.2.  Premedication  
Hu5F9 -G4 
Premedication with oral acetaminophen 650 –1000 mg and oral or intravenous 
diphenhydramine 25 mg, or comparable regimen, is required before administration 
of the first 2 doses of Hu5F9- G4 (inclusive of the priming dose).  If less than 4 hours 
has elapsed since a prior dose of acetaminophen has been given, for example, as a 
premedication for avelumab, the dose of acetaminophen premedication for Hu5F9-
G4 may be omitted.  Premedication may be given at any time on the day(s) of dosing, up to 15 minutes prior to dosing.  Premedication for subsequent Hu5F9- G4 
treatments may be continued based upon the treating physician’s clinical judgement and the presence/severity of prior infusion- related reactions.  Premedications used 
to manage infusion- related reactions are described in Section 6.5.1.1 . 
Avelumab  
Premedication with an antihistamine and with acetaminophen (for example, 25 to 
50 mg intravenous or oral diphenhydramine and 500 to 650 mg oral acetaminophen) 
approximately 30 to 60  minutes prior to the first 4 doses of avelumab is mandatory.  
Premedication should be administered for subsequent avelumab doses based on 
clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion- related reactions.  This 
regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate.  However, the prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not 
permitted.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 77 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  6.1.3.  Timing of Dosing 
In both study parts, Cycle 1 will be 5 weeks in duration and Cycles 2+ will be 
4 weeks. The Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab dose levels and schedules are outlined 
above in Table  3-1, and in the Study Schemas  provided above for Part 1  and Part 2 . 
On days when both study drugs are being administered, Hu5F9- G4 will be 
administered at least 1 –2 hours after the completion of avelumab infusion.  
6.1.4.  Patient Monitoring After Infusion  
Following the first 4 avelumab infusions, patients must be observed for 1 hour after 
the completion of the infusion for potential infusion- related reactions.  
All patients should be monitored for 1 hour after the completion of each Hu5F9- G4 
weekly infusion for the first 5 weeks.  Post -infusion monitoring should begin after 
Hu5F9- G4 is given.  Post -infusion monitoring is not required for doses after Cycle 1.  
Patients who experience any study drug -related AEs during the observation period 
should be further monitored, as clinically appropriate.  
Immediate access to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or equivalent environment and appropriate medical therapy (including epinephrine, corticosteroids, 
IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen) must be available for use in the 
treatment of infusion -related reactions. Infusion of avelumab will be stopped if the 
patient experiences Grade ≥2 infusion- related, allergic, or anaphylactoid reactions.  
6.1.5.  Repriming 
The following list describes the requirements for Hu5F9- G4 reprimin g. 
• Patients who experience an interruption of >2 weeks after receiving only the 
priming dose (1 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by receiving the Hu5F9- G4 
priming dose of 1 mg/kg IV over 3 hours (±30 minutes) and 3 subsequent 
weekly maintenance doses prior to starting the twice weekly dosing schedule.  
• Patients who experience an interruption of >4 weeks after receiving at least 1 dose (i.e., 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by receiving the 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 78 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  Hu5F9- G4 priming dose of 1 mg/kg IV over 3 hours (± 30 minutes) and 
3 weekly maintenance doses prior to starting the twice weekly dosing 
schedule.  
• Avelumab must be administered as regularly scheduled (e.g. Hu5F9- G4 
repriming doses may be administered on the same day as avelumab is given 
and administration of avelumab every 2 weeks should be maintained.)  
• Premedication is required for the repriming dose and the first weekly maintenance dose ( Section  6.1.2 ). 
On the day that patients receive their repriming dose, a predose ADA sample is to 
be collected.  
For patients who are reprimed, the following assessments are to be performed at the supplemental weekly visits (e.g., Day 8, Day 22):  
• CBC with differential, platelets, reticulocytes  
• Peripheral blood smear  
• Serum chemistry  
• Haptoglobin, D -dimer, thrombin, fibrinogen  
• PT/INR, aPTT  
• Vital signs  
• Physical examination  
• Adverse events  
• Concomitant medications  
 
6.2. Hu5F9 -G4 Preparation and Administration 
6.2.1.  Preparation  
Patients should be premedicated in accordance with Section 6.1.2.  Hu 5F9-G4 
should be prepared as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 79 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  6.2.2.  Administration  
6.2.2.1.  Priming Dose  
All patients will receive a priming dose of  1 mg/kg Hu5F9 -G4 on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
The duration of the infusion of the priming dose will be 3 hours (±30  minutes).  
The priming dose will be administered in Cycle 1 only.  Repriming doses are 
required for patients who experience dose interruptions or treatment delays of 
>4 weeks.  Details are provided in Section  6.4.2.3 . 
6.2.2.2.  Maintenance Dose  
The priming dose of Hu5F9- G4 will be followed by the maintenance doses of 
Hu5F9- G4. 
In Part 1 of the study, 2 doses and 2 dosing schedules are planned.   Additional dose 
levels and schedules may be evaluated based on emerging study data and after 
CTSC review.  
In Dose Level 1, Hu5F9- G4 maintenance doses will be administered at a dose of 
30 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 2 hours (±30 minutes) Cycle 1 doses will be 
administered on Days 8, 15, 22, and 29, while doses in Cycles 2+ will be administered on Days 1 and 15.  
In Dose Cohort 2, Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at a dose of 45 mg/kg as an 
IV infusion over 2 hours (±30 minutes).  Cycle 1 doses will be administered on Days 
8, 11, 15, 22, and 29.  Cycle 2 doses will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.  Doses in Cycles 3+ will be administered on Days 1 and 15.  
In Part 2 of the study, Hu5F9- G4 will be dosed based on the dose and schedule 
selection that will be made by the CTSC after all available clinical, 
 and PK data are reviewed from Part 1.  
On days when both study drugs are given, Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at least  
1 hour after the completion of the avelumab infusion.  Proposed doses of study drug 
CCI
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 80 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  to be administered are outlined above in Table  3-1, and in the 
Study  Design  Schemas  provided above for  Part 1  and Part 2 . 
Modifications to the infusion rate due to infusion- related reactions are described in 
Section 6.5.2.   Patients will receive Hu5F9- G4 Q2W until the criteria in Section 8 are 
met. 
6.3. Avelumab Preparation and Administration 
6.3.1.  Preparation  
Patients should be premedicated in accordance with Section 6.1.2.   Avelumab 
should be prepared as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.2.  Administration  
No priming dose is required for avelumab.  In Part 1 of the study, avelumab will be 
administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 800 mg over 1 hour ( ˗10 to 
+20 minutes).  Because of the different cycle lengths (due to the priming dose of 
Hu5F9- G4) Cycle  1 doses will be administered on Days 8 and 22, while doses in 
Cycles 2+ will be administered on Days 1 and 15.  Administration should be through an IV line containing a sterile, non- pyrogenic, low protein binding in- line filter 
(pore  size of 0.2  micron).  Drugs should not be co- administered through the same 
IV line.  In Part 2 of the study avelumab will be fixed at 800 mg.  
On days when both study drugs are given, Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at least 
1 hour after the comp letion of the avelumab infusion.  Proposed doses of study drug 
to be administered are outlined above in Table  3-1, and in the Study Schemas 
provided for Part 1 and Part 2.  
Modifications to the infusion rate due to infusion- related reactions are described in 
Section 6.5.2.  Pa tients will receive avelumab once every 2 weeks until the criteria in 
Section 8 are met.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  6.4. Dose Delays, Dose Modifications, and Treatment Termination  
6.4.1.  Treatment Termination:  Hu5F9 -G4 and Avelumab  
Because of the possibility of an initial increase in tumor burden caused by immune 
cell inf iltration in the setting of a T -cell response (termed pseudoprogression) with 
immunotherapy treatment, radiographic progression defined as unconfirmed progressive disease according to irRECIST (irPD;  Bohnsack 2014) may not be 
indicative of true PD.  Patients who meet criteria for unconfirmed irPD while receiving treatment will be permitted to continue treatment if they meet all of the 
criteria provided in Section 3.1.  If the treating physician and Sponsor agree that it is 
in the best interest of the patient to continue treatment with either Hu5F9- G4 or 
avelumab alone, the patient may continue to participate in the study provided that 
other protocol stipulations are met.  
Treatment termination is defined as permanent discontinuation of both study drugs.  
6.4.2.  Hu5F9 -G4 
6.4.2.1.  Dose Modifications:  Study Part 1  
Proposed doses of study drug to be administered are outlined above in Table  3-1.  
Dose modifications or dose delays should be implemented for any AEs that meet the DLT criteria, as defined in Section  3.2.1.2 (refer to Part 1 in  Table  6-1).  Hu5F9- G4 
may be re- introduced at a lower dose level if the AE has recovered to Grade 0- 1, or 
to baseline, within 4 weeks.  Data from patients who restart dosing after the recovery 
period will not contribute to the MTD evaluation at the lower dose level.  Treatment delays of more than 4 weeks (such as for an unrelated medical condition with 
expected recovery) must be approved by the CTSC.  Patients with an interruption or 
treatment delay of longer than 2 weeks after receiving only the priming dose 
(1 mg/kg) or >4 weeks after receiving at least 1 maintenance dose (e.g ., 30 mg/kg, 
45 mg/kg) must be “reprimed” by receiving the pr iming dose of 1 mg/kg IV over 
3 hours (±30 minutes) and 3 subsequent weekly maintenance doses following the 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 82 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  repriming dose prior to resuming the twice- weekly dosing s chedule 
(Section 6.1.5 , Repriming).  
6.4.2.2.  Dose Modifications:  Study Part 2  
Patients who experience a Grade 3 or 4 study drug -related AE (that matches the 
criteria for a DLT, as defined in Part 1) should have their Hu5F9- G4 doses reduced 
in subsequent treatments to the next lower dose level, or as suggested in discussion 
with the Medical Monitor.  Table 6-1  outlines the toxicities requiring an Hu5F9- G4 
dose reduction.  If the Grade 3 or 4 AE recurs after dose reduction, study drug should be discontinued, unless the treating physician and Sponsor agree that the 
patient is clinically benefitting.  If additional dose reductions are required but the 
patient is deemed to be benefitting from treatment, the dose of Hu5F9- G4 may be 
reduced by an additional 50%.  Refer to Table  3-1 for dose modification level -1, that 
should be made based on the proposed initial assigned dose of Hu5F9- G4 [Dose 
Level 1] in Part 2.)

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  6.5. Safety Management Guidelines  
6.5.1.  Hu5F9 -G4-related Events 
6.5.1.1.  Management of Infusion- related Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions are defined by the NCI  CTCAE (under the category  
“General disorders and administration site conditions”) as “a disorder characterized 
by adverse reaction to the infusion of pharmacological or biological substances.”  
For the purposes of this study, the time frame for infusion- related reaction 
assessment is the 24 -hour period beginning from the start of the infusion.  
Recommendations for the management of infusion- related reactions are provided 
below.  
• For Grade 1 infusion- related reactions, described as mild transient reaction, 
infusion interruption is not indicated, intervention is not indicated:  
o Remain at bedside and monitor patient until recovery from symptoms.  
• For Grade 2 infusion- related reactions, infusion interruption is indicated, but 
patient responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihi stamines, 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, IV fluids); 
and prophylactic medications are indicated for ≤24 hours:  
o Stop the Hu5F9- G4 infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and 
consider treating the patient with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or 
equivalent) and/or 500 –750 mg oral acetaminophen.  
o Remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.  
o Corticosteroid therapy may also be given at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
o If the infusion is interrupted, wait until symptoms resolve, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate.  
o If no further complications occur after 1 hour (± 10 minutes), the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  Monitor the patient 
closely.  
o If symptoms recur, stop infusion and disconnect patient from the infusion 
apparatus.  No further Hu5F9- G4 will be administered at that visit.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 87 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  o Premedications should be considered before any future infusions.  
o The amount of Hu5F9 -G4 infused must be recorded on the  case report 
form (eCRF).  
o Patients who experience a Grade 2 infusion- related reaction during the 
post-infusion observation period that does not resolve during that time 
should be observed until the AE resolves, with vital sign measurements as 
medically indicated for the management of the AE.  
• For Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion- related reactions, where Grade 3 is 
described as prolonged infusion- related reactions (e.g., not rapidly responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion), or  recurrence 
of symptoms following initial improvement, or where hospitalization is 
indicated for other clinical sequelae (e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary 
infiltrates).  
Grade 4 is described as having life- threatening consequences and where 
urgent intervention indicated.  
o Immediately discontinue infusion of Hu5F9- G4. 
o Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and consider treating the patient as 
follows:  
Administer bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution 
for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25  mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 
with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed.  
o The patient should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that 
the symptoms will not recur.  
o Patients who have Grade 4 infusion- related reactions occurring with the 
first dose (priming dose) will be permanently discontinued from study treatment.  
o Patients who experience Grade 3 infusion- related reactions must be given 
premedicatio n prior to all subsequent doses.  In this setting, premedication 
with oral acetaminophen (650 mg), oral or IV diphenhydramine (25–
50 mg), and IV dexamethasone (4– 20 mg), or a comparable regimen, is 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 88 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  recommended for the subsequent 2  doses.  Continued premedi cation with 
corticosteroids beyond these 2 doses may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
o Patients who receive premedication with a corticosteroid and still experience a Grade 3 or 4 infusion- related reaction will be permanently 
discontinued from study treatment.  
o Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of 
anaphylaxis.  
o All patients with Grade 3 or greater infusion- related reactions will be 
observed until the AE(s) resolves or stabilizes, with vital sign 
measurements and additional evaluations, as medically indicated for the 
management of the AE(s).  
6.5.1.2.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
In the case of evidence for tumor lysis syndrome associated with Hu5F9- G4, 
patients will be admitted to the hospital as clinically indicated.  Standard 
management will include vigorous IV hydration; correction of acidosis, if present; 
hypouricemic agents; and close monitoring of serum uric acid, phosphorus, and 
electrolytes.  Study treatment should be held until the patient’s condition resolves or 
stabilizes.  
6.5.1.3.  Hemagglutination and Microangiopathy  
In the Phase 1 trial experience with Hu5F9- G4 in solid tumors and AML, 
agglutination of RBCs has been observed on peripheral smear.  Hu5F9- G4-related 
microangiopathy is a possible sequela of hemagglutination; however, it has not been observed in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials to date.  In addition, AEs may be 
associated with findings of hemagglutination.  Monitoring of hemagglutination and microangiopathy includes physical exam assessments, complete blood counts 
(CBCs), peripheral smears, serum chemistries, and D -dimer testing as outlined in 
the schedule of assessments (SOA).  Peripheral smears will be read by local sites with reporting of RBC agglutination, spherocytosis, and evidence of RBC destruction

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  (e.g., schistocytosis, fragments) when present.  The presence or absence of 
hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral smear will be incorporated 
into the AE severity grading for hemagglutination and microangiopathy, as described 
below.  The degree of peripheral smear findings will be quantified according to the 
appropriate scale ( Appendix E) for sites that have the capability to do so, but i s not 
required.   
  AEs relating to hemagglutination and microangiopathy will be 
graded for toxicity according to the scale below.  
AE Severity Grading for Hemagglutination and Microangiopathy  
Grade 1:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral 
blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that is asymptomatic or 
mild, not requiring intervention  
Grade 2:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that requires medical 
intervention  
Grade 3:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that is medically 
significant, requiring hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, disabling, or limiting self -care ADLs  
Grade 4:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that is life threatening or 
requires urgent intervention  
Grade 5:  Evidence of hemagglutination and/or microangiopathy on peripheral 
blood smear AND associated clinical sequelae that results in death  
6.5.1.4.  Anemia, Blood Cross -Matching, and Packed Red Blood Cell 
Transfusion Procedures  
Hu5F9- G4 b inds to red cells and leads to erythrophagocytosis.  This, coupled with 
anemia from other causes in patients with cancers, means that care has to be taken 
with RBC cross -matching and packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions.  There is 
CCI
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 90 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  a possibility that treatment with Hu5F9- G4 may obscure assessment of RBC 
phenotyping.  
During the Screening Period prior to initiation of Hu5F9- G4 therapy, blood cell ABO 
phenotyping for minor antigens, type and screen (ABO/Rh), and Direct Antiglobulin 
Test (DAT) will be performed for each patient as described in Section  7.3.6.7.  
This,  together with using the prior phenotype, will facilitate allocation of properly 
cross- matched blood, should a blood transfusion be warranted.  
Procedure for patients after exposure to Hu5F9 -G4: 
1. ABO, Rh, and DAT may be pan- reactive due to Hu5F9- G4 binding to red 
cells.  Therefore, if a non- urgent transfusion is ordered by the Investigator, 
perform the following procedures:  
• Front Type:  EDTA/glycine- acid (EGA) Treat cells ×2 (maximum) and 
Warm  Wash  ×4 (minimum) with 0.9% Saline.  
• Back Type:  Perform reverse anti -human globulin for both A and B. 
• If a valid ABO type cannot be obtained, mark the final report as invalid 
and notify the transfusion service for the site.  
2. Antibody screen  
If a pan- agglutinin/warm autoantibody is present in low ionic strength solution 
(LISS), repeat the antibody screen with polyethylene glycol (PeG).  Perform 
PeG adsorption studies and elution studies.  
6.5.1.4.1.  Blood Components for Transfusion  
For all elective red cell transfusions, leukocyte -reduced units matched for the 
phenotype of the patients (as described above) will be used.  Where exact matching 
for all the specified blood groups proves impractical (e.g., for MNS), local sites will 
decide on the best matched donor units to be used.  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
matching (i.e., CMV seronegative units for CMV -seronegative patients)  will not be 
required for this study because it will limit the inventory for antigen matching.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 91 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  If the cross -match is incompatible, the RBC units that are Coomb's 
crossmatch- incompatible will be selected (e.g., phenotype- matched or least 
incompatible) for i ssue at the discretion of the local site’s Transfusion Service 
Medical Director or equivalent person, where available.  Such instances will be 
documented, along with consent signatures obtained from ordering physicians, 
according to best practices in blood bank policies and procedures.  
For emergency transfusions, the transfusion laboratory may consider using emergency Group O Rhesus negative units if phenotyped units are not available.  
Blood plasma therapy will be blood- type specific.  Platelets will be blood type 
compatible whenever possible, and if not, will have been tested and found not to 
have high titer anti -A or anti -B. 
6.5.2.  Avelumab -related Events 
Detailed safety management guidelines are provided in the Avelumab PI, (Appendix  B) for the safety issues listed below:  
• Immune -mediated reactions  
o Pneumonitis  
o Immune -mediated hepatitis  
o Immune -mediated colitis  
o Immune -mediated endocrinopathies  
• Adrenal insufficiency  
• Thyroid disorders (Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism)  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus  
o Immune -mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction  
• Other immune- related adverse reactions  
• Infusion -related reactions  
• Embryo -fetal toxicity  
To mitigate infusion -related reactions, patients have to be premedicated with an 
antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) prior to the first 4 infusions of 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 92 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  avelumab ( Section  6.1.2 ).  Premedication should be administered for subsequent 
avelumab doses based on clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior 
infusion- related reactions.  
Management of infusion- related reactions should follow guidelines provided in 
Table  6-2. 
Table  6-2. Treatment Modification for Symptoms of Infusion- related 
Reactions Associated with Avelumab  
NCI CTCAE Grade  Treatment Modification for Avelumab 
Grade 1:  mild 
• Mild transient reaction; infusion 
interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated.  • Decrease the avelumab infusion rate by 50% and monitor closely for any 
worsening.  
Grade 2:  moderate  
• Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (for example, 
antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications 
indicated for ≤ 24 hours.  • Temporarily discontinue avelumab 
infusion.  
• Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once infusion- related reaction has 
resolved or decreased to at least Grade  1 in severity, and monitor 
closely for any worsening.  
Grade 3 or Grade 4: severe or life- threatening 
• Grade 3: Prolonged (for example, not 
rapidly responsive to symptomatic 
medication and/or brief interruption of 
infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for clinical 
sequelae.  
• Grade 4: Life- threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  • Stop the avelumab infusion immediately and disconnect infusion 
tubing from the subject.  
• Subjects have to be withdrawn immediately from avelumab treatment 
and must not receive any further 
avelumab treatment.

Abbreviations:  IV = intravenous; NCI CTCAE = National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event; NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs.  
 
Once the avelumab infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or interrupted due to 
an infusion- related reaction, it must remain decreased for the next scheduled 
infusion.  If no infusion -related reaction is observed in the next scheduled infusion 
the infusion rate may be returned to baseline at the all subsequent infusions.  If an 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 93 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  infusion- related reaction occurs, all details about drug preparation and infusion must 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigator 
immediately.  
Investigators should also monitor patients closely for potential infusion- related AEs  
(irAEs), which may become manifest at any time during treatment.  Such events 
include but are not limited to pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies 
(hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus), 
myocarditis,  myositis, rash.  
6.5.2.1.  Immune -related Adverse Events 
Since inhibition of PD- L1 stimulates the immune system, irAEs may occur. 
Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity (NCI  CTCAE grade):  
• Grade 1 to 2:  treat symptomatically or with moderate dose steroids, more frequent monitoring  
• Grade 1 to 2 (persistent):  manage similar to high grade AE (Grade 3 to 4)  
• Grade 3 to 4:  treat with high dose corticosteroids  
Treatment of irAEs should follow guidelines presented in Table 6-3.

Patients are considered to have completed study drug treatment when they finish the Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days (± 1 week) after their last dose of last study drug 
received, unless they are experiencing ongoing study drug -related AEs and serious 
adverse events (SAEs).  For patients being followed for ongoing SAEs or study 
drug-related AEs, follow -up visits will continu e at least every 4 weeks until resolution 
or return to baseline, stabilization  of the event , the patient is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent , or the Medical Monitor deems it necessary, whichever occurs 
first.  If a patient begins another anti -cancer therapy, Safety Follow -up Visits will 
stop.  
All patients, including those who discontinue study drug early, will be followed for response until progressive disease (PD) or new anti -cancer therapy and, if feasible, 
for survival (patients will be contacted every 3 months [± 1 month] from the date of the Safety Follow -up Visit, 5 years from the date that the last patient is enrolled into 
the study, or full withdrawal of consent) until death or study closure, whichever occurs first.  For any patient who dies during this period, the cause of death must be 
reported to the Sponsor.  Patients are considered to have completed study 
participation when they are no longer followed for disease progression or survival, or 
they withdraw consent.

Refer to the schedule provided in Table  7-1 for specific timing of screening 
procedures.  
The patient must be willing and able to sign and date the ICF before any Screening 
assessments or study -specific tests may be performed.  All patients who are 
enrolled will be given a unique study number that will be used to identify the patient throughout the study.  
Screening assessments will be completed within a 30- day Screening Period prior to 
the first dose of study drug.  Screening assessments may be repeated during the 
30-day Screening period.  Screening assessments may be used for pre-infusion 
assessments on Cycle  1, Day  1 dosing if performed within 72 hours of study drug 
administration.  Assessments performed as part of standard of care prior to ICF may be used if they are within the required Screening period.  The first dose of Hu5F9- G4 
(priming dose) and must be given within 30 days of all Screening assessments.  
7.3. Study Procedures  
Refer to the schedules provided in Table  7-1, Table  7-2, Table  7-3, and Table  7-4 for 
specific timing of study procedures.  
7.3.1.  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be assessed in accordance with the schedules provided 
in Section  7 (Table 7-1,  Table 7-2 , and Table 7-3).   A complete physical examination 
should be performed at Screening.  Thereafter, symptom -directed physical 
examinations are acceptable.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded in the patient’s study source documents.  New or worsened abnormalities 
should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (CRF).  
Height should be recorded during Screening only; weight should be recorded during Screening and on Day 1 of each cycle.  Refer to Section 6.1.1  for guidelines 
regarding weight -based dosing for Hu5F9- G4.

schedule provided in Table 7-1 .  One ECG will be performed at Screening.  
Triplicate ECGs will be performed at the visits indicated after Screening.  If applicable, the triplicate ECGs should be performed within 2 hours prior to the first 
infusion (i.e. , Hu5F9 -G4 on C1D1, avelumab on C1D8 and C2D1) and within 
30 minutes of the end of Hu5F9- G4 infusion on treatment.  The interval between 
ECG reads will be according to the Institution’s standard of care.  
7.3.4.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
ECOG performance status will be assessed in all patients in accordance with the 
schedules provided in Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table 7-2 , and Table 7-3) .  The ECOG 
performance status scale is provided in Appendix D. 
The ECOG performance status is a scale used to assess how a patient's disease is 
progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, 
and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.  
7.3.5.  Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy tests will be performed in accordance with the schedules provided in 
Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table 7-2) .  Pregnancy tests are required only for women of 
childbearing potential.  Note that a woman is considered to be of childbearing 
potential (WOCBP), i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -
menopausal unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for  12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 116 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.  However , in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.   
A urine or serum pregnancy test is required at Screening and within 72 hours before 
study drug administration on Day  1.  The Day 1 pregnancy test does not need to be 
repeated if the Screening pregnancy test was performed within the 72 hours before 
study drug administration.  Pregnancy tests will be performed every 4 weeks, 
starting with Cycle  2. 
7.3.6.  Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory assessments will be performed in accordance with the schedules provided in Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table  7-2, and Table  7-3).  Most laboratory 
assessments will be performed locally at each study center’s laboratory by means of their established methods; analytes to be assessed by the local laboratory or 
specialty laboratories are presented in Table  7-5.  Before starting the study, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor (or designee) with a list of the normal ranges and units of measurement.  Pre- infusion assessments may be performed up to 
72 hours before study drug treatment.

hematology tests to be assessed by the local laboratory or specialty laboratories are presented in Table 7-5. 
7.3.6.3.  Peripheral Blood Smear Assessment  
Peripheral smears will be collected at selected time points as outlined in the schedule provided in Table 7-1 and Table  7-2, and assessed for the presence of 
hemagglutination, in addition to standard cell morphology assessment.  Slides 
should be processed and assessments occur in accordance with your local practice.  
These samples should be collected from the arm contralateral to the arm being used 
for drug infusion, if possible.  Whenever possible, peripheral smears will be 
evaluated according to the guidelines provided in Appendix E.  For patients 
undergoing blood transfusion, samples for peripheral smears will be collected 1 hour 
(± 30 minutes) after completion of the transfusion.

Prothrombin time/ international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin 
time (PT/INR, a PTT) will be assessed at the time points outlined in the schedule 
provided in Table  7-1 and Table  7-2. 
7.3.6.7.  Type and Screen (ABO/Rh), Direct Antiglobulin Test  
Due to the risk of developing anemia, blood phenotyping, type and screen 
(ABO/Rh), and DAT should be performed at Screening prior to exposure to 
Hu5F9- G4:  Full phenotyping (if not transfused in last 3 months) should include 
ABO, Rh, D, C, E, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, and antibody screen tests.  (The complete 
list of analytes is presented in Table  7-5.)  Treatment with Hu5F9- G4 may make 
phenotyping difficult due to expected coating of the RBC membrane.  In addition, patients who experience a drop in hemoglobin to below 9 g/dL at any time, or 
patients in whom clinical findings indicate a possible need for transfusions, it is recommended, but not required, that a Type and Screen, and DAT, be performed.  
7.3.7.  Urinalysi s 
Urinalysis will be assessed at the time points outlined in the schedule provided in Table  7-1 and Table  7-2.  Urinalysis will include dipstick results for color, 
appearance, specific gravity, pH, RBCs, glucose, bilirubin, ketones, occult blood, and protein. 
7.3.8.  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Serum samples for PK analysis will be collected according to the schedules provided 
in Section  7 (Table 7-1,  Table 7-2 , Table 7-3 , and Table 7-4 ).  PK samples will be 
collected to assess the PK of Hu5F9- G4 and to explore the kinetics of avelumab.  
PK samples will be sent to a central lab for processing.  The exact date and time of

7.3.10.  Anti-drug Antibodies  
ADAs will be tested according to the schedules provided in  Section 7 ( Table 7-1,  
Table  7-2, and Table 7-3 ).  As shown in the SOA Table 7-1 and Table 7-2 , 
peripheral blood for immunogenicity assessments for ADAs against Hu5F9- G4 
 will be collected on Days 1, and then on Day  1 of Cycles 2 to 4, and 
every 3 cycle s thereafter to coincide with tumor response assessments, and as 
shown in Table  7-3, at the End of Treatment and Safety Follow -up Visits.  When 
collected on the day of study drug dosing, the blood sample must be collected before dose administration.  A validated tiered testing process 
(screening+confirmation+titre) will be used to measure antibodies to Hu5F9- G4 in 
serum samples.  For patients who have tested positive for ADAs, the impact of ADAs on PK, safety, and biologic activity may  be assessed, if relevant.

Biopsies will be collected according to the schedules provided in Section  7 
(Table 7-1, Table  7-2, and Table 7-3 ).  Tumor biopsies will be used to explore the 
effects of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab on the tumor microenvironment, including but 
not limited to, the possible evaluation of the types of immune cells present and the 
expression of CD47 and other relevant markers.  In addition, PD -L1 expression will 
be evaluated on tumor cells and/or immune cells by immunohistochemistry.  These tumor biopsies are  mandatory in Part 2, 
unless the Investigator and Sponsor determine that, in particular cases, obtaining a tumor biopsy is not feasible.  These reasons could include,  but are not limited to, 
lack of accessible tumor tissue to biopsy and patient safety issues.  A tumor biopsy will be collected during the Screening Period prior to first dose and on Cycle 3 Day 1 
(± 2 weeks).  Core biopsies may be collected for these time  points; however 
excisional biopsies, where possible, are preferred over core biopsies.  Fine needle aspiration biopsies are not acceptable.  Biopsies should ideally contain 30% or 
≥100 viable tumor cells.  
 
 
 
7.3.12.  Response Assessments 
Response assessments will be collected according to the schedules provided in 
Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table 7-2 , and Table 7-3 ).  Appropriate cancer staging 
assessments should be performed.  Imaging assessments are to be conducted according to RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer  2009) and irRECIST ( Bohnsack 2014) as 
described in Section  10.1.  The  same imaging modality used at Screening should be 
used throughout the study whenever possible.  
The first response assessment will occur at Cycle 3, Day 1 (±  1 week).  
After  Cycle  3, assessments will have a window of ±2 weeks.  Subsequent response 
assessments will occur every 2 cycles.  Response assessment will be obtained at

they should be obtained on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4.  From Cycle 5 and onward, 
they may be obtained every 2 cycles. 
7.3.13.  Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be recorded according to the schedules provided in Section 7 
(Table 7-1, Table  7-2, Table  7-3, and Table 7-4 ).  After signing informed consent, all 
SAEs will be collected regardless of attribution ( Section 9.2.1 ).  At each visit all AEs 
observed by the Investigator or reported by the patient that occur after the first dose 
of study drug th rough 30 days after the last dose of study drug are to be reported 
using the applicable electronic case report form (eCRF; Section  9.3.1 ).  AEs that 
occur prior to study treatment that are assessed as related to a protocol -mandated 
intervention (e.g.,  invasive procedures such as biopsies) must also be reported.  
Following 30 days after the last dose of study drug, Investigators are to report any 
new study drug -related SAEs that occur up to 90 days after the last dose or the start 
of new anti -cancer treatment (whichever occurs first), any ongoing SAEs, and study 
drug-related AEs, including late- onset immune- mediated AEs.  At any time, any new 
SAEs assessed by the Investigator as related to Hu5F9- G4 and/or avelumab must 
be reported.  Patients who develop study drug -related AEs or SAEs within the 
90-day period will be seen by the study physician.  
7.3.14.  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be recorded according to the schedules provided in 
Section  7 (Table  7-1, Table 7-2 , Table  7-3, and Table  7-4).  All concomitant 
medications taken by a patient while on study are to be documented.  Changes in baseline concomitant medication information is to be collected after consent through 
the end of the 30- day S afety Follow -up Period.  Concomitant medications associated 
with procedure- related AEs will be captured from the time of informed consent on.

route, start date, and stop date, and is to be reported using the applicable eCRF.  
7.3.15.  End of Treatment Visit  
The End of Treatment (EOT) Visit to be completed within 14 days of the decision to 
end treatment with either or both study drugs.  Refer to the schedule provided in 
Table  7-3 for specific EOT study procedures.  
7.3.16.  Safety Follow -up 
The Safety Follow -up Visit is to be completed within 30 days (± 1 week) after the last 
dose of the last study drug received.  Refer to the schedule provided in Table  7-3 for 
specific Safety Follow -up Visit procedures.  Patients will be followed until PD or until 
they begin a new anti -cancer therapy.  For patients who achieve a PR or CR while 
on study, a repeat disease assessment will be obtained at the time of PD whenever possible.   
The Safety Follow -up Contact is to be completed by phone 90 days (±  5 days) after 
the last dose of last study drug received.  The call will collect information on new 
study drug -related SAEs, ongoing SAEs, and study drug -related non- serious AEs, 
including late- onset immune- mediated AEs.  At any time, any new SAEs assessed 
by the Investigator as related to Hu5F9- G4 and/or avelumab must be reported.  
Patients who develop study drug -related AEs or SAEs within the 90- day period will 
be seen by the study physician.  
7.3.17.  Long- term Follow -up 
After the Safety Follow -up Contact (90 days after last dose), patients will be followed 
for any ongoing SAEs and study drug-related AEs and new SAEs assessed as 
related to study drug every 4 weeks until resolution to baseline, stabilization, until the patient starts a new anti -cancer therapy, or the patient is lost to follow -up, whichever 
occurs first.  Any SAE assessed as related to study drug must be reported whenever 
it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of study drug.  
Patients will also be asked about any anti -cancer therapy.  For patients without

until disease progression or the patient begins a new anti -cancer therapy.  
7.3.18.  Survival Follow -up 
Survival will be assessed in accordance with the schedule provided in Table  7-3.  
All patients who permanently discontinue all study treatment will be contacted during 
a clinic visit or by telephone to assess the following:  
• Survival  
• Disease progression (if not documented previously)  
• Commencement of new cancer therapy following the last administration of 
study drug  
Patients will be contacted every 3 months (±  1 month) from the date of the Safety 
Follow -up Contact, until 60 months from the date that the last patient is enrolled into 
the study or full withdrawal of consent until death or study closure, whichever occurs first.  For any patient who dies during this period, the date and cause of death must 
be reported to the Sponsor.  The patient’s primary physician or family may be 
contacted by the investigator to obtain survival information in case the patient cannot be reached.  
8. STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
8.1. Withdrawal of Patients from Study Drug Treatment  
Patients (or a legally acceptable representative) may decline to continue receiving study drug at any time during the study.  The patient’s health and welfare is the 
primary consideration in any determination to discontinue study drug treatment.  Patients who withdraw from study drug during the treatment period should be 
encouraged to return for an EOT Visit for evaluation of safety within 2 weeks of the 
decision to end Hu5F9 -G4 + avelumab combination treatment.  The studies to be 
performed at this visit are listed in Schedule of Assessments Table 7-3 .  It is strongly 
encouraged that patients return for their Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days (±  1 week) 
after their last dose of study drug.  The assessments to be performed at this visit are 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 126 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  described in Table  7-3.  All patients who withdraw from study drug treatment will be 
followed for disease response and survival.  
Reasons for withdrawal from study drug treatment may include, but ar e not limited 
to:  
• Confirmed tumor progression according to irRECIST.  
• Unacceptable toxicity.  
• Clinically significant change in the patient’s status that precludes further 
treatment (e.g., pregnancy or other AE), after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor.  
• Patient’s request, with or without a stated reason.  In case the patient decides 
to withdraw from treatment, further study assessments should be performed 
unless declined by the patient.  
• Investigator or treating physician decision in the absence of any of the above.  
• Pregnancy.  
8.2. Withdrawal of Patients from Study  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care.  Patients (or a legally acceptable 
representative) may decline to continue receiving study drug and/or other 
protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study.  Patient data 
up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study and, where permitted, publicly  available data may be included after withdrawal of consent.  
The Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from the study.  The Investigator or Sponsor has the right to discontinue 
any patient from study participation.  
Reasons for pati ent withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to:  
• Death  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to follow up 
• Study termination  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 127 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  8.3. Defining the End of Study  
The end of the study for all patients occurs at the primary completion date, which is 
defined as the date on which the last patient completes the last visit (phone contact 
is also considered as a visit) or when the CTSC decides to terminate the study, 
whichever occurs first.  
Recruitment will cease when one of the following occurs:  
• Study treatment is considered too toxic to continue treatment before the 
anticipated number of patients are recruited.  This assessment will be made 
by the CTSC.  
• The stated number of patients to be recruited is reached.  This number may 
be increased to include replacement patients for those who are not DLT-evaluable and patients added to intermediate dose or expanded cohorts 
as determined by the CTSC, and approved, if necessary, by the appropriate IRBs.  
• The stated objectives of the trial are achieved.  
• Sponsor decision.  
In term inating the study, the Sponsor and the Investigators must ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interest.  
8.4. Study Termination 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Both the Sponsor 
and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the Investigator’s participation in 
the study according to the study contract.  The Investigator is to notify the 
IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in writing of the study’s completion or the 
Investigato r’s termination of participation in the study and send a copy of the 
notification to the Sponsor.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
9.1. Safety Parameters and Definitions 
Safety assessments will consist of recording all AEs and SAEs; protocol -specified 
hematology and clinical chemistry variables; measurement of protocol -specified vital 
signs; and the results from other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to 
the safety evaluation of the combination of these study drugs.  
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the 
Competent Authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating 
Investigators, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines, FDA regulations, European Clinical Trials Directive, and/or local 
regulatory requirements.  
9.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attributio n. 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE  reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies), including AEs that occur prior to 
study drug treatment that are related to protocol -mandated interventions.  
• Events that occur prior to administration of both study drugs that are related 
to a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as 
biopsies)  
• Pre-existing medical conditions, judged by the Investigator to have worsened 
in severity or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified 
AE reporting period.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 129 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  9.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that at any dose is:  
• Fatal (i.e., the AE is the actual cause of death)  
• Life-threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in which the patient was at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e.,  the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the study drug(s)  
• Considered a significant medical event by the Investigator based on sound medical and scientific judgment (i.e.,  may jeopardize the patient or may 
require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed 
above)  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non- serious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the 
intensity of an AE (as in Grade 1 [mild], Grade 2 [moderate], Grade 3 [severe], 
Grade 4 [life- threatening] or Grade 5 [death] according to CTCAE v. 4.03).  
The event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event 
outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs.

Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 130 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  9.2. Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded on 
the eCRF and that SAEs are recorded on the SAE Report Form and reported to the 
Sponsor in accordance with instructions in the Study Reference Manual.  SAEs must 
be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming 
aware of the event.  
9.2.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After signing of informed consent, but prior to initiation of any of the study drugs, all events deemed by the Investigator to have been caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) will be collected as AEs (or SAEs if any of t he serious criteria appl y). 
After initiation of any of the study drugs, all  AEs and SAEs, regardless of attribution, 
will be collected until 30  days following the last administration of last study drug 
received, or until the Safety Follow -up Visit (whichever occurs later) unless the 
patient begins a new anti -cancer therapy before that. Until 90 days after the last 
dose of last study drug received or the Safety Follow -up Contact (whichever occurs 
later), Investigators are to report only new study drug- related AEs or SAEs, 
(including late- onset immune- mediated AEs).   Patients who develop study 
drug-related AEs or SAEs within the 90- day period will be seen by the study 
physician.   Follow -up information regarding SAEs and study drug -related AEs will be 
reported until resolution (or return to baseline), stabilization of the event , the patient 
is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent, the Medical Monitor deems it necessary , or 
the patient initiates new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first .  Follow -up will 
be conducted as described in Section 7.3.16 and Section  7.3.17.  Resolution of AEs 
and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF, on the 
SAE Report Form (if applicable), and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.   The Sponsor or its designee may follow  up by telephone, 
fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details

At any time, Investigators are to report SAEs that they assess to be related to any of 
the study drugs (Hu5F9- G4 and/or avelumab received as part of this study).  
9.2.2.  Eliciting Adverse Events 
A consistent method of non- directive questioning for el iciting AEs at all patient 
evaluation time points should be adopted.  Examples of non- directive questions 
include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
 
9.2.3.  Assessment of Severity and Causality of Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each patient contact.  
All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the patient or noted by authorized study 
personnel,  will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, and on the SAE report form, if applicable.  
For each AE and SAE, the Investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (Section 9.1.2 ), severity ( Table 9-1 ), and causality ( Table 9-2 ).  A causality 
assessment will be made for both Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab individually.  Table  9-2 
provides guidance for assessing the causal relationship to study drug(s).  
The AE grading (severity) scale NCI CTCAE Version  4.03 (Appe ndix C) will be used 
for AE reporting as shown in Table 9-1 .  As described in Section  6.5 (Safety 
Management Guidelines), customized severity grading for hemagglutination and microangiopathy AEs will be used ( Appendix C).

Note:  The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the “Related” or “Not Related” causality assessment for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor or its designee, will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety 
findings to Investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
 
9.3. Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events  
9.3.1.  Recording Adverse Events 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology and concepts when recording 
AEs and SAEs.  Colloquialisms and abbreviations are to be avoided. 
A separate log line in the AE eCRF should be used for each medical concept that needs to be recorded.  
9.3.1.1.  Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, 
each individual event should be recorded as an AE on separate log lines of the 
eCRF and SAE report form (if the event is serious).  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported to the Sponsor by subsuming the symptoms under 
the reported diagnosis, in accordance with the CRF Completion Guidelines.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 134 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  9.3.1.2.  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause.  For example, if  severe 
diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE on the eCRF.  However, medically significant AEs occurring 
secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the 
eCRF.  
9.3.1.3.  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF 
unless their severity increases.  If a persistent AE increases or decreases in 
severity, it  should be recorded again on a new log line on the Adverse Event eCRF 
indicating the change in severity.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time 
points and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on Adverse 
Event eCRF each time they occur.  
9.3.1.4.  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be recorded as AEs on the eCRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification or 
discontinuation, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.).  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilir ubin 5  × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only 
the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 135 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or 
syndrome, the  abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE on the eCRF.  If the 
laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE.  For example, an  elevated serum potassium 
level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkale mia.”  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to 
visit should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.  
9.3.1.5.  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period 
(Section 9.2.1 ), regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an eCRF and SAE 
Report Form and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness and not later than the next business day.  This includes death attributed to progression of 
disease.  
If the death is attributed to progression of disease, especially in the absence of other signs and symptoms, record “[specific disease type] progression” as the SAE term 
on the SAE Report Form.  
When recording a death on an eCRF or SAE Report Form, the event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single 
medical concept whenever possible.  
9.3.1.6.  Worsening of Disease  
Worsening of and/or progression of disease should not be routinely recorded as an 
AE or SAE if it does not result in death.  These data will be captured as efficacy 
assessment data.  However, worsening and/or progression of disease can be 
recorded as an SAE, if the outcome is fatal in the absence of other signs and 
symptoms, or if the Investigator assesses the PD to be related to one of the study 
drugs.  
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 136 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  9.3.1.7.  Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this 
protocol.  
There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no occurrence of an AE.  These scenarios include a planned 
hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization to:  
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre- existing medical 
condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study  
• Hospitalization for social reason (e.g. respite care, waiting for insurance 
authorization)  
9.3.1.8.  Other Reportable Information 
Certain information, although not considered an AE or SAE, must be recorded, 
reported, and followed up as indicated below.  The following sections describe such 
information.  
9.3.1.8.1.  Pregnancy  
Female patients who become pregnant during the treatment period must be withdrawn from study treatment immediately.  
Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or a patient’s partner during treatment with either study drug or within 6 months of last study drug administration must be 
reported to the Sponsor’s safety clinical research organization (CRO) ( Section 9.2) 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of it, using a Pregnancy Notification Form (provided in the Investigator Trial File).  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain 
consent for follow -up from the patient or patient’s partner.  The safety CRO will 
follow -up on all pregnancies for the pregnancy outcome through the Investigator, 
using a Pregnancy Outcome Form.  Data will be collected about the pregnancy, fetal

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  status, neonate status.  In the event that the neonate has abnormalities at birth, 
additional data will be collected for the infant about those abnormalities.  
Spontaneous or therapeutic abortion should always be reported as an SAE 
(medically significant event) and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form, 
and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as described in Section  9.2.  Any 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient or female partner 
of a male patient exposed to any of the study drugs should also be recorded and 
reported as an SAE  within 24 hours of awareness.  
9.3.1.8.2.  Overdose  
An overdose of Hu5F9 -G4 is defined as a dose higher than that indicated in the 
protocol, with or without experiencing an AE.  
An overdose of avelumab is defined as any dose ≥10% than the planned dose for that particular administration.  
Any overdose must be recorded in the trial drug section of the eCRF.  
9.3.1.8.3.  Abuse or Misuse  
Abuse or misuse of a study dr ug is use for nonclinical reasons, with or without 
experiencing an AE.  
9.4. Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators will submit reports of all SAEs, regardless of attribution, within 24 hours 
of awareness according to the instructions provided by the Sponsor.

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
10.1.  Anti-Cancer Effect  
Patients will be assessed for response using RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009) for the 
primary efficacy endpoint and irRECIST ( Bohnsack 2014) for the secondary efficacy 
endpoint.  The first response assessment will occur after 2  cycles of treatment.  
Subsequent response assessments will occur every 2 cycles or approximately 
8 weeks.  Tumor markers will be obtained, as appropriate, at baseline, and then 
every cycle until Cycle 5, then every 2 cycles.  Finally, response assessment will be 
obtained at the EO T Visit, unless a prior radiographic assessment has been 
performed within the last 4 weeks or a prior response assessment documented confirmed PD.  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The primary objectives of this Phase 1b study are to describe the safety and 
tolerability of the combination of Hu5F9- G4 and avelumab and determine the 
recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2DS).  As such, the statistical analysis will be primarily descriptive providing listings, graphic displays, frequencies, 
and/or percentages for discrete variables and the mean, standard deviation, median, 
and ranges for continuous variables.  Where relevant, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) may also be provided.  Time- to-event endpoints will be summarized using 
Kaplan- Meier methods.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  11.1.  Analysis Sets  
11.1.1.  Part 1 Safety Run -In Cohort  
Dose Evaluation Set (DES)  
The Dose Evaluation Set includes all enrolled solid tumor patients in Part 1 who 
receive at least 1 dose of both Hu5F9- G4 (at a maintenance level) and avelumab 
and either experience a DLT or complete at l east 4 infusions of Hu5F9- G4 (at the 
maintenance level) and 2 infusions of avelumab.  
Patients who withdraw before completing the 5- week DLT assessment period for 
reasons other than a DLT, or who do not fulfill either of the criteria above, will not be 
evaluable for dose review decisions and will be replaced in the cohort.  
11.1.2.  Parts 1 and 2 Safety and Efficacy Analysis Cohort  
Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS)  
The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) includes all enrolled patients who receive at least 
4 doses of Hu5F9- G4 (at th e maintenance level) and 2 doses of avelumab, and for 
whom a baseline and post -treatment tumor assessment is available.  
The analysis of overall response rate (ORR), best overall response (BOR), duration 
of response (DOR), time to tumor progression (TTP), PFS, and OS will be performed on the EAS.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAS)  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) includes all enrolled patients who receive at least 
1 dose of either study drug.  The analysis of safety will be performed on the SAS.  
PK Analysis Set (PAS)  
The PK Analysis Set (PAS) includes all patients in the SAS from whom PK blood 
samples are collected during the study and who have at least one measurable 
concentration of Hu5F9- G4.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  11.2.  Sample Size Determination  
This trial will include a total of up to 40 patients.  This sample size includes both 
Parts 1 and 2 of the study, allowing for patient replacement as defined in this 
protocol.  In Part 1, up to 12- 18 patients will be treated in a Safety Run- in Cohort, 
assuming that no more than 2 DLTs in each cohort of 6 patients occur.  Up to 
18 patients may be enrolled in Part 1 if some patients are ineligible for DLT 
assessment. 
Part 2 consists of a single expansion cohort in 20 ovarian cancer patients who will 
undergo safety, PK, .  This s ample size will allow 
for confirmation of the safety profile of Hu5F9 -G4 and avelumab in this population, 
and the mandatory tumor biopsies  
  The anti -tumor activity of this regimen will also be documented.  With this 
sample size, the lower bound of the 95% exact CI would exclude 10% if the 
objective response rate is 30% or higher.  
11.3.  Clinical Trial Steering Committee  
The CTSC will oversee the conduct of the clinical trial.  A  representative from the 
Sponsor, usually the Study Medical Monitor or designee, will chair the CTSC.  
The CTSC will have representation from each participating site in the study.  
The CTSC will re view safety and efficacy data generated during the trial and make 
decisions about patient recruitment, trial management, initiation of protocol specific 
amendments, expansion of cohorts, using higher or lower dose levels, defining any 
new dose cohorts, identification of the recommended dose for Part 2  
.  The  CTSC will meet at a minimum at the completion of the DLT period for 
each cohort  in the Safety Run- in part of the trial, at any protocol -specified formal 
interim analyses, and when emerg ent critical safety data are reported.  
The composition, structure, and function of the CTSC are defined in the 
CTSC Charter.

All analyses will be descriptive and hypothesis generating in nat ure.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for all safety and efficacy endpoints.  
All analyses will be conducted separately for patients in Parts 1 and 2 of the study unless otherwise specified.  Safety analyses may be conducted for patients in both 
Parts 1 and 2 of the study together.  Efficacy analyses may also be conducted on all 
efficacy- evaluable ovarian cancer patients.  
For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, and ranges will be 
provided.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage in each category 
will be provided along with 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs for primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints.  For time- to-event variables, the Kaplan- Meier (KM) estimates 
and corresponding two- sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs for the median and quartiles 
will be provided.  The KM plot may also be provided.  Details regarding the statistical 
analysis to be conducted, including the handling of missing data and patient 
withdrawal, will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

11.6.2.  Safety Analyses 
The SAS is defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (either 
Hu5F9- G4 or avelumab).  The  statistical analysis will be descriptive, providing 
listings, graphical displays, frequencies, and percentages for discrete variables 
and/or the mean, standard deviation, median, and ranges for continuous variables.  
Safety variables to be examined include DLTs for patients in Part 1, TEAEs (AEs 
worsening or occurring during or after a patient’s first exposure to study drug), study 
drug-related adverse events (ADRs), vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory, 
CD47 RO, and ADA assessments.  AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA,  Version  19.0) and grouped by system organ class 
and preferred term.  Summary  tables will include the number and percentage of 
patient s with AEs, SAEs, fatal  AEs, and other AEs of interest.  
Data will be presented by Part 1 (Safety Run- in Cohort) and by Part 2 (Ovarian 
Cancer Expansion Cohort), and, where relevant, summarized across various dose 
cohorts.  Data may be graphed, summarized, or listed depending on the amount of data to be reported.  Where relevant, safety data will also be presented by the study

cohort.  
11.6.2.1.  Adverse Events 
For the SAS, AEs that occurred during Screening, but before exposure to study drug will be reported in the AE line listings and appropriately identified as non- TEAEs.  
Summary tables of TEAEs and ADRs will be provided using the NCI  CTCAE 
Version 4.03 to describe the type and severity of event.  Peripheral smear 
assessments will be tabulated and reported separately.  TEAEs and ADRs will also be tabulated using Investigator assessment of the relationship to study drug (related 
or not related).  SAEs, including deaths, will be summarized and/or listed for each 
dose cohort and for all dose cohorts combined.  TEAEs and ADRs resulting in 
withdrawal from study drug or further study participation will be tabulated and/or 
listed.  DLTs will also be listed.  Unless otherwise noted, the tabulation of  AEs will be 
based on patient incidence rather than event incidence.  
For patients who went through Screening only or who were enrolled but never 
treated, AEs and SAEs that occur during Screening will be reported separately as 
the "Screened- only/Never Treated” Set with line listings and/or summary tables, 
along with relevant demographic data collected.  
11.6.2.2.  Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints  
The analysis of other safety endpoints such as vital signs, peripheral smear 
assessments, and other laboratory assessments,  will include listings, graphical 
displays, and descriptive statistics such as change from baseline and/or shift tables, 
where relevant.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
11.6.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
PK analysis will be conducted for Hu5F9- G4 using the PAS .  Based on the distinct 
MOAs of Hu5F9 -G4 and avelumab, drug -drug PK interactions are not expected.  
Thus, samples for PK analysis for avelumab will be biobanked and will be analyzed based on CTSC recommendation.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  The PAS consists of all patients who have a t least 1  blood sample that provides 
evaluable PK data.  The PAS will be used for summaries of PK concentration data 
and PK parameters.  Due to the sparse sampling regime, it is anticipated that the 
Cmax after the first maintenance dose will be the only calculable PK parameter in this 
population.  Individual patients may be removed from the estimation of particular PK parameters based on the number of available blood samples for them.  These 
patients will be identified at the time of analysis.  
Summary sta tistics will be presented for Hu5F9- G4 serum concentrations at each 
scheduled time point.  Descriptive graphical plots of individual serum 
concentration- versus -time profiles and mean concentration- versus -time profiles will 
be generated.  Missing concentration values will be reported as is in data listings.  Concentration values below lower limit of quantitation will be set to zero in summary 
statistics, and reported as -is in data listings.  Any missing PK parameter data will not 
be imputed.  Population PK modelling analysis may also be conducted by combining Hu5F9- G4 PK data from this study along with data from other studies, but results of 
that analysis will be reported separately.

and the IRB/IEC continuance of approval must be sent to the Sponsor.  
12.4.  Informed Consent and Human Subject Protection 
An initial sample ICF is provided for the Investigator to prepare the informed consent docume nt to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template are to be 
communicated formally in writing from the Sponsor’s Study Monitor to the Investigator.  The  written informed consent document is to be prepared in the 
language(s) of the potential patient  population.  
Before a patient’s participation in the clinical study, the Investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the patient or legally acceptable 
representative after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening 
procedures or any investigational products are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an individual or other body authorized under applicable law to 
conse nt, on behalf of a prospective patient, to the patient’s participation in the 
clinical study.  
The Investigator is also responsible for asking the patient if the patient has a primary 
care physician and if the patient agrees to have his/her primary care phy sician 
informed of the patient’s participation in the clinical study.  If the patient agrees to 
such notification, the Investigator is to inform the patient’s primary care physician of 
the patient’s participation in the clinical study.  If the patient does  not have a primary 
care physician and the Investigator will be acting in that capacity, the Investigator is to document such in the patient’s medical record.  The acquisition of informed 
consent and the patient’s agreement or refusal of his/her notificati on of the primary 
care physician is to be documented in the patient’s medical records, and the ICF is 
to be signed and personally dated by the patient, or a legally acceptable 
representative, and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.   
The original signed ICF is to be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 148 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  copy of the signed consent form is to be provided to the patient or legally acceptable 
representative.  
If a potential patient is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally acceptable representative, the Investigator must provide an impartial witness to read 
the ICF to the patient and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the patient and 
the witness must sign the ICF to attest that informed consent was freely given and 
understood.  
12.5.  Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to the Sponsor, including the following:  
• Subjects are to be identified by a unique patient identificat ion number.  
• Where permitted, date of birth is to be documented and formatted in 
accordance with local laws and regulations.  
• On the eCRF demographics page, in addition to the unique patient 
identification number, the patient’s age at time of enrollment is t o be included.  
• For SAEs reported to the Sponsor, any source documentation provided 
(e.g., medical records, laboratory results) must have any patient identifier 
(e.g., patient name, initials, medical records number) fully redacted (i.e., blacked out) prior to transmission.  
• Documents that are not submitted to the Sponsor (e.g., signed ICFs) are to be kept in confidence by the Investigator, except as described below.  
In compliance with the CFR/ ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the Investigator 
and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory 
agency(s), and the IRB/IEC direct access to review the patient’s original medical 
records for verification of study -related procedures and data.  Direct access includes 
examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the study.  The Investigator is obligated to inform and 
obtain the consent of the patient to permit such individuals to have access to his/her study -related records, including personal information.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  12.6.  Urgent Safety Measures  
The Sponsor or Investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect 
trial participants from any immediate hazard to their health or safety.  Urgent safety 
measures may be take n without prior authorization.  The  trial may continue with the 
urgent safety measures in place.  
The Investigator must inform the Sponsor IMMEDIATELY if the study site 
initiates an urgent safety measure. 
The notification must include all of the following:  
• Date of the urgent safety measure  
• Who made the decision  
• Why the action was taken  
The Investigator will provide any other information that may be required to enable 
the Sponsor to report and manage the urgent safety measure in accordance with the 
current regulatory and ethical requirements for expedited reporting and closeout.  
12.7.  Serious Breaches and Fraud  
The Sponsor will comply with ICH GCP guidelines for reporting serious breaches and fraud which may occur in this particular trial in all regions in which t he 
investigational product is being studied.  
Investigators must notify the Sponsor immediately if any serious breach of GCP is suspected.  
If there is any proof of fraud this must also be reported to the Sponsor.  All instances of confirmed clinical trial f raud occurring at sites in the United Kingdom (UK) will be 
treated according to the procedure for dealing with a serious breach and must be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
within 7 days of the Sponsor becoming aware.

Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  12.8.  Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor’s representative(s) are responsible for contacting and visiting the 
Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting 
the various records of the clinical study (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) 
provided that patient confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s representative(s) are responsible for verifying the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency  of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the 
conduct of clinical research.  The Sponsor’s representative(s) are to have access to patient medical records and other study -related records needed to verify the entries 
on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator  agrees to cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) to ensure 
that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRFs, are resolved.  
12.9.  Audits and Inspections  
As stipulated by 21 CFR §312.58 and ICH guidelines for GCP, a representative of the Sponsor, the FDA, or other regulatory agencies may conduct periodic site audits 
or inspections.  The Investigator or designee will provide these representatives with 
access to all requested materials, including eCRFs  and supporting source 
documents.  In addition, the Investigator or other qualified study site personnel are to 
be available to answer questions, hold interviews, and provide facility tours, if 
requested.  
12.10.  Data Collection and Handling 
The Investigator is responsible for complying with the requirements for all 
assessments and data collection (including patients not receiving protocol -required 
therapies), as stipulated in the protocol for each patient in the study.  For patients who withdraw prior to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or 
unwilling to continue the SOA (as described in Section 7.1), the Investigator may 
Hu5F9- G4 
Protocol 5F9006, Amendment 3  Page 151 of 160 
 
Forty Seven Inc.  Confidential  search publicly available records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status.  
This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as 
comprehensive as possible.  
The Investigator agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the patients t reated 
as part of the research under this protocol.  Data collection will involve the use of the electronic data capture (EDC) system, to which only authorized personnel will have 
access.  The  Investigator agrees to maintain accurate eCRFs or paper CRFs and 
source documentation as part of the case histories.  The Sponsor will supply the eCRF, which will be completed in English.  
The Investigator or designee must enter all results collected during the clinical study 
into eCRFs.  Guidelines for completion of eCRFs will be reviewed with study site 
personnel at the site initiation visits.  Investigators are responsible for approval of the 
entered/corrected data.  Detailed instructions may be found in the other study 
specific documents.  
All entries made on the eCRF, must be verifiable against source documents.  In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by study monitors, 
programmatic edit checks and data listings will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol.  As a result of this monitoring 
and these checks, queries may be electronically issued to the clinical study sites and 
electronically resolved by those sites.  
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated according to regulatory requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records.  Also, 
data will be stored and evaluated in such a way as to assure patient confidentiality in accordance with the legal and regulatory requirements applying to protected health 
information.  Study records (e.g., copies of eCRFs, regulatory documents) will be 
retained at the study site, along with adequate source documentation.  The study file 
and all source data must be retained for the time period required by applicable 
regulatory requirements and will not be destroyed until written notification is given by 
the Sponsor or designee for destruction.

Section  8, the Investigator or designee will maintain source documentation for this 
clinical study that documents the treatment and study course of patients as described in the study manual.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the patient’s eCRF data are obtained.  These include, but are not limited to hospital 
records, clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, 
microfiches , radiographs, and correspondence.  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive 
and centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation, suitable 
for inspection at any time by representatives from the Sponsor and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  
The Investigator must retain all essential documents for this clinical study until at 
least 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and 
until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of Hu5F9 -G4.  However, the Investigator may need to retain these 
documents for a longer period, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor.  A  Sponsor representative will be responsible 
for informing the Investigator and study site regarding when they no longer need to retain these documents.  Before destroying any records, the Investigator must notify 
the Sponsor and reach agreement on record destruction, or the Sponsor may 
request an additional retention period.

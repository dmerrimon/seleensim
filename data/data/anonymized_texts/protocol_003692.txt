2.5 Study Devices and Imaging Agents 
 
In this study, IC2000 and SPY-PHI will be assessed as an intraoperative fluorescence visualization tool in the identification of LNs during lym phatic mapping in subjects 
undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy with early stage breast cancer. SPY-PHI is intended for intraoperative visual  assessment of blood vessels and related 
tissue perfusion by surgeons.  It is an im aging system used in ca pturing and viewing 
fluorescent images for visual assessment of  blood flow, as an adjunctive method for 
the evaluation of tissue perfusion, and relate d tissue-transfer circulation in tissue and 
free flaps during various surgical procedures. 
SPY-PHI allows for real time, intraoperativ e visualization and video of near infrared 
(NIR) fluorescence, which are acqui red by using the imaging agent.  
The imaging agent used with SPY-PHI is Indocyanine Green (IC2000), which is a 
sterile, water-soluble tricarbocyanine dy e with a peak spectral absorption at 
800-810 nm in blood plasma or blood. IC2000 contains not more than 5.0% sodium 
iodide. In this study, investigational ICG, IC2000, will be administered to subjects 
through an intradermal injection into t he peri-areolar area of the breast. 
Tc-99m radioactive colloid injection is a clear, colorless aqueous solution and will be 
injected into the peri-areolar area of the breast as per standard of care. 
Tc99m will be used in conjunc tion with the Gamma Probe. Gamma Probes detect the 
presence of gamma rays emitte d from radioactiv e isotopes in body organs or tissue . 
The system provides an increasing or decr easing sound and visual indicator (Count 
Bar) that vary in pitch as level of ga mma radioactivity increases or decreases3. 
 
2.6 Study Variables 
 
Primary Variable 
• To assess the effectiveness of IC2000 and SPY-PHI (SPY Portable Handheld Imager; also called “IC2000 and SPY”) Fluorescence Imaging System in the identification of lymph nodes  (histology confirmed lymph nodes), during lymphatic 
mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy in subjects with early stage breast 
cancer.
 
o Defined as the proportion of lym ph nodes identified and excised by 
IC2000/SPY compared to t he proportion of lymph nodes identified and 
excised by Tc99m/Gamma Probe, (histology confirmed lymph nodes). Denominator is the tota l number of lymph nodes identified and excised, 
inclusive of clinically suspicious  lymph nodes (histology confirmed).

Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 7 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Significance  
 
Our objective is to study effects of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) containing  estrogen and 
progesterone (NuvaRing) on vaginal bacteria (the vaginal microbiome) , local immunity , and lower 
genital tract infection  in women.  Emerging data suggest a favorable effect of this CVR on vaginal 
bacteria, specifically hydrogen peroxide -producing lactobacilli (LB), which are supported when the 
vagina is under the influence of estrogen.1,2 These lactobacilli are critical for defense  against infection 
with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections  (STI) . Bacterial vaginosis (BV)  is characterized by loss 
of these LB and instead,  overgrowth of a mix of anaerobic bacteria. BV significantly increases risk of 
STI/HIV, including genital herpes caused by HSV2.3,4 BV is characterized by declines in protective 
immunologic mediators (certain defensins, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI)) and increases 
in inflammatory cyt okines and chemokines,5 alteration of cervical immune cell populations6 and 
activation of local immune cells, including  T cells.7 Whether local delivery of hormones through a 
product like the CVR restores the lactobacilli and the  protection they provide from BV and STI/HIV  is 
unknown. In contrast, the contraceptive systemic depot progesterone— commonly used worldwide —
may independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission.8 Our overarching hypothesis is that 
NuvaRing contributes to reduction in BV, healthy markers of cervicovaginal immune response and 
decreased rates of HSV2 shedding. Long- acting  vaginal delivery of hormonal contraception as the 
foundation of “multicomponent prevention” – for example, delivery systems that can combine activity 
against unintended pregnancy, HIV, and other STI —has become a major focus for scientists, advocates, 
and funders alike,9-11 but effects on the vaginal environment need careful definition  before broad 
implementation.  
 The need for contraceptive options has taken on urgency with evidence indicating that systemic 
hormonal contraception (primarily injectable,  long -acting progestin) may increase women’s risk of HIV 
acquisition and transmission  to male sex partners.
12 Lack of other contraceptive options is a critical 
barrier to progress towards optimizing women’s reproductive health . Moreover, BV remains a major 
problem for women, causing symptomatic vaginitis and conferring increased risk for adverse outcomes of pregnancy and STI/HIV acquisition. We propose to explore the hypothesis —supported by limited 
data —that a contraceptive vagin al ring (CVR) that is commonly used in the U.S. , the NuvaRing, will 
enhance women’s genital and reproductive health. We propose that this CVR will increase the bacteria 
that help the vaginal environment protect against infection by HIV and other STIs, redu ce rates of BV, 
and that in women who already have HSV2 , use of the CVR  will lower HSV2  shed ding  in the female 
genital tract. Importantly, CVR acceptability in general is excellent.
13 Moreover, the format of drug 
delivery through the form of a vaginal ring  is also being intensely explored with the use of antiretroviral 
agents (dapivirine, tenofovir) as a means of topical, female -controlled  HIV prevention, and formulation 
work with several antiretroviral drugs for sustained delivery with the NuvaRing format is underway.9  
 
We believe the NuvaRing specifically will enhance vaginal health because we hypothesize that it will 
promote the growth of the Lactobacillus  bacteria that protect women from infection with HIV and other 
STI. These bacteria, called L. crispatus  and L. jensenii , are promoted by adequate levels of vaginal 
estrogen. These bacteria maintain low vaginal pH (<4.7) by  producing lactic acid . BV occurs when these 
vaginal lactobacilli are replaced by overgrowth of other vaginal bacteria (primarily anaerobes , or 
bacteria that live in low -oxygen conditions) . BV is the most common cause of vaginal complaints in 
reproductive -aged women. In pregnant women, BV is strongly associated with increased risk of preterm 
birth s and pregnancy -associated infectio ns.  In non -pregnant women, BV increases  the risk of pelvic 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 8 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 infections, and acquisition of multiple STI , including HSV2 and HIV .14 BV may  elevate these risks in 
several ways, including activation of local immune cells . Finally, recent data indicate that on set of 
menstruation triggers key shifts in local vaginal bacteria, and in many women, may actually precipitate 
BV. Continuous use of the NuvaRing (use for four weeks, then replace) suppresses menstruation, and is 
increasingly used by many women with excellent reports of acceptability and safety. Whether this 
suppression of menstruation could suppress BV recurrence is not known.  
 
Although short -term antibiotic therapy improves symptoms and restores Lactobacillus  predominance in 
most women with BV, up to 20% of women fail routine therapy. In addition, BV recurrence after successful therapy is the rule. Recurrence is likely caused by failure to recolonize the vagina with 
desirable  lactobacilli, which requires adequ ate vaginal estrogenization. In one study , women who used 
the NuvaRing for 3 consecutive 28 -day cycles had higher quantities of desirable vaginal lactobacilli 
relative to women who used oral contraceptive pills containing 20 μ g ethinyl estradiol and 100 μg 
levonorgestrel.
1 The NuvaRing releases 120 mcg/day of ENG (the active metabolite of desogestrel, a 
progesterone) and 15 mcg/day of ethinyl estradiol (the estrogen component). While generally well tolerated, incidence of local complaints (increased vaginal discharge or discomfort) with continuous CVR 
use is higher  than those reported by OC users;
15 thus, the risk: benefit ratio of this approach needs 
careful assessment.  
 Pregnancy is also an independent risk for HIV acquisition and transmission , when acquis ition confers 
high rates of perinatal transmission.
16,17 Howev er, systemic depot progesterone, commonly used 
worldwide, may independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission.8 Increased HIV risk  
related to hormonal contraceptive use would be of global public health importance, given the large 
number of  women using such methods. In a recent technical report, the World Health Organization 
noted that “expansion  of contraceptive method mix and further research on the relationship between 
hormonal contraception and HIV  infection is essential.”18  
 For all of these reasons, then, a careful study of the microbiological, clinical, and immunologic benefits 
of the CVR is a high scientific and public health priority.  
 
1.2 Study Hypothesis  
 
• CVR use will be as sociated with favorable vaginal changes assessed by BVAB qPCR, and 
community definition by high -throughput sequencing  
 
• Initiation of CVR use will be associated with an increase in desirable protective factors in the 
vagina, including increases in SLPI and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines.  
 
• CVR use will be associated with lower rates of and longer time to incident BV assessed by clinical status (Amsel criteria and symptoms)
19 and Nugent score,20 and among HSV -2-infected women, 
with a reduction in HSV -2 shedding.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
We propose to assess potential benefits associated with both intermittent (use for 3 weeks, remove for 1 week, as defined in the package insert) and continuous (use for  4 weeks, then replace) CVR use 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 9 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 among women either with BV or at high risk for BV . We will also recruit women who are HSV2 -
infected.  
 
Primary outcomes will be as follows:  
 
• The primary outcomes will be the quantity of L. crispatus  determined by species -specific 
qPCR assay (Aim 1), local immune parameters, including cytokines and innate mediators (Aim 2), and incidence of and time to clinical BV episodes over the course participation (with 
the exploratory aim of measuring genital HS V-2 shedding among HSV -2 seropositive women 
(Aim 3).  
 
• Secondary objectives will include a determination of Nugent score on Gram stain of vaginal 
fluid, vaginal colonization with bacteria associated with BV, the vaginal microbiome as 
determined with broad range 16S rRNA and pyrosequencing, and rates of adverse events with CVR use. At study end, all participants will be offered the choice of continuing NuvaRing use, or will be counseled on alternative (non -CVR) contraception methods. 
Women who opt to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD) at the end of the study will be 
offered participation in IUD an Extension Study , in which we will follow subjects for an 
additional 6 months to assess changes in immunity and the microbiome  after IUD 
placement .

final month of daily home swab collection.   
4.4 Study Termination  
 
The study may be terminated at any time by the principal investigator.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Study Overview  
 
This study will be conducted at the University of Washington Virology Research  Clinic (VRC) located at 
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.  Eligible women with BV will be invited to enroll as will women 
with a high likelihood of experiencing BV in the ne ar term ( 12 months). We plan to enroll approximately 
120 women.  
 Among those with BV  at Enrollment , all will be treated with standard antibiotic therapy. After 
assessment for cure at 7 -10 days, they will be asked to return for a visit at one month  from enrollment  
to establish their baseline status. They will be offered non -hormonal methods for pregnancy prevention 
during that initial month.
 21 After one month  (Month 2 visit) , they will then be asked  to initiate NuvaRing 
use using one of the following two  approaches:  
 
• Continuous CVR use for four 28 -day cycles, with replacement of the CVR after each cycle  
 
• Non -continuous CVR use involving use for 21 days, then removal for 7 days, with replacement 
after the 7 -day CVR -free period  
 Following initiation of  CVR use, all participants will be evaluated monthly for BV  with standard criteria  
(Amsel and Nugent criteria) and have specimens obtained for performance of bacterial q uantitative PCR 
(qPCR) assays for BV -associated bacteria, L. crispatus and L. jenseni. Women  will also be asked to seek 
care with the study team for interim vulvovaginal symptoms, with provision of diagnostic workup and 
appropriate treatment.  
 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 12 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 While participants will have the right to voluntarily stop using CVR at any point during the study, they 
will specifically be offered the option of discontinuing CVR use at six months  (after 4 months of use)  for 
the purpose of documenting whether the vagin al environment changes after CVR cessation. For this, 
they will return for one additional monthly visit.  
 
5.1.1 Hormonal Sub-Study   
 
In a sub -study of 40 women, we will compare cervicovaginal effects of the contraceptive ring to the 
normal changes occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in response to endogenous 
estrogen and progesterone. Cervical cytobrush specimens wi ll be collected to obtain an adequate 
sample of endocervical epithelial cells, which will be used for microarray -based gene expression 
analyses.  Subjects who are otherwise eligible for the main study  and who are BV negative, have regular 
menstrual cycles 25-35 days in length, and have had no use of hormonal contraception within the past 2 
months (no DMPA within the past 6 months) will be eligible  for the sub -study .   Hormonal Sub-study  
participants will be asked to return for on e additional visit  prior to initiation of CVR  for serum 
progesterone level testing and collection  of cervical cytobrush samples  in addition to regular visit 
specimens (same as Visit 1) . 
 
5.1.2 Intrauterine Device (IUD) Extension S tudy  
 
During the Month 7 visit  (or after completion of the s tudy) , we will offer women enrollment in an 
optional Extension Study , which aims to assess changes in cervicovaginal immunity, vaginal microbiome, 
and HSV -2 shedding among participants who opt to initiate  an IUD . Subjects who have completed the 
Month 7 visit and daily vaginal swabs during the main study will be eligible to participate.  All 
participants will receive counseling on contraceptive options at completion of the main study. Women 
who opt for an IUD will receive information regarding clinics that offer IUD placement, including the 
Public Health – Seattle & King County STD Clinic and other local family planning clinics.  Subjects will 
receive IUD placement per standard of care at individual clinics ; IUDs will not be placed  as part of study 
procedu res. IUD Extension Study  participants will be asked to return approximately one month after IUD 
placement for their first Extension Study V isit. Women who previously participated in the Hormonal 
Sub-study will also have cytobrush specimens and progesterone  levels collected at 2 time points during 
the IUD Extension Study .  
 
5.2 Study samples  
 5.2.1 Vaginal Fluid  
 
Swabs of vaginal fluid will be obtained from the posterior fornix for PCR assays. BV diagnosis will be 
made using any three of the following: (1) vaginal pH ≥4.7, (2) clue cells >20% of vaginal epithelial cells 
on microscopy, (3) fishy odor with KOH and (4) abnormal vaginal discharge (increased amount, differing from usua l consistency, or malodorous).  Diagnostic evaluation for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and 
Trichomonas vaginalis will be performed using nucleic acid amplification testing (APTIMA -Combo, 
GenProbe).  
 Women with any condition for which treatment or further testing is indicated will be managed 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 13 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 according to standard guidelines , and  will remain e ligible for enrollment . BV will be treated with  
standard treatment (either metronidazole gel .75%, one application  vaginally nightly  for 5 days , or oral 
metronidazole , 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, according  to the participant’s preference  
). All women treated for BV will be asked to return at 7 -10 days for a test -of-cure visit, with BV cure 
defined by  absence of >2 Amsel criteria.  
 
5.2.2 Daily Home Swab Samples  
 
For one month before CVR initiation, one month after, and one month following CVR dis continuation, all 
subjects will be asked to self -collect two vaginal swabs daily and to store in their freezer for return to 
the clinic at the next visit or beforehand at their convenience. These swabs will be analyzed for vaginal 
bacteria with bacterium -specific qPCR assays.  Women with HSV -2 infection will be asked to collect one 
additional mixed anogenital swab to measure daily HSV -2 genital shedding.  IUD Extension Study  
participants will be asked to complete two vaginal swabs daily  (plus an additional swab for women with HSV-2) at two additional time points: one month after IUD placement, and 6 months after IUD 
placement.   If a subject withdraws from the study due to C VR side e ffects or other issues  and has used 
the CVR for at least 2 cycles, we will ask that they complete one final month of daily home swab 
collection.   
 
5.2.3 Vaginal Biopsies  
 
Vaginal biopsies  are optional.  Vaginal biopsies  will be collected at two time points during the study: the 
Month 1 baseline visit  (for women who agreed to the hormonal sub -study, the Month 1 vaginal biopsies 
will ideally be collected at the cycle day 6 -10 (follicular phase) visit) , and the Month 6 visi t. Participation 
in this procedure is optional, and subjects willing to provide vaginal biopsy specimens will sign a 
separate consent form.  Subjects in the optional Hormonal Sub -Study  will have one an additional vaginal 
biopsy procedure at Visit 1b.  Subj ects in the IUD Extension Study  will have  one additional vaginal biopsy 
procedure at Month 13 (IUD 6 ). Subjects will be instructed to not begin collecting vaginal swabs until 5 
days after the biopsy to ensure healing.    
 
The p rocedure for the vaginal biops y is as follows: A s peculum will be placed into the vagina. After 
injection of 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, two biopsies  approximately 2 x 2 mm in size will be 
collected from the upper posterior vaginal wall with baby Tischler forceps using standard technique. 
Hemostasis will be obtained with silver nitrate or Monsel’s ferric subsulfate solution, if indicated. Biopsy 
samples will be analyzed for epithelial thickness, glycogen content of epithelial cells, immune cell populations , and gene expr ession .  
 
5.3 Contraception  
 
After the enrollment visit, women will be asked to maintain a one -month period of no hormonal 
contraceptive use.  They will be counseled on non -hormonal methods of contraception (abstinence, 
barrier methods) and will be provided male and/or female condoms (as they prefer) at no cost.  
5.4 CVR Use  
 After one month  (Month 2 visit) , women  will be asked to initiate NuvaRing use using one of the 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 14 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 following two approaches. Participants will choose the approach they prefer, and will be provided  
standard counseling and health information about the risks and benefits associated with each:  
 
• Continuous CVR use for four 28 -day cycles, with replacement of the CVR after each cycle  
• Non -continuous CVR use involving use for 21 days, then removal for 7 days, with replacement 
after the 7 -day CVR -free period  
 
Participants  will initiate CVR use at any time in the cycle , with backup contraception (condoms) to cover 
the appropriate time period.  We will follow standard guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention ( CDC), the Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, which  
state that women who initiate CVR within 5 days of the start of menstrual bleeding do not require back 
up contraception.  Women initiating CVR >5 days after the start of menstrual bleeding require backup 
protection for the next 7 days.   
 
While the package insert mentions initiation early in cycle, we aim to keep the number of pre -initiation 
visits to a minimum. After four months of CVR use  (at Month 6 visit) , women will be offered the option  
to discontinue use of the CVR , will be provided condoms  and will then be assessed again after one 
month. Women may elect to continue CVR use at the Month 6 visit.  CVR will be provided by the study.   
 For subjects who opt for continuous CVR use and prefer to have their CVR removed by the study 
clinician, the CVR will be saved for future analysis.   
 
5.4.1 IUD Use  
 
All subjects will receive comprehensive contraceptive counseling a t the Month 6 and 7 visits. Women 
who choose to discontinue the CVR and initiate an IUD for contraception will be offered participation in 
an optional IUD Extension Study . Women  will receive a list of clinics where they can schedule IUD 
placement, including the Public Health –  Seattle & King County STD Clinic (located in the same building 
and floor as the research visits), Harborview Women’s Clinic, University of Washington affiliated clinics, or other family planning clinics in the area. Subjects can choose the IUD brand that they prefer, including 
the levonorgestrel -releasing IUD (Mirena, Liletta, Skyla, Kyleena), or the nonhormonal copper IUD 
(Paragard). Screening, pre -procedur e preparation, and the IUD insertion will be performed as part of 
primary care by health care providers and will not be part of study procedures. Subjects will be 
instructed to contact the study coordinator after IUD placement to schedule their Month 8 (IU D 1) visit.  
 
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
 
Administration of any medication or therapies considered necessary for the subject’s welfare will be 
documented in the subject’s  case report form in the  concomitant medication section  at each visit, 
includi ng treatment for BV and STIs.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1 Clinical Examination 
 
Pelvic examination:  all findings will be recorded in the CRF Exam Form . 
 
Pelvic Examination and Specimen Collection: 
A non -lubricated speculum  must be used during pelvic examination. After visual external examination  
and CVF (soft cup) collection , specimen collection/examination should take place in the following order. 
Table 1 summarizes the samples to be collected at various visits.  
 
Vaginal Discharge Identification Observe for presence of  discharge and, if present, characterize by visual examination.  
 
7.2 Laboratory Evaluations  
 7.2.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
 
pH Measurement  
Measure pH of vaginal discharge with pH indicator sticks. Samples for pH should be obtained from the 
lateral vaginal wall.  Avoid contact with cervical mucus.  
 Vaginal & Cervical Swabs/Fluid  
There will be a total of 6 vaginal swabs , collection of vaginal fluid using a soft cup , and 1 endocervical 
cytobrush for those participating in the optional study at Months 1a, 1b and 3 : 
1. Vaginal fluid collected using soft cup for measurement of cytokines and other immune mediators;  
2. Saline and KOH microscopy (to asses for amine odor, clue cells, trichomonads, and yeast) ; 
3. Gram stain of vaginal fluid (to confirm presence of BV, if present) ; 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 19 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 4. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis ; (lateral 
vaginal wall, p. 23 ; collected at Enrollment and then as indicated at subsequent visits ) 
5. Vaginal fluid swab for storage (Epi- Centre) ; 
6. Quantitative PCR assays fo r vaginal bacteria (2 Epi- Centre swabs) ; (lateral vaginal wall, p. 23)  
7. Endocervical cytobrush for immune cell characterization (collected at Enrollment (Month 1a), 
Month 1b and Month 3 visits) for those subjects enrolled in the Hormonal sub-study.  
 
Test fo r Volatile Amines (Whiff Test), Yeast, Clue Cells and Motile Trichomonads  
Swab lateral vaginal walls with a cotton -tipped applicator and place a liberal amount of discharge on 
each of two glass slides.  Mix two drops of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) with t he discharge on one 
slide and immediately determine if a fishy amine -like odor is present. Mix two drops of 0.9% saline 
solution with the discharge on the other slide and place a cover slip over both slides. Examine both slides under a light microscope at 10X and at 40X magnification. On the KOH slide, note the presence or 
absence of yeast (buds and hyphal elements). On the saline slide, note the presence or absence of 
motile trichomonads and clue cells. Clue cells will be identified as vaginal epithelial c ells with such heavy 
coating of bacteria surrounding them that their peripheral borders are obscured. Three representative 
fields should be examined and the ratio of clue cells to vaginal epithelial cells determined. Clue cells should be >  20% of vaginal e pithelial cells to meet criteria for diagnosis of BV.  
 NAAT for STIs on Vaginal Swabs  
The clinician will obtain a vaginal swab using the swabs supplied for the GenProbe Aptima test for 
trichomonas/chlamydia/gonorrhea). The swab will be sent to the HMC CT Laboratory.   
 
Urine Sample  
Collected to test for pregnancy at Screening and at additional visits, if  indicated.  
 
Serum Samples  
For HSV  testing, 10.0 ml of blood will be collected in a red top  tube. For HIV testing, 2.0  ml of blood will 
be collected in a lavender -top tube .  Specimens will be transported to the UW Virology Laboratory in 
Seattle.  
 For prog esterone testing, collect 1.0 mL of blood in a red top tube for testing at RTS located at HMC . 
 
7.2.2 Research Laboratory Evaluations  
 
Collection of Endocervical Fluid Using SoftCup   
Soft Cup: After all swabs are collected, a flexible menstrual soft cup will be  inserted gently into the 
vagina. The participant will be encouraged to ambulate following insertion. The cup will then be removed, divided and placed into two tubes, and stored for eventual transpo rt to the Fredricks ’ 
laboratory  in Seattle.  
 
Sample for Gr am Stain  
Swab posterior fornix  with a cotton -tipped applicator.  Place a moderate amount of discharge on slide 
and spread it as evenly as possible and allow the slide to air dry.  With a pencil, label the slide with the subject’s study ID , visit number and  date .  Place  the slide in a plastic slide holder or slide box  for 
transport to the lab for reading .  All Gram stains will be read by microbiologists without knowledge of 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 20 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 any patient’s clinical condition and interpreted in accordance with pre -determined criteria. Slides will be 
sent to the Fredricks’ Laboratory  in Seattle.  
 
Vaginal Swabs for Molecular Analyses and Storage  
Obtain three additional swabs of vaginal fluid, usin g the Epi Probe swabs supplied, from the lateral 
vaginal walls. Two are for performance of quantitative PCR assays, and the other is for storage for future 
analysis. Two swabs should be placed in the - 70 freezer for later transport to Dr. David Fredricks’ lab. 
The remaining (3rd)  swab should be retained  in the - 70 freezer at UW VRC  for future analysis.  
 
Vaginal biopsies  
Vaginal biopsies  will be collected at 2 study visits (Month 1 and Month 6) , and Month 13 (IUD 6) for IUD 
Extension Study  participants.  
 Two biopsies will be collected at each visit . One specimen will be divided; o ne half will be analyzed by  
Dr. Dorothy Patton’s lab for epithelial cell layer thickness and immunohistological staining for cellular 
glycogen content, and the other half will  be analyzed for immune cell populations at the Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  (Dr. F lorian Hladik and  Dr. Jennifer Lund’s lab). The second biopsy 
will be preserved in R NAlater (at room temperature for 24 hours to allow tissue penetration, followed 
by storage at - 70C) and processed for RNA -Seq.  
 CVR Storage for Future Analysis  
CVRs that are removed at the clinic will be saved for future analysis.   
 
7.2.3 Laboratory Procedures and Specimen Processing  
 
At all visits (listed in Table 1) vaginal material will be collected using polyester- tipped swabs or Epi -
Centre swabs which will be stored locally at - 70 C prior to shipping  to the Fredricks Lab in Seattle. Refer 
to the SoftCup SOP for specimen processing.   
 
Quantification of cytokines, chemokin es, and antimicrobial soluble immune mediators in vaginal fluid :  
For measurement of local immune mediators, we will use a combination of transcriptional profiling of 
endocervical cells as well as ELISAs.  We will use RNASeq and RT -PCR to measure transcrip tional profiles 
of endocervical cells collected before, during, and after CVR initiation.  We will measure concentrations  
of total protein (BCA Protein Kit) and the following:  IL -1α, IL -1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-1ra, 
IFN-epsilon, RANTES, MIP -3α, MIP -1α and MIP -1β by multiplex proteome array with beads from 
Chemicon International, measured using Luminex and analyzed using StarStation (Applied Cytometry Systems). These mediators were selected because they are present in genital tract secreti ons and have 
been linked to modulation by exogenous sex hormones, and with STI/HIV risk. We will also measure the concentration of select anti -inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial proteins that may contribute to 
host defense using commercial ELISA kits : SLPI (R & D Systems), HNP1 -3 (HyCult Biotechnology), HBD -1, 
HBD -2 and HBD -3 (Alpha Diagnostics), lactoferrin (Calbiochem) and lysozyme (Alpco Diagnostics).   
 
Performance of vaginal proteomic analysis:  We will perform proteomic analysis on saved samples from 
this study, at a laboratory to be determined. We anticipate that the Protein Profiling technique of Multiplexed Isobaric Tagging Technology for Relative Quantitation (iTRAQ)
22 will be used to determine 
protein expression changes in the vaginal proteome  between 20 women, obtained at two visits: one 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 21 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 prior to CVR insertion, and one two months after CVR insertion. For the analysis, we will select visits at 
which BV (or other STI) are not present to maximize likelihood that proteomic changes will be less lik ely 
to be influenced by other processes. To maximize likelihood of identifying unique proteins that contribute, we will select samples with highest and lowest quantities of L. crispatus and lowest and 
highest Nugent scores, respectively. For this set of 40  samples, 6 x 8 plexes will be used. One tag in each 
iTRAQ set will contain a pooled standard of all of the samples and will be used in analysis to cross 
compare the 6 iTRAQ samples sets. LC -MS/MS is performed on an AB SCIEX TripleTOF ® 5600 mass 
spectrometer equipped with a Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC system. Protein identification and 
quantitation is done with the AB ProteinPilot ™ software. Data are deposited into the Yale Protein 
Expression Database (YPED)
23 which is an integrated web -accessible software system that addresses the 
storage, retrieval, and integrated analysis of high throughput proteomic and small molecule analyses. 
For biostatistical analysis, the ProteinPilot peptide summary is filtered to include only peptides with 1) no mis -cleavages, 2) high confidence peptide identifications, and 3) two or more iTRAQ reagent ratios 
for this peptide. A cyclic lowess normalization
24 is then performed to compensate for any differences 
between iTRAQ labels.    
8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
Side effects of CVR use : As noted above, the NuvaRing has an acceptable safety profile, is approved for 
use by the U.S. F.D.A., and is widely used by U.S. women for contraception. We will routinely query participants prior to use for any contraindications to CVR use, and also carefully assess at each visit for the development of any interim clinical processes of concern (for example, thrombosis) that might represent a side effect of the CVR  as listed in the package insert . Participants  will also be asked to 
contact us at any time during the study should they have concerns about new symptoms or signs.  
 
Management of adverse events & counseling related to CVR : Participants will receive standard 
counseling about anticipated side effects of CVR initiation, and will be assessed for any adverse events 
reported during the course of the study as needed. The main adverse event we anticipate is irregular bleeding among women who use the CVR continuously; this is typically mild and resolves within first two cycles of use. Dr. Sarah Prager, a collaborator on this project, is highly trained in management of 
contraceptive use, and will provide expert guidance as needed.  
 
Phlebotomy :  May cause some pain or bruising.   Some persons may feel light -headed  or faint when 
blood is drawn.   
 
Collection of swabs and cervicovaginal samples from genital areas :  If samples are collected during 
herpes episodes, this may cause some irritation from the already sore lesion.  Collection of swabs does 
not pose risk of a dditional infection.    
 
IUD risk :  There is a very small risk that the IUD could be pulled out at the time of pelvic exam or during 
sample collection.   
 
Data collection :  Participants may feel some stress or discomfort answering personal and sensitive 
questions about their health and sexual practices.   
 
Pelvic/genital examination :  Discomfort should be similar to that experienced for a PAP test.  There 
may be a feeling of pressure from the speculum, which may be used to hold the vaginal walls open.  
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 22 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 Participants may briefly feel pressure when the swab touches the cervix when samples are taken for 
bacterial or viral cultures.  
 
Side effects of oral and intravaginal metrondiazole gel:  These medications may be needed to treat BV 
during study participation. Interactions between oral metronidazole and alcohol can produce nausea, 
vomiting, and flushing.  Alcohol should be avoided while taking oral metronidazole or using intravaginal 
metrondiazole gel.  Yeast infections may be associated with metronidazole gel.  P articipants will be 
checked for a yeast infection if they develop symptoms during the study.   
 
Risks of vaginal biopsy :  Patients may experience pain associated with the speculum examination. They 
also may have pain associated with lidocaine injection and  the biopsy. There are small risks of b leeding 
and infection . Risk of bleeding will be minimized by biopsy location along the upper anterior or posterior 
aspect of the vagina, use of lidocaine with epinephrine,  observation and use of silver nitrate or Mons el’s 
solution to ensure hemostasis. To minimize the risk of delayed bleeding, participants will be instructed 
to avoid sex ual intercourse  or placement of tampons for 5  days.  Subjects will be instructed to not begin 
collecting vaginal swabs until 5 days af ter the biopsy to ensure healing.    All procedures will be 
performed by a board -certified gynecologist or experienced nurse practitioner who has performed 
vaginal biopsies for other research studies.  
 
8.1 Known Potential Benefits  
 
Subjects may benefit from participation in this study by having a blood test for detection of infection with HSV2  and HIV , and by finding out more about the likelihood of their having BV or recurrent BV .  
They will not be charged for any of the diagnostic tests.  Subjects may benefit from pre and post -test 
counseling, treatment and referrals, as necessary.  We have found that subjects are empowered by knowing how frequently they shed HSV -2, for example, and by knowing more about what BV is and how 
it can be prevented .   Otherwise, this  study will not be of direct benefit to the subjects.   
 
8.2 Specification of Safety Parameters  
 
Safety will be assessed by the frequency, incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs solicited in -clinic and 
via phone call.  
8.3 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
 
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events  
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring all AEs  that are observed or reported during the study  are 
documented .    
8.4.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
 
Adverse Event:   Interna tional Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E6 defines an AE as any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment.  An AE  can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 23 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product.  The occurrence of an AE may 
come to the attention of study per sonnel during study visits and interviews or by a vaccine recipient 
presenting for medical care.  
 
Severity of Event:   All AEs will be assessed by the clinician using a standard  grading system  (NIH DAIDS 
Adverse Events Toxicity Tables) . For events not included in the protocol defined grading system, the 
following guidelines will be used to quantify intensity:  
 
Mild : events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities.  
 
Moderate : events result  in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
 
Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Se vere events are usually incapacitating.  
 
Life threatening : any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction th at had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Relationship to study procedures :  The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of an AE to study 
procedur es is part of the documentation process .  If there is any doubt as to whether  a clinical 
observation is an AE, the event should be reported to the PI .  AEs will be assessed according to the 
relationship to the study process : associated or not associated. To help assess, the following guidelines 
are used.  
 
Associated – The event is temporally related to the study procedures and no other etiology 
explains the event.  
 Not Associated –  The event is temporally independent of study the study procedures and/or  the 
event appears to be explained by another etiology.  
 
8.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
 
A SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following conditions:  
- Results in death during the period of protocol defined surveillance.  
- Is life -threatening (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event).  
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization during the period of 
protocol -defined surveillance.  
- Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
- Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
- Any other important medic al event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the 
event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  
one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 24 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the develop ment of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.5 Reporting Procedures  
 
Adverse events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF.  Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, investigator assessment of severity, investigator asses sment of relationship to study product, date of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome.  The intensity  of nonserious AEs can be assessed by a 
licensed clinician (i.e., physician, nurse, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant).  Causality  of non serious 
AEs can be assessed only by a clinician licensed to make medical diagnoses (ie, physician, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant).  All AEs occurring while on study will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or until considered stable.  
 Any medical condition that is present at screening will be considered as baseline and will not be reported as an AE.  If the severity of any pre -existing medical condition increases during the stud y 
period, then it will be recorded as an AE . 
 
All SAEs will be reported immediately to the Investigator.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
9.1 Outcomes  
 
Aim 1. The primary outc ome will be quantity of L. crispatus measured by qPCR at all available follow -up 
visits and will be compared during five  months of CVR use to one month  prior to CVR use. Secondary 
outcomes will be BV defined clinically by Amsel and confirmed by Nugent crit eria at any follow -up visit, 
quantities of other BVAB defined by qPCR assay, and reported genital adverse events.  Quantity and 
presence of other lactobacilli and BVAB species detected by PCR will be assessed using the methods 
outlined above. All available  follow -up observations will be used. Quantity of L. crispatus will be log 
transformed and analyzed using a linear mixed model with subject random effect to account for correlation within person. Binary outcomes will be analyzed using generalized estimatin g equations with 
log link and robust standard errors to estimate relative risks while accounting for correlation.  
 Aim 2. The outcomes of interest will be compared within participants, using each woman as her own control; observations from the time prior to CVR initiation will be compared to those collected during 
CVR use. We will use methods for Normal data and then use non -parametric approaches or dichotomize 
and use binomial link GEE if data are highly skewed and cannot be transformed into a Normal 
distribution. Some analyses will be exploratory; we will compare quantities of several immune mediators noted above by CVR use.  These comparisons will not likely be independent, so we will adjust 
for multiple comparisons by permutation procedure. We will also correlate concentrations of immune mediators with qPCR results in Aim 1 to test the hypothesis that higher concentrations o f protective 
lactobacilli will be associated with higher levels of protective mediators, and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Continuous variables between comparison groups will be compared using t -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, and di chotomous variables will be compared by chi-
square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Linear mixed effects models or generalized estimating equation (GEE) models will be used to examine whether outcomes (mediator concentrations, vaginal bacterial 
Protocol_NuvaRing (Project 4)  Page 26 of 33 version 7.0, 27- MAR -18 quantities) d iffer significantly between comparison groups after adjustment for confounding factors 
identified through univariate analysis. All analyses will assume a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  
 
Aim 3. The primary outcomes will be (1) incidence of BV at all  available follow -up visits, and  (2) time to 
BV during four months of CVR use relative to the two months prior to CVR use. For secondary analysis, we will measure the quantity of HSV -2 by PCR. This will be log transformed and association with CVR use 
exami ned using a linear mixed model as for Aim 1.  Sample size calculation: Data from our prospective 
studies of BV were used to estimate the likelihood of these conditions occurring during follow -up. Over 
six months of observation, we have documented BV recurr ence rates after cure of an initial BV episode 
of 28 / 100 person -years in absence of any hormonal contraception . A recent meta -analysis estimated 
that HC was associated with a 30% reduced likelihood of BV.
25 With these assumptions, we will have 
reasonable  power to detect a 30% or greater difference in incidence of BV by CVR status (Table 5). 
However, BV incidence may be lower, and mechanisms for a favorable shift in vaginal microbiome, if affected  by CVR, may be heterogeneous. If so, we will still be able to generate important preliminary 
data in support of the CVR’s favorable effect on the vaginal environment through demonstration of improved microbiome maintenance and immune profile; this would support future study of the CVR in populations with higher in cidence of BV and other cervicovaginal STI.  
9.2 Sample Size  
 Aim 1: Total anticipated enrollment is 120  women.  We will screen approximately 56 women per month 
over 18 months and estimate that about  14 women/month will be interested in participating . We 
anticipate that of the interested women , approximately 50% will have BV  or a history of BV in the prior 6 
months, for predicted  enrollment of 6 -7 women per month . Assuming at least 75% of women return for 
at least one pre - and one post -CVR visit, we will have at least 90  analyzable women.  
 Aim 2: Participants are as described in Aim 1.  
 
Aim 3:  Participants are as described in Aim 1. Moreover, we anticipate that approximately half o f the 
total women enrolled will be H SV-2-infected at study entry ( 60 women).   
10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

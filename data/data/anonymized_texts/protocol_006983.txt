SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209511
Protocol Title : Phase IIIb/IV, Randomized, Double Blinded, Study of Nivolumab 3 mg/kg in Combination with 
Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg vs Nivolumab 1 mg/kg in Combination with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in Subjects with Previously 
Untreated, Un resectable or Metastatic Melanoma
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):
Arm A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (N3I1) IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses then 
flat dose nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks 
Arm B: nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (N1I3) IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses then flat 
dose nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks.
Study Phase:   IIIb/ IV
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with N3I1 will show a reduced rate of drug-related Grade 3 -5 adverse events 
compared with N1I3 and have similar efficacy in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma.
Objectives : 
The primary  objective is to compare the incidence of drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg to nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive 
subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Key secondary  objectives include:
To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), as determined by investigators, of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined 
with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 1mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive subjects 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma .
To evaluate progr ession free survi val (PFS) of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in treatment -naive subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma.
To assess overall survival (OS)
To assess Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) using the European Organi sation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC QLQ -C30). 
Study Design :
This is a Phase IIIb/IV, randomized, double blinded, study of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 
1mg/kg vs nivolumab 1 mg/kg ipilimumab in combination with 3 mg/kg in adult subjects with p reviously untreated, 
unresectable or metastatic m elanoma .
The study  will consi st of 3 phases: screening, treatment, and follow -up.

Subjects will be randomized 1:1 and stratified by programmed cell death receptor -ligand 1 (PD-L1)expression (5% 
tumor cell surface expression vs < 5% tumor cell s urface expression/indeterminate ), and American Joint Commission 
on Cancer (AJCC )M stage (M0/M1a/M1b vs M1c). Record of BRAF V600 status (mutant vs wildty pe) must be 
provided (by local institutional standard), but not used for stratification.   
On-treatment phase consists ofParts 1 and 2:
During Part 1, subjects will be tr eated every 3 weeks with the combination of nivolumab and i pilimumab for 4cycles.
A cycle will be defined as 3 weeks during Part 1.   
During Part 2, s ubjects will be treated by n ivolumab, flat dose 480 mg every four weeks , beginning 6 weeks after the 
last combination dose .A cycle will be defined as 4 weeks during Part 2.   
Treatment will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity in both arms ,up to a maximum of 2 years treatment
Study Population:
Key Inclusion Criteria: (see Protocol Section 3.3.1 for full list of criteria)

No prior systemic anticancer therapy  for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
melanoma therapy  is permitted if it was completed at least 6 weeks prior to date of first dose, and all related 
adverse events have either returned to baseline or stabilized.
Measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1 .1 (RECIST )criteria
Tumo r tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease must be provided for biomarker analyses. In order 
to be randomized, a subject must be classified as PD -L1 positive, PD -L1 negative, or PD -L1 indeterminate. If an

biomarker analyses. 
Known BRAF V600 mutation status as determined by local institutional stan dard or subject to consent to BRAF 
V600 mutation testing per local institutional standards during the Screening Period, the results of which must be 
reported within 3 months of randomization. All BRAF statuses (BRAF wild -typeor BRAF 600 mutation positive)
are eligible .
Key Exclusion Criteria :
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases areeligible if these have 
been treated and there is no evidence of progression viamagnetic resonance imaging (MRI , except where 
contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) for at least 8 weeks after trea tment is complete and within 28 days 
prior to first dose of study drug administration. There must also be no requirement for high doses of systemic
corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks 
prior to study drug administration.
Ocular melanoma
Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, 
residua l hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not 
requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted 
to enroll.
Subjects mustalso meet the study criteria including exclusion for medical history , positive hepatitis B/C, HIV and 
pregnancy tests, and the laboratory criteria described in Section 3.3.
Study Drug: includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Products (IP/IMP) and Non -investigational [Med icinal] 
Products (Non -IP/Non -IMP) as listed:

Medication Potency IP
Nivolumab BMS -936558-01 
Solution for Injection100 mg (10 mg/mL) 10 mL per vial
Ipilimumab 200 mg (5 mg/mL) 40 mL per vial
Study Assessments : 
Adverse events will be collected to determine the incidence of drug -related adverse events between the two cohorts.
Subjects will be observed for tumor response ( ORRand P FS).
Subjects will be assessed by computed tomography  (CT) o r magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning Week 12 
(1 week) from randomization and continuing every 8weeks (1week )for the first 12 months andthen every 
12weeks (2week s) until disease progression.
Subjects will be followed for O verall survival (OS) after disease progression or after drug -discontinuation.
Patient reported outcomes will be collected using the EQ- 5D and EORTC QLQ -30
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: Approximately 346 subjects will be randomized to the 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio in order to target 
340 treated subjects (170 per arm). Given a two-sided alpha of 0.05, this number of treated subjects provides 80%

power to show a statistically significant difference in the rate of drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs between the two 
treatment arms, assuming a rate of 40% in Arm A and a rate of 55% in Arm B.
Endpoints: The primary  endpoint is the incidence of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AEs. 
The secondary endpoints of the study are investigator determined OR R, PFS, OS, and HRQoL.
Analyses:   For the primary analy sis, we will report the drug-related Grade 3 -5 AE rate by treatment arm, the 
difference in rates between arms, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Two -sided CMH test, stratified by 
PD-L1 expression and M stage at screening, will be performed to compare the rate of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AE rate 
between the two treatment arms.
ORRs and corresponding 95% exact Confidence Interval ( CI)s will be calculated using the Clopper Pearson method 
for each of the treatment arms. BOR will be tabulated for each treatment group. The 2 treatment arms will be compared 
using a two-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by PD-L1 expression and M stage at screening. 
Associated odds ratios and 95% CIs for Arm A relative to Arm B will be calculated , and a p -value will be pre sented 
for descriptive purposes . An estimate of the difference in ORRs and corresponding 95% CI will be calculated using 
CMH methodology.
PFS curves for each t reatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit method. Median PFS and 
corresponding two-sided, 95% confidence intervals will be computed. Descriptive Hazard Ratio and corresponding 
two sided 95% CIs for Arm A relative to Arm B will be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, with 
treatment group as a single covariate stratified by PD -L1 expression and M Stage at screening. PFS rates at 6 months 
with 95% CIs will be estimated using KM methodology. 
OS will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier methodology. Median values, along with two-sided 95% 
CIs will be calculated. EORTC QLQ -C30 scale data will be summarized by timepoint using descriptive statistics for 
each treatment group.

2 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS
2.1 Good Clinical Practice
This study  will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP), as defined by the 
International Conference on Harm onisati on (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles 
underlying European Unio n Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal 
Regulation s, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the protocol . The protocol  and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinio n prior to init iation of the study .
All potenti al serious breaches must be reported to Bristol  Myers Squibb (BMS )immediately. A 
serious breach is a breach of the condit ions and principles of GCP in connect ion with the study  or

Personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualified by educat ion, training, and 
experience t o perform their respective tasks .
This study  will not use the services of study personnel where sancti ons have been invoked or where 
there has been scient ific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.2 Institutional Review Board/Indep endent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the invest igator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinio n 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol , consent form, subject recruit ment materials (eg, 
advert isements), and any other written informat ionto be provi ded to subj ects. The invest igator or 
BMS shoul d also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigat or Brochure or product labeling
inform ation to be provided to subjects and any  updates. 
The investigator or BMS shoul dprovide the IRB/IEC with reports, upd ates and other informat ion 
(eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments ,and administrative letters )according to regulatory 
requi rements or i nstitution procedures .
2.3 Informed Consent
Invest igators must ensure that subjects are clearly and full y informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other crit ical issues regarding clinical studies in which they  volunteer to participate. 
In situat ions where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country g uidelines) are clearly and fu lly informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provi de the invest igator with an appropri ate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements requi red by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requi rements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki .
Invest igators m ust:
Provi de a copy  of the consent form  and wri tten information about the study  in the language
in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participat ion. The language 
must be non -technical  and easily understood. 
Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details o f the study .
Obtain an info rmed consent signed and personally dated by the su bject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who condu cted the informed consent discussio n. 
Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinio n of the written informed consent 
form and any other inform ation to be provi ded to the subjects, pri or to the beginning of the 
study, and after any revisio ns are completed for new informat ion.
If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, and the subject subsequent ly beco mes capable of making and co mmunicating his or her
inform edconsent duri ng the study , consent must addit ionally  be obtained from  the subject.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase IIIb/IV,randomized, doubl e blind, 2-arm study  of nivolumab 3 mg/kg combined 
withipilimumab 1 mg/kg vs nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined withipilimumab 3 mg/kg , in adult 
(18 years) subjects with previously  untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Subjects 
must have unresectable or metastati c Stage III orstage IV melanoma, as per the AJCC staging 
system, and must not have received prior systemic therapy  for the treatm ent of unresectable or 
metastati c melano ma. 
Subjects will be rando mized 1:1 and stratified by PD-L1 status and AJCC M stage as described 
below :
PD-L1 expression level
PD-L1 5% tumor cell surface expressio n (in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor 
cells) vs 
PD-L1 < 5% tum or cell surface expressi on (in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor 
cells)/indeterminate (tumor cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining 
or melanin content)
AJCC M stage at screening (See Appendix 4)

Figure 3.1 -1: Study Design Schematic
It is expected that 460 subjects will need to be enrolled in order to randomize 346, assuming a 
screen failure rate of 25%.
This study  will consist of 3phases: screening, treatment, and fo llow-up.
3.1.1 Screening Phase
Begins by establishing the subject’s init ial eligibi lity and si gning of the ICF.
Subject is enro lled using the I RT
Tumor tissue obtained in the metastatic setting or from  an unresectable site of disease must be 
provi ded for bi omarker analyses.  In order to be rando mized, a subject must have quant ifiable 
PD-L1 expressio n (5% or <5% tumor cell membrane staining) or be classified as PD-L1 
indeterminate . If an insufficient amount of tumor tissue fro m an unresectable or metastati c site 
is available prior to the start of the screening phase, subjects must consent to the acquisit ion of 
additional tumor tissue for perform ance of bio marker analyses .Previously

4doses or
Arm B(N1I3) : nivolumab 1 mg/kg +ipilimumab 3 mg/kg ipilimumab are administered 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses.
After combinat ion therapy , all subjects will receive a flat dose 480 mg nivolumab IV every 
4weeks , beginning 6 weeks after the last combinatio ndose, until progressio n or unacceptable 
toxicity.
Treatment with Nivo lumab will be li mited to 2 y ears maximum duration.
A negat ive pregnancy test should be documented within 24 hours prior to start of each dose of 
investigat ional product.
Within 3 days from rando mization , the subject m ust receive the dose of study  medicati on.
On study  laboratory  assessments should be drawn within 72 hours prior to dosing
PK samples and immunogenicit y samples will be collected according to the schedule in Table 
5.1-2and Table 5.1-3
Adverse event assessments should be documented at each clinic visit. 
Quality ofLife will be assessed using European Organi sation for Research and Treatm ent of 
Cancer Qualit y Of Life Quest ionnaire -core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30)and European Qualit y of 
Life-5 Dimensi ons (EQ-5D) questionnaires , to be com pleted after randomizati on,prior to the 
first dose of  study therapy  and every  6 weeks for the first 6 months,and every  4 weeks until 
approximately  week 40, according to the schedule in Table 5.1 -2.
Study  drug dose may  be delayed for toxicit y. See Section 4.4.1 .
Treated subjects will be evaluat ed for response according to the RECIST 1.1 guidelines 
beginning 12 weeks ( 1 week) after randomizat ion and cont inuing every 8 weeks (1 week) 
for the first 12 months, and then every  12 weeks (2week ) until disease progressi on or 
treatm ent discont inuat ion, whichever occurs later .
This phase ends when the subject is discont inued from study  therapy. For a complete list of 
reasons for treatment discont inuat ion, see Section 3.5.
3.1.3 Follow -Up Phase
Begins when the decision to discontinue a subject from study  therapy is made (no further 
treatm ent wi th study  therapy ).  Pati ents will be followed for efficacy and OS.
Subjects who disc ontinue treatm ent for reasons other than tum or progressi on will continue to 
have tumor assessments beginning 12 weeks (1 week ) after randomizat ion and cont inuing 
every 8weeks (1 week) for the first 12 months from rando mizat ion, and every 12 weeks 
(2week s) thereafter until documented tumor progressio n.

Subjects will be followed for drug-related toxicities until these toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline or are deem ed irreversible. All adverse events will be docum ented f or a minimum  of 
100 day s afte r last dose.
After completion of the first two follow- up visit s, subjects will be fo llowed every  3 months for 
survival.
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all randomized subjects outside of the protocol 
defined window as detailed in the Time and Events Table 5.1-4Follow-up Assessments 
(CA209511). At the time of this request, each subject will be contact ed to determine their survival 
status unless the subject has wit hdrawn consent for all contact.
The total duration of the study  from start of randomizat ion to primary analysis of the study is 
expected to be approximately 13months (7months of accrual  + 6months of follow -upafter last 
subject has been dosed ), assuming an accrual rate of  58 subjects per month.Addit ionalsurvival 
follow-up may continue for up to 5 years from the primary  analysis. The study  will end once 
survival fo llow-up has concluded.   
3.2 Post Study Access to Therapy
At the concl usion of the study , subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied study  drugup to themaximum treatm ent durati on of 2 years.

Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman canbe considered

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent
Any clinical adverse event , laboratory abnormalit yor intercurrent illness which, in the opinio n 
of the invest igator, indica tes that conti nued parti cipati on in the study  is not in the best interest 
of the subject
Terminat ion of the study  by BMS
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent thro ugh imprisonment or involuntarilyincarceration 
for treatm ent of ei ther a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious di sease) illness
Unblinding a subject for any  reason (emergency or non -emergency)
Pregnancy .
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event. In the event a normal healthy female subject beco mes pregnant 
during a clinical  trial, the study  drug must be discontinued immediately . In most cases, the study 
drug will be perm anently discont inued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary 
for subject safet y).  Please call the BMS Medical Moni tor within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuat ion of study drug, a discussio n between the invest igator and the BMS Medica l 
Monitor/desi gnee m ust occur.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).

3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follow up
In this study ,overall survival is a key endpo int of the study . Post study  follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject safet y and t he integrit y of the study. Subjects who 
discontinue study  drug must continue to be followed for collect ion of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line with Section 5until death or the conclusio n of the study .
BMS m ay request that survival data be collected on all treated/randomized subjects outside of the 
protocol  defined window ( Table 5.1 -1).At the time of this request, each subject will be contacted 
to determine their survival status unless the subject has withdrawn consent for all contacts or is 
lost to foll ow-up.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study  drugwill remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified fo llow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authori zed by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal  of consent shoul d be explained in detail in the medical records by  the invest igator, as 
to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study fo llow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vi tal status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
inform ation shoul d be used to determine vi tal status only as appropriately  directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up wi th persons authori zed by  the subjec t as noted above. Lost to fo llow-up 
is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum  of three docum ented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. All attem pts 
shoul d be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If invest igator’s use of third -party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study has 
been included in the subjec t’s inform ed consent, then the i nvest igator may use a Sponsor -retained 
third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up porti on of the study .The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public healt h registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact informat ion.If after all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator shoul d be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records .

4.1 Investigational Product
An invest igational product, also known as invest igational medicinal product in someregions, is 
defined a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study , including products already with a market ing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) different ly thanthe authori zed form, or used for an 
unauthori zed indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The invest igational product shoul d be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibilit y of the investigator to ensure that invest igational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The invest igational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authori zed personnel according to local regulat ions.
In thi s protocol , invest igational products are:
Nivo lumab
Ipilimumab
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnosti c, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
non-invest igational products. 
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager shoul d ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidi ty) as determined by BMS . If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study drug arise, the study drug should not be dispense d
and contact BMS immediately.
Study  drug not supplied by  BMS will  be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Invest igational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes requi red to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
docum entati on of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures , 
reconstitution, and use of required processes ( eg,required diluents, administration sets).
4.3.1 Part 1 Study Drug Administration (Combination Portion)
In the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combinat ion porti on, nivolumab is to be administered first.
Subjects shoul d receive nivolumab at a dose of 3mg/kg (Arm  A) or 1mg/kg (Arm  B) as a 
30-minute IV infusio n, on Day 1 of each treatment cycle every  3  w eeks for 4 doses or until 
progression, unacceptable toxici ty, withdrawal of consent, or the study  ends, whichever occurs 
first. 
The nivo lumab infusio n must be prompt ly followed by a saline flush to clear the line o fnivolumab 
before starting the next infusio n.

The second infusio nin the co mbination cohort will always be ipilimumab, and will start 
approximat ely30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusio nand the infusio n line has 
been flushed, filters changed and the pat ient has been observed to ensure no infusion react ion has 
occured.
Subjects should receive ipilimumab at a dose of 1mg/kg (Arm  A) or at a dose of 3mg/kg (Arm B) 
as a 30-minute IV infusio n, on Day 1 of each treatm ent cycle every 3weeks (within 3calendar 
days of scheduled date)for 4 doses or until progressi on, unacceptable toxici ty, withdrawal  of 
consent, or the study  ends, whichever occurs first. 
The ri sk/benefit profile for nivo lumab has primarily been invest igated using a 60 -minute infusio n 
and for ipilimumab a 90-minute infusion. Long infusio n times place a burden on patients and 
treatm ent centers. Establishing that these agents can be safely administered using shorter infusio n 
times will diminish some of this burden.  Previous clinical studi es of nivolumab have used 
60-minute infusio n duration and for ipili mumab 90 -minute. Both nivo lumab and ipili mumab have 
been administered safely at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over these treatment durations. Overall, 
infusio n react ions including high-grade hypersensit ivity reacti ons have been uncomm on across 
multiple clinical studi es, and all have been managed b y following the safet y algori thms. Infusi on 
durati on of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not 
expected to present any safet y concerns compared with the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivo lumab 
dose infused over the 60-minute duration.  Similarly, shortened infusion durat ion of 30 minutes 
for ipilimumab is not expected to present addit ional safet y concerns .24
Both agents given as single agent is unco mmo nly associated with infusio n reacti ons, incidence 
less than 1% for ipilimumab (YervoyFDA Label ) and for nivolumab 3%.9  In the CA209069
study , hypersensit ivity/infusio n react ions were listed as 3.2% for the combination and 2.2% for 
ipilimumab.  No Grade3 or Grade4 hypersensit ivity/infusio n reacti ons were observed in either 
the combination or single agent ipilimumab treatm ent groups .25  
Subjects shoul d be carefully  monitored for infusion reacti ons during nivolumab/ipilimumab 
administration. If an acute infusio n reacti on is noted, subjects shoul d be managed according to 
Secti on4.4.
The pharmacy manual includes detailed instructions for study  medicat ion preparation .  
Dosing calculat ions should be based on the body  weight assessed at screening . It is not necessar y 
to re-calculate subsequent doses if the subject weight is wit hin 10% of the weight used to calculate 
the previous dose. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. 
During Part 1, subjects may be dosed no less than 19days between doses. If dosing is delayed, 
both nivo lumab and ipilimumab must be delayed together. If dosing is resumed after a delay, both 
nivolumab and ipilimumab must be resumed on the same day.

4.3.2 Part 2 Study Drug Administration (Maintenance)
Starti ng 6weeks after the last co -administered dose in Part 1 , subjects will be administered a flat 
dose 480mg nivolumab IV as a 30-minute IV infusio nevery  4week s(Q4W) (3days) until 
unacceptable toxicity or di sease progressi on, up to a m aximum  of 2 years treatment .
Subjects may be dosed up to 3 days after the scheduled date if necessary. Subsequent dosing shoul d 
be based on the actual  date of  adm inistration of the previous dose of drug. Every  effort shoul d be 
made to adhere to protocol treatm ent schedule of administrati on of nivolumab every  4 weeks in 
the maintenance phase.  In extenuating circumstances in which the patient cannot make the dosing 
schedule withinthe 3-day window, BMS Moni tor shoul d be contacted .

4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
CA209511 is a randomized, double -blind study. After the subject’s init ial eligibilit y is established 
and informed consent has been obtained, the subject must be enrolled into the study  by access ing 
an Interactive Response Technologies web-based system (IRT) to obtain the subject number. Ever y 
subject that si gns the informed consent form  must be assigned a subject number in IRT. Specific 
instructi ons for using I RTwill be provi ded to the investigational site in a separate doc ument. The 
investigator or designee will register the subject for enrollment by following the enrollment 
procedures established by BMS. The fo llowing inform ation is requi red for enrollment:
Date that informed consent was ob tained
Date of birth
Gender at bi rth.
Once enrolled in IRT, enrolled subjects that have met all eligibilit y criteria will be ready to be 
rando mized through the I RT. The fo llowing informat ion is required for subject randomizat ion:
Subject number
Date of birth
PD-L1 expressio n level (PD-L15% expressio n vs PD-L1 <5% expressio n/indeterminate) 
entered by  vendor
M Stage at screening ( See Appendix 4).
Subjects meet ing all eligibilit y criteria will rando mize 1:1 ratio to Arm A (N 3I1) or Arm B (N 1I3) 
and stratified by  the f ollowing factors:
PD-L1 expression 
M stage .

Grade ≥3AST, ALT, or total bilirubin will requi re discont inuat ion
Any Grade 3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnorm ality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations o f pancreat itis does not require dose delay. 
Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormalit y, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, warrants del aying the dose of study  medicat ion.
Subjects requi ring delay shoul d be re-evaluated weekly or more frequent ly if clinically indicated 
and resume dosing when re -treatment criteria are met.
4.4.2 Dose Modifications
Dose reducti ons or dose escalat ions are not permitted. All dose modification rules apply to both 
Arms A and B given the blinded nature of this study .
4.4.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment 
Subjects should resume treatment with nivo lumab and ipilimumab in both arms A and B given the 
blinded nature of the study  when the drug -related AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline, wi th 
the following except ions:
Subjects m ay resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fat igue
Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatm ent in

Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases)
Subject provi des wri tten informed consent pri or to receiving addi tional study  medicat ion, All 
other elements of the main inform ed consent including the descript ion of reasonably 
foreseeable risks or disco mforts, or other al ternative treatment options will st ill apply .
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be performed within 6 weeks of initial 
investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD. The assessment o f clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the subject is clinically  deteriorating and unlikely  to receive any benefit from continued 
treatm ent wi th nivo lumab.
If the invest igator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatm ent, the subject should remain on the trial and continue to receive monitoring according to 
the Time and Events Schedule on Secti on5.
For the subjects who continue study therapy beyo nd progression, further progression is defined as 
an addit ional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum o f 5 mm abso lute increase from t ime 
of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the 
diameters of new measurable lesio ns compared to the time of initial PD. Treatment with study 
medicat ion shoul d be di scontinued perm anent ly upon documentation of further progression.
New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progress ion may 
beco me measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely  due to 
inclusio n of new lesions which beco me measurable, these new lesio ns must demonstrate an
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
4.4.6 Management Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
than AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivo lumab and ipilimumab are considered I-O
agent sin this protocol. Early recognit ion and management of AEs associated with I-O agents ma y 
mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been devel oped to assist investigators in 
assessing and managing the fo llowing groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy

4.4.7 Treatment of Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is 
unlikely  to be immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, 
arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other all ergic -like react ions. All Grade 3 
or 4 infusio n react ions shoul d be reported within 24 hours to the study medical monitor and 
reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusio n reacti ons shoul d be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standard s and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s (mild reacti on; infusio n interruption not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recom mended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g at l east 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy  or infusi on interrupti on but responds 
prom ptly to symptom atic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal antiinflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):
Stop the study  drug infusio n, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and treat the subject wi th 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetam inophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until  resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no furthe r complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the ori ginal  infusi on rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further study 
medicat ion will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following pr ophylactic prem edicat ions are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minutes before nivo lumab and/or ipilimumab infusio ns. If 
necessary , corti costeroi ds (up to 2 5 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.

4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
The sponsor, subjects, investigator, and site staff will be blinded to th e study  drug administered 
during Part 1 (Combinat ion Portion) of the study . Each invest igative site must assign an unblinded 
pharmacist/designee, and an unblinded site monitor will be assigned by sponsor to provide 
oversi ght of  drug supply and othe r unblinded study documentation.
During Part 2 (monotherapy  portion), 480 mg nivolumab administered as a flat dose will be 
open -label. However, subject’s treatm ent assigned arm during Part 1 must not be revealed until 
end of study .
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study .Hence, every 
effort should be made to maintain the blind. However, in the event of a m edical emergency  or 
pregnancy in an individual subject in which knowledge of the invest igational product is crit ical to 
the subject's management, the blind for that subject may be broke n by the invest igator. The 
subject’s safet y takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatm ent 
assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an indiv idual subject's treatm ent, the invest igator shoul d determine
that the unblinded informat ion is necessary, ie, that it will alter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the 
investigat ional product , theproblem may be properly  managed by assuming that the subject is 
receiving active product . It is highly  desirable that the decision to unblind treatm ent assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Moni tor, but the investigator al ways has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblin d. The Principal Invest igator should only call in for emergency unblinding 
AFTER the decisio n to di scont inue the subject has been made .
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through IRT. For 
inform ation on how to unblind form emergency, please consult the IRT manual.
In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact the Medi cal Monitor and ensure every attem pt is 
made to preserve the blind .
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes shoul d be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor .
Designated staff of Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Devel opment may be unblinded prior to 
database lock to facilitate the bioanalyt ical analysis of pharmacokinetic samples and 
immunogenicit y. A bioanaly tical scientist in the Bioanaly tical Sciences departm ent of 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development (or a designee in the external central bioanalyt ical 
laboratory ) will be unblinded to the randomized treatm ent assignments in order to minimize 
unnecessary  bioanaly tical analysis o f samples . 
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be monitored by drug accountabilit y as well as the subject’s medica l 
record and electroni c case report form ( eCRF ).

4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study , study  drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced by the investigator) such as partially 
used study  drug containers, vials and sy ringes may be destroyed on site. 
Any unused study  drugs can only be destroy ed after being inspected and reconciled by the 
responsible Study  Monitor unless study  drug containers must be immediately destroy ed as required 
for safet y, or to m eet local regulat ions (eg,cytotox ics or bio logics). 
On-site destructi on is allowed provided the fo llowing minimal standards are met:
On-site disposal  pract ices must not expose humans to risks fro m the drug.
On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regul ations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
Written procedures for on-site disposal  are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provi ded to BMS upon request.
Records are maintained that allow for traceabilit y of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quanti ty disposed, and ident ification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal , ie,incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste dispos al vendor 
must be documented.
Accountabilit y and disposal  records are complete, up- to-date, and available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If condit ions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Study Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study  drug.
It is the investi gator’s responsibilit y to arrange for di sposal  of all empt y containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal  have been est ablished according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provi ded that appropri ate records of disposal  are 
kept.
4.9 Return of Study Dr ug
If study  drug will not be destroyed upon complet ion or terminat ion of the study , all unused and/or 
partially used study  drug that was supplied by BMS must be returned to BMS. The return of study 
drug will be arranged by the responsible Study  Moni tor. 
It is the investi gator’s responsibilit y to arrange for di sposal  of all empt y containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal  have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provi ded that appropri ate records of disposal  are 
kept.

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Study  evaluat ions will take place in accordance with the flow charts in Section 5.1. Baseline 
assessments shoul d be performed within 28 days prior to randomizat ionutilizing CT or MRI. In 
addition to chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain, all known sites of disease shoul d be assessed at 
baseline. Subsequent assessments should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites 
of disease and shoul d use the same imaging method as was used at baseline. Subjects will be 
evaluated for tumor response beginning 12 weeks (± 1week) from  randomizat ionand cont inuing 
every 8weeks (± 1 week) for the fi rst 12 m onths and every  12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter, until 
disease progressi on is docum ented or treatm ent is discontinued (whichever occurs later). Tumor 
assessments for ongoi ng study  treatment decisio ns will be completed by the invest igator using

5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment 
Efficacy assessment is not a primary endpo int.  The primary endpo int is the incidence of
drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs. See Section 6for a further descript ion of adverse event reporting .
5.4.2 Secondary Effica cy Assessments
The secondary  measur e of efficacy will include the ORR and PFS.
The ORR, will be determined by the invest igator using RECIST 1.1 criteria, in all treated subjects. 
ORR and is defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of complete response (CR) or partia l 
response (PR) divided by the number of treated subjects. The invest igator -determined ORR will 
be further characterized by the investigator -determined durati on of response (DOR) and the 
magnitude of reduction in tumor volume
The other secondary  efficacy  measure will be to evaluate PFS in all treated patients.
Addit ional secondary  endpoints include OSin all treated subjects.
Radiographic images will be co llected and sent to a centralized imaging core laboratory for storage 
and potenti al future central reading. 
5.4.2.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesio ns must be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by  CT/MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam  (lesio ns which cannot be accurately measured
with calipers shoul d be recorded as nonmeasurable)
20 mm by  chest x-ray.

must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow up, only the short axis willbe measured 
and fo llowed.
5.4.2.2 Non-measurable L esions 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly  non-measurable lesio ns.
Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial  effusio n, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdo minal masses/abdo minal organom egaly  ident ified by physical exam  that is not measurable

5.4.2.3 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone Lesions
Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed lyt ic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue co mponents, that 
can be evaluated by  cross secti onal imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesio ns if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of measurabilit y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
Cystic Lesions
Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts shoul dnot be considered 
as malignant lesio ns (neit her measurable nor non -measurable) since they are by definit ion, simple 
cysts.
“Cystic lesio ns”thought to represent cyst ic metastases can be considered as measurable lesio ns, if 
they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y described above. However, if noncyst ic lesio ns are 
present in the same subject, these are preferred for select ion as target lesio ns.
Non-measurable Lesions
Tumor lesio ns situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to locoreg ional 
therapy , are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesio n.
5.4.3 Specifications for Method of Measurement
5.4.3.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline eva luations should be 
perform ed as close as possible to the treatm ent start and never more than 28 days before the 
beginning of treatment.
5.4.3.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique shoul d be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be done rather than clinical examinat ion unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  clinical exam .
5.4.3.3 CT/MRI Scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumpt ion that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater th an 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesio n shou ld be twice the slice thickness.

5.4.3.4 Chest X -Ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest x-ray, particularly when progressi on is an important endpoint
since CT is more sensit ive than x -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesio nson 
chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded byaerated 
lung.
5.4.3.5 Clinical L esions
Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, docum entati on by color 
photography  including a ruler to estim ate the size of the l esion is suggested. As previously  noted, 
when lesio ns can be evaluated both by clinical exam  and imaging, imag ing evaluat ion shoul d be 
undertaken since it is more object ive and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
5.4.3.6 Ultrasound
Ultrasound is not useful in the assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by ul trasound in the course of the study , confi rmation 
by CT or MRI i s advised. 
5.4.3.7 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is not advised .
5.4.3.8 Tumor Markers
Tumor markers such as, but not limited to, LDH may be used for clinical management, but will 
not be included in the assessment of BOR.
5.4.4 Baseline Documentation of "Target” and “Non -Target Lesions”
5.4.4.1 Target L esions 
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum o f five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline.
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calcul ated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum , then as noted bel ow, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tum or regression in
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
Previously  treated CNS metastases are not considered measurable lesions for purposes of 
RECIST 1.1 determined response.

5.4.4.2 Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of
15mm by CT scan. Only the short axis o f thesenodes will contribute to the baseline sum.
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non -pathol ogical and should not be recorded 
or fo llowed.
5.4.4.3 Non-target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesio ns should be fo llowed as “present ”, “absent ”, or in rare cases “unequivocal  progressi on”. 
In addit ion, it is possible to record mult iple non -target lesio ns invo lving the same organ as a single 
item on the case report form (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes ”or “multiple liver 
metastases ”).  
5.4.5 Tumor E valuation
Evaluat ion of Target Lesions
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Parti al Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum o f diameters of target lesio ns, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study ). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate anabsolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).
Stable Disease (SD) :Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
5.4.5.1 Target L esions that Become “Too Small to Measure”
All lesio ns (nodal  and non-nodal ) recorded at baselin e shoul d have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radio logist is able 
to provi de an actual  measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
5.4.5.2 Target Lesions that Split or Co alesce on Treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be
added together to calculate the target lesio n sum.
As lesio ns coalesce, a plane between them maybe maintained that would aid in obtaining maxi mal 
diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesio ns have truly coalesced such that the y

are no l onger separable, the vector of the longest diameter in thi s instance should be the maximal 
longest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
5.4.5.3 Evaluati on of Non -target Lesions
While so me non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
shoul d be assessed only qualitat ively at the time points specified in the protocol.
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesio n(s) above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression of exist ing non-target l esions (Note: the appearance of one or m ore 
new lesio ns is also considered progression).
5.4.5.4 Unequivocal Progression in Non -target Disease
To achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substant ial worsening in non-target disea se such that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall  tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discontinuati on 
of therapy .
A mo dest ‘increase’ in the size o f one or more non -target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status.
5.4.5.5 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesio ns denotes disease progressi on. The finding of a new lesion 
shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new”
bone lesio ns may be simply healing or flare of preexist ing lesio ns. This is particularly  important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis o f a 
liver l esion may be reported on a CT scan reported as a “new”cysticlesio n, which it is not.
A lesio n ident ified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will ind icate di sease progressi on. An example of this is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered whic h 
reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she di d not have brain imaging at baseline.
5.4.6 Response Criteria (RECIST 1.1)
For subjects who have measurable disease at baseline, Table 5.4.6 -1provides a summary  of the 
overall response status calculation at each time po int.

5.4.6.1 Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time po int, the subject is not evaluable 
(NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesio n measurements are made at an assessment, the 
case is also consi dered NE at that time point, unl ess a convincing argum ent can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) woul d not have changed the assigned time- point 
response.
5.4.6.2 Confirmation of Scan 
Verificat ion of Response: As per RECIST 1.1, confirmat ion of response is required for trials wit h 
response as a primary  endpoint but is no longer requi red in rando mized studi es since the control 
arm serves as appropriate means of inter pretati on of data. Hence, confirmat ion is NOT required.27
Verificat ion of Progressi on: Progressi on of  disease shoul d be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered not to have 
progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.
5.4.6.3 Best Overall Response
The BOR is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is defined as the best response 
design ation, as determined by the invest igator, recorded between the date ofrandomization and 
the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy , 
whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression orsubsequent therapy , all 
available response designat ions will contribute to the BOR assessment. The subject’s best overall 
response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also 
take into consideration the appear ance of new lesio ns.

5.4.6.4 Duration of Objective Response
The durati on of objective response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
docum ented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on 
study ). 
5.5 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments
Samples for PK and immunogenicit y assessments will be collected for all subjects receiving 
nivolumab and ipilimumab as described in Table 5.5.1 -1. All t imepo ints are relat ive to the start of 
study drug administrati on. All on-treatm ent timepoints are intended to align with days on which 
study  drug is administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predose 
sampl e shoul d be co llected just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample is collected 
but the dose is subsequent ly delayed, an addit ional predose sample should not be collected. Further 
details of sample collect ion, processing, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory 
procedures manual.
Blood sam ples shoul dbe drawn from a site other than the infusio n site (ie, contralateral arm) on 
days of infusio n. All samples collected pre-dose should betaken just prior to th e administratio n 
from the contralateral arm (ie, the arm not used for the infusio n). If the infusio n was interrupted,
the interruption details will also be documented on the CRF. Blood samples will be processed to 
collect serum  and stored preferably at-70°C (sampl es may be stored at-20°C up to 2 months). 
Further details of pharmacokinet ic sample co llection and processing will be provided to the site in 
the lab manual.
Blood samples for immunogenicit y analyses of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab will be collected 
according to the schedule given in Table 5.5.1 -1. Samples collected from subjects will be evaluated 
for the development of Ant i-Drug Ant ibody  (ADA) for nivo lumab and/or ipilimumab by validated 
immunoassays. Samples may also be analyzed for neutralizing ADA response to nivo lumab and/or 
ipilimumab. Neutralizing ADA testing condit ional upon assay  availabili ty.
5.5.1 Pharmacokinetic and Immun ogenicity Sample Analyses
The serum samples will be analyzed for drug (nivo lumab and ipilimumab) and ADA (anti-
nivolumab and ant i-ipilimumab ant ibodies) by validated immunoassays. Samples wit h a posi tive 
ADA response may also be analyzed for neutralizing ADA response to nivolumab and/or 
ipilimumab. 
In addition, selected serum samples may be analyzed by an exploratory  method that measures 
nivolumab and ipilimumab, or detect anti-drug antibodies for techno logy explorat ion purposes; 
exploratory  results will not be reported. The corresponding serum  samples designated for either 
PK, immunogenicit y or biomarker assessments may also be used for any of those analyses, if 
requi red (eg, insufficient sample volume to complete testing or to follow up on suspected 
immu nogenicit y related AE).

5.6.1 Tumor Tissue Specimen 
Pre-treatm ent tum or tissue specimens in the form of a paraffin embedded bl ock or a minimum of
10 unstained slides will be submitted for central PD -L1 immunohistochemistry  (IHC) assessment
prior to randomizat ion. These biopsy samples shoul d be excisio nal, incisio nal, punch or core
needle. Fine needle aspirates or other cytology specimens are insufficient for downstream
biomarker analyses. PD -L1 stained tissue sect ions will be assessed by a patho logist and scored as
PD-L1 expressio n 5% or PD -L1 expressio n <5% based on the frequency o f tumor cell  surface 
PD-L1 staining among a minimum of ahundred (100) evaluable tumor cells. Where membrane 
staining is obscured by high cy toplasmic staining or melanin c ontent, but the tumor tissue sample 
contain the minimum number of evaluable tumor cells, samples will be deem ed PD-L1 
indeterminate.
Tumor sam ples will be stained for PD -L1 by  ICH and the stained tissue sect ions will  be assessed 
by a pathologist for tumor and immune cell membrane expressio n of PD -L1. These tumor samples 
may also be assessed for the expression o f other immune or melano ma related genes, RNAs and/or 
proteins, as well as, the presence of immune cell populat ions using a variet y of methodol ogies 
inclusive of, but not limited to IHC, qRT-PCR, genet ic mutation detection ,fluorescent in-situ 
hybridizat ion (FISH) and exo me sequencing. Various m olecular markers with potential predict ive 
value for the treatment of melanoma with nivolumab, ipilimumab and other immunotherapies are 
currently under investigation and may be assessed in this study . These tumor tissue biomarkers 
include, but are not limited to PD-1, PD-L2, tumor infiltrating lymphocy tes (TILs) or 
subpopulations of TILs and a Th1 immune mRNA exp ression signature. In addition, other methods 
of measuring tum or PD -L1 expressio n may also be assessed.
Tumor tissue samples may also be collected upon progression . This sample may be used for the 
assessment of markers implicated in resistance to immunotherapeutic agents, including but not 
limited to other T cell checkpo int receptors and ligands (eg, Lag-3, Tim-3) and intratumoral 
immune cell subsets, including but not limited to, T regulatory cells and myelo id derived 
suppressor cells. These sampl es may also be used to invest igate the effect of

schedule) for PBMC preparation , except at si tes where the stabili ty of the sam ples after shi pment 
to the Central  Labora tory cannot be guaranteed. Samples must be shipped within 48 hours to a 
BMS -designated central laboratory  for processing.
These PBMC samples may be used for immunophenoty ping or characterizat ion of the immune 
cell subsets in the periphery, including, but not limited to, T cells, B cells, NK cells, or 
subpopulations of the aforement ioned immune cell types. These samples may also be used to 
assess immune cell funct ion or antigen specific T cell proliferat ion or activat ion pending emerging 
inform ation from other nivo lumab or i pilimumab studies. 
5.6.4 Whole Blood for SNP Assessment
Who le blood samples for exploratory  pharm acogenet ic assessment will be collected from all
subjects and put in frozen storage. Genomic DNA will be extracted and subsequent ly assessed for 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genet ic var iations in genes that may predispose 
subjects to nivolumab or ipilimumab benefit or adverse events (unless restri cted by local 
requi rements.) Such genes include, but are not limited to PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 andCTLA -4. 
Addit ional use of these data may include correlative analyses aimed at ident ifying genoty pic 
associ ations with clinically -relevant biomarkers ident ified by other methodol ogiesdescribed in

Myel oid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an immune cell populat ion capable of suppressing 
T cell activation and proliferat ion. Low pre-treatment MDSC levels in peripheral blood may be 
associ ated with better overall survival in melano ma patients treated with the immunotherapeutic 
agent ipilimumab.28MDSCs will be measured at baseline and on-treatm ent to assess 
pharmacodynamic changes or associ ations with outcome (see Secti on5.6.3 for addit ional details

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
HRQoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30. The EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most 
commo nly used QoL instrument in advanced melano ma c linical studies. It is a 30 -item instrument  
that has gained wide acceptance in onco logy clinical  studies. The EORTC QLQ -C30 comprises 
6functional scales (physical functioning, cogni tive funct ioning, emotional functioning, social 
funct ioning and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom  scales (fatigue, pain, 
nausea/vo miting, dyspnea, insomnia, appeti te loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial 
difficult ies). Except for the overall  health status and gl obal quali ty of life items, responses for all 
items are 4-point categori cal scales ranging fro m 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very  much). The overall healt h 
status/qualit y of life responses are 7- point Likert scales.
General health status will be measured using the EQ -5D. The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument 
for use as a m easure of self -reported heal th status. The EQ -5D comprises 5 dimensio ns (mobilit y, 
self-care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort and anxiet y) and a visual analog rating scale (VAS). 
The utilit y data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and commo nly used in cost 
effect iveness analysis.
The EQ -5D will be administered along wit h the EORTC QLQ -C30 during on -study  phases (Part s
1and 2) as outlined in Sect ion5.1, to all subjects. 
Healthcare resource utilizat ion data (eg, hospitalizations, non-protocol  specified medical visits, 
diagnosti cs, etc) will be collected for all randomized subjects. The resource utilizat ion capture is 
specific to hospital admissi on utilizat ion data and non-protocol  specified visits related to study 
therapy . Resource utilization questi ons will be collected on-study  phases (Part s 1and 2) as outlined 
in Section 5.1, to all subjects.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject ad ministered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnorm allaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence t o suggest a causal relat ionship.

Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorit ies and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.7for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events mustbe handled as SAEs.(See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is consider ed related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SA E (see Secti on 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
NOTE :

a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures .All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within
100 day s of discont inuat ion of dosing . For subjects randomized and never treated with study  drug, 
SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of rando mizat ion.If applicable, SAEs must be 
collected that relate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether relat ed or not rel ated to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Con tactInformat ion list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi red method f or reporti ng.  In the event the el ectroni c system  is unavailable for transmissio n,

paper forms must be used and submitted immediately.  When paper forms are used, the original 
paper form s are to rem ain on si te.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy reporting) :Refer to Contact
Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are requi red. (Not e: Follow -up 
SAE reports mustinclude the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resol ution or stabilization.
A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse React ion) is a subset of SAEs and will be 
reported to the appropriate regulatory  authori ties and invest igators following local and global 
guidelines and requirements. 
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collect ion of nonseriousAE informat ion should begin at init iation of study drug until 100 days 
from the last dose of study drug. Nonserious AEinform ation shoul d also be collected from the 
start of a placebo lead-in per iod or other observat ional peri od intended to establish a baseline status 
for the subjects.
Every  adverse event must be assessed by the investigator with regard to whether it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events which are potenti allyimmune -mediated, additional informat ion will 
becollected on subject’s case report form.
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or d iscont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
6.3 Immune -mediated Adverse Events
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
whic h were exacerbated by the induct ion of autoimmunit y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the subject’s case report form.

The following laboratory  test resul t abnormalit ies shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electroni c) as appropri ate. Paper form s are only  intended as a back -up 
option when the electronic system  is not functioning .
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory test resul tabnormalit y that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
Any laboratory test resul tabnormalit y that requi red the subject to receive specifi c corrective 
therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term  woul d be used by the 
reporting invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  drug, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study expos ure, including during at least 5 half 
lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of thi s event and co mplete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporti ng 
procedures described in Sect ion 6.1.1 .
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event. In most cases, the blinded study  drug(s) will be perm anent ly 
discontinued. If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuat ion of blinded study drug(s), a discussio n between the investigator and the BMS Medica l 
Moni tor/desi gnee m ust occur. Under no circumstances will dosing during pregnancy be allowed.
The invest igator must immediately notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Moni tor of  this event 
and com plete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  to BMS (or desi gnee) wi thin 24 hours 
of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in 
Secti on6.1.1 . 
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS . Information on this pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.6 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered of both excessive and specifically  important.
All occurrences of overdose must be reported as SAEs (see Section6.1.1 for reporting details).

6.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potenti al DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ngdetails).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, wit hout init ial findings o f cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),

3.Noother immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.8 Other Safety C onsiderations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming ,any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
Approximately  346 subjects will be rando mized to the 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 rati o in order to 
target 340 treated subjects (170 per arm ). Given a two -sided alpha of 0.05, this number of treated 
subjects provides 80% power to show a statistically significant difference in the rate of 
drug-related Grade 3 -5 AEs between the two treatm ent arms, assuming a rate of 40% in Arm A 
and a rate of 55% in Arm B.
We assume that treatm ent with N3I1 (Arm  A) will resul t in a 15% reducti on in the rate of 
drug-related Grade 3 -5 events when compared to treatm ent with N1I3 (Arm  B). The difference 
of 15% is clinically  meaningful  and assumes a 40% event rate in Arm  A and a 55% event rate in 
Arm B. The assumpti on of  55% in Arm B is based on observed rates of drug -related Grade 3 - 5 
AEs in the combinat ion arm of studies CA209069 and CA209067, which enrolled the same patient  
popul ation as the current study  (previ ously untreated metastati c melano ma). The assumed 
reducti on to 40% in Arm A corresponds to the same rate ratio (0.727) that was observed in Cohort 
2a relative to Cohort 2 in S tudy CA209004.

Table 8.1 -1shows the precisi on that the sample size of 170 treated subjects per arm  will provide 
for estimat ing adverse event rates (primary  endpoint) or objective response rates (secondary 
endpo int), under different assumed observed rates. 
For example, if exactly 68 of 170 treated subjects (40%) experience a drug- related Grade 3 -5 AE 
in Arm A and 94 of 170 treated subjects (55.3%) experience a drug -related Grade 3 -5 AE in Ar m 
B, then the exact 95% CI for the rate of drug -related Grade 3 -5 AEs will be (32.6%, 47.8%) for 
Arm A and (47.5%, 62.9%) for Arm B. 
Furtherm ore, if exact ly 102 of 170 treated subjects (60%) experience an object ive response in a 
treatm ent arm , then the exact 95% CI f or the ORR in that treatm ent arm  will be (52.2%, 67.4%). 
If the observed ORR is exact ly the same in each arm and equal to 60%, then the 95% CI for the 
difference in ORR between arm s will  be (-10.4%, 10.4%), and the 95% CI for the odds rati o will 
be (0.65, 1.54).

8.2 Populations for Analyses
Since the primary object ive will be addressed by  a saf ety endpo int, the primary  endpoint analysis 
will be based on all treated subjects. For consistency, the secondary  endpoints will use the same 
analysis population as the primary endpoint (i e, all treated subjects ).
All En rolled Subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered 
into the I RT.
All Randomized Subjects: All subjects who were randomized to any  treatm ent group. Thi s is 
the primary  dataset f or efficacy list ings
All Treated Subjects: Al l subjects who received at least one dose of any study medicat ion.This 
is the primary dataset for analysis of study conduct, study popul ation, efficacy  (including 
secondary  endpoints), exposure, and safet y (including primary  endpoint ).
PK Subjects: All tr eated subjects with available serum time -concentrati on data.
Immunogenicit y Subjects: All treated subjects with available ADA data.

8.3 Endpoint s
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s )
The primary endpo intof the study  is the rate of drug-related Grade 3 - 5 AEs.The drug-related 
Grade 3 -5 AE rate is defined as number of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE of Grade 3 or 
higher, judged to be related to study  drug by the investigator, and with onset on or after the first 
dose of study  treatment and within 30 days of the last dose of study  treatm ent, divided by  number 
of treated subjects. AE grade will be defined using National  Cancer Institute Commo n
Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) ve rsion 4.0 cri teria.
The analysis of the primary  endpoint will occur when all subjects who are still on -treatm ent have 
had at least 2 post -baseline tumor assessments.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Descript ive analyses of secondary  endpo ints will be perform ed to evaluate the hypothesis of 
similar efficacy between the treatment arms.
The first secondary  endpo int is ORR as determined by invest igators. The ORR is defined as the 
number of subjects with a BOR of CR or PR divided by the number of treated subjects for each 
treatm ent group. The BOR is defined as the best response designat ion, as determined by the 
investigator, recorded between the date of randomizati on and the date of obj ectively docum ented 
progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent ant i-cancer ther apy, whichever occurs first. 
For subjects without docum ented progression or subsequent therapy , all available response 
designations will contribute to the BOR assessment. Tumor assessments are scheduled to be 
perform ed at Week 12following rando mizat ion, every 8weeks for the first 12 months and then 
every 12 weeks unt il disease progression.
The second secondary  endpo int is PFS. PFS is defined as the time between the date of 
rando mizat ion and the first date of documented progression, as determined by  the in vestigator, or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported progressio n 
will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or 
die will be censored on the date of their lastevaluable tumor assessment. Subjects who did not 
have any on study  tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on their date of 
rando mizat ion. Subjects who started anti -cancer therapy  without a pri or reported progressi on will 
be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy .
The thi rd secondary  endpoint is OS. OS is defined as the time between the date of rando mizat ion
and the date of death due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last 
known alive date. OS will be fo llowed continuously while subjects are on the study drug and every 
3 months via in -person or phone contact after subjects discont inue the study drug.
The fourth secondary  object ive (to evaluate HRQoL) will be measured by mean changes from 
baseline in the EORTC -QLQ -C30 gl obal healt h status/QoL composite scale and by mean changes 
from baseline in the remaining EORTC QLQ -C30 scales. HRQoL will be evaluated per Section

In addit ion, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors who 
must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study facilit ies. BMS 
audit reports will be kept confident ial.
The investigator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspect ions scheduled by regulatory authori ties, 
and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspect ion reports to BMS. 
9.1.2.1 Source Documentation
The Investi gator isresponsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, ori ginal  and attributable, whether the data are hand -written on paper or entered 
electroni cally. If source data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archiv ed, retri eved, 
or transmitted electroni cally via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such system s must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulati ons governing use of electroni c records and/or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/healt h records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol  required assessments, and/or drug accountabilit y 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activit ies, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy  consists of a copy of 
original  informat ion that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all o f the sam e attri butes and informat ion as the original. 
9.1.3 Investigational Site Training
Bristol-Myers Squibb will provi de quali ty invest igational staff training prior to study  initiation. 
Training topics will include but are not limited to : GCP, AE reporting, study details and procedure, 
electroni c CRFs, study documentati on, informed consent, and enrollment of WOCBP.

9.2 Records
9.2.1 Records Retention
The investigato r must retain all study  records and source documents for the maximum period 
requi red by applicable regul ations and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for the period 
specified by BMS , which ever is longer. The investigator must contact BMS prior to destroying 
any records associated with the study .
BMS will notify  the invest igator when the study  records are no longer needed.
If the investi gator withdraws from the study  (eg, relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agree d upon designee (eg, another invest igator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writ ing to BMS.
9.2.2 Study Drug R ecords 
It is the responsibili ty of the invest igator to ensure that a current disposit ion record of  study  drug 
(inventoried and dispensed) is maintained at thestudy site to include investigat ional product and 
the following non-investigation alproduct(s) . Records or logs must comply with applicable 
regul ations and guidelines and should include:
amount received and placed in storage area
amount currently  in storage area
label ident ificat ionnumber or batch number 
amount dispensed to and returned by  each subject, including uni que subject i dentifiers
amount transferred to another area /sitefor dispensing or storage
nonstudy  disposi tion (eg, lost, wasted) 
amount destroy ed at st udy site, if applicable
amount returned to BMS
retain samples for bioavailabilit y/bioequivalence, if applicable
dates and initials of person responsib le for Invest igational Product dispensing/accountabilit y, 
as per the Delegation o f Authori ty Form.
BMS will provi de forms to f acilitate inventory  control  ifthe invest igational site does not have an 
established system that meets these requirements.
9.2.3 Case Report Form s
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories desi gned 
to record all observat ions and other data pertinent to the invest igation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the invest igation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding o f product safet y. CRFs may  be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnorm alities 
that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study .

For si tes using the BMS electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data 
collect ion fields except for fields specific to SA Es and pregnancy, which will be reported on the 
electroni c SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively .  If electronic SAE form is 
not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances 
permitted by  study -specific CRF co mpletion gu idelines provided by BMS . 
The confidentialit y of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentialit y rules in accordance wi th the applicable regulatory  requi rement(s).
The invest igator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and init ials of all persons 
authori zed to m ake entri es and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The co mpleted CRF ,SAE/pregnancy CRFs ,must be pro mptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
investi gator or qualified physician who is a subinvesti gator and who is delegate d this task on the 
Delegati on of Authori ty Form. For electronic CRFs, review and approval /signature is completed 
electroni cally through the BMS electroni c data capture tool .Theinvest igator must retain a copy 
of the CRFs including records of the changes a nd corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet BMS training requirements and 
must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the unique user account provi ded by 
BMS . User accounts are not to be shared or reassi gned to other individuals.
9.3 Clinical Study Report and Publications

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Com plete Abst inence Com plete Abst inence is defined as co mplete avoidance of 
heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of 
contraception for all study  drugs. This also means that 
abstinence is the preferred and usual lifest yle of the patient. 
This does not mean periodi c abstinence (e.g., cal endar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, professio n of abst inence for entry 
into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and wit hdrawal, 
which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women
must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acce ptable alternate 
methods of highly  contracepti on’s must be discussed in the 
event that the subject chooses to forego complete abst inence.

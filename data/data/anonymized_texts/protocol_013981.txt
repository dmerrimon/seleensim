Protocol Title A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, 
Dose-Response Study of Meloxicam Co-Crystal in The Treatment of 
Post-Surgical Dental Pain.
Protocol 
NumberMECC-TBZ-2001
Study Sites The study is planned to be conducted at 1 study site.
Study Period 
PlannedThe study is planned to be conducted over a period of approximately 3 months.
Duration of 
Individual 
TreatmentThe duration from screening to follow up is expected to be approximately 
1.5 months.
Subjects will be dosed with study drug on Day One.
End of Study End of study is defined as last subject, last visit.
Background 
and RationaleThe effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society; 
inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and 
in a post-surgical environment, it affects the functional recovery, the risk of 
post-surgical complications, and the risk of persistent postsurgical pain.
Finding alternatives to opioids, can expand safe and effective options in pain 
management to meet this important public health need and help to reduce the 
public health burden from adverse outcomes related to prescribed opioids.
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
group of medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in 
clinical studies. NSAIDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acute 
pain, however current oral formulations of meloxicam are not suitable for the 
treatment of acute pain due to a relatively slow absorption. In contrast, an IV 
formulation of meloxicam has recently demonstrated efficacy in models of acute 
pain.
Meloxicam [Co-crystal of Meloxicam: Salicylic acid (1:1)] (hereafter 
MECC-SA) is being developed to provide a rapid absorption of meloxicam from 
an oral dose. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of MECC-SA in subjects with acute pain; 
however, it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to the rapid 
absorption demonstrated in Study The efficacy dose-response 
profile of MECC-SA is currently unknown and the purpose of this study is to 
establish an understanding of the dose-response relationship for this formulation.
The dental pain model is considered an ideal model of post-surgical acute pain 
as it has high assay sensitivity and is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage 
models. It is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative 

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 4 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialcare protocols can be standardized across patients. The dental surgical model has 
demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across a range of different 
pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opioids and, more specifically, has 
demonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam.

Methodology This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 
dose-response study, randomizing approximately 110 male or female subjects 
who have had dental surgery (removal of ≥2 third molars) performed. Subjects 
will receive study drug on Day 1.
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the 
IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in 
Clinical Trials) group for trials involving subjects with short-duration acute pain.
Subjects will attend screening at Visit 1, to occur within 30 days prior to the 
planned dental surgery.
The subjects will have the operation performed on Day 1 using appropriate local 
anesthesia and sedation (performed using nitrous oxide and a local injection of 
lidocaine with epinephrine). Subjects will also receive prophylactic antibiotics 
post-surgically.
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) where 0 
is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable) will be assessed during the 
5 hours following surgery. If the subject scores a NPRS ≥5 and a rating of 
moderate or severe pain on a 4-point categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, 
mild, moderate, severe) during this time they will be eligible for randomization. 
A diary will be used to record the pain scores.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either MECC-SA (10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID or 15 mg BID) or placebo. 
Dosing of study medication must be within 15 minutes of the eligible pain score.
PI scores (NPRS) will be measured at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication, as 
well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at the time of early 
termination.
Pain relief assessment (using a 5-point scale - none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, 
good or a lot = 3, and complete = 4) will be measured at 15, 30, and 45 minutes 
and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 hours afte r the first dose of 
study medication, as well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at 
the time of early termination.
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be made at 24 hours 
post dose, rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 
2 good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent and/or at the time of early termination. 
The times to first perceptible relief and meaningful pain relief will be determined 
using the double-stopwatch technique. The time to onset of first perceptible 
relief (time that the first watch is stopped) is defined as the post dose time at 
which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. The time to meaningful pain 
relief (time that the second watch is stopped) is defined as the post dose time at 
which the subject begins to feel meaningful pain relief. 
Rescue medication of immediate release hydrocodone/acetaminophen will be 
allowed at any time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least 1 hour 
post-dose if possible. A PI score assessment will be made immediately prior to 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 6 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialany rescue medication.
PK samples will be taken pre-dose and 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 hours after the first dose at Day 1.
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic following the 24-hour assessments; if 
the subject requires a longer duration of in-patient assessment due to reasons 
associated with the surgery this is acceptable.
A final follow up telephone call will occur approximately 5 days after the last 
dose of study drug administration.
Safety will be assessed via recording of AEs, safety laboratory testing and pre- 
and post-dose 12-lead ECGs and vital signs.
Adverse events of special interest will include those related to gastrointestinal 
(GI) AEs, particularly bleeds and those related to serious cardiovascular (CV) 
events.
Unless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug 
will have discharge procedures performed at that time or at an early termination 
(ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.
Study 
TreatmentTreatments to be received during the study will include one of the following 
treatment arms:
1. MECC-SA 15 mg QD.
2. MECC-SA 10 mg QD.
3. MECC-SA 15 mg BID.
4. MECC-SA 10 mg BID.
5. Placebo BID.
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, 
subjects will receive in a double dummy design, two tablets when dosed (one 
that is representative of a 10 mg tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg 
tablet). Due to the double dummy design, neither the subject, nor the 
Investigator will know what treatment a subject receives. To maintain the blind 
between QD and BID arms, subjects assigned to QD arms will receive placebo at 
the second dose. Per the clinic procedures, subjects will also be blindfolded 
during dosing.

Planned 
Number of 
SubjectsN=110 subjects (N=22/treatment arm) to give approximately N=100 evaluable 
subjects for the primary endpoint (N=20/treatment arm).
Statistical 
MethodsThe primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference 
over 0-24 hours (SPID 0-24).

To analyze the primary endpoint, a 3-parameter E max model will be fitted to the 
SPID 0-24 standardized means (observed mean for each dose and placebo 
divided by the pooled standard deviation) for placebo and 10 mg QD, 15 mg 
QD, 10 mg BID and 15 mg BID MECC-SA.  Standardized effect sizes will be 
estimated from the E max model together with their 95% confidence intervals and 
p-values. Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max 
model. The numerical dose values will be 10, 15, 20, 30 and 0 for 10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID, 15 mg BID and placebo respectively.
Additional models may be explored utilizing a Multiple Comparison Procedure – 
Modeling (MCP-Mod) approach.
If the E max model fails to converge, and no other suitable models are identified 
using MCP-Mod, an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess 
the difference between treatment groups for SPID 0-24. The ANCOVA model 
will include treatment and study site as fixed effects and baseline PI score as a 
covariate. The difference between MECC-SA and placebo will be estimated 
from the least squares means (LS means) along with the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the standardized effect sizes 
for each dose will be calculated by dividing the differences in LS means for each 
dose and placebo by the pooled standard deviation.
PK parameters for meloxicam and salicylic acid (C max, pAUC 0-4, pAUC 0-24) will 
also be calculated.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Indication
Acute, post-operative pain.
1.2 Background and Rationale
The effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society; 
inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and in a 
post-surgical environment, it affects the functional recovery, the risk of post-surgical 
complications, and the risk of persistent post-surgical pain [1].
Opioids have been used to treat many forms of pain in the USA, sometimes unnecessarily or 
inappropriately, leading to extensive misuse of these powerful medications and culminating 
in the current health crisis. It is estimated that 115 Americans die every day from opioid 
induced overdoses and that in 2015 alone, the cost to the US economy of the opioid epidemic 
was $504 billion [ 2], with a drug overdose rate in 2015 of 16.3 per 100,000 [3], increasing to 
21.7 per 100,000 in 2017 [4]. Clearly the misuse of opioids has a huge impact both on 
individual patients and their families but also on the wider society. The Centers for Disease 
Control have also determined through a meta-analysis that opioid therapy prescribed to treat 
acute pain is associated with a greater likelihood of long-term opioid use [5]. Therefore, 
reducing opioid use or replacing opioids with alternative drugs would be advisable. Advice 
from groups such as Washington State Agency Medical Directors’ Group is that post-surgical 
use of opioids should be avoided where possible with alternative drugs offered as analgesia or 
minimized [6].
Alternatives to opioids can expand safe and effective options in pain management to meet 
this important public health need and help to reduce the public health burden from adverse 
outcomes related to prescribed opioids. 
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group of 
medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activity in clinical 
studies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment 
of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis [7] and acute 
pain [8]; [9]. NSAIDs are currently recommended by the American College of Rheumatology 
for the treatment of osteoarthritis [10] and have indications for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA); however, most recent treatment guidelines for RA have focused on disease 
modification rather than analgesia [11]; [12]. NSAIDs are considered generally safe for 
short-term use with the following exceptions: patients with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory 
disease, patients with prior myocardial infarction who are receiving antithrombotic therapy, 
patients with asthma, and patients with a history of renal disease [13].
The apparent primary mechanism of action of meloxicam, and of other NSAIDs, is the 
reduction of prostaglandin (PG) production through its inhibitory activity against 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 24 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialcyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) [14]. Meloxicam is currently approved in oral 
formulations in USA as a treatment for chronic diseases: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pauciarticular and polyarticular course (at the 7.5 mg dose 
only in children that weigh ≥60 kg). An IV formulation of meloxicam is currently approved 
in USA for the management of moderate-severe pain. 
Meloxicam is available in tablet form; (MOBIC® [Boehringer Ingelheim] and various generic 
forms and QMIIZ® orally disintegrating tablets [Tersera Therapeutics]) and in capsule form 
(VIVLODEX® [Iroko Pharmaceuticals]). MOBIC is approved at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg once 
per day and VIVLODEX is approved at doses of 5 and 10 mg once per day. Meloxicam has 
been extensively studied in humans as MOBIC and VIVLODEX in chronic pain indications, 
including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam has also recently been approved 
by US FDA in an intravenous formulation as ANJESO® (Baudax Bio, Inc) at a dose of 30 mg 
for the management of moderate-severe pain.
Based on the demonstration that meloxicam is effective for the treatment of chronic pain such 
as osteoarthritis at doses of ≥7.5 mg/day and that this effect is mediated by inhibition of 
cyclooxygenase, a concentration of approximately 1090 ng/mL, which is similar to the steady 
state concentration of 7.5 mg meloxicam, would be considered sufficient for mediating an 
analgesic response [15]. Ex vivo assays performed on samples taken from subjects receiving 
7.5 mg meloxicam have demonstrated an 83% inhibition of COX-2 [15].
Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups 
across MOBIC trials, reflective of the safety profile of meloxicam. The most commonly 
reported AEs in both short-term and long-term studies of MOBIC in osteoarthritis are 
summarized in Table 3.

Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of 
serious GI events,  
 
MECC-SA contains salicylic acid as a co-former, this is at a low dose (up to 11.6 mg for BID 
dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg) which is anticipated to have negligible physiological effects. 
However, it is acknowledged that salicylic acid (and acetylsalicylic acid) at higher doses can 
cause adverse effects, such as local gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration of the GI tract, 
particularly when administered with other NSAIDs. As the potential for local GI toxicity for 
salicylic acid is not known all GI symptoms should be assessed and documented.
As discussed in the most recent specific Cochrane Review of meloxicam [16] and the general 
review of NSAIDs for the treatment of acute pain [8], current oral formulations of meloxicam 
(e.g., MOBIC and VIVLODEX) are not indicated for, nor are they suitable for, the treatment 
of acute pain due to the delayed absorption of the product. 
Meloxicam however, has demonstrated efficacy in a number of clinical studies using 
intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) formulations, including short-term studies in dental 
extraction [17]; [18] and post-bunionectomy surgery [19]; [20]. Furthermore, some data are 
suggestive that IM meloxicam has a more rapid onset than oral meloxicam in rheumatoid 
arthritis pain [ 21] and sciatica [22].

1.3 Investigational Product
MECC-SA is being developed to provide a rapid absorption of meloxicam from an oral dose. 
The meloxicam component of the co-crystal formulation is considered to be the primary 
active component of the product.
Salicylic acid is used as the co-former in the MECC-SA tablets. Considering that meloxicam 
is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for meloxicam absorption is solubility. 
The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by increasing its solubility and dissolution. The dose of salicylic acid (5.8 mg and 
11.6 mg considering QD and BID dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg, respectively) used in 
MECC-SA formulation is considered as a subtherapeutic dose (approved oral clinical doses 
of acetylsalicylic acid are in the range of 50- 325 mg/day) with negligible physiological 
effects. Whilst the side effect profile of acetylsalicylic acid is well known, including local 
effects on the GI tract, it is acknowledged that the local side effects of its metabolite (via 
hydrolysis in the GI tract, liver and plasma) salicylic acid when given orally are unknown, 
although a fraction of acetylsalicylic acid is metabolized to salicylic acid in the GI tract prior 
to absorption. Considering the low dose of salicylic acid in the formulation, MECC-SA is not 
considered a new fixed combination drug.
Based upon the available data, it can be considered that salicylic acid that is incorporated into 
MECC-SA is (1) at sub-therapeutic levels with negligible physiological effects and (2) 
enhances the effectiveness of meloxicam by increasing its solubility and dissolution thereby 
increasing its rate of absorption. Therefore, the product would not be considered a new 
fixed-combination drug.
The efficacy dose response profile of MECC-SA is currently unknown, and the purpose of 
this study is to establish an understanding of the dose response relationship for this 
formulation.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 30 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential1.4 Ethics and Benefit-Risk Considerations
As discussed in Section 1.2, meloxicam has been extensively studied and subsequently 
prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis but oral forms of meloxicam have not been used to treat acute pain due to slow 
absorption of the drug. A rapidly absorbing form of meloxicam should demonstrate efficacy 
in the treatment of acute pain and if the drug has a similar overall exposure (and lower than 
that of IV meloxicam) to that of other oral meloxicam products the safety profile should be 
similar. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of MECC-SA in subjects with acute pain, however it is 
anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to the rapid absorption demonstrated in 
study  It is estimated that a 15 mg dose of MECC-SA would exceed 
1090 ng/mL within 30-45 minutes of dosing, therefore acute analgesia could be anticipated at 
or around this time. Assuming linearity of exposure for meloxicam, a 10 mg dose of 
MECC-SA would exceed 1090 ng/mL at around 1.25 hours. It can therefore be anticipated 
that a 10 mg dose would achieve acute analgesia, however it may not be as efficacious as 
15 mg. 
As some studies of ANJESO [19]; [20] might indicate some loss of efficacy prior to 24 hours 
whereby the confidence intervals for the IV meloxicam and placebo overlap at later 
timepoints, the inclusion of BID doses of MECC-SA will assess whether BID dosing 
provides a better duration of action than QD dosing.  
 
 
 
The administration of MECC-SA 15 mg BID should therefore be 
well tolerated.
As MECC-SA will be administered under controlled conditions in a clinic-based study, the 
risks and benefits to individual subjects can be carefully assessed; rescue medication will be 
available to subjects (whether taking active or placebo) if the pain associated with the 
surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
The use of placebo in the study is appropriate to ensure that any change from baseline in pain 
assessments related to the study drug can be adjusted for the ‘placebo-response’ that is 
common in pain studies. All subjects will be allowed to use rescue medication if the pain 
associated with the surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
Complete information for MECC-SA may be found in the Single Reference Safety 
Document, which for this study is the MECC-SA Investigator’s Brochure.

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Overall Design
This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging 
study, randomizing approximately 110 male or female subjects that have had third molar 
dental surgery. Subjects will receive a dose of study drug on Day 1 after surgery and a further 
dose approximately 12 hours later.
3.2 Rationale for Study Design
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the IMMPACT 
(Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) group for trials 
involving subjects with short-duration acute pain [23].
The dental surgical pain model has been in widespread use for over 50 years, is well 
characterized, and is frequently used to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
analgesic molecules (onset/offset, dose response, and potency). Efficacy in the dental model 
is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage models and has a high assay sensitivity [24]. The 
model is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative care protocols 
can be standardized across patients. 
The dental surgical pain model has demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across 
a range of different pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opioids [24] and specifically has 
demonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam [18] recently approved as 
ANJESO.
This study will specifically identify if MECC-SA has efficacy in a model of acute 
post-operative pain and will enable the identification of the most appropriate dose and regime 
of MECC-SA to continue in development.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential4.2.3 Criteria for Study Drug Termination, Withdrawal From the Study and Study 
Termination
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by the investigator or at the study center.
Every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study. When available, a reason for not 
completing the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).
If, a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, due to any reason as provided in the 
below withdrawal criteria, the site should request the subjects’ consent for being followed-up 
during further study visits to perform safety and efficacy assessments as per Table 1. 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study prior to randomization under the following 
circumstances:
The subject withdraws consent.
The subject has a positive pregnancy test at Visit 2 (Day 1) or at any preceding point 
prior to this following Screening (Visit 1).
Despite education/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compliance 
with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to dosing with 
study drug.
If it is in the subject’s best interest based on decision of the Principal Investigator or 
Sub-Investigator e.g., due to occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to 
present a safety concern prior to dosing with study drug. Specifically, the following 
would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event prior to Visit 2 
(Day 1). 
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12 lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >500 msec.
A subject may be required to terminate study drug for reasons including the following:
The subject withdraws consent.
For female subjects, diagnosis of pregnancy or stated intention to become pregnant. 
All efforts should be made by the site to obtain consent from the pregnant women, so 
that they are followed until delivery or termination.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 37 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialDespite education/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compliance 
with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to continued 
dosing with study drug.
The subject requires more than 6 tablets/day (equivalent to 30 mg hydrocodone and 
1950 mg acetaminophen) rescue medication.
At the investigator’s discretion (it is recommended that the investigator discusses with 
medical monitor prior to decision), if it is in the subject’s best interest due to 
occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to present a safety concern to 
continued dosing with study drug and warrants treatment withdrawal. Specifically, the 
following would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event.
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12-lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >500 msec.
If the blind is broken for a subject by the Investigator.
The Principal Investigator and/or Mylan reserves the right to terminate the study for any 
reason.
The study will be terminated early if there are significant subject safety concerns that are 
indicative of a change to the risk: benefit profile for the overall study population. In this case 
the IRB will be informed accordingly.
Subjects who prematurely terminate the study will have discharge procedures performed 
prior to leaving the clinic or an Early Termination (ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible. 
4.3 Replacement Policy
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.
4.4 Lifestyle Guidelines
Subjects are to observe the following restrictions during the study.
4.4.1 Meals and Dietary Restrictions
In order to avoid interference with sedation and operative procedures subjects should fast 
from midnight prior to the surgery.
Subjects will be allowed to eat food after 2 hours post-first dose.
Subjects should not consume any water or other drinks for 2 hours prior to the surgery.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 38 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialSubjects may consume water and other drinks ad libitum  following completion of the 
surgery.
Subjects will be given snacks and meals at appropriate times (after the fasting period) during 
confinement in the clinic.
4.4.2 Alcohol and Tobacco
At all study visits, subjects will be required to: 
Abstain from alcohol for at least 24 hours prior to admission for the surgery at Visit 2 
(Day 1) and continue abstaining from alcohol until after discharge on Visit 2 (Day 2). 
Abstain from smoking or vaping (or other tobacco based products) following 
admission for the surgery at Visit 2 (Day 1) and continue abstaining from smoking or 
vaping until after discharge on Visit 2 (Day 2).
4.5 Contraception
4.5.1 Females - Non-Childbearing Potential
Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria:
1. Postmenopausal females, defined as females, who have been amenorrheic for at least 
2 years and confirmed via serum FSH.
2. Females who have a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.
All other females will be considered to be of childbearing potential.
4.5.2 Females - Childbearing Potential
Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an acceptable, highly effective method of 
contraception starting 28 days prior to dosing and continuing at least 28 days following the 
last treatment, such methods include at least one of the following:
Abstinence (periodic abstinence is not acceptable)
Tubal ligation
Intrauterine device or intrauterine system
Barrier method, like condom, with spermicide
Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 6 months. Male partners with 
vasectomies of <6 months are NOT considered protected
Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected, transdermal, or implanted) with the 
exception of low dose gestagens, i.e., only containing lynestrenol or norethisterone, 
since they do not inhibit ovulation and are therefore not considered as highly 
effective. The subject must remain on the hormonal contraceptive throughout the 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 39 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialstudy and must have been on a stable regimen of hormonal contraceptives for an 
adequate period prior to the study to ensure effectiveness (e.g., 3 months)
4.6 Pregnancy Testing
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all female subjects at Screening. Urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at subsequent 
visits as described in the schedule of activities (results will be reviewed and must be negative 
prior to dosing). In the event of a positive test, the subject will be withdrawn from the study 
(or will not enter the study if during screening).
Any pregnancy occurring after randomization to study drug will be followed up and reported 
to the sponsor as per Section 10.5.
5 STUDY DRUG
5.1 Investigational Drug
MECC-SA will be provided as 10 and 15 mg tablets.
15 mg tablets (and matching placebo)  
10 mg tablets (and matching placebo)  
Placebo is a tablet identical to the corresponding dose of active study drug.
To maintain the blind, subjects will take in a double dummy design, two tablets (one that is 
representative of a 10 mg tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg tablet) of study drug 
or placebo will be administered on one day, Visit 2 (Day 1). Due to the double dummy 
design, neither the subject, nor the Investigator will know what treatment a subject receives. 
To maintain the blind, regarding QD and BID dosing, subjects assigned to QD treatment arms 
will receive placebo at the second dose. Additionally, per the clinic procedures, subjects will 
be blindfolded during dosing.
Study drugs will be administered following randomization and approximately 12 hours 
following the first dose.
5.1.1 Administration of Study Drugs
Study drug (two tablets containing MECC-SA or matching placebo) will be administered in a 
double dummy design at the clinic at each dosing time.
Subjects should take the study drugs with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in 
each period under the supervision of trained study personnel. 
This activity will be followed by mouth and hand check of the subjects to assess compliance 
to dosing.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 40 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialStudy drugs must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed or divided.
In the event of any significant dosing errors, the Medical Monitor, or Mylan study contact 
should be contacted immediately.
5.2 Drug Inventory
Mylan will supply: 
MECC-SA and matching placebo.
The Investigator site will supply:
Medication required for sedation and anesthesia during the surgery.
Rescue medication for pain relief following randomization, 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/325 mg).
All materials associated with the surgical procedure.
5.3 Study Medication Complaints
In the event the subject has a complaint/concern during study participation regarding the 
study supplied study medication, they should contact the site.
In the event of a complaint/concern regarding any study medication provided by Mylan for 
this study, as a minimum the following information should be sent by the site via e-mail to 
Study number
Principal Investigator name
Subject ID
Date of occurrence of incident/complaint
Description of incident/complaint (facts)
Confirmation if the complaint caused or resulted in a SAE? If “Yes”, confirmation 
that the SAE has been reported
Additional information and potentially the return of study medication may be requested by 
Mylan in order to investigate the complaint.
5.4 Storage, Disposition of Unused Study Drug and Drug Accountability
The Investigator, or an approved representative, e.g., pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the investigator site.
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by the label storage.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 41 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialTemperature of storage facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using 
validated devices that record maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage 
facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this 
must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee. At sites where daily monitoring and 
recording is not possible at weekends, then on the next working day after the weekend the 
temperature record (e.g., max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any 
temperature excursions. Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly 
calibrated. Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion 
has been assessed and confirmed by Mylan. 
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. If Mylan supply drug accountability forms these must be used. 
Alternatively, Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms 
must identify the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition 
on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be 
signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Mylan or 
designee.
At the end of the study, Mylan will provide instructions as to disposition of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Mylan. Destruction 
must be adequately documented.
5.5 Randomization 
Assignment of Subject Identification (SID) number, randomization number and study 
medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by an automated 
Interactive Voice/Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS). A manual containing complete 
instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be provided to each site prior to 
study start. At their first clinic visit, the IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID. Each SID will be 
unique and serve as the primary subject identifier throughout all phases of the study. The SID 
must appear on all CRF pages, source documents, laboratory data, ECG and diary data. 
Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional 
“randomization number” by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization. Subjects will be allocated to 
treatment within blocks for the given allocation ratio.
At Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomized to receive MECC-SA (10 mg QD, 
15 mg QD, 10 mg BID or 15 mg BID) or matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio through the 
IVRS/IWRS.
5.6 Breaking the Blind
Emergency subject unblinding will be managed by an automated IVRS/IWRS. 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 42 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialA manual containing complete instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be 
provided to each site prior to study start.
Subject unblinding should be discouraged unless knowing the treatment received by the 
subject would change the way an AE is treated.
5.7 Rescue Medication For Relief of Pain
Any use of rescue medication while the subject is in the clinic will be recorded, including the 
dose and time of administration.
5.7.1 Pre-Dose
If a subject requires the use of rescue medication prior to administration of study drug, the 
subject will not be eligible for randomization.
5.7.2 Post-Dose
Rescue medication of immediate release hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/325 mg) will be 
allowed to treat breakthrough pain, subjects will be encouraged to refrain from rescue 
medication until at least 1-hour post-dose. A dose of rescue medication will be allowed as 
needed up to once every two hours. A maximum of 6 tablets (equivalent to 30 mg 
hydrocodone and 1950 mg acetaminophen) will be allowed; if a subject requires greater than 
this the subject should be withdrawn from the study.
Pain Intensity will be measured immediately before any rescue medication is administered.
5.8 Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to 
post-study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration in the CRF. All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.
Medications taken prior to dosing with study medication will be documented as a prior 
medication. Medications taken after dosing with study medication will be documented as 
concomitant medications.
Subjects will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
section of this protocol (Section 4.2.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by Mylan or designee 
regarding potential need to early terminate study drug (e.g., for safety reasons – see 
Section 4.2.3).
5.9 Recommended Procedure in a Subject Experiencing Adverse Effects Secondary to 
Excessive Pharmacological Effects of Study Drug
Symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, 
nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 43 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialGastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Severe poisoning may result in hypertension, acute renal 
failure, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory depression, coma, convulsions, cardiovascular 
collapse and cardiac arrest. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAID and may occur following an overdose.
Subjects should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID 
overdose or symptoms suggestive of excessive pharmacological effect. Accelerated removal 
of meloxicam by 4 g oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day has been 
demonstrated in a clinical trial [ 25].
5.10 Treatment Compliance
Subjects will be dosed in the clinic on Visit 2 (Day 1) of the study, a visual check of the 
subject’s mouth and hands will be made to ensure compliance of dosing.
6 STUDY CONDUCT
Subjects eligible for study recruitment will have the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by the investigator. They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate. Subjects agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening 
(if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by IVRS/IWRS 
system. 
Once a subject enrolls in this trial the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the trial. Clinical trial site staff are responsible for developing and 
implementing support and retention plans. Elements of this plan may include the following.
Thorough explanation of the complete clinical trial visit schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re-emphasis at each clinic visit.
A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the trial's 
successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the overall 
success of the trial.
Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic 
visit attendance and full study participation and compliance.
Collection of contact information at screening (address, phone numbers, email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits.
Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.
Immediate and multifaceted follow-up on missed clinic visits.
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 44 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialsubject so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. All contact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study 
with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of 
site plans to support and retain subjects within the trial, subjects may voluntarily withdraw 
from the trial for any reason and at any time.
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be approximately 1.5 months. 
For details and timings of assessments, refer to Section 7.
6.1 Screening Procedures
Each prospective subject must agree to participate in screening procedures by signing the 
most recent ICF before any screening procedure is initiated. The Principal Investigator or 
Medical Sub-Investigator will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm 
eligibility of each subject prior to enrollment.
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1)
Subjects will commence screening procedures within 30 days prior to the planned surgical 
procedure and subsequent randomization, to confirm that they meet the selection criteria for 
the study. If the time between screening procedures and potential randomization exceeds 
30 days as a result of unexpected delays, then the subject will need to be discussed with 
Mylan or designee to consider potential for re-screening (if re-screening is agreed, the subject 
will need to be re consented and assigned a new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re-screening for 
other reasons may be possible following discussion with the Mylan or designee. If 
re-screening occurs this will be clearly documented within the site file.
At Screening (Visit 1), the following will be completed; procedures can be performed in a 
different order, but informed consent must be obtained prior to any procedures and the 
12-lead ECG must be performed prior to vital signs or obtaining blood samples.
Written informed consent. 
IVRS/IWRS registration. 
Complete medical history, demographics. 
Complete history of all prescription or non-prescription drugs, dietary supplements 
taken within 28 days prior to consent. History of alcohol or illicit drug use.
Record 12-lead ECG – supine or semi-recumbent.
Record vital signs – supine or semi-recumbent blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate 
(PR).

Schedule Visit 2 (Day 1) and remind the subject of lifestyle and study drug and 
concomitant medication requirements for visits.
oSubjects should be reminded to fast from midnight prior to the surgery.
Subjects may be discharged from the clinic following completion of all assessments.
6.2 Treatment Phase
6.2.1 Visit 2 (Day 1)
The following procedures will be completed; procedures can be performed in a different 
order as long as they are performed at the correct nominal time and would not impact on 
other tests, e.g., 12-lead ECGs that are taken at the same nominal time as vital signs or blood 
samples are taken prior to those other procedures:
6.2.1.1 Pre-Dose Procedures

6.2.3 Early Termination (ET) visit
Subjects may request termination of study drug or withdrawal from the study at any time, or 
be required to withdraw or terminate study drug by the investigator or sponsor for reasons as 
per Section 4.2.3. If study drug is terminated or the subject withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/withdrawal should be established and recorded. If a subject does not 
return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document the outcome of subject contact 
attempt, if possible. The investigator will contact Mylan or designee in the event that a 
subject fails to complete the study or violates the protocol.
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 49 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialcollected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Unless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
conduct the procedures detailed below prior to leaving the clinic or return to the clinic for an 
ET visit and will have this scheduled as soon as possible after their last dose of study drug.
At the Early Termination (ET) visit (or discharge from the clinic) the following procedures 
will be completed:
General physical examination, including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological systems, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, head, ears, 
eyes, nose, and thyroid gland.
Record 12-lead ECG – supine or semi-recumbent.
Record vital signs – supine or semi-recumbent BP and PR.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialSubjects will be reminded that AEs should be reported to the study staff up to 30 days after 
the last dose of study medication.
7 TREATMENT PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases, the investigator or designated representative will take all 
steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol required 
test cannot be performed the investigator or designated representative will document the 
reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure 
that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The Mylan study team will be 
informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
Activities specific to this protocol are summarized in Table 1 and expanded upon further 
below.
7.1 Dental Surgery
The dental surgery and related anesthesia, sedation, and prophylactic antibiotics are not 
investigational and will occur regardless of research.
The dental surgery (extraction of ≥2 x third molars, at least 1 of which involves partial or 
complete mandibular bony impaction) will be performed on Visit 2 (Day 1).
The procedure will be performed using appropriate local anesthesia and sedation (performed 
using nitrous oxide and a local injection of lidocaine with epinephrine). Subjects will also 
receive prophylactic antibiotics post surgically.
7.2 Efficacy Assessment
7.2.1 Pain Intensity (NPRS)
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10 point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) where 0 is no pain 
and 10 is the worst pain imaginable) [26] will be assessed during the 5 hours following 
surgery. If the subject scores a NPRS ≥5 (and moderate or severe pain on the categorical 
scale) within 5 hours following surgery, they will be eligible for randomization.
Assessments will be made following surgery until a baseline pain is achieved.
Assessments will be made at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 
20, and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication, and immediately before any rescue 
medication and/or at the time of early termination.
Assessments will also be made immediately following the time of first relief and time of first 
meaningful relief.
The PI will be recorded in a diary.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 51 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential7.2.2 Categorical Pain Rating
A pain rating using a 4-point categorical rating scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) will be 
used to assess eligibility for randomization. If the subject records moderate or severe (and a 
NPRS ≥5) within 5 hours following surgery, they will be eligible for randomization.
Assessments will be made following surgery until a baseline pain is achieved.
The categorical pain rating will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.3 Pain Relief Assessment
A pain relief assessment will be made using a using a 5-point scale - none = 0, slight = 1, 
moderate = 2, good or a lot = 3, and complete = 4.
Assessments will be made at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 
20, and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication, and immediately before any rescue 
medication and/or at the time of early termination.
Assessments will also be made immediately following the time of first relief and time of first 
meaningful relief.
The pain relief assessment will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.4 Patient Global Assessment (PGA)
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be rated on a 5-point scale, ranging 
from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 2 good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent. 
Assessments will be made at 24 hours after the first dose of study medication or at time of 
early termination if applicable.
The PGA will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.5 Time to First Perceptible Pain Relief
Time to first perceptible pain relief will be assessed using a double stopwatch approach. 
The time to onset of first perceptible pain relief (time that the first watch stopped) is defined 
as the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. 
7.2.6 Time to Meaningful Pain Relief
Time to meaningful pain relief will be assessed using a double stopwatch approach. 
The time to onset of meaningful pain relief (time that the second watch stopped) is defined as 
the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel meaningful pain relief.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 52 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential7.2.7 Rescue Medication Use
Rescue medication of immediate release hydrocodone/acetaminophen will be allowed at any 
time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least 1-hour post-dose if possible. A PI 
score assessment will be made immediately prior to any rescue medication.
The time and dose of any rescue medication taken by a subject will be recorded in the CRF.
7.3 Safety Assessment
7.3.1 Adverse Event Assessment
If a subject reports any symptoms before drug administration, they will be evaluated by 
medical staff and necessary measurements will be performed. The Principal Investigator or 
Medical Sub-Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the course of action.
Findings from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical examinations will be 
recorded as medical history. Clinically significant worsening from the screening procedures 
will be recorded as adverse events.
Subjects will be routinely queried in regard to the presence or absence of AEs using open 
ended questions. When assessing AEs, the subject will be specifically asked regarding the 
presence of any GI symptoms. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events 
in the subject’s CRF. The AE source documentation will minimally include the following 
information: date and time of assessment, the outcome of the response, and identification of 
the clinic staff member collecting the information.
7.3.2 Laboratory Safety
The following safety laboratory tests (Table 7) will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and 
Visit 2 (Day 2).

tests can be performed.
e.Urine drug screen to include the following as a minimum cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates, buprenorphine, 
benzodiazepines and amphetamines. 
Hematology and chemistry will be analyzed by a local laboratory. Urinalysis will be 
conducted at the laboratory and if urine is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or leukocyte 
esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy/culture by a laboratory. 
Additionally a urine drug test will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and on admission at 
Visit 2 (Day 1). If a subject has a positive test for amphetamines but is prescribed medication 
such as to treat ADHD, they would still be acceptable at the Investigator’s discretion.
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be per 
the local laboratory’s standard procedures. The Investigator will provide collection materials 
for packaging and shipment of samples to the laboratory.
Any clinically significant findings in laboratory safety data should be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.
7.3.3 Vital Signs - Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) will be measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 
1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times specified in Table 1 and Section 6. Additional collection 
times, or changes to collection times of blood pressure and pulse rate will be permitted, as 
necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 54 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialSupine or semi-recumbent BP will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level 
of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg after 5 minutes of rest. Where possible, the 
same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and PR 
are acceptable, although, when done manually, PR will be measured in the brachial/radial 
artery for at least 30 seconds. Any clinically significant changes in BP and PR should be 
recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on 
the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.4 12-lead ECG
In this study, 12-lead ECGs will be recorded using clinic ECG devices. ECGs should be 
collected at measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times 
specified in Table 1 and Section 6. All 12-lead ECGs will be single recordings.
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 
5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. Pre-dose ECGs should be performed prior 
to commencing blood sampling or vital signs assessments. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a medically qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recordings and make any comparisons to baseline measurements.
At screening, the QTcF must be ≤470 msec for female or ≤450 msec for male subjects, and 
the ECG must show no clinically significant rate or rhythm abnormalities for the subject to be 
eligible (See Section 4.2.2). 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinically significant changes between the screening and 
subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and 
seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.5 General Physical Examination
A full general physical examination will consist of an examination of the abdomen, 
cardiovascular system, lungs, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurological systems, skin, 
extremities, head, ears, eyes, nose, and thyroid gland by trained medical personnel at the site. 
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and Visit 2 (Day 2).
Height and weight will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1). 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 55 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialPhysical examination results will not be recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant 
finding at Screening (Visit 1) should be recorded under medical history and changes between 
Screening (Visit 1) and subsequent examinations should be recorded as an AE. Determination 
of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.6 Blood Volume
Total blood sampling volume for an individual subject is approximately 103.5 mL. 
Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments, provided the total volume 
taken during the study does not exceed 500 mL during any period of 30 consecutive days, 
and the ethics committee/IRB is notified of the blood collection.

7.4 Pharmacokinetics
7.4.1 Plasma for Analysis of Meloxicam
Blood samples will be collected at the following times, with the date and time of each sample 
being recorded in the CRF:
Pre-dose and 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 
24 hours after the first dose of study medication.
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the exact nominal time 
relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (e.g., within 
6 minutes of a 60-minute sample) for samples prior to ≤8 hours from dosing and ±1 hour for 
samples ≥12 hours from dosing will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the 
exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source document and CRF.
PK sample handling instructions will be provided to the Investigator prior to initiation of the 
study.
Samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with Mylan 
standard operating procedures.
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may be used for 
metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method. These data will be 
used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report. 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 56 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential7.4.2 Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples
The shipment details and assay lab contact information will be provided to the investigator 
site prior to initiation of the study.
7.5 Restrictions
Study restrictions include all items listed in the Lifestyle Guidelines (Section 4.4) and the 
concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria section of this protocol 
(Section 4.2.2) and will be prohibited throughout the duration of the study. If concomitant 
medications change during the study, a discussion between the Principal Investigator or a 
Medical Sub-Investigator along with Mylan should occur, and a decision to continue or 
discontinue the subject will be made based on the medication’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by the sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any 
major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.
8.1 Sample Size Determination
N=110 subjects (N=22/treatment arm) to give approximately N=100 evaluable subjects for 
the primary endpoint (N=20/treatment arm). This is on the basis of an approximately 10% 
dropout rate.
In order to derive the required sample size for the primary endpoint, simulations were 
performed according to the method described below:

The numerical dose values were 10, 15, 20, 30 and 0 for 10 mg QD, 15 mg QD, 10 mg BID, 
15 mg BID and placebo respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.2 Populations for Analyses
8.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set (SS) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. Data will be summarized according to the treatment a subject actually received.
8.2.2 Intent To Treat Analysis Set
The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received study drug, including 
subjects who discontinued study treatment or received protocol allowed rescue medication.
8.2.3 Per Protocol Analysis Set
The per protocol analysis set (PP) will include all subjects in the ITT who had no major 
protocol violation that would impact on the primary efficacy endpoint. Significant protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 9.4 and will be further defined in the SAP. The list of major 
protocol deviations will be finalized prior to database lock and unblinding as part of the final 
blinded data review (BDR). Data will be summarized and analyzed according to the treatment 
a subject actually received at randomization.
8.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PK) will include all subjects who receive a dose of study 
medication and who provide at least one post dose concentration sample for the Population 
PK analysis.

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 58 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential8.3 Statistical Analyses
8.3.1 Definition of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference (SPID) over 
0-24 hours.
8.3.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall (summed) pain intensity difference over 
0-24 hours (SPID 0-24).
A 3-parameter E max model will be fitted to the SPID 0-24 standardized means (observed 
mean for each dose and placebo divided by the pooled standard deviation) for placebo and 
5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg MECC-SA. Standardized effect sizes will be estimated from the E max 
model together with their 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Baseline pain intensity 
score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max model.
The numerical dose values will be 10, 15, 20, 30 and 0 for 10 mg QD, 15 mg QD, 10 mg 
BID, 15 mg BID and placebo respectively.
Additional models may be explored utilizing a Multiple Comparison Procedure – Modeling 
(MCP-Mod) approach [27].
If the E max model fails to converge, and no other suitable models are identified using 
MCP-Mod, an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess the difference 
between treatment groups for SPID 0-24. The ANCOVA model will include treatment and 
study site as fixed effects and baseline PI score as a covariate. The difference between 
MECC-SA and placebo will be estimated from the least squares means (LS means) along 
with the 95% confidence interval (CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the 
standardized effect sizes for each dose will be calculated by dividing the differences in LS 
means for each dose and placebo by the pooled standard deviation.
Impact of Protocol Allowed Rescue Medication Use
For the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint a 2-hour windowed last observation 
carried forward (W2LOCF) approach will be used whereby the PI score obtained before a 
given rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the PI scores collected at each 
observation timepoint within 2 hours following the rescue dose.
8.3.3 Secondary/Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Analyses for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the PP (8.2.3).
As a sensitivity analysis of the W2LOCF approach, a W4LOCF will also be used whereby 
the PI score obtained before a given rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 59 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialPI scores collected at each observation within 4 hours following the rescue dose. The analysis 
will be conducted in both the ITT and the PP analysis sets.
8.3.4 Missing Data
The amount of missing data is expected to be minimal given the short duration of the study.
Missing pain assessments for subjects who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy, 
an AE, or intolerance to study drug will be imputed using a baseline observation 
carried forward (BOCF) approach.
Missing pain assessments due to other reasons for discontinuing will be imputed using 
a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.
In addition to the BOCF/LOCF approaches outlined above, missing data may be 
imputed using appropriate multiple imputation (MI) methods. Further information 
will be provided in the SAP.
Intermittent missing pain assessments between two non-missing scores will be 
imputed using linear interpolation. 
The impact on the computation of the primary efficacy endpoint and the methods for 
handling missing data may be assessed in secondary/sensitivity analyses and any pre-planned 
analyses will be fully described in the SAP. As this is a Phase 2 study, additional post-hoc 
analyses may be carried out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.3.5 Sub-Group Analyses
Subgroup analyses may be specified in the SAP. As this is a Phase 2 study, additional 
post-hoc analyses may be carried out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.3.6 Definition and Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
All hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Nominal p-values will 
be presented for all secondary endpoints without adjustment for multiple comparisons (since 
this is a Phase 2 study).
8.3.6.1 Secondary SPID Endpoints and TOTPAR
The SPID endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12 and 12-24 hours will be 
analyzed using the E max/ANCOVA model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.
The TOTPAR endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12, 12-24 and 0-24 hours will 
be analyzed using the E max/ANCOVA model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.
8.3.6.2 Pain Intensity Differences (PID) Over Time
PID scores over time will be analyzed using a longitudinal mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, study site, time, treatment by time 
interaction and baseline PI score. Subject will be fitted as a random effect. Variance 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 60 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialestimation will be based on an unstructured covariance matrix. Missing data will be assumed 
to be Missing At Random (MAR). Least squares means (LS means) will be plotted by time to 
show the pain-relieving efficacy of both MECC-SA and placebo over 24 hours.
8.3.6.3 Time to Event Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the time-to-event endpoints listed:
Time to perceptible pain relief (PPR).
Time to meaningful pain relief (MPR).
Elapsed time from the start of study medication to first rescue medication 
administration.
Time to event endpoints will be analyzed and plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology and 
differences between MECC-SA and placebo evaluated using the log-rank test. The median 
time to event will be calculated and presented.
8.3.6.4 Responder Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the responder endpoints listed:
Proportion of subjects with overall pain reductions from baseline of ≥30% and ≥50% 
within 4 hours following the first dose based on the PI scores. Both these analyses 
will be presented for both methods of handling rescue medication use (W2LOCF and 
W4LOCF approaches).
Proportion of subjects using rescue medication during 0-24 hours.
Patient’s Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control for 0-24 hours after the initial 
dose scored on the 5-point scale will be dichotomized and the percentage of subjects 
reporting a PGA score of 2 (good) or better defined as a responder.
The number and percentage of responders in each treatment group will be summarized. A 
comparison between MECC-SA and placebo will be evaluated with the odds ratio (OR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval from a logistic regression model with treatment group 
and baseline PI as a covariate.
8.3.6.5 Frequency of Rescue Medication Use 
The frequency of rescue medication use will be summarized and graphically presented for the 
0-24 hours period after the first dose of study treatment.
8.3.7 Pharmacokinetics
For all pharmacokinetic data analyses, the PK population will be used.
Samples for PK determination of drug concentrations of meloxicam and salicylic acid, in 
plasma will be determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 61 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialmethods. Details of the validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate 
bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam and salicylic acid will be listed, summarized on 
the basis of time intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding 
meloxicam dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, 
number of subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations 
for each time interval and by treatment group.
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam and salicylic acid concentrations will be 
performed using modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. 
Details of the PPK model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.
If the dose-response relationship cannot be established in this study (for example, no doses 
are effective, or all doses are equally effective) then exploratory exposure-response analysis 
may be conducted using individual predictions of exposure from the PPK analysis in this 
study. Outcomes from this analysis will be reported separately, if conducted.
8.3.8 Safety Analyses
Analysis of all safety data will be performed on the Safety Population and will be presented 
by the treatment received. 
8.3.8.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Authorities (MedDRA). The occurrence of AEs and SAEs will be summarized in terms of 
incidence, as well as in terms of total number of AEs. Analysis of AEs in terms of incidence 
by severity and by relatedness will also be provided. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest version of WHO Drug 
Dictionary and will be summarized. Medical history will be listed by subject and coded using 
the latest version of MedDRA and will be summarized. 
8.3.8.2 Vital Signs
Blood Pressure and pulse rate will be listed and descriptively summarized (N, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum) by treatment group and visit. Baseline (defined as the 
pre-dose value collected on Visit 2 (Day 1) and changes from baseline will be similarly 
summarized. 
8.3.8.3 ECG Analyses
ECG data; QT, QTc (Fridericia’s), heart rate (HR), QRS duration, PR and RR interval will be 
listed.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 62 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialBaseline (defined as the pre-dose value collected on Visit 2 (Day 1) and change from baseline 
for QT, QTcF, HR, QRS, RR and PR will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, 
mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) by treatment and study week.
For QTcF a classification of absolute values and increases from baseline will be performed. 
The number of subjects with maximum absolute QTcF <450 msec, 450 msec ≤QTcF 
<480 msec, 480 msec ≤QTcF <500 msec and QTcF values ≥500 msec will be tabulated by 
treatment and visit. The number of subjects with maximum increase from baseline QTcF 
<30 msec, 30 msec ≤QTcF <60 msec and QTcF ≥60 msec will be tabulated by treatment and 
visit.
8.3.8.4 Laboratory Data
Descriptive summaries of observed values and change from baseline (defined as the samples 
collected on Screening (Visit 1)) will be presented for clinical laboratory evaluations (Serum 
chemistry and hematology) by treatment group. Assessments of laboratory variables 
according to clinical relevance will be tabulated by visit and treatment group for each clinical 
laboratory parameter in frequency tables. Additionally, for each laboratory parameter, shifts 
in value from baseline to all post-baseline visits will be presented by treatment group in shift 
tables.
The assessment of categorical urinalysis variables will be tabulated by visit for each urine 
parameter by treatment group in frequency tables. Additionally, for each of the urine

property of the sponsor and the Investigator must review all CRFs prior to submission to the 
sponsor.
The CRF may be considered as the source document. The investigator must seek prospective 
agreement to the sponsor in writing to use the CRF as source document prior the start of the 
study. In addition, items directly recorded in the CRF must be documented that they will be 
considered as source.
All records pertaining to the receipt and return of study supplies (particularly study 
medication) and copies of final case report forms, worksheets, and other pertinent source 
documents must be retained in accordance with ICH-GCP and the applicable regulatory 
requirements of the country where the study is being conducted as well as the country where 
the study will be submitted.
The investigator must obtain in writing the sponsor’s agreement to dispose of any records, 
even if the retention period has been reached.
9.6 Confidentiality
Information furnished to Clinical Investigators and IRBs/Ethics Committees will be 
maintained in confidence by the Clinical Investigator and IRB/Ethics Committee. By signing 
this protocol, the Investigator affirms to the Sponsor that he/she will maintain, in confidence, 
information furnished to the IRB/Ethics Committee relevant to this study under appropriate 
understanding of confidentiality with such IRB/Ethics Committee.
By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees that within local regulatory restrictions and 
institutional and ethical considerations, the Sponsor may consult and/or copy source 
documents (e.g., laboratory/X-ray reports, ECG tracings, workbooks, medical records) in

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 66 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential10 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING
The adverse event collection period begins at signing of informed consent and continues until 
the telephone End of Study (EOS) Visit. Adverse events occurring during this period need to 
be reported to the sponsor according to Section 10.3. The Investigator is also responsible for 
notifying the sponsor if he/she becomes aware of any adverse event after the study period has 
ended and it is considered related to the study medication (i.e., an adverse drug reaction). 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged by the 
principal investigator to be stable or permanent.
10.1 Definitions
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory or physical findings, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Clinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory assessments, vital signs, and 
physical examination are to be recorded as adverse events. Clinically significant 
abnormalities include:
a result associated with accompanying signs/symptoms 
a result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a result that leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy 
a result considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or sponsor
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event. 
An abnormal safety assessment (e.g., laboratory, vital signs, ECG) associated with a 
clinical diagnosis that has been recorded as an AE does not require a separate AE 
entry
Events meeting the definition of an AE also include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 67 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. (Please refer to the Section 10.2 for further 
details) 
A symptom or medical complication related to a protocol-mandated intervention, 
including screening procedures
Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Note: In patient hospitalization is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an overnight stay. An 
elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the study drug or a 
hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or 
event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due to transportation, 
organization or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to 
be considered an SAE.
oEvents NOT to be reported as SAEs are hospitalizations for the following: 
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not 
associated with any deterioration in condition 
Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not 
worsen 
Admission to a hospital or other institution for general care due to 
social or economic reasons (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical 
care) 
Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling 
any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in 
hospital admission 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 68 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialHospitalization also does not include the following: Rehabilitation 
facilities, Hospice facilities, Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief), Skilled 
nursing facilities, Nursing homes 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event (medically significant)
oNote: medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject and / or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
oThe seriousness criterion of “medically significant” should only be selected 
when none of the other seriousness criteria apply to the event but the 
investigator still considers the event as serious.
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events. 
Adverse Drug Reaction
All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose of the 
investigational product should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by 
either the reporting Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to 
an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated as if the relationship were “possible.”
Expected/Unexpected Adverse Event
An expected AE is defined as one whose nature, severity or outcome is consistent with the 
applicable reference safety information described of the study drugs. 
An AE is to be considered unexpected if the nature, severity or outcome is not consistent with 
the applicable product reference safety information.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 69 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialPreexisting Condition
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline medical history and not reported as an AE. A baseline or preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
Any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event
At the last scheduled contact with the subject the investigator should instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study. 
The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study. 
10.2 Special Situations
The following situations may by associated with a serious outcome and should be evaluated 
for expedited reporting to the sponsor.
Any diagnosis of Cancer or Neoplasm is to be reported as a serious adverse event.
Emergency Room Visits:  Events that result in emergency room visits that do not 
result in admission to the hospital are not routinely considered to be serious events; 
however, these events should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., 
life-threatening, other serious [medically significant] events).
Overdose: Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent; this should be 
reported regardless of sequelae. Signs and symptoms associated with accidental 
overdose are to be recorded as adverse events or as serious AEs. If adverse events 
associated with overdose fulfil any of the serious criteria (as defined in section 
‘Serious Adverse Event’), a completed SAE report form is required to be submitted.
Reports of Drug-drug interaction and Drug Abuse and Medication Errors: drug 
interactions or abuse of the study medication must be recorded as AEs. Medication 
errors will be captured as protocol deviations while any associated signs or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In addition, any serious consequence of drug 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 70 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialinteractions, drug abuse, or medication error must be reported immediately if these 
fulfil any of the SAE criteria.
10.2.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest given that MECC-SA is an NSAID will include the 
following:
Myocardial Infarction/Unstable Angina
Stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Heart Failure
Cardiac Arrhythmia (Atrial & Ventricular)
Gastrointestinal haemorrhages NEC
Gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation
Any AESI should be reported per the SAE reporting process per Section 10.5.
10.3 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
During the Adverse Event Reporting Period, the PI will record all adverse events. At each 
contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all adverse events should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of 
the case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes AE name or term (in 
standard medical terminology) and final diagnosis, event description, time and date of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, seriousness, relationship to study product (assessed only 
by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), action taken with the study 
drug, treatment for the event and time (if available) and date of resolution/stabilization of the 
event.
Any findings from protocol specified safety assessments that are associated with the 
indication being studied are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal results of diagnostic procedures should be 
grouped under one diagnosis on the CRF where possible and appropriate.
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the outcome. Any adverse event that occurs after the study period and is related to 
the study treatment or study participation should be recorded; and if serious, the investigator 
should also immediately report it to the Sponsor.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 71 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential10.4 Classification of an Adverse Event
10.4.1 Severity
The Investigator will assign a severity rating to each AE. For purposes of consistency, the 
following scale is to be used:
Grade 1 - MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
Grade 2 - MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
Grade 3 - SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and Serious AEs. Severity is a classification 
of intensity, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria (see 
definitions, Serious Adverse Event).
10.4.2 Causality
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to 
determine the causality of the adverse event. The investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF.
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include: Temporal 
relationship, Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s), Pharmacological 
plausibility, Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history), Drug 
interactions, De-challenge/re-challenge, Dose relationship.
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment 
in accordance with the following definitions:
Category Causality Description
DEFINITE Causal relationship is certain For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de-challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory re-challenge procedure if necessary.
PROBABLE High degree of certainty for For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 72 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialCategory Causality Description
causal relationship there is a clinically compatible response to 
de-challenge (re-challenge is not required), and 
other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.
POSSIBLE Causal relationship is 
uncertainFor example: the temporal relationship between 
study treatment exposure and the AE onset/course 
is reasonable or unknown, de-challenge 
information is either unknown or equivocal; could 
also be explained by disease or other drugs.
UNLIKELY Causal relationship is
improbableAnother explanation is more likely such as disease, 
environment, or other medication.
Does not represent a known reaction to study drug.
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATEDNo possible relationship The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible
For SAEs, if the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided when possible (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events, study-related procedure).
10.4.3 Expectedness
The Sponsor or its designated representative will be responsible for determining whether an 
AE is expected or unexpected based on the reference safety information. The reference safety 
information mentioned in the IB will be used in this study for the expectedness assessment of 
SAEs.
10.4.4 Outcome
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to Sponsor or its 
designated representative.
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:
RECOVERED/RESOLVED where the subject recuperated and is free of any 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.
RECOVERED WITH SEQUELAE where the subject recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (i.e. ongoing) where the subject has not recuperated 
from the condition or injury and the event is still considered ongoing.
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 73 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialRECOVERING where the subject has begun to recuperate from the condition or injury, but 
the event is considered ongoing at a reduced intensity.
FATAL the condition or injury results in the subject’s death. The investigator should identify 
the principal cause of death and assign Fatal outcome to that event. Other concurrent ongoing 
AE/SAEs present at the time of death would remain Not recovered/Not resolved.
UNKNOWN can be selected if none of the other situations apply or are known. Follow-up 
should be conducted to obtain one of the preceding outcomes.
10.4.5 Action Taken With the Study Treatment
Action Description
Treatment interrupted The treatment was temporarily discontinued
Treatment withdrawn The treatment was permanently discontinued
Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused
No action taken The AE did not result in any modification of dose or frequency of dosing
Not applicable The AE occurred prior to first dose or following last scheduled dose
10.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Pregnancy Exposures
Investigators and the Sponsor or its designated representative must conform to the serious 
adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which 
they are responsible. 
10.5.1 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor
Immediate notification of SAEs by the investigator to Mylan PSRM is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects are met.
Mylan will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and investigators.
Serious adverse events must be reported to the study sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. 
To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form must be completed and 
signed by the investigator or designee and forwarded to:
 

Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 74 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialIf the initial notification using the completed ‘SAE report form’ is not possible, the 
notification may be made via email/fax or over telephone with the following minimum 
necessary information
Study identifier
Study Center
Subject number
A description of the eventCurrent status (outcome of event-if known 
and whether study medication is continuing)
The reason why the event is classified as 
serious
Investigator assessment of the causality 
between the event and study treatment
The investigator should provide further information on the as soon as possible, preferably 
within 48 hours of awareness. This should include a copy of the completed SAE Report form, 
and any other diagnostic information and medical records that will assist in the understanding 
of the event.  
Subject identifying information must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting 
documentation provided by the Investigator. Any information that could be used to identify 
the subject (e.g., name, address, medical record number) must be de-identified before 
submission to Mylan or its designee. The subject’s study specific ID number should be 
recorded on every page of documentation forwarded to the sponsor.
The PI should provide the final diagnosis as the SAE term whenever possible in the SAE 
report form and CRF. The signs and symptoms should be provided in the narrative only, not 
as SAE terms. The PI should only list all signs and symptoms as SAE terms if no diagnosis is 
available at the time of report.
10.5.2 Follow-up
New information and any important missing information from prior reports on a serious 
adverse event must be provided promptly to the study sponsor. In addition, the Investigator 
may be requested by Mylan/designee to obtain specific additional follow-up information in 
an expedited fashion. The investigator should respond to targeted follow-up requests as soon 
as possible and preferably within 48 hours from receipt of the request. 
10.5.3 Investigator reporting: Notifying the Ethics Committee
Investigators are responsible for safety reporting to their local Ethics Committee (LEC) and 
complying with their local EC’s reporting requirements. Copies of each report and 
documentation of LEC notification and receipt will be kept in the investigator’s study file.
10.5.4 Investigator Reporting of Pregnancy: Notifying the Study Sponsor 
All subjects who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to practice adequate 
birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation as 
Protocol MECC-TBZ-2001 Page 75 of 102
Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidentialdetailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnancy testing will be conducted 
throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of assessments.
A subject who is found to be pregnant at the screening visit will be excluded from the study 
and will be a screening failure. 
Subjects who have been enrolled in the study should be instructed to contact the Investigator 
or study staff immediately if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. Early termination visit 
assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. Pregnant 
females will be discontinued from study treatment by the Investigator. A male that has a 
partner that becomes pregnant during the study will not be discontinued from study treatment. 
Details of the pregnancy should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report form and reported to 
 within 24 hours of awareness by email  or 
 from the time of initial awareness, even if beyond the closure of 
the clinical database. 
The Investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy every 3 months or until 
delivery or termination and informing the Sponsor about its outcome. Reports where the 
embryo or fetus may have been exposed to the study drug(s), should be followed-up in order 
to collect information on the:
outcome of the pregnancy,
outcome for both mother and fetus (malformation/anomalies diagnosed since initial 
report)
development of the child after birth (developmental assessment, infant illnesses, 
hospitalizations, drug therapies, breastfeeding)
Healthy newborns should be followed-up at 1 month after birth to confirm no congenital 
anomalies were subsequently detected (if possible).
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the Sponsor.
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered an elective procedure and not an AE; nevertheless, Mylan requests the outcome 
(e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours of awareness and sent as a follow-up 
on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form). 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study and considered by the investigator as at least 
possibly related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to Mylan PSRM.
If the study center becomes aware of a pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject, study 
personnel should contact their clinical research associate to obtain a partner pregnancy ICF.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 ConfidentialConsent of the pregnant partner must be obtained before any details of the pregnancy can be 
shared with Mylan or its designated representative. If the pregnant partner provides consent 
to have the pregnancy followed, the study center should collect the information specified on 
the Pregnancy Report form and forward the completed form to Mylan PSRM every 3 months 
until the pregnancy outcome has been obtained.

made along with a request to ensure proactive monitoring for GI adverse events.
In addition, clarifications and correction of typographical errors/inconsistencies have been 
made. The corrections include minor changes to the sample size justification sections to 
reflect the BID dosing regimens; this does not change the number of subjects required for the 
study.

Synopsis – Study Treatment
Changed From
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, subjects will be 
blindfolded and receive two tablets when dosed; to maintain the blind between QD and BID 
arms, subjects assigned to QD arms will receive placebo at the second dose.
Changed To
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, subjects will 
receive in a double dummy design, two tablets when dosed (one that is representative of a 
10 mg tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg tablet). Due to the double dummy 
design, neither the subject, nor the Investigator will know what treatment a subject receives. 
To maintain the blind between QD and BID arms, subjects assigned to QD arms will receive 
placebo at the second dose. Per the clinic procedures, subjects will also be blindfolded during 
dosing.

Changed To
Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of 
serious GI events,  
 
MECC-SA contains salicylic acid as a co-former, this is at a low dose (up to 11.6 mg for BID 
dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg) which is anticipated to have negligible physiological effects. 
However, it is acknowledged that salicylic acid (and acetylsalicylic acid) at higher doses can 
cause adverse effects, such as local gastrointestinal effects such as ulceration of the GI tract, 
particularly when administered with other NSAIDs. As the potential for local GI toxicity for 
salicylic acid is not known all GI symptoms should be assessed and documented.

Protocol Version 5.0 15 September 2020 Confidential1.3 Investigational Product
Changed From
Salicylic acid is used as the co-former in the MECC-SA tablets. Considering that meloxicam 
is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for meloxicam absorption is solubility. 
The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by increasing its solubility and dissolution.

The intended use of salicylic acid in MECC-SA is to increase the rate of absorption of 
meloxicam by increasing its solubility and dissolution. The dose of salicylic acid (5.8 mg and 
11.6 mg considering QD and BID dosing of MECC-SA 15 mg, respectively) used in 
MECC-SA formulation is considered as a subtherapeutic dose (approved oral clinical doses 
of acetylsalicylic acid are in the range of 50- 325 mg/day) with negligible physiological 
effects. Whilst the side effect profile of acetylsalicylic acid is well known, including local 
effects on the GI tract, it is acknowledged that the local side effects of its metabolite (via 
hydrolysis in the GI tract, liver and plasma) salicylic acid when given orally are unknown, 
although a fraction of acetylsalicylic acid is metabolized to salicylic acid in the GI tract prior 
to absorption. Considering the low dose of salicylic acid in the formulation, MECC-SA is not 
considered a new fixed combination drug.
1.4 Ethics and Benefit-Risk Considerations
Changed From
The age of subjects (including those aged 16-18 years) is reflective of the population of 
subjects needing the removal of third molars. The use of NSAIDs in adolescent subjects is 
common, with side effects similar to those of adult subjects [28]; [29]. Further, the systemic 
exposure of meloxicam in adolescent subjects is similar to that of adult subjects [30].

other tests, e.g., 12-lead ECGs that are taken at the same nominal time as vital signs or blood 
samples are taken prior to those other procedures:
6.2.1.1 Pre-Dose Procedures
Check the subject has fasted from midnight.
Review AEs.
Review concomitant medications.
Record vital signs – supine or semi-recumbent blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate 
(PR).
Perform urine drug screen.
Urine pregnancy test (if female of childbearing potential).
Check study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Record body temperature.
Diary training.
Perform dental surgery, using appropriate local anesthesia and sedation (performed 
using nitrous oxide and a local injection of lidocaine with epinephrine). Subjects will 
also receive prophylactic antibiotics post-surgery.
Pain assessments (Pain Intensity (0-10-point numeric pain rating scale – NPRS) and 
Categorical Pain Rating (4-point scale – none, mild, moderate, severe)) will be made 
during the 5 hours post-surgery until a baseline pain assessment is achieved.

categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, mild, moderate, severe) during this 
time they will be eligible for randomization.
Randomization using IVRS/IWRS.
oTo occur such that dosing occurs within 15 minutes of the eligible pain scores.
12-lead ECG – supine or semi-recumbent taken prior to dosing.
Vital signs (BP and PR) – supine or semi-recumbent taken prior to dosing.
Blood for a PK sample taken prior to dosing.

General physical examination, including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological systems, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, head, ears, 
eyes, nose, and thyroid gland.
Record 12-lead ECG – supine or semi-recumbent.
Record vital signs – supine or semi-recumbent BP and PR. 
Urine pregnancy test (if female of childbearing potential). 
Urinalysis (dipstick for blood, protein etc.). Sample to be sent for microscopy/culture 
if positive for blood, protein, nitrites or leukocyte esterase.
Blood will be collected for safety laboratory tests. 
Review concomitant medications.
Adverse Event assessment.
oWhen assessing AEs, the subject will be specifically asked regarding the 
presence of any GI symptoms.
Discharge subject from the clinic.
oProvide appropriate post-discharge pain medications, per standard of care.
oIf a subject requires a longer duration of in-patient assessment due to reasons 
associated with the operation this is acceptable.

Changed From
For all pharmacokinetic data analyses, the PK population will be used.
Samples for PK determination of drug concentrations of meloxicam, in plasma will be 
determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Details of the 
validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam will be listed, summarized on the basis of time 
intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding meloxicam 
dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of 
subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations for each 
time interval and by treatment group.
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam concentrations will be performed using 
modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. Details of the PPK 
model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.
If the dose-response relationship cannot be established in this study (for example, no doses 
are effective, or all doses are equally effective) then exploratory exposure-response analysis 
may be conducted using individual predictions of exposure from the PPK analysis in this 
study. Outcomes from this analysis will be reported separately, if conducted.

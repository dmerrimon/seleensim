Treatment Assignment :  Subjects will receive  the EYP-1901 intravitreal in sert (the test article ) in the 
designated study eye .  
Control:   Sham IVT injection  
Duration of Treatment:   Duration of release of the EYP-1901 active ingredient (vorol anib) is 
expected to be at least 9 months.  
Test Article Therapy:   Each EYP -1901 intravitreal insert is 8  mm long and is designed to deliver 
vorolanib into the vitreous humor at two different doses for at least 9 months.  Single or multiple 
inserts will be administered to the study eye at Day 1 by injection through the pars plana using  a pre -
loaded applicator with a 22 -gauge needle .  Two of the following doses will be selected based upon 
ongoing Phase 1 studies:  
• 2060  µg dose, 2 inserts, 2 2-gauge needle  
• 3090  µg dose; 3 inserts, 22 -gauge needle  
Designation  of Study Eye:   For subjects wit h unilateral NPDR, the affected eye will be designated as 
the study eye; for subjects with bilateral NPDR, the study eye will be the more severely affected eye 
meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, ie, the eye having the worse DRSS or if equal, the eye  
clinically judged to be the more severely affected eye as determined by the Investigator .  If the eyes are 
symmetrically affected, the study eye will be the right eye.   The fellow eye will receive treatment as 
needed and according to the Investigator ’s judgment.  
Study Procedures:   Assessments will include the ETDRS -DRSS score on 4 -widefield digital 
stereoscopic fundus photography, BCVA by ETDRS, anterior/posterior segment ocular examination, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), wide -field FA, color fundus photography (CFP), ocular and non -ocular

 treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory evaluations (HbA1 c, hematology, 
serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), bioanalytical testing for plasma  levels of vorola nib and 
X-297, its main metabolite,  heart rate and blood pressure measurements, SD -OCT, and , at study sites 
where equipment is available, OCT -angiography (OCT -A).  Photographs will be sent to the CRC  for 
analysis.  
Follow -up Visits:   Following injection on Study Day 1, subjects will return at W eeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 
48 (see details in attached Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments).  
Masking:   Except for the Investigator s administering the study treatments, masking will be maintained 
for both subjects and the Investigator s conducting the study assessments.  Sham IVT injections will be 
used during the study to maintain masking of investigational EYP -1901 therapy for study subjects . 
Only  the Sponsor /CRO  will be unmasked after the last subject completes the Week 3 6 visit to conduct 
endpoint analysis.  
Criteria for Evaluation  in the Study Eye : 
Primary Endpoint:   
• Percentage of subjects improving ≥2 steps from baseline in the DRSS score at Week 36 in each 
dose level vs. sham.  
The DRSS may be used to describe overall retinopathy severity as well as the change in severity over 
time.  Severity ranges from level 10 (DR absent) to level 85 (advanced proliferative DR: posterior 
fundus obscured, or center of macula detached).  Here, DRSS describes severity level 47 (moderately 
severe NPDR) and level 53 (severe NPDR) at Week 36 from baseline.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Percentage of subjects improving ≥2 steps from baseline in the DRSS score at Week s 24 and  
48 in each dose level vs. sham.  
• Percentage of subjects  improving ≥2-steps or ≥3-steps over time in DRSS from baseline . 
• Percentage of subjects  worsening ≥2-steps or ≥3-steps over time in DRSS from baseline . 
• Percentage of subjects  who developed a vision -threatening complication due to diabetic 
retinopathy at Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Percentage of subjects  who developed CI -DME at Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Time to develop any neovascular vision threatening complication (PDR/ASNV) through 
Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Time to develop CI -DME through Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Percentage of subjects  who received anti -VEGF or additional standard of care intervention due 
to ocular diabetic compl ications at Week s 24, 36 and 48. 
• Percentage of subjects  who received PRP, inclusive of subjects  undergoing vitrectomy with 
endolaser, at Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Area Under the Curve (AUC) for change from baseline in BCVA at Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Systemic exposure s to vorol anib and X-297, its main metabolite , measured through plasma  
levels  up to Week s 24, 36, and 48. 
• Rates of ocular (study eye and fellow eye) and non -ocular TEAEs at Week s 24, 36, and 48.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Vorolanib is a multi -kinase inhibitor of both vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and 
platelet -derived growth factor ( PDGF ), which is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.  This drug 
was originally developed as an oral pharmaceutical formulation to treat patients with pathologic 
angiogenesis found in certain solid tumors , in von Hippel -Lindau disease, and in exudative age-
relate d macular degeneration ( AMD ).  As a small molecule, vorolanib has more recently been 
developed as an intravitreal formulation utilizing the Durasert® platform,  a proprietary sustained 
delivery technology used in FDA -approved intraocular products indicated for the treatment of 
posterior segment uveitis , such as Retisert® (Bausch & Lomb, Inc., USA) and Yutiq® (EyePoint 
Pharmaceut icals, Inc., USA), and for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), such as 
Iluvien® (Alimera Sciences, USA).  EYP -1901 Intrav itreal Insert  is a bioerod ible, sterile, 
sustained -release drug delivery system formulated in Durasert® and designed to release 
microgram levels of vorolanib daily into the ocular vitreous chamber for the treatment of wet 
age-related macular degeneration ( wAMD ) and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) . 
1.2 Overview of NPDR  
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of new blindness in the US, with a prevalence rate in 
adults with diabetes of approximately 28.5% ( https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1225122 -
overview ).  The global impact of DR -related vision complications is expected to rise given the 
increasing  rates of diabetes across the US and other developed countries.  As ocular 
manifestations often precede other systemic complications of diabetes mellitus, eye care 
specialists play a critical role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diabetic ey e 
disease.  
There are several stages of DR, ranging from mild nonproliferative disease to severe proliferative 
disease.   While the most common early clinically manifestations of NPDR include formation of 
microaneurysms  and intraretinal hemorrhages, these pa tients do not present with any symptoms.   
Progressing in stage, further damage can be observed such as intraretinal microvascular 
abnormalities, cotton wool spots, increased numbers of hemorrhages, and venous caliber 
abnormalities.  At any stage in the cou rse of the disease, increased vasopermeability results in 
retinal thickening (edema) and/or exudates that may lead to a loss in central vision.   The 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) stage results from closure of arterioles and venules with 
secondar y proliferation of new vessels on the retina, optic disc, or anterior segment.   Common 
complications of DR that puts the patient’s vision at risk and requires either urgent medical or 
surgical intervention include center involved -diabetic macular edema (CI -DME), tractional 
retinal detachments, epiretinal membranes, and vitreous hemorrhage.   The risk of these 
complications usually increases as the severity of DR increases, although DME can be present at 
any stage of DR ( Aiello et al. 1994 ).  The link between diabetic ischemia and subsequent 
proliferation of angiogenic factors including VEGF has been established.  
Preventing the conversion to PDR and the associated vision threatening complications h as the 
potential to improve the quality of a patient li ves for decades.   The ability to minimize sight -
threatening diabetic complications in the working -age population could have significant impact 
on public health.

 While both ranibizumab  (LUCENTIS®) and a flibercept  (EYLEA®) have demonstrated that 
intravitreal  (IVT)  anti-VEGF therapy can effectively regress the severity of DR, the use of these 
agents in clinical practice remains limited due to the need for regular treatment and visits to 
achieve the desired  outcomes ( LUCENTIS® and EYLEA® prescribing  information ).  EYP -1901 
could potentially provide long -term treatment to patients.  
For this Phase 2 clinical study, participants with moderately  severe to severe NPDR without 
CI-DME at baseline will be enroll ed.  This represents a population that is often observed without 
treatment in clinical practice until signs of high -risk proliferative disease are present.  These 
patients are at significant risk of progressing to more serious vision threatening stages of DR.  
Therefore, this population of patients has the potential to benefit from EYP -1901 long lasting 
treatment.  
1.3 Study Rationale  
Despite the introduction of a number of improved anti -VEGF biologic agents in recent years, 
there remains a need for new therapies that will provide equivalent efficacy and anatomic disease 
control while reducing the need for frequent injections to prevent  the progression to more serious 
vision threatening stages of DR.   EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, the Sponsor of this study, has 
developed EYP -1901  Intravitreal Insert , a sustained and controlled delivery formulation of 
vorolanib over a period of at least  9 mon ths as a therapy to address this unmet medical need.  
1.4 Nonclinical Experience with EYP -1901  
X-82, an oral vorolanib formulation, and EYP -1901( Vorolanib Intravitreal Insert ) were both 
investigated in nonclinical efficacy models and in nonclinical safety and pharmacokinetic 
studies .  For a summary of the nonclinical experience with these drug formulations please refer 
to the current EYP -1901 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.5 Clinical Experie nce with EYP -1901  
This is the third  clinical investigational study of EYP -1901 ( vorolanib intravitreal in sert); a 
previous Phase 1 dose -escalation study (ie, the DA VIO trial) in patients with wAMD was 
initiated in Jan  2021 and a Phase 2 trial in patients w ith wAMD will be initiated in mid -2022 .  
Interim safety and efficacy analyses conducted upon completion of Week  24 in the DAVIO study 
provided support for initiation of the present Ph ase 2 study.  
For X -82 (oral vorolanib), t wo previous studies were conduct ed in wAMD ( Jackson  et al. 2017 ; 
Cohen et al. 2021 ).  For additional details on the clinical experience from previous EYP -1901 
and X -82 studies please refer to the current EYP -1901 IB.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of EYP -1901 compared  to sham treatment in the 
improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR.  
The secondary objective s are: 
• To characterize the safety of EYP -1901 in subject s with moderately severe to severe 
NPDR.

 • To determine if EYP -1901 will prevent the worsening of diabet ic retinopathy and reduce 
the incidence of DME.  
• To evaluate the need for additional standard of care intervention due to ocular diabetic 
complications.  
• To determine the anatomic effects of EYP -1901  in subjects with moderately severe to 
severe NPDR.  
• To dete rmine the systemic exposure to vorolanib and X -297, its main metabolite,  
measured through plasma levels up to Week  48. 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -masked , multi center  study  evaluating the ocular 
efficacy and safety of two doses of the EYP -1901 intravitreal insert compared to sham  in adult 
subjects with NPDR .  Up to 60 subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 :1 basis to th ree different 
treatment arms (2060  µg EYP -1901, 3090  µg EYP -1901, or sham IVT injection)  across 
approximately 30 sites in the US , such that each treatment arm will include up to 20 subjects .  
All subjects , irrespective of treatment arm, will receive an IVT injection  on Day 1  in the 
designated study eye . 
Following injection on Day 1, subjects will return at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and 4 8 following study 
drug administration .  The Schedule of Assessments is presented in Table  5–1. 
3.1.1 General Study Method s 
For subjects with unilateral NPDR, the affected eye will be designated as the study eye; for 
subjects with bilateral NPDR, the study eye will be the more severely affected eye meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criter ia, ie, the eye having the worse Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale 
(DRSS ) score or if equal, the eye clinically judged to be the more severely affected eye as 
determined by the Investigator .  If the eyes are symmetrically affected, the study eye will be the 
right eye.  The fellow eye will receive treatment as needed and according to t he Investigator ’s 
judgment.  
Subjects ≥18 years of age with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (documented hemoglobin A1c 
[HbA1c ] ≤12%) and an active diagnosis of moderately severe to severe NPDR (based on DRSS 
levels 47 or 53) in whom pan -retinal photocoagulation (PRP) and anti -VEGF injections can be 
safely deferred for at least 6 months as per the Investigator , and who satisfy all other protocol 
eligibility criter ia up until dosing on Day 1 , will be enrolled  and receive the assigned study 
treatment . 
Study procedures will include:  ETDRS -DRSS score on 4 -widefield digital stereoscopic fundus 
photography, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by ETDRS, anterior/posterio r segment ocular 
examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), wide -field fluorescein angiography (FA), color fundus 
photography (CFP), ocular and non -ocular treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical 
laboratory evaluations (HbA1c, hematology, serum ch emistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), 
bioanalytical testing for plasma  levels of vorolanib and X-297, its main metabolite, heart rate 
and blood pressure measurements, spectral -domain – optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT),

 and, at study sites where equi pment is available, OCT -angiography (OCT -A).  Photographs will 
be sent to the central reading center ( CRC ) for analysis.  
3.2 Masking and Randomization  
Except for the Investigator s administering the study treatments, masking will be maintained for 
both subjects  and the Investigator s conducting the study assessments.  Sham injections will be 
used during the study to maintain masking of investigational EYP -1901 therapy for study 
subjects.  Only the Sponsor/CRO will be unmasked after the last subject complete s the Week 3 6 
visit to conduct endpoint analysis.  
The r andomization code will be generated with a computer program according to the study 
design, the number of subjects , and the number of treatments.  The random allocation of each 
treatment to each  subject will be done in such a way that the study is balanced.   Randomization 
will occur on Day 1.  
3.2.1 Emergency Unmasking  
Unmasking a subject’s treatment to the assessing Investigator  should only be done in emergency 
situations for reasons of subject safety.  
At the initiation of the study, the clinical sites will receive instructions for unmasking a subject.  
In the event that an emergency unmasking is required, the assessing Investigator /medically 
qualified designee has the authority to unmask a subject’s tre atment using IXRS, or its back -up 
system if I XRS is not functioning.   If possible, the assessing Investigator /medically qualified 
designee should contact the Medical Monitor or designee before breaking the mask.  
When the masked treatment code is broken, th e date and time of unmasking, name of person 
doing the unmasking, and the reason for unmasking must be fully documented in the source 
documentation.  
3.3 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The prospective, randomized, double -mask ed study with a  sham IVT injection control group is 
an acceptable design for the evaluation of comparative efficacy and safety of two doses of 
EYP -1901.  
The two doses (2060 µg and 3090 µg)  chosen for EYP -1901 were based on the safety profile 
through Week 36 in the ongoing Phase  1 DAVIO study  (see details in Section 1.5 ). 
3.4 Duration of Study  
Total study participation will be approximately 52 weeks  (including the Screening period ).  After 
the initial Screening Visit, subjects may have between 5 and 30 days to be enrolled, at which 
point the study treatments /control  will be  administered on Day 1, if the eligibility criteria are still 
met.  Subjects who require a longer period between initial screening and Day 1 will be 
re-screened prior to entry into the study.  After Day 1 study treatment dosing , the follow -up 
period will be through 48 weeks  (with  visit windows of ± 7 days starting at Week  4).  Eligible 
subjects who are enrolled in this study will be seen for the scheduled study visits over 
approximately 12 months depending on the time between Day  1 and the final study visit.  Screen

 failures will b e recorded along with the reason(s) for not meeting the eligibility criteria.   Study 
completion is achieved at the Week 48 visit (End of Study Visit ). 
3.5 Recording of Injection Procedure  
The injection procedure of EYP -1901 or sham  may be photographed or video -recorded 
according to the site’s standard procedures.  Images and/or video will be provided to the Sponsor 
who may distribute them to other participating sites or other appropriate parties.  Subject  
identifying information must be redacted from all images and video prior to distribution.  
4 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
Three treatment groups of  up to  20 subjects each  will be enrolled to assess  the efficacy  and safety 
of 2060 µg or 3090 µg EYP -1901 intravitreal insert compared to sham  IVT injecti on. 
Subjects will be enrolled in the study only if they meet all the following eligibility criteria ; 
continued eligibility  will be assessed again at treatment randomization on Day 1 . The 
Investigator will exercise medical and scientific judgement in decidi ng whether a laboratory 
finding, or other assessment should be reassessed within the Screening Period. Subjects that do 
not meet all the requirements as outlined in the eligibility criteria (screen failures), may be 
rescreened at the discretion of the Inve stigator.

4.3 Pregnancy and Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must be practicing and willing to continue using a highly 
effective method of birth control during the course of the study, such as:  oral contraceptive pill 
(eg, Ortho Tri -Cyclen®); injection ( eg, Depo Provera®); implant ( eg, Norplant®); patch 
(eg, Ortho Evra Patch®); vaginal ring (eg, NuvaRing®); intrauterine coil ( eg, Mirena® coil); 
intrauterine device (IUD)  with or without hormones ; a barrier method ( eg, latex condom, 
diaphragm, or cap) used with an additional form of contraception  (ie, two methods  [eg, 
sponge, spermicide, hormonal c ontraceptive pill, or injection]) ; or complete a bstinence .  A 
female is considered to be of childbearing potential UNLESS she is post-menopausal (no menses 
for two consecutive years) or without a uterus and/or both ovaries . 
Before enrolling a woman of childbearing potential, Investigators must review with the subject 
the following:  
• Pregnancy prevention information  
• Risks to unborn child(ren)  
• Risks if currently nursing  
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  (or if complete abstinence is being followed)  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy

 For s ubjects who become pregnan t during the study positive urine pregnancy results will be 
confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.   Based on the anti -VEGF mechanism of action of 
EYP -1901 , the study treatments may pose a risk to human embryofetal development.  Subjects 
should continue parti cipation in the study at the discretion of the Investigator  and only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Subjects should be instructed to notify 
the Investigator  if it is determined after completion of the study that they b ecame pregnant while 
participating in the study.  However, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to pursue the follow -
up.  Whenever possible, a pregnancy should be followed to term, any premature terminations of 
pregnancy should be reported, and the stat us of the mother and the child should be reported to 
the Medical Monitor after delivery.  
Subjects who are not of childbearing potential meeting one or both of the following criteria will 
not be required to be tested for pregnancy or use contraception:  
• Amen orrheic for >2 years without a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy and a FSH 
value in the postmenopausal range upon pre -trial (screening) evaluation . 
• Post-hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy , or tubal ligation.   Tubal ligation must be 
confirmed with m edical records of the actual procedure.  
4.4 Study Termination  Criteria  
Each s ubject  will be informed that they are free to  
 Monitor, or the Medical Monitor 
may exercise his or her medical judgment to terminate a subject ’s participation in the study if it 
is in the best interest of the subject . 
If a subject withdraws from the study during the fo llow-up period, the Investigator  should make 
every effort to have the subject  return to the clinic for the end of study safety evaluations.  
Medical Monitoring for this study will be conducted by:  
, MD  
 and  
EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
480 Pleasant Street, Suite B300  
Watertown, MA 02472 USA  
Cell:   
 
The Sponsor  reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Every effort should be made to 
collect all data required by the protocol during or following the subject ’s Early Termination Visit . 
In cases of early termination, every effort should be made to compl ete the case report forms and 
report the results as thoroughly as possible.  A termination electronic case report form (eCRF) 
page should be completed for every subject who received study treatment whether or not the 
subject completed the study.  The reaso n for any early termination from the study should be 
indicated on this form.  The primary reason for a subject’s early termination should be selected 
from the following standard categories:

 Adverse Event (AE):   Clinical or laboratory events occurred that i n the medical judgment of the 
Investigator  for the best interest of the subject are grounds for discontinuation.  This includes 
serious AEs (SAEs) and non -serious AEs regardless of the relationship to study drug s. 
Subjects who are withdrawn due to AEs must  be followed until there is either:  
• Resolution  
• Stabilization or severity to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Grade 1/mild  
• Returned to baseline status  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• The event is otherwise explained by the Investigator  
Death:   The subject died during the study.  
Withdrawal of Consent:   The subject desired to withdraw from further participation in the study 
in the absence of a medical need to withdraw as determined by the Investigato r.  If the subject 
gave a reason for this desire, this should be recorded.  
Major Protocol Violation:   There was failure to meet the protocol entry criteria or the subject 
failed to adhere to the protocol requirements or received prohibited medication ( eg, subject 
failure to follow instructions, or inability to complete study assessments).  The violation 
necessitated premature termination from the study.  
Other:   The subject was terminated for a reason other than those listed above, such as termination 
of stu dy by the Sponsor or a regulatory authority.  The Investigator  must specify the reason.  
5 STUDY PROCEDURES  
To ensure the health of both eyes, observations of both the study eye and non -study (fellow) eye 
should be made at all visits  as described in the Sched ule of Study Procedures and Assessments 
(Table  5–1) unless otherwise indicated . 
BCVA by ETDRS:   The equipment and procedures necessary  for testing BCVA are presented in 
Appendix 1 .  Visual acuity is always tested with the subject’s best correction and should be 
measured prior to pupil dilation and slit lamp biomicroscopy exami nation or any drops or 
ointments are used.   BCVA by ETDRS will be measured at every study visit ( Table  5–1).  Visual 
acuity testing in this study is r equired at a distance of 4 meters, and for subjects with reduced 
vision at 1 meter.  Each site should have at least one certified refractionist available for the use of 
ETDRS charts.  An ETDRS -certified refractionist should perform all protocol refraction and 
BCVA measurements required by the protocol.  
Slit lamp Biomicroscopy :  Anterior chamber evaluation will be conducted using a slit beam of 
1 mm height and 1  mm width with maximum luminance through the highest powered lens using 
the Investigator’s standard slit lamp equipment and procedure.  This procedure will be the same 
for all subject s observed at the Investigator’s site.  Ocular signs assessments , includin g vitreous 
haze, the presence of anterior chamber cells,  and will be scored  according to the scale s and 
conventions  presented in Appendix 2.  Ocular examinations will be done at the study visits  noted 
in (Table  5–1).

Protocol EYP -1901 -204 (Version 3.0)   
 
31 March 2023 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 65 
   
 Dilated Ophthalmoscopy :  Will be performed according to the Investigator’s preferred 
procedure.  This procedure will be the same for all subjects observed at the Investigator’s site  
(Appendix 2 ).  Ocular examinations will be done at the study visits note d in ( Table  5–1). 
Intraocular Pressure /Tonometry:   IOP will be measured as described in Appendix 2  at the 
study visits noted in ( Table  5–1). 
Wide -Field Fluorescein Angiography  and Color Fundus Photography :  A study -certified 
photographer will take mydriatic stereoscopic color photographs and a fluorescein angiogram of 
both eyes according to the standardized procedures described in the Study Manual.  Photography 
must be performed after testing visual acuity if these procedures are performed  on the same day.  
FA/CFP will be done at the study visits noted in ( Table  5–1). 
ETDRS -DRSS:   The CFP images will be assessed by the CRC to determine the ETDRS -DRSS 
score  on 4-widefield digital stereoscopic fundus photography for study eligibility (specifically 
Inclusion Criteri on #2) and for the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, percentage of subjects 
improving ≥2 steps from baseline in the DRSS score at Week 36 in each dose level vs. sham) .  
The DRSS may be used to describe overall retinopathy  severity as well as the change in severity 
over time.  Severity ranges from level 10 (DR absent) to level 85 (advanced proliferative DR: 
posterior fundus obscured, or center of macula detached).  Here, DRSS describes severity level 
47 (moderately severe N PDR) and level 53 (severe NPDR) at Week 36 from baseline.  
SD-OCT and SD-OCTA Assessments:   Spectral -domain – optical coherence tomography 
assessments of both eyes will be taken by a study -certified OCT technician according to the 
standardized procedures described in the Study Manual.  Because the eye must be dilated for 
OCT, it must be performed after testing visual acuity if these procedures are perfor med on the 
same day.   SD-OCT and SD-OCTA (at pre-specified  study sites where equipment is available) 
testing will be done at the study visits noted in ( Table  5–1).  Please note that  either SD-OCTA or 
swept -source – optical coherence tomography angiography (SS -OCTA) imaging could be 
collected in this study . 
Ocular and Non -ocular TEAEs:   Subjects will be queried regarding ocular and nonocular AEs , 
SAEs , and changes in their general health, concomitant medications or concurrent procedures . 
Both elicited and volunteered  reports will be recorded.   
5.1 Measurements and Evaluations by Visit  
The schedule of study procedures and assessments by visit is presented in Table  5–1.  Starting at 
Week 4, s tudy visits should be conducted within ± 7 days for all scheduled visits .

6 STUDY INTERVENTION S 
6.1 Study Intervention  Identification and Description  
EYP -1901 intravitreal insert  is a bioerod ible, sterile , sustained -release drug delivery system that 
is designed to release microgram levels of vorolanib into the ocular vitreous chamber for the 
treatment of NPDR .  The intravitreal inse rt formulation design is based on the Durasert® 
technology that allows EYP -1901 to exhibit the following characteristics:  
• Bioerodible properties  
• Sustained -release kinetics  
• Prolonged duration of release (not less than 9 months)  
• High  drug loading  
• Administration in an office setting through an intravitreal needle injection  
6.1.1 EYP -1901 Composition

6.1.2 EYP -1901 /Sham Applicator  Packaging  
EYP -1901 is packaged at EyePoint Pharmaceuticals.  EYP -1901  loaded applicator s (and sham 
applicators ) are placed inside a foil chevron pouch  and sealed .  The sealed foil pouch is then 
placed inside a Tyvek® chevron pouch .  The final pouch  is sent for terminal sterilization.  Upon 
completion of sterilization, each pouch is labeled with a “Sterile” label, and then placed into a 
labeled box.  
6.2 Study Drug  Administration  
6.2.1 EYP -1901  Intravitreal Insert  
Each EYP -1901 insert has been designed to deliv er vorolanib into the vitreous humor for at least 
9 months .  EYP -1901 will be administered to the study eye by a single injection through the pars 
plana using a pre -loaded applicator with a 22 -gauge needle.  
6.2.2 EYP -1901 Injection Procedure  
For a detailed description of the EYP -1901 injection procedure, please refer to the EYP -1901 
Instructions for Use (IFU) document.  
6.3 Storage and Dispensing of Study Drug s 
EYP -1901 must be stored in a secure place and at controlled room temperature (20°C to 
25°C/68° F to 77°F) and in the original container to protect the product from light.  Temperature 
excursions between 15°C to 30°C/59°F to 86°F are acceptable.  
The Investigator has the overall responsibility of ensuring that EYP -1901 is stored in a safe 
location wit h limited -access under the specified storage conditions.  Limited responsibility may 
be delegated to a pharmacy representative; however, this delegation must be documented.  
6.4 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring adequate accountab ility of all used and unused 
EYP -1901.  While the Investigator  may delegate components of drug accountability tasks to 
EYP -1901 (V orolanib  Intravitreal  Insert)   EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol EYP -1901 -204 (V ersion 3.0)

 documented designee(s) ( eg, pharmacist or staff designee), the ultimate responsibility for drug 
control and accountability resides with the Investigator .  This includes acknowledgment of 
receipt of each shipment (quantity and condition), maintenance of subject dispensing records an d 
returned (as required) documentation.  Dispensing records will document quantities received 
from the Sponsor (or designee) and quantities dispensed to subjects, including treatment 
kit/package number, date dispensed, subject identification number, subjec t initials, and the 
initials of the person dispensing drug will be recorded on the drug accountability log.  
During study initiation, the study monitor (Clinical Research Associate, CRA) will evaluate and 
obtain a copy of each site’s written standard operat ing pro cedure for study drug 
disposal/ destruction or return to ensure that it complies with Sponsor requirements if supplies 
will not be returned.  
An inspection for inventory and accounting purposes, and the assurance of proper storage, will 
also be conduc ted during monitoring visits.  Any significant accounting or storage discrepancy 
will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor and a plan for resolution will be documented.  After 
the monitor has checked and verified drug accountability during interim site visits and at the end 
of the study, any expired, partially -used, and used product should be handled according to the 
Sponsor’s instructions ( ie, returned or destroyed).  
6.5 Anaphyla xis, Overdose , and Dose Modification  
Vorolanib and the inactive ingredients of EYP -1901 are not known to cause hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
Since EYP -1901 is delivered through a pre -loaded  applicator , the risk of accidental overdose is 
minimal.  Refer to the current IB for information on potential risks associated with EYP -1901.  
Dose  modification is not applicable since EYP -1901 is for single -delivery only.  
Note:   Hypersensitivity reactions to iodine and/or fluorescein used during ocular assessments are 
also possible.  
Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include:  
• Localized or genera lized itching  
• Facial flushing, generalized flushing  
• Shortness of breath, wheezing  
• Uneasiness and agitation  
• Local edema followed by facial edema  
• Light-headedness/dizziness  
• Chest tightness  
• Tachycardia  
• Hypotension  
• Rigors (chills)

 If anaphylaxis occurs, the subject should be managed according to standard cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) procedures, as necessary.  The subject may require the following treatment:  
• Epinephrine (adrenaline) to reduce the allergic response  
• Oxygen  
• Intravenous antihistamines and c ortisone to reduce airway inflammation and improve 
breathing  
• A beta -agonist (such as albuterol) to relieve breathing symptoms  
6.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
6.6.1 Prior Medications  
Prior medications are defined as all prescription, vaccinations, supplements, herbal therapies, any 
prohibited medications, and over -the-counter (OTC) medications taken within the 30 days 
(whether continuing or not) prior to Day 1 with the exceptio n of pre vious treatments for NPDR , 
both approved and investigational products .  Previous treatments for NPDR  are to be captured 
for the 12 months prior to Screening , and any historical anti -VEGF injections . 
All prior medications must be documented on the concomita nt medications eCRF.  
6.6.2 Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and OTC  concomitant medications used concurrently (from the Screening Visit  
to Week  48 or Early Termination ) must be documented on the concomitant medication eCRF.  
Information on the concomitant  medication eCRF includes the name of the medication/therapy, 
dose, frequency, route, dates of use, and indication for use.  Subjects should be instructed not to 
take any medication including OTC products, without first consulting with the Investigator .  Any 
AE(s) that result(s) from taking a concomitant medication following the first study dose should 
be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
6.6.3 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Any medications or therapies that the subject is using during the study period and that would 
preclude eligibility as indicated in the Exclusion Criteria ( Section 4.2 ), are prohibited 
concomitant medications.  In addition, any medication or therapies initiated during the study 
period that, in the Investigator ’s judgment, could potentially confound the safety and preliminary 
efficacy o f EYP -1901 would also be considered prohibited concomitant medications.  
All prohibited concomitant medications used concurrently (from Day 1 to Week 48 or Early 
Termination ) must be documented on the concomitant medication eCRF  
6.6.4 Permitted Medication and Pro cedures  
Following the intravitreal injection s of either dose of the EYP -1901 insert  (2060  µg or 3090  µg) 
on Day 1 , treatment of the fellow eye will be at the discretion of the Investigator.  Any fellow eye 
therapy should be documented in concomitant meds d uring the study if required.  
After Day 1 , all subjects , regardless of treatment assignment, may receive approved anti -VEGF 
supplemental therapy or other  standard of care  therapy if they have ocular diabetic complications

 warranting intervention.   All ocula r diabetic complications in the study eye will be managed in 
accordance with each study center’s standard of care  and must be documented as an AE.  
During the study, participants who develop ocular diabetic complications in the study eye 
requiring anti -VEGF  treatment per standard of care  may be administered therapy as required .  If 
needed, the study centers will provide their own supply of FDA -approved anti -VEGF therapy 
and submit the associated costs for reimbursement.  The number of anti -VEGF injections 
received, the name of the product being injected, and the timing of all inje ctions must be  
recorded in the source documents and eCRF.  
Participants who develop ocular diabetic complications requiring PRP or retinal laser standard of 
care must have the time of laser treatment recorded in the source documents and eCRF.  
Participants w ho develop ocular diabetic complications requiring surgical intervention standard 
of care  (eg, pneumatic retinopexy, cryopexy, scleral buckle) must have the type of intervention 
and the time of intervention recorded in the source documents and eCRF.  
In this case, the Investigator is required to contact the Medical Monitor prior to administering 
treatment if feasible.  
7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety assessments will include the incidence and severity of TEAEs reported after Screening , 
clinical laboratory eval uations (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), safety 
data collected from ocular examinations and IOP measurements, vital sign measurements,  ECGs,  
and the use of concomitant medications.  
Medical safety reviews will be conducted by the Sponsor for all TEAEs and other relevant 
information related to safety on an ongoing basis and throughout the duration of the study 
according to the study Safety Management Plan.  
7.1 Adverse Events  
The following are specific definitions of terms guided by the International Co uncil for  
Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH E2 ), 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , and the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
that apply to the following sections.  The severity of A Es will be graded by CTCAE v ersion 5 or 
higher  (Appendix 4 ). 
Definition of Adverse Event:  
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational or 
marketed (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
product.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use of a  
medicinal  product, whether or not considered related to the product.  
AEs may also include pre - or post -treatment complications tha t occur as a result of 
protocol -specified procedures ( eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture, del ivery procedure, 
etc.).  Pre -existing conditions that increase in severity or change in nature during (or as a 
consequence of use of a medicinal product) the study will also be considered AEs.  
EYP -1901 (V orolanib  Intravitreal  Insert)   EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol EYP -1901 -204 (V ersion 3.0)   
 
31 March 2023 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 65 
   
 An AE Will Not Include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) for 
events that led to the procedure  
• Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior to 
the Screening Visit , unless they worsen during the study  
• Situations where an AE  or untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( eg, 
hospitalization for elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions)  
Associated with the Use of the Drug (Causality):  
There is a reasonable possibility that the eve nt may have been caused by the study medicinal 
product  (and/or the administration procedure s). 
Unexpected Adverse Event:  
Any event that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current version of the IB ; 
or in the product labeling  for marketed products .  For example, if the IB or product labeling  
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis, then an event of hepatic necrosis would be 
considered unexpected by the virtue of the greater severity.  The Sponsor or designee will 
determine AE expectedness.  
7.1.1 Ocular Adverse Events  
The following ocular events will be considered AEs for the purposes of this study:  
• Decrease in BCVA of ≥15 letters or ≥3 lines from the previous BCVA measurement  
• Moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) ocular finding s compared to the last ocular 
examination  
• Worsening of >2 steps in anterior chamber cell count or vitreous haze compared to the 
last ocular examination  
• Increase in IOP of >10 mmHg at two visits at least 1 week apart or an increase in IOP to 
>25 mmHg  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE that results in one of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• Is life -threatening (the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an ev ent which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more intense).  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons for 
any length of time), or prolongs existing hospitalization.  
• Results in a persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
EYP -1901 (V orolanib  Intravitreal  Insert)   EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol EYP -1901 -204 (V ersion 3.0)   
 
31 March 2023 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 65 
   
 • Congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
treatment).  
• Other important medical event.  Medical and scien tific judgment should be exercised in 
determining whether an event is an important medical event.  An important medical event 
may not be immediately life -threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization but 
required medical intervention in order to pr event a SAE outcome.  However, if it is 
determined that the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other SAE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported 
as serious.  Examples of such events are i ntensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The following hospitalizations will not be considered SAEs : 
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department for <24 hours that does not 
result in in -patient admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a 
“life -threatening event”).  
• Elective surgery or planned surgery prior to signing th e ICF.  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure.  
• Routine health assessments requiring admission for Baseline /trending of health status ( eg, 
routine colonoscopy).  
• Medical/surgical admission for a purpose other than healthcare purp oses and was planned 
prior to entry into the study (appropriate documentation is required in these cases).  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and/or requires no medical/surgical intervention ( eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, care -giver respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
• Progressive disease ( NPDR ) is expected and will not be considered an SAE.  
Clarification of SAEs : 
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  
• All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs.   If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
• “In-patient hospitalization” means the subject has been form ally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not 
include presentation to, and/or care within, an emergency department.  
• The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the ev ent based on signs, 
symptoms , and/or other clinical information.  
Note:   Progressive disease should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  However, because it is expected 
in the study population, it will not be considered as an SAE.

 7.1.3 Sight -Threatening Ocular Events Defined as SAEs in This Study  
In addition to the standard SAE categories  described above, this study defines these additional 
ocular events as SAEs:  
• An AE that causes a decrease in visual acuity of ≥30 letters or ≥6 lines from the most 
recent previous measurement of visual acuity, lasting more than 1 hour.  
• An AE that causes a decrease in visual acuity to light perception or worse, lasting more 
than 1 hour.  
• An AE that requires surgical intervention ( eg, conventional surgery, vitreous tap , or 
biopsy with intravitreal injection of anti -infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy with  gas) 
to prevent permanent loss of sight.  
• An AE that is associated with severe intraocular inflammation ( ie, 4+ anterior chamber 
cell score  or 4+ vitreous haze score ). 
• Two consecutive IOP measurements of ≥30 mmHg taken at least 72 hours apart when a 
subjec t is already being treated with two IOP -lowering medications.  
• An IOP <6 mmHg requiring medical intervention.  
• An AE that in the opinion of the Investigator  requires medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent permanent loss of sight.  
The Investigator  must e mploy all necessary therapeutic measures to resolve the SAE.  Any 
medications or therapies used to treat the SAE must be recorded in the concomitant medication 
eCRF.  
7.1.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered an A E if it:  
• Results in the initiation or change of an intervention ( eg, increased dose of medication), 
based on medical evaluation ( eg, packed red cells for low hemoglobin).  
• Results in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment fulf ills the 
definitions of an AE.  
• Increases in severity compared to baseline.  
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part 
of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormali ty considered 
to constitute an AE should be reported on the AE eCRF.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator  to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute an 
AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  
All laboratory AEs should be repeated and reassessed by the Investigator  to track resolution and 
especially to confirm if they meet the definition of serious.  If serious, they will be reported as 
SAEs.  
The Investigator  or a licensed designee must review all laboratory results in a  timely manner as 
demonstrated by signature/date.

 7.1.5 Adverse Event Severity and Relationship  
Adverse event severity is defined as a qualitative assessment of the intensity of an AE as 
determined by the Investigator .  The assessment of severity is made irrespe ctive of the 
relationship or serio usness of the event to EYP -1901, sham , or the injection device.  
In the absence of an assigned severity per the CTCAE v ersion 5.0 or higher  (Appendix 4 ) 
grading  criteria, the Investigator will grade AEs according to the following severity criteria:  
Mild/Grade 1:  The event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily 
activities; usually does not require intervention.  
Moderate/Grade 2:  The event may be of sufficient severity to make subject 
uncomfortable; performance of daily activities may be influenced; 
intervention may be needed.  
Severe/Grade 3:  The event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with 
daily activities; subject may not be able to  continue in the study; 
treatment or other intervention usually required.  
Life- or Sight -Threatening/Grade 4:  
The event requires urgent intervention to preserve life and/or 
permanent loss of vision.  
Death/Grade 5 : The event resulted in the subject’s death . 
Causality/Relationship to Study Treatment  
The relationship of study treatment  (ie, EYP -1901  or sham ), the applicator , or the injection 
procedure , to each AE must be determined by the Investigator according to the following:  
Not Related:  Evidence indicates no plausible direct relationship to the study  
treatment, device , or procedure, or there is a reasonable causal 
relationship between non -study  product, concurrent disease, or 
circumstance and the AE; and/or a causal relationship is consider ed 
biologically implausible . 
Possibly Related:  There is  a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
treatment, device , or procedure and the AE.  There may or may not 
be a clinically -plausible temporal sequence between the onset of the 
AE and study t reatment , device , or procedure; the AE is not 
reasonably supported by other conditions . 
Probably Related:  The study treatment , device , or procedure and AE occurrence are 
reasonably related in time; a clinically -plausible temporal sequence  
between the onset  of the AE and study treatment, device , or 
procedure is likely; based upon the Investigator’s clinical 
experience, the association of the AE with study treatment , device , 
or procedure is likely; all other potential causes have been ruled 
out. 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the seque nce study treatment, device , or procedure is 
determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related for the purposes 
of expedited regulatory reporting.

 7.1.6 Recording of Adverse Events  
Medical conditions or diseases present before a sub ject starts study treatment are only considered 
AEs if they worsen after the start of the study treatment.  
Adverse events may be spontaneously reported or elicited at each study visit through open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject.   To prevent reporting bias, subjects should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.  
The Investigator will record all AEs in the eCRF.  Where a diagnosis is possible, it is preferable 
to report the diagnosis rather than a se ries of terms (signs/symptoms) relating to the diagnosis.  If 
a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual symptoms and signs should be recorded.  
The following information must be captured for all AEs:  
• Onset and end date  
• Severity  
• Seriousness  
• Relationship to EYP -1901 , sham , the injection device, or the procedure  
• Action taken  
• Any treatment required  
• Outcome  
If treatment for the AE was administered, it should be recorded on the appropriate concomitant 
medication/procedure eCRF page.  Each distinct AE should be recorded separately.  
7.1.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
All subjects enrolled in the study will be evaluated for AEs, which will be collected from the 
time the ICF is signed until study completion ( Table  5–1). 
All AEs will be evaluated from onset until resolution or stabilization, whichever is first.  Adverse 
events that continue after the subject’s discontinuation or completion of the study will be 
followed until their medical outcomes are determined or until no further change in the condition 
is expected.  The event and outcome will be reported in writing by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor.  The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC)  with any additional requested information, notably for reported deaths.  
7.1.7.1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s 
All SAEs, regardless of cause(s) or relationship to study drug s, must be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first 
awareness using the study’s designated SAE /SADR (Serious Adverse Drug Reaction)  Report 
Form.  
Minimal information to be provided on the SAE /SADR  Report Form includ es: 
• Protocol number  
• Site and Investigator identifiers

 • Subject number  
• Brief description of the event(s)  
• Onset date of the event  
• Outcome of the event as of the date of report, if known  
• Resolution date and time, if the event(s) resolved  
• Any medication adminis tered to treat the event  
• Investigator’s assessment of the causal relationship of the SAE to the study medicinal 
product  
• Additional and follow -up information as requested by Sponsor or its designee  
SAEs must be reported using the study’s designated SAE /SADR  Report Form and sent to:  
   
  
The Investigator will also compile other relevant documentation  with urgent priority  (eg, copies 
of test results, hospital discharge summary, autopsy report, etc.) , and send this information to the 
Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designee).  
The FDA and all participating Investigators shall be notified by a written Investigational New 
Drug Application (IND) safety report of any AE associated with the use of the investigational 
product  that is both serious and unexpected no later than 15 calendar days from the Sponsor’s 
awareness date of the event.  An SAE is considered to be associated with the use of the 
investigational product if the relationship between the SAE and the invest igational product is 
classified by the Investigator as “possibly related” or “probably related” ( ie, suspected, 
unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]) .  Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening SAE 
associated with the use of the investigational produ ct will be reported to the FDA by the Sponsor 
within 7 calendar days.  
The IRB/EC should be notified of SAEs  as required in accordance with the local institutional 
policy.  
All Investigators participating in the study will be notified of unexpected SAEs dete rmined to be 
related to study treatment/injection procedure.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy that occurs during the study must be immediately reported to the Investigator who 
will immediately notify the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first awareness using the 
study’s designated Pregnancy Report Form.   This includes any pregnancy following maternal or 
paternal exposure to the study treatments . 
The pregnancy should be followed to term.   The outcome, including premature termination must 
also be reported to the Spo nsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness using 
the Pregnancy Report Form.   All live births must be followed for a minimum of 4 weeks or to the 
first well -baby visit.  All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontan eous 
abortions/miscarriages should be reported as SAEs.  Elective abortion procedures without 
complications should not be considered as AEs.

 If the Investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy occurring in any male subject’s partner during 
the male subject’s treatment with the assigned study  medicinal product, the Investigator must 
submit this information to the Sponsor on the Pregnancy Report Form.  
The Pregnancy Report Form should be sent to:  
   
  
Special Situations  
Notification must be made to the Sponsor or designee of any special situation which includes the 
following, regardless of any associated AE: 
• A medication error, defined as any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
admini stration of a medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider or 
subject . 
• Abuse, defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal or other 
product . 
• Misuse, defined as any intentional or inappropriate use of a me dicinal product that is not 
in accordance with the protocol instructions or local prescribing information . 
• An overdose, defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of a 
medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively whi ch is above the maximum 
recommended dose per protocol or in the product labeling.  In cases of a discrepancy in 
drug accountability, overdose will be determined only when it is clear that the subject 
received an excess dose(s).  
Special situations should be  reported on the study’s designated SAE/SADR Report Form except 
pregnancies for which there is a dedicated form.   If any special situation results in clinical 
sequela(ae)/ AE(s) , the event (s) must be recorded on the AE eCRF.  If the AE is serious, the SAE 
eCRF must be completed and a SAE /SADR  Report Form must be completed and submitted to 
the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first awareness.  
Special situations involving concomitant medication do not need to be reported on the 
SAE/SADR Report Form.  How ever, special situations involving concomitant medication that 
result in clinical sequelae/AEs should be reported on the AE eCRF.  In addition, any 
inappropriate use of prohibited concomitant medications should not be reported as “misuse” but

9 PHARMACOKINETICS  
Secondary endpoint s in this study  include  the evaluation of the systemic exposure to vorolanib 
and X -297, its main metabolite,  as measured through plasma.  Blood  samples will be collected at 
the visits noted in Table  5–1 for PK analysis of vorolanib and its main metabolite  concentrations.   
Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples to the designate d analytical testing 
laboratory will be conducted according to the procedures described in Appendix 3 . 
In the event the subject requires vitrectomy during the study, the unmasked Investigator  or 
designee will collect a vitreous sample and EYP -1901 implants (if applicable) to be sent to 
sponsor as described in Appendix 3 . 
10  ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
The primary objective of this study is to  assess the efficacy of EYP -1901 compared to sham 
treatment in the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR.  The primary endpoint of 
this study will be the percentage of subjects improving ≥2 steps from baseline in the DRSS score 
at Week 36 in each EYP -1901 dose level versus the sham  IVT injection group  in the study eye . 
The DRSS may be used to describe overall retinopathy severity as well as the change in severity 
over time.  Severity ranges from level 10 (DR absent) to level 85 (advanced proliferative DR: 
posterior fundus obscured, or center of macula detached).  Here, DRSS describes severity level 
47 (moderately severe NPDR) and level 53 (severe  NPDR) at Week 36 from baseline.  
Additional secondary endpoints include the following  in the study eye (unless otherwise 
specified) : 
• Percentage of subjects improving ≥2 steps from baseline in the DRSS score at 
Week s 24 and  48 in each dose level vs. sham.  
• Percentage of subjects improving ≥2 -steps or ≥3 -steps over time in DRSS from 
baseline.  
• Percentage of subjects worsening ≥2 -steps or ≥3 -steps over time in DRSS from 
baseline.

11  STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
Detailed methodology for statistical analyses of the data collected in this st udy will be 
documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be developed and maintained by the 
Sponsor . 
The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the 
primary endpoint definition and/or its analys is will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
All study data will be presented in by -subject listings.  
11.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The objectives of the study are to provide efficacy and safety data in a prospective, randomized, 
double -masked, contro lled trial.  However, the study is not formally powered to perform 
statistical hypothesis testing between each EYP -1901 arm versus sham  IVT injection.  
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized at 1:1:1 ratio to each of three treatment arms 
(20 per trea tment arm).  
11.2 Analysis Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study treatment (EYP -1901  or sham ).  The safety summaries will be based on the ITT 
population.  The subjects will be summarized based on the treatments that they actually receive.  
The efficacy population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
treatment (EYP -1901  or sham ) and continue until at least Week 36 (ie, have had the primary 
endpoint assessed).

Sponsor or its designee prior to release of investigat ional supplies to the study site.  The approval 
letter must refer to the specific protocol and informed consent form.  The study site must 
maintain an accurate and complete record of all reports, documents , and other submissions made 
to the IRB/EC concerni ng this protocol.  A list of the IRB/EC members, their titles or 
occupations, and their institutional affiliation, or an IRB/EC assurance number must be provided 
to the Sponsor or its designee prior to release of study supplies.  
FDA/relevant health authori ty regulations require that all advertisements for subject recruitment 
be approved by an IRB/EC prior to implementation.  The complete text and format must be 
submitted to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to IRB/EC submission.  
The Investigator is  responsible for notifying the IRB/EC of any SAEs.  A copy of the notification 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor or its designee.  
Status reports must be submitted to the IRB/EC at least once a year (or more frequently as 
required by the IRB/EC) and the IRB/ EC must be notified of study completion or termination.  
A final report must be provided to the IRB/EC and the Sponsor within 6  months of study 
completion or termination.  This report should include:  any protocol deviations, the number of 
subjects evaluat ed, the number of subjects who withdrew or were withdrawn and the reasons for 
withdrawal, any significant AEs , and the Investigator’s summation of the study.  
12.3 Informed Consent Process  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to inform each subject, prio r to the screening 
evaluation, of the purpose of this clinical trial, including possible risks and benefits and 
document the informed consent process in the subject’s chart.  Prior to entry into the study or 
initiation of any study -related procedures, the subject  must read, sign and date the IRB/EC 
approved ICF.  The person executing the consent must also sign and date the final consent form 
page.  One or two signed originals of the ICF will be prepared, in accordance with applicable 
local requirements.  A signed original copy will be retained with the subject records, and either a 
copy of the signed original or the other signed original of the ICF will be given to the subject , in 
accordance with applicable local requirements.  
12.4 Source Documentation

of administration, and dosage).  
• All relevant observations and data on the condition of the subject throughout the stud y. 
• The date when subject exited the study and a notation as whether the subject comp leted 
the study or was discontinued, including the reason for discontinuation.  
Upon request, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor with any required background data fro m 
the study documentation or clinic records.   This is particularly important when source documents 
are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected.   In case there are issues or 
governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected.  
12.5 Electronic Case Report Forms  
All study data must be incorporated in the corresponding eCRFs which are designed for 
computer processing and anal ysis.  The Investigator will be responsible for recording all data in 
the eCRFs and must ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported to the Sponsor in the eCRF and in all required reports.  
Data from clinical laborator y reports, etc., will be incorporated into the eCRFs either by direct 
transcription into appropriate eCRF pages or by inclusion of photocopies of these reports with 
printouts of the appropriate eCRF pages and stored in the site’s Study Binder.  
If correctio ns are made following official final review and sign -off by the Investigator, the 
Investigator must be made aware of the changes and provide written acknowledgement.

 12.6 Retention of Study Records  
GCP regulations require that the Investigator retain all documentation related to this clinical trial 
for a period of 2 years after the approval of the NDA in the US (o r Product License outside the 
US) for this drug or 2 years after the withdrawal of the IND.  These records include the protocol 
and copies of all documents submitted to the Sponsor  or to government authorities, subject 
records (including signed ICFs, subje ct charts, eCRFs, and other source documents), IRB/EC 
approvals and correspondence, records of drug accountability, and all study communications, 
whether written, telephonic, or electronic.  None of the required documents will be destroyed or 
transferred t o the control of another party without the written approval of the Sponsor.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee the archiving requirement at the site for any or all of the 
documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Spon sor to 
store these in a sealed container outside of the study site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.   When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the subject, appropriate copies will be made for storing outside of the study site.  
12.7 Monitoring the Study and Data Quality Assurance  
Representatives of the Sponsor (or designees) will contact the  Investigator and his/her staff prior 
to the start of the trial to review the procedures to be followed in conducting the study and 
recording the findings, and to confirm the facility’s readiness to conduct the trial.  
It will be the monitor’s responsibilit y to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of 
the data being entered on them.  The monitor must have access to all study related reports and 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The Investigator (or designee) must agree to 
cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these 
monitoring visits are resolved and agree to provide missing information and g rant access to all 
study documentation.  
Every attempt must be made to follow the protocol, obtain and record all data requested for each 
subject at the specified times.   However, ethical reasons may warrant the failure to obtain and 
record certain data or to record data at the times specified.   If data is not recorded per protocol, 
the reasons must be clearly documented on the eCRF/records.  
Accurate and reliable data collection will be ensured by the verification of the eCRFs against the 
Investigator’s reco rds by the monitor (source documentation verification).  Collected data will be 
entered into a computer database and subject to electronic and manual quality assurance 
procedures.  
The study data must be verifiable with the source data , which  requires acces s to all original 
recordings, laboratory reports, product accountability records, including access to the subject 
electronic medical record , and source data must be made available for all study data.   Subjects 
must also allow access to their medical record s.  They will be informed of this and must consent 
to permission by providing their signature on the ICF prior to enrollment.  
Representatives of the Sponsor (or designees) may audit the study periodically to ensure that all 
records are correct and complete .  The verification of the eCRF data must be by direct inspection 
of source documents.

 Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure will be assessed by applanation tonometry (preferably, Goldmann) and 
should b e measured before the  slit lamp examination has been completed at all study visit s and at 
the Day 1 visit , it should be measured at 10 (+/- 5) and 60 (+/- 10) minutes following the 
intravitreal injection  (EYP -1901 or sham IVT injection ).  If IOP measurements at any study time 
point s are ≥30 mmHg, two additional measurements should be performed and IOP recorded as a 
mean of three measurements per eye .  All reasonable efforts should be made to have the same 
examiner obtain all IOP measurement for a given subject.  Measurement should be performed 
before dilated ophthalmoscopy.

TITLE A randomized, 24-week treatment double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study 
of dupilumab 300 mg every other week, in patients with bilateral nasal polyposis on a background therapy with intranasal corticosteroids 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 Primary objective: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) compared to 
placebo on a background of mometasone fur oate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing 
nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) seve rity and endoscopic nasal polyp score 
(NPS) in patients with bilateral nasal polyposis (NP). In addition for Japan, 
reduction in computed tomography (CT) scan opacification of the sinuses will be 
also a coprimary objective. 
Secondary objectives: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in  improving total symptom score (TSS). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the 
sinuses (for Japan, this is part of the primary objective) 
• To evaluate the ability of dupilumab to reduce the proportion of patients who require treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) or surgery for NP. 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with prior surgery and comorbid asthma (including nonstero idal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] 
Exacerbated Respiratory Disease [NERD]). 
• To evaluate the residual effect of dupilumab through the 24-week follow-up period. 
• To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP.  
• To evaluate functional dupilumab concentrations (systemic exposure) and 
incidence of treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (ADA). 
Exploratory objectives: 
• To explore the effects of dupilumab on nasal microbiome, total and allergen-
specific immunoglobulin Es (IgEs) in  blood, and urinary leukotriene E4 and a 
metabolite of prostaglandin D2 (PGDM). 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on healthcare resource utilization. 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on SNOT-22 items: ‘decreased sense of smell/taste’, 'difficulty falling asleep,' 'wake up at night,' 'lack of a good night's 
sleep,' 'wake up tired,' 'fatigue,' and 'reduced productivity’. 
• To assess the effect of dupilumab in improving sense of taste.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 STUDY DESIGN General design 
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-b lind, Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study comparing the efficacy of dupilumab to placebo, in patients with bilateral NP on 
a background treatment with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). 
Study periods 
The clinical trial consists of 3 periods: Run-in period (4 weeks +/-3 days): All patients will enter a run-in period of 4 weeks receiving MFNS of 2 actuations 
(50 µg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 400 µg, starting at 
Visit 1 (V1), unless the patients are unable to tolerate or there is a specific regulatory 
requirement preventing use of this dose, in  which case they can stay on a lower dose 
regimen (200 µg once daily) of MFNS. 
Randomized treatment period (up to 24 weeks +/-3 days): 
Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatments: 
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) q2w.  
• Arm B: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w. 
All patients will continue on the stable dose of MF NS used during the run-in period except if 
dose is changed due to adverse event (AE). 
Rescue:  
During the study treatment period and off-treatm ent follow-up, based on clinical evaluation, 
in case of worsening of signs and/or sym ptoms requiring medical intervention, the 
Investigator may consider rescue treatment with:  
• Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in case of 
acute infection). 
• Short course OCS (prednisone or prednisolone). 
• Sino-nasal surgery for nasal polyps (based on previous observations, 8 weeks of 
IMP treatment it is recommended prior to surgery to allow onset of treatment 
effect) 
Patients receiving rescue treatment other than surgery during the study should continue on study drug unless the Investigator decides to withdraw the study treatment (see 
Section  8.2.2). Before starting treatment with SCS, patients should come to the study site for 
clinical assessments including endoscopy and PROs.  
For patients undergoing surgery for NP the Investigator may decide to continue IMP up to 
the time of surgery or end of treatment  (EOT), whichever date comes first (see 
Section  9.2.1.5 for details). At the time of surgery patients will be permanently discontinued 
from study treatment and assessed as soon as possible using the procedures normally 
planned for the EOT Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in 
Section  10.3.1 .  
Post treatment period (24 weeks +/-3 days): 
After completing 24 weeks of treatment with the investigational medi cinal product (IMP) (or 
following early discontinuation of IMP or di scontinuation from the study), patients will be 
instructed to: 
• Return to the study site for all the last scheduled study visits for evaluations of 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and ADA, physical examination, nasal peak inspiratory 
flow (NPIF), University of Pennsylvania sm ell identification test (UPSIT), NPS, CT

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: The sample size is chosen to enable an adequat e characterization of the efficacy between 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo with regard to the 2 coprimary endpoints, changes from 
baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24.  
The observed mean NC reduction of the dup ilumab group with weekly dosing (qw) in 
ACT12340 is 0.95 and the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To 
calculate the power, a conservative estimate  is used that assumes the placebo-adjusted NC 
reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% of the placebo-adjusted effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg qw. Thus, the mean NC reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w is then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 * (0.95 – 0.26) + 0.26 at Week 24. Assuming 
normal distribution of the change in NC, a common standard deviation (SD) of 1.03, which 
has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 120 patients per group, the study will have 95% power to detect an effect size of 
0.534 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus placebo.  
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 
1.85 and the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group is 0.30. Using the same conservative approach that assumes t he placebo-adjusted NPS reduction with the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w is 80% of the placebo-adjusted effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is then assumed 
to be 1.54 = 0.8 * (1.85 – 0.30) + 0.30. Assuming normal distribution of the change in NPS, 
a common SD of 2.11, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in 
ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 120 patients per group, the study will have 98% 
power to detect an effect size of 0.588 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus placebo. 
Therefore, with a sample size of 120 patients per group, the combined power of the two 
coprimary efficacy endpoints is at least 93% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group with

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the two endpoints. 
The observed mean LMK reduction of the dup ilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 
9.07 and the observed mean LMK reduction of the placebo group is 0.23. Using same 
conservative approach that assumes the pl acebo-adjusted LMK reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is 80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is then assumed to be 7.30 = 0.8*(9.07-0.23)+0.23. Assuming 
normal distribution of the change in LMK, a common standard deviation (SD) of 5.50, which 
has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout 
rate, with 120 patients per group, the study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 
1.285 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in LMK at Week 24 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group. 
With the same sample size of 120 patients per group, the combined power of the 
3 coprimary efficacy endpoints for Japan is at least 92% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
with alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the 3 endpoints. 
The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor 7.0. Randomization: 
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio to dupilumab 300 mg q2w or 
placebo. The randomization will be stratified based on asthma status, prior surgery, and 
country. 
Analysis population: 
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the randomized ITT 
population which includes all patients who have been allocated to a randomized treatment 
regardless of whether the treatment kit wa s used or not. The efficacy analyses will be 
conducted according to the treatment to which they were randomized. 
The analysis population for safety endpoints is defined as all patients exposed to study 
medication, regardless of the amount of treat ment administered. The safety analyses will be 
conducted according to the treatment patients actually received. The treatment emergent period is defined as the time from the first administration of study 
medication to Week 12 of the post treatment period. Coprimary efficacy variables: 
For all countries except Japan, the coprimary efficacy variables are: change from baseline in 
NC and in NPS at Week 24 assessed for dupilumab 300 mg q2w versus placebo. 
For Japan only, in addition to the 2 coprimar y endpoints above, the following will also be a 
coprimary endpoint: 
• Change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the 
LMK score at Week 24. 
The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for dupilumab versus placebo:  
• H0: No treatment difference between the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo. 
• H1: There is a treatment difference between the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo. 
Analysis of the coprimary efficacy variables: 
Each of the 2 coprimary efficacy endpoint s (3 coprimary endpoints for Japan) will be 
analyzed using a hybrid method of the wors t-observation carried forward (WOCF) and the 
multiple imputation (MI). With this approach,  for patients who undergo surgery for NP or 
receive SCS for any reason, data collected postsurgery or post-SCS will be set to missing, 
and the worst postbaseline value on or before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to

baseline will be used to impute). For patients who discontinue the treatment without being 
rescued by surgery or receiving SCS, an MI approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value, and this MI will use all patients who have not been rescued by surgery or 
receiving SCS at Week 24 and data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included 
in the analysis. Each of the imputed complete data will be analyzed by fitting an analysis of 
covariance model with the baseline covariate and factors for treatment, asthma status, prior 
surgery history, and regions. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data will be 
combined using Rubin’s rule. Descriptive st atistics including number of subjects mean, 
standard error, and least squares (LS) means will be provided. In addition, difference in LS 
means and the corresponding 95% confidence inte rvals (CI) will be provided along with the 
p-values. 
Analyses of key secondary efficacy endpoints 
Analysis of the change from baseline in TSS, UPSIT score, daily loss of smell assessment, 
LMK, and SNOT-22 scores at Week 24 for dupilumab 300 mg q2w versus placebo  
The change from baseline in TSS, SNOT-22, U PSIT, daily loss of smell and LMK at Week 
24 will be analyzed using the hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in the same fashion as 
for the coprimary endpoints. 
Analysis of proportion of patients receiving SCS and/or planned to undergo surgery for NP 
during the 24-week treatment period fo r dupilumab 300 mg q2w versus placebo  
Proportion of patients with first SCS rescue or surgery (actual or planned) for NP during the 
24-week treatment period will be derived and analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards 
model and log rank test stratified by asthma status, prior surgery history, and regions, by 
considering the first SCS rescue use or sur gery for NP (actual or planned) as the event. 
Descriptive statistics including number of patients with rescue or surgery and number of 
patients without rescue or surgery (censored) and the corresponding rates will be provided 
by treatment group. The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% CI will be provided for the dupilumab group versus the placebo group. 
Analysis of other secondary endpoints: 
Changes from baseline in continuous endpoi nts at Week 24 will be analyzed using the 
hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in the same fashion as for the coprimary endpoints.  
For each subgroup factor
, interaction tests will be carried out to investigate consistency of 
the dupilumab effect across different subgroups identified by that factor. In addition to the 
analysis in the current study, statistical analysis for these subgroups with comorbid 
asthma/NERD and prior surgery will be further conducted using the pooled data of 
EFC14146 and EFC14280, and the details will be provided in the SAP for the Integrated 
Summary of Efficacy. 
For any responder type endpoints, the Cochran-M antel-Haenszel test stratified by asthma 
status, prior surgery history, and region will be used. Comparisons of the proportions of 
responders between dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo will be derived. Patients who 
undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS fo r any reason will be considered as nonresponders 
for time points after using SCS or surgery.  For patients who discontinue treatment without 
using SCS or surgery, data collected during the off-treatment period will be used to 
determine the responder/nonresponder status . Missing data will be considered as 
nonresponders.  
Proportion and time-to-event of patients wit h SCS rescue for any airway exacerbated 
disease will be analyzed using a similar appr oach as the key secondary endpoint of the 
proportion of patients with SCS rescue or  surgery (actual or planned) for NP. 
For the change from baseline in continuous endpoints through the 24-week follow up period,

The safety variables, including AEs, laborator y parameters, vital si gns, electrocardiogram 
(ECG) and physical examinations will be summa rized using descriptive statistics. 
Missing data handling: 
For all continuous efficacy endpoints, in the primary approach for missing data handling, for 
patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data collected 
postsurgery or post-SCS will be set to missing,  and the worst postbaseline value on or 
before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to impute missing value at the certain 
analyzed visit (for patients whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will be 
used to impute), and for patients who discontinue the treatment without being rescued by 
surgery or receiving SCS on or before the analyzed visit, a MI approach will be used to 
impute missing value at the certain analyzed vi sit, and this MI will use all patients who have 
not been rescued by surgery or receiving SCS at that analyzed visit and data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included in the analysis. 
For responder type endpoints, patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any 
reason will be considered as nonresponders for time points after using SCS or surgery; for 
patients who discontinue treatment without usi ng SCS or surgery, data collected during the 
offtreatment period will be used to determine the responder/nonresponder status, and missing data will be considered as nonresponders. 
In addition, the reason and pattern of mi ssing data will be carefully examined and tipping 
point analyses and other sensitivity analyses will also be performed. 
Multiplicity considerations:  
The multiplicity procedure is proposed to control the overall type-I error rate for testing the 
coprimary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha is 0.05. The comparisons 
with placebo will be tested based on the hi erarchical order below at 2-sided α = 0.05 for 
300 mg q2w dose regimen versus placebo: 
1. Coprimary efficacy endpoints: 
In countries other than Japan: 
• Change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 24. 
In Japan: 
• Change from baseline in NC, in NPS and in CT LMK at Week 24. 
 
2. Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• Change from baseline to TSS at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in UPSIT at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in loss of smell daily symptoms at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in SNOT-22 at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in CT LMK score at Week 24 (this will not be a secondary 
endpoint for Japan as it is already a coprimary endpoint). 
• Proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery for NP during the treatment 
period. 
In countries other than Japan, the study is considered positive when both coprimary endpoints, the change from baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24, achieve statistical 
significance. 
In Japan, the study is considered positive when all coprimary endpoints, the change from 
baseline in NC, in NPS, and in CT LMK at Week 24, achieve statistical significance.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 12 First step analysis: 
A first step analysis may be performed when a ll patients complete the Week 24 visit, 
including early dropouts. Since this analysis is  the final analysis of the coprimary endpoints 
and other 24-week endpoints, and no decision on the conduct of the study will be made 
based on the first step analysis (in particular, no decision to prematurely stop the study), 
there will be no alpha adjustment due to the EOT analysis. Specific steps will be taken to 
maintain the blind of the study to all individuals involved in the conduct of the study and/or 
analysis. 
Individuals involved in the first step analysis of the study will not be involved in the conduct 
of the study afterwards; individual patient i dentification will not be released to anyone who is 
directly involved in the conduct of the study. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  The total duration of the study (per patient ) is expected to be approximately 52 weeks: 
• Run-in period (4 weeks +/- 3 days). 
• Randomized treatment period (24 weeks +/- 3 days). 
• Post treatment period (24 weeks +/- 3 days).

a The run-in period is 28 days in duration to run in any patient on MFNS, and to collect baseline data. Patients receiving rescue  medication with systemic corticosteroid (SCS) or and surgery during this  period will not be 
randomized. V2 will take place 28 days +/-3 day window after V1. Windows for subsequent  visits are also +/- 3 days. Assessments /procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order if applicable: 
patient-reported outcomes and other questionnaires; procedures; safety and laboratory assessments; IMP administration, 
b Optional interim visit may be scheduled at site for IMP/NIMP supply or IMP administration. 
c Patients who discontinue treatment  early will be assessed as soon as possible us ing the procedures nor mally planned for the EOT  Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in Section

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 17 d Past medical history including allergic comorbidities (asthma, aspirin sensitivity, allergic rhinitis etc.). Surgeries for NP w ill be assessed including number, type and dates of sino-nasal surgeries, polypectomies in 
the past. Systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use (number of courses, doses, way of administration and duration) in the past 2 years  before V1 and/or contraindication/intolerance to SCS, as well as long term 
antibiotics use (>2 weeks) in the previous year will be entered in the e-CRF.  NERD: NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflamma tory drug) Exacerbated Respiratory Di sease will be assessed through a specific 
questionnaire ( Appendix F ). 
e Spirometry (FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75): should be performed anytime  during the run-in period (betw een V1 and V2) before a first ad ministration of IMP for all patients, locally after withholding the last dose of 
salbutamol/albuterol or levosa lbutamol/leval buterol for at least 6 hours. FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75 will be determined at the desi gnated treatment visits. All patients should have the result of FEV1 (% of predicted 
normal) recorded in e-CRF: anytime during the run-in period (before V2). Patients with FEV1 50% or less (of predicted normal) w ill not be randomized. For the other scheduled visits  during the randomized 
treatment period, spirometry will be performed only in patients with asthma at V6, V7, V8 and V10 and the result of FEV1, FVC a nd FEF25-75 will be recorded in e-CRF at the study scheduled visits. 
f Chest X-ray if no chest imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) is available within the previous year of V1. In countries for which a specific  approval procedure for the x-ray or CT scan is required by a different committee than 
the local EC/IRB, a chest MRI between V1 and V2 can be performed. 
g Refer to Section  1 and Section 6  Study Design for details on treatment arms. IMP will be administered after completion of all scheduled clinical  assessments an d sample collections at the visit or at home. 
h Electronic diary/NPIF meter is used for daily recording of MFNS use, AM NPIF (daily up to Week 24 and afterwards at Week 36 and  Week 48 during the follow up) and daily symptoms severity from V1 to end of 
study: 1) nasal congestion/obstruction, 2) anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose), 3) posterior rhinorrhea (post nasal drip), and 4) loss of sense of smell, scored using a 0-3 categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = 
mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms). This device is dispensed at V1 and information is downloaded fro m this device on the other indicated days. For nasal congestion, a severity ≥2 
on V1 and a weekly average severity >1 at the time of randomiz ation (V2) is requir ed and will be made available to  the site to determine patient eligibility. If there are 4 or more measurements collected within 
7  days prior to randomization, the baseli ne will be t he average of these measurements; if  less than 4 measurements are collect ed, the baseline will be the average of the most recent 4 prior to randomization.  
i At baseline (V1 and V2) eligibility to surgery based on Investigat or opinion will be assessed. Duri ng the study treatment and f ollow-up, if rescue medication with systemic corticosteroids is requir ed, oral prednisone 
or prednisolone will be dis pensed by the site to the patient through a schedul ed or unscheduled in-clinic visit. Use of oral st eroids for rescue treatment of worsening nasal polyps or for another reason will be 
captured by the Investigator (or designee) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF and the date and dosing information (daily d ose, duration, INN) will be informed. Details on actual or planned date for surgery for 
NP, type and outcome (wherever possible) will be recorded in a specific e-CRF page. If surgery is performed during the study tr eatment period or follow-up, an AE or SAE page will be completed. They will be 
discontinued from study treatment and assessed as soon as possible using the procedures normally planned for the EOT visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as des cribed in Section 10.1.11. If 
surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date and outcome. 
Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
j Nasal endoscopy: endoscopy (includi ng use of decongestants before the procedure) will be performed after all other efficacy ass essments have been completed for each visit. Standard video sequences will be 
downloaded by the Investigator to  the centr al reader’s secured internet site. For eligibility, central reading of V1 will be us ed. At V2, Investigator will review V1 results from central reader to confirm entry criteria and 
reconfirm eligibility based on review of In clusion/Exclusion Cr iteria and the V2 endoscopy loca l reading. To confirm eligibilit y at V2, only the V1 central reading will be made available to the site . In addition at V2 the 
Investigator will perform the NE to confir m eligibility score and enter the result in t he e-CRF. Thus the pat ient is considered  eligible based on a V1 central reading followed by a V2 local reading NPS score of 5 or 
more and at least 2 each side. The final results of central reading from V2 onward will be made available to the site after the  study. 
k A CT scan should be performed anytime during the run-in period before the first administration of IMP and at Visit 8 (Week 24).  Central reading will be used for comparison baseline (BL) to Week 24 for the primary 
analysis and at EOT. A Week 48 CT scan may be performed if approved by local ethics committees. Whenever possible, a cone beam CT scan should be utilized. In countries where local EC do not approve a CT 
scan or for which a specific approval procedure for the CT scan is required by a different committee than the local EC/IRB, pat ients may be enrolled using a CT available in the previous year or perform an MRI of 
the sinuses between V1 and V2. These countries will be exempted from all the planned study CT scans unt il approval from these c ommittees is received. The MRI will be used only for confirmation of exclusion 
criteria. 
l During the study the PROs should be completed by the patient in the e-diary, in the following order: daily symptoms of NC, loss  of smell and rhinorrhea; SNOT-22; VAS rhinos inusitis; loss of taste severity, EQ-5D; 
ACQ-6 (in patients with asthma). 
m Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats pe r minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), body temper ature (degrees Celsius) and body weight  (kg) will be measur ed at the screening and 
randomization visits  (V1 and V2) and subsequent vi sit pre-specified in the flow-chart. Height (cm) will be measured at screenin g (V1) only. Vital signs will be measured prio r to receiving investigational product at 
the clinic visits in the sitting position using preferably the same arm at each visit.

Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screen (anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies ) and antinuclear antibody (ANA). In case of results showing HBsAg (negative), and HBcAb total or HBcAb IgM (positive), an HBV DNA 
testing must be performed prior to randomization to rule out a false positivity if the Investigator believes the patient is a f alse positive, or to clarify the serological status if the Investigator finds it unclear to interpret 
in absence of known HBV infection. In case of results showing HCV Ab (positive), an HCV RNA testing may be performed to rule ou t a false positivity, if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive. Note: 
Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is positive ( ≥1:160 titer). Tuberculosis local testing at baseline would be performed on a country by country basis according to local guidel ines if required by regulatory 
authorities or ethic committees.

part of visit with or without the assistance of a home care provider. In case of positive urinary test the study treatment will  be withheld and a serum pregnancy test to confirm the pregnancy should be performed as 
soon as possible. Pregnancy will lead to definit ive treatment discontinuation in all cases. 
q Serum dupilumab concentration, immune resp onse assessment (ADA) samples will be collected and archived prior to administration of IMP and during the randomized treatment period. Blood samples for PK and 
ADA assessment will be collected at any time in case an SAE occurs. In response to AEs of special interest like anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity additional ADA samples closer to the event may be analyzed, 
based on the judgement of the medical Investigator and/or medical monitor. Patients who are ADA positive at their last study vi sit (early termination or EOS) will be considered for follow-up based on the overall 
clinical presentation at that time. Patients who are considered for follow-up may be asked to return to the clinic to have addi tional samples collected for analysis.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP ) is a clinical condition characterized by the 
presence of multiple polyps in the upper nasal cavity, originating from the osteomeatal complex 
(OC) and the spheno-ethmoid recess and characterized by mucosal inflammation of the nasal 
cavity and paranasal sinuses with symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks. Clinically, CRSwNP is defined by long-term symptoms of  nasal obstruction and congestion, reduction in or loss of sense 
of smell, and anterior and posterior rhinorrhea. These symptoms can impact greatly upon a patient’s quality of life (QoL). The presence or absence of polyps is confirmed by performing 
endoscopy. Coronal computed tomography (CT) scans can confirm the presence and extent of 
sinus and polyp involvement. With an estimated pr evalence of 2% to 4% (in Europe and United 
States [US]), nasal polyps (NP) has a high burde n of symptoms and a high relapse rate after 
treatment. Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity associated with CRSwNP, treatment options range from local or systemic  corticosteroids (SCS) to functional endoscopic 
sinus surgery. Patients with CRSwNP and comorbid  asthma (~30% of patients with NP) have a 
characteristically poor therapeutic response and a high recurrence rate, and their disease tends to be more resistant ( 1, 2). 
The pathogenesis of nasal polyps is unknown. Nasal polyps are most commonly thought to be caused by allergy, although a significant number are associated with nonallergic adult asthma or 
no respiratory or allergic trigger that can be demonstrated. Risk factors include genetic susceptibility, anatomic abnormalities, infec tion, local immunologic imbalance and eicosanoid 
dysmetabolism (manifested as aspirin intolerance), some or most of which may play a role in its 
pathogenesis ( 3, 4, 5). 
Pathophysiologically, CRSwNP is an inflammatory  and remodeling process affecting the mucosa 
of the nose and paranasal sinuses often associated with mucocilliary impairment, bacterial 
infection, allergic disease, a nd/or anatomical abnormalities ( 6, 7, 8). CRSwNP is a T-helper cell-2 
(Th2) driven inflammatory process in which eo sinophils are the predominant inflammatory cell 
found in the sinuses and nasal polyps, and is frequently associated with asthma and aspirin sensitivity ( 9). In European and US populations, more than 80% of patients with CRSwNP have 
eosinophilic upper airway inflammation. The extent of sinomucosal involvement, the size of the 
polyps, and the severity of nasal disease correl ate with the extent of eosinophilic inflammation 
(10). The chronic inflammation asso ciated with eosinophilic polyps exhibits elevated levels of 
interleukin-5 (IL)-5 (promoter of eosinophil survival, differentiation and taxis), eosinophil 
cationic protein (eosinophil activ ation product), eotaxins (eos inophil chemoattractants), and 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the nasal polyps and local secretions ( 11).  
The therapeutic armamentarium of clinically proven medical interventions for CRSwNP is limited. First-line treatment is topical corticosteroids. Intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) sprays improve the symptoms of nasal obstruction ( 12), secretion, and sneezing to some extent. 
However, their effect in reducing polyp si ze and on improving the sense of smell ( 13), a cardinal

EFC14146 - dupilumab  Version number: 1  
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 31 symptom of NP ( 14) is limited. Overall, due to the relatively modest effects on the symptoms of 
NP, in many instances, INCSs do not address the main QoL issues for pati ents. Short courses of 
oral steroids are also prescribed as adjunctive therapy to INCS or in cases of severe disease ( 15); 
however, the long-term use of systemic steroids  for the treatment of nasal polyps is not 
recommended as the risk of prolonged systemic st eroids use is not outweighed by the benefit ( 12). 
The current US practice guidelines indicate th at the duration of clin ical benefit of oral 
corticosteroids (OCS) is variable and may decrease with repeated courses of treatment ( 16). 
The only alternative for most patients that respond inadequately to medical tr eatment is surgery of 
the sinuses. However, even after surgical treatment , continued use of at least INCS is needed and 
disease recurrence requiring repeated surgeries is high. 
Recent therapeutic approaches have been focu sed on trying to control the Th2 response and 
clinical improvement in CRSwNP and associated symptoms have been observed in other studies 
of biological therapies, including the an ti-IgE monoclonal antibody (mAB) omalizumab ( 17), or 
the anti-IL-5 mAB mepolizumab ( 18). 
Dupilumab is a systemic targeted immunomodulatory agent, inhibiting the Th2 pathway. It is a 
fully human mAB directed against the interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R α) subunit, a component 
of IL-4 receptors Type I and Type II, which medi ate signaling by IL-4 (both receptors) and by 
IL-13 (Type II receptor). Dupilumab binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 activation of 
their respective receptors. For further complete information regarding the preclinical and clinical evaluation of dupilumab to 
date, refer to the current version of the Investigator Brochure. 
Dupilumab is in clinical development for the treatment of CRSwNP worldwide. However in the 
US, based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) feedback, this clinical development program 
will support the indication of nasal polyposis (NP).  
Preliminary clinical evidence, based on the proof of concept (POC) data and the mechanism of 
action, suggests that dupilumab provides an effective treatment and substantial improvement over INCS for patients suffering from CRSwNP. In  a POC study (ACT12340), 60 patients with 
bilateral NP and chronic symptoms of sinusitis re fractory to INCS were randomized to dupilumab 
300 mg once weekly (qw) SC administration for 16 weeks or placebo, with background intranasal 
mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS; NASONEX ). In this study, dupilumab demonstrated a 
significant improvement in endosc opic, radiographic and clinical measures of NP and sinusitis, as 
well as improvements in lung function and disease control in patients with comorbid asthma ( 19).  
Dupilumab, therefore, offers promise of signifi cant benefit above and bey ond current standard of 
care in this patient population a nd may provide an alternative for those patients who respond 
inadequately to INCS and may obviate the need for repeated surgeries.

This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of dupilumab in 
patients with moderate-to- severe signs and symptoms of NP w ho are not controlled on standard of 
care.  
This study will primarily investigate the efficacy  and safety of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks 
(q2w) compared to placebo on top of the current standard of care background therapy of (daily 
use of intranasal MFNS [NASONEX]), utiliz ing multiple objective and subjective outcome 
measures in patients with NP. By allowing Investigators, at their discretion, to use SCS or surgery 
as a rescue therapy for worsening of NP, the st udy will also assess the effect of dupilumab on the 
need for surgery and SCS use over the randomized treatment period. 
4.3 POPULATION 
The population of the EFC14146 study is composed  of patients with b ilateral NP (endoscopic 
bilateral nasal polyp sc ore [NPS] has to be ≥ 5 out of a maximum score of 8) that present with 
chronic symptoms of nasal congestion (NC) (mod erate/severe) and another symptom such as loss 
of smell and/or rhinorrhea despite background tr eatment with INCS and maximum therapy with 
standard of care including systemic  corticosteroids (in the previous 2 years) and/or surgery in the 
past (see Section  7.1). 
The proposed patient selection cr iteria will reflect standard of care in this severe uncontrolled 
patient setting by allowing enrollment of patients that received INCS, SCS prior to the run-in 
period, and/or patients with  previous surgeries. 
Approximately 26% to 50% of NP patients suffer from comorbid asthma and it is estimated that asthma is underdiagnosed in up to 25% of these patients ( 20, 21). NP has also been observed to be 
associated with chronic bronchitis and, in t hose with asthma, lower airway obstruction ( 6, 20). 
NP patients also more frequently present with  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
intolerance ( 22) and if they also suffer from asthma they are diagnosed with NSAID-exacerbated 
respiratory disease (NERD). 
These patients have the highest rates of exacer bation and hospital admissi ons and tend to have a 
poorer perception of control of disease, due to the persistence and severity of the associated 
sinonasal symptoms ( 23). Additionally, asthma symptoms tend to be more severe in these 
patients. Taking into account the high prevalence, the hi gh disease burden and unmet need of NP patients 
that have comorbid asthma and aspirin or NERD, these patients will be allowed to enter the study 
(unless they present with any of the exclusion criteria described in Section  7.2). In addition, 
stratification at randomization for asthma and specific subgroup analysis will be performed to 
specifically assess efficacy in these subgroups. 
NP patients who have persistent signs and symptoms  or disease relapse after short course treatment 
with SCS or after a surgery for NP, represent a subgroup of patients with higher burden and unmet

with prior surgery will be performed. 
4.4 STUDY DESIGN 
This phase 3 multinational, mu lticenter, randomized, double-bli nd, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study will evaluate the efficacy of dupilu mab 300 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) 
q2w for 24 weeks followed by 24 weeks off-treatment period on a background of INCS. 
The proposed study, allowing daily use of INCS and SCS courses and/or surgery as needed or 
other treatments considered standa rd of care, will aim at evalua ting a potential role for dupilumab 
in the existing treatment paradigm, for the treatment of nasal polyps.  
The clinical study consists of 3 periods: 
• Run-in period where the patients will r eceive MFNS for 4 weeks +/-3 days. 
• Randomized dupilumab/placebo treatment period (24 weeks) where approximately 
240 patients w ill be  randomized, 120 p/arm, to one of the following treatments: 
- Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w

• Post treatment period - where patients will be followed for 24 weeks to evaluate potential disease recurrence (through objective and subjective efficacy assessments), systemic concentrations of functional dupilumab (PK), immunogenicity, and safety after they are 
off the investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
During the whole study duration, patients will conti nue MFNS stable dose started at Visit 1 (V1) 
except if dose is changed due to AE.  
In addition, patients may receive rescue medications (including SCS) and/or undergo surgery for 
NP as deemed necessary by the Investigator and patient. Short courses of oral steroids are often 
used as adjunctive therapy to INCS or in cases NP patients who fail standa rd of care with INCS 
(15). Refer to Section  8.2.2 for additional details. 
Overall, this study will evaluate the potential real life benefit that dupilumab may provide for 
patients that failed currently available treatment options. 
4.4.1 Endpoints rationale and description 
Clinically, NP is defined by long-term symptoms  of nasal obstruction a nd congestion, reduction in 
or loss of sense of smell, and an terior and posterior rhinorrhea. The presence or absence of polyps 
is confirmed by performing endoscopy. These symptoms can greatly impact patient’s QoL.  
Medical and surgical intervention decisions are ma inly driven by the nasal polyp symptom burden 
and response to standard therapy with topical and SCS. Therefore, in this study severity of symptoms will be scored daily by the patient (0-3). For NC which is a major clinical symptom,

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 01  17-May-2017 
EFC14146 - dupilumab  Version number: 1  
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 34 the monthly average of the daily recorded sympto m score will be assessed  as coprimary endpoint 
along with the objective endoscopi c assessment of NP score.  
Thus, the coprimary endpoints of this study are the change from baseline at Week 24 in: 
• Nasal congestion/obstruction severity score consisting of the monthly average of the daily 
morning ante meridiem (AM) patient-assesse d daily symptom severity (using a 0 to 3 
categorical scale). The NC is assessed by  the patient on a daily basis from V1 and 
throughout the study, using an electronic diar y (e-diary) using a 0 to 3 categorical scale 
(where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms , 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe 
symptoms).  
• The bilateral endoscopic NPS ranges from 0 to 8 points and is the sum of the right and left 
scores (from 0 = no polyps; 1 = small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the 
inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the 
middle turbinate; 3 = large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity) ( 17, 18, 24). For further detail, see Section  9.1. 
• In addition, for Japan: Lund-Mackay score. The Lund-Mackay (LMK) system is based 
on localization with points given for degree of opacification on CT scan: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total opacifica tion. These points are then applied to the 
maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinus on each side. The OC is graded as 0 = not occluded, or 2 = occluded deriving a maximum score of 12 per side. For further detail, see Section  9.1. 
Key secondary endpoints of the study include: 
• Change from baseline in the severity of total symptoms score (TSS) at Week 24.  
• Change from baseline in University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in the severity of decreased/loss of smell daily assessed by the patient at Week 24.  
• Change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the LMK score 
at Week 24. (Note for Japan: this is considered as primary endpoint) 
• Change from baseline in 22- item sino-nasal outco me test (SNOT-22) at Week 24. 
• Proportion of patients receiving SCS and/or undergoing surger y (actual or planned) for 
nasal polyps during the study treatment. 
The proposed study design and endpoints will answ er important clinical questions about the 
efficacy on symptoms and objective signs of the disease and the effect of dupilumab on reduction 
of SCS rescue therapy and surgery, which are the most relevant clinical practice assessments and 
reflect current standard of care. 
Other efficacy, safety and exploratory asse ssments in patient re ported outcomes (PROs), 
health-related quality of life (H RQoL) and condition-specific and general medical questionnaires 
to evaluate the potential real lif e benefit will be evaluated too.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 35 These treatment approaches and endpoints reflect r eal-life clinical assessment and are in line with 
increasing focus in the medical field on the effects of medical conditions and treatments on the 
QoL of, and functioning of, patients ( 1). 
4.4.2 Dupilumab dose and regimen rationale  
The dose regimens are selected based on the to tality of clinical evidence in the dupilumab 
program including data from Phase 2 efficacy an d safety study (ACT12340) in patients with nasal 
polyps and symptoms of chronic sinusitis, the result of Phase 2b dose ranging study in patients with moderate to severe asthma (DRI12544), the Phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) and Phase 3 studies (R668-AD-1334 and R668-AD-1416)  in patients with m oderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD), as well as the supportiv e pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD) 
analysis.  
While the clinical manifestations may be distinct across NP, asthma and AD indications, Th2 
mediated inflammation is implicated in the disease etiology and pathophysiology of all 3 conditions. Dupilumab has demonstrated marked  concentration dependent inhibition of the 
upstream and downstream Th2 inflammatory biomarkers including thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and IgE with a very similar PD profile and exposure-response relationship in AD, asthma an d NP patients. In asthma dose ranging study 
(DRI12544), 300 mg q2w regimen demonstrated a robust treatment effect across all relevant 
indices of drug action, while less frequent dos e regimens 200 mg q2w and 300 mg once every 
4 weeks (q4w) showed less effect in some e ndpoints including SNOT-22. Both dose-response and 
exposure-response analyses indicat ed that therapeutic responses (eg, improvement in forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] at Week 12)  and biomarker responses (including fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide and TARC) plateaued by 300  mg q2w. Thus, a further increase in dose above 
300 mg q2w is unlikely to achieve  additional clinical benefit. The 300 mg q2w regimen is being 
currently evaluated as the higher dose regime n in the asthma phase 3 pivotal study.  
In the AD dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021), a similar treatment effect between 300 mg qw 
and 300 mg q2w was also observed for most e fficacy endpoints (eg, IGA [Immunoglobulin A] 
and EASI [Eczema Area and Severity Index]). C onsistently, results from the Phase 3 efficacy and 
safety studies in AD patients (R668-AD-1334 an d R668-AD-1416) confirmed the highly similar 
clinical efficacy for the 300 mg qw and 300 mg q2w regimens across all endpoints. 
In the phase 2 POC study in NP patients with chronic symp toms of sinusitis (ACT12340), the 
300 mg qw regimen demonstrated a robust, clinic ally and statistically significant treatment 
response on the primary and secondary efficacy e ndpoints for NP and chroni c sinusitis at the end 
of the 16-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic/PD analysis of ACT12340 efficacy endpoints 
predicted a superior therapeutic  benefit at both 300 mg q2w and 300 mg qw regimens, including 
clinical significant reduction in bilateral NPS (>1 point from baseline) and significant improvement in symptoms of NC and decrease/lo ss of smell. The exposure-response analysis of 
SNOT-22 by leveraging both ACT12340 and the dose ranging data from DRI12544 NP patients 
consistently supports significant clinical benef its of 300 mg q2w regimen in improving SNOT-22 
outcome (total score and select ed nasal components of loss of smell and nasal blockage) and 
limited additional bene fit with further increase in dose beyond 300 mg q2w. Thus, the available

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 01  17-May-2017 
EFC14146 - dupilumab  Version number: 1  
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 36 efficacy data from asthma, AD and NP trials collectively indicate a high potential for achieving an 
optimal treatment effect at 300 mg q2w in NP patients. 
Nasal polyposis is an inflammatory disorder of  upper airways of chronic and recurring nature 
requiring the use of long-term anti-inflammatory treatment to achieve a maintenance state ( 25). 
In the ACT12340 study, a gradual development of  treatment response was observed for bilateral 
NPS and NP symptoms of NC and sense of sme ll. The PD steady-state for the above endpoints 
was not reached at the end of treatment (EOT ) at Week 16, suggesting additional therapeutic 
benefit with longer treatment dur ation. The time-course PK/PD analys is predicts 24 weeks to be 
the optimal treatment duration to assess the maximal symptomatic effect for NPS, NC and other key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
In ACT12340 study, a single loading dose of 600 mg was used on Day 1 to rapidly achieve an 
efficacious concentration range for a potentially earlier onset of significant response. Consistent with the observed PK and PD profile of NP response (gradual de velopment of response as well as 
slow offset of response during off-treatment),  PK/PD simulation of c oprimary endpoints of NPS 
and NC showed minimal difference in the develo pment of treatment effect and steady-state 
response of NPS and NC in the presence and absence of the loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1. Therefore, no loading dose is included in the present study. 
In summary, the present clinical evidence from th e 3 related Th2 disease populations of NP, AD, 
and asthma supports selection of  300 mg q2w as the potential efficacious dose regimen to be 
evaluated for benefit risk in the Phase 3 study. 
4.5 OVERALL BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT 
Polyps are generally comprised of eosinophilic inf iltrate and associated with a Th2 orchestrated 
inflammatory state characterized by high IgE, increased Th2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, 
and decreased T-regulatory function. Dupilumab prevents IL-4 and IL-13 binding and activation of their respective receptors involved 
in signaling pathways that play key roles in the pathophysiology of NP. A Phase 2a study in 
patients with NP and symptoms of sinusitis, demonstrated efficacy of dupilumab with improvements in endoscopic, ra diographic and clinical measur es of disease as well as 
improvements in lung function and disease contro l in patients with comorbid asthma. Based on 
the POC data and the mechanism of action, dupilu mab may provide an effective treatment for 
patients suffering from NP despite maximal treatment with available therapy.  
Overall, 7408 subjects have been enrolled into the dupilumab development program (completed 
and ongoing studies) as of 30 September 2016. Based upon the currently available data for dup ilumab and the review of the data by an 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), systemic hypersensitivity has been identified as 
an important potential risk. Use in patients with helminthic infections is considered missing information based on mechanism of action and evidence of the role of IL-4 in helminth repulsion

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 37 in animal studies published in literature. Othe r theoretical risks based on immune-modulating 
properties of IL-4 are being ma naged conservatively through: 
• Exclusion of patients with immunosuppre ssed status or receiving systemic 
immunosuppressants, and/or having active bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, or at high 
risk for developing or reactivating infections. 
• Monitoring of safety data, including periodic blinded safety monitori ng team review and 
unblinded IDMC review. 
The total number of patients exposed to dupilumab is over 5,000.  Data from these patients 
showed that dupilumab is well tolerated and has a favorable safety profile. This, together with the efficacy demonstrated in ACT12340 study in patie nts with NP, show a favorable benefit risk 
balance, and support continued de velopment of dupilumab in NP.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
EFC14146 is a multinational, multicenter, rando mized, double-blind, Phase 3, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study to evaluate dupilumab in patients with bilate ral NP. All patients will enter a 
run-in period of 4 weeks +/-3 days receiving MFNS of 2 actuations (50 µg/actuation) in each 
nostril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 400 µg, starting at V1, unless they are unable to 
tolerate or there is a specific regulatory requirement preventing use of this dose, in which case they can stay on a lower dose regimen (200 µg) of MFNS.  
Approximately 240 patients with bilateral NP will be randomized  1:1 (120 patients/arm) into 
2 treatment groups as follows:  
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w until Week 24. 
• Arm B: placebo matching dup ilumab SC q2w until Week 24. 
The 240 patients will be included in approximately 80 sites.  Patients will be randomized 
according to asthma status (history of asthma or  not), prior NP surgery (yes or no), and country. 
In order to have adequate number of patients for the subgr oup analysis of patients with 
asthma/NERD and prior surgery enrollment of the following categories of patients will be limited 
as follows (see rationale Section  4.2):  
• Patients without asthma and/or  NERD history will be limited to 120 patients (out of the 
total 240 randomized patients). 
• Patients without prior surgery will be limited to 120 patients ( out of the total 
240 randomized patients). 
Patients may fall into more than one category without limitation in numbers. 
During the randomized treatment period, patients w ill continue the stable dose of intranasal 
MFNS stabilized during the run-in period except if dose is changed due to AE. For a schematic 
study design refer to Section  1.1. 
During the study, patients who report deteriora tion requiring medical/surgical intervention may 
come to the site for an endoscopy and clinical evaluation. An unscheduled visit may be used for 
this purpose and if necessary the Investigator may consider one of the treatment alternatives described in Section  8.2.2.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 40 6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The clinical trial will consist of 3 periods: 
• Run-in period (4 weeks, +/-3 days):  to determine a patient’s eligibility and for 
run-in/standardization of background IN CS (MFNS) prior to randomization. 
• Randomized dupilumab/placebo treatment  period (24 weeks +/-3 days):  to randomize the 
patient into a treatment arm and treat with dupilumab or placebo dose regimen. 
• Post treatment period (24 weeks +/-3 days):  to continue to collect data for PK, 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy after th e patient has completed the study drug 
treatment period. 
If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up 
contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date 
and outcome (see Section  9.2.1.5). Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
The total duration of study participation for patients that complete the randomized treatment 
period and post treatment follow up is approximately 52 weeks. The schedule of the visits is 
described in the study flow chart in Section  1.2. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The last patient last visit will occur when the la st randomized patient has completed the end of his 
or her 24-week follow-up period or prematurel y discontinues from the study. The end of the 
clinical trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit. 
6.3 FIRST STEP ANALYSIS 
A first step analysis may be performed when a ll patients complete the Week 24 visit, including 
early dropouts. Since this analysis is the final analysis of the coprimary endpoints and other 
24-week endpoints, and no decision on the conduct of the study will be made based on the first 
step analysis (in particular, no decision to prematurely stop the study), there will be no alpha adjustment due to the interim analysis. Specific steps will be taken to maintain the blind of the 
study to all individuals involved in the conduct of the study and/or  analysis, if we perform this 
first step analysis, and to protect the overall blinding of, and integrity of, the study data given the first step analysis as further described in Section  11.5. 
Individuals involved in the first step analysis of the study will not be involved in the conduct of the study afterwards; individual patient identification (ID) will not be released to anyone who is directly involved in the conduct of the study.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.1.1 Dupilumab 
Sterile dupilumab 150 mg/mL will be  provided in prefilled syringes  (2.25 mL total volume) to 
deliver 300 mg in 2 mL.  
8.1.2 Placebo for dupilumab 
Sterile placebo for dupilumab will be provided in identically matching prefilled syringes to 
deliver 2 mL. 
8.1.3 Preparation of investigational medicinal product 
Dupilumab in prefilled syringes will be dispensed to the patients, if required for home administration. 
8.1.4 Dosing schedule 
Regardless of the treatment arm, all randomized patients will recei ve q2w SC administrations of 
either dupilumab or placebo on Day 1 (V2). Ever y other week IMP administrations must be 
separated by at least 11 days (See Section  1.2).  
At V2, the Investigator (or delegate) will perform  the injection. After V 2, q2w administration of 
IMP will be performed at the investigational site up to at least Week 8 (V6). The IMP will be 
administered following clinic procedures and bl ood collection. Patients w ill be monitored at the 
study site for at least 30 minutes (or minimum time approved by the local regulator) after 
injections for signs of a hypersensitivity reaction. 
From Week 10, q2w home administration of IM P (by patient, caregiver, or health care 
professional) is possible if the patient (or caregiver) has been tr ained for 4 injections. Training 
must be documented when completed successfully and training injections must be recorded in the 
source documents. When IMP is administered at hom e, the patients must be  advised by the site 
staff to self-monitor for potential signs and symp toms that may suggest a hypersensitivity reaction 
for at least 30 minutes after administration (or minimum time approved by the local regulator). If 
the patient (or caregiver) is unable or unwilling to administer IMP, arrangements must be made for qualified site personnel and/or healthcare pr ofessionals to administer IMP for the doses not 
scheduled to be given at the study site. If the pa tient, or caregiver(s) do not develop the comfort to 
inject the IMP at home, or the Investigator determ ines that the patient (or caregiver) injection at 
home is not appropriate, injections  can be performed at the site by way of unscheduled visits. 
Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or  the upper arms, so that the same site is not

(caregiver trained by Investigator or Delegate ) or healthcare professi onal but not the patient 
themselves. 
Detailed instructions for transport, storage, prep aration, and administration of IMP are provided to 
the patient. For doses not given at the study site patients will complete a paper dosing diary to 
document compliance with self-injection (or caregiver) of IMP, location of injection, and any symptoms. The diary will be kept as s ource data in the pa tient’s study file. 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.2.1 Intranasal corticosteroid background therapy 
On a daily basis throughout the study, the patient will use an e-diary to record daily use of 
mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) (NASONEX) 50 µ g/actuation nasal spray suspension, 
(refer to the package insert & SmPC for a descri ption, administration details and precautions for 
use). MFNS is provided in a bottle that contains  18 g (140 actuations) of product formulation. The 
Sponsor will provide the MFNS to the Investigator sites for dispensing to the patients. If patient is 
unable to tolerate 200 micrograms twice a day (total dose 400 micrograms) due to experiencing 
AE, patient may reduce dose to 200 micrograms once per day. 
Detailed instructions for transpor t, storage, preparation, and ad ministration of noninvestigational 
medicinal product (NIMP) are provided to the pa tient. Patients will complete the e-diary to 
document compliance. The e-diary will be considered as source data. 
8.2.1.1 Run-In Period 
After V1, once patient eligibility for study entry has been confirmed, all patients will enter a 
run-in period of 4 weeks during which they will receive starting at V1 MFNS:  
• Two actuations (50 µg/actuation) in each nostril BID (total daily dose of 400 µg), unless they are unable to tolerate the BID regime n or this dose is not approved in specific 
countries, in which case, they will follow a once daily (QD) regimen.  
MFNS will be self-administered by the patient, and at each visit the Investigator must ensure that 
the patient has the necessary doses up to the next  visit, knowing that one MFNS device (1 bottle) 
contains sufficient doses for either 2 weeks of BID treatment/regimen or 4 weeks of QD 
treatment/regimen. 
Patients who receive rescue medica tion including INCS drops or syst emic (oral, intravenous [IV], 
intramuscular [IM]) steroids between V1 and V2 will not be randomized. They can be rescreened 
as described in Section  10.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 48 8.2.1.2 Randomized treatment period 
During the randomized treatment period, all pa tients will continue on the MFNS stable dose 
initiated at V1. If they experience an AE du ring the treatment period, patients can reduce the 
frequency of MFNS administration. 
8.2.1.3 Post treatment period 
Upon completing the randomized tr eatment period (or following early discontinuation of IMP or 
discontinuation from the study), patients can conti nue treatment with the stable dose of MFNS 
that was maintained throughout the randomized tr eatment period until the EOS visit, or modify 
treatment based on medical judgment. 
If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up 
contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date 
and outcome (see Section  9.2.1.5). Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial.  
8.2.2 Rescue treatment  
During the study treatment period and off-trea tment follow-up, based on clinical evaluation, in 
case of worsening of endoscopic/radiological sign s and/or clinical symptoms requiring medical 
intervention, the Investigator may consider rescue treatment with: 
• Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in case of acute 
infection). 
• Short course OCS (prednisone or  prednisolone up to 2 weeks). 
• Sino-nasal surgery for nasal polyps. Based on previous observations from the POC study, 
8 weeks of IMP treatment is recommended prior to surgery to allow onset of treatment 
effect.  
Patients receiving rescue medica tion during the study should continue on study drug unless the 
Investigator decides to withdraw the study treatme nt. Before starting treatment with SCS, patients 
should come to the study site for clinical  assessments including endoscopy and PROs. 
Patients scheduled for sino-nasal surgery may continue IMP up to the time of surgery or EOT 
whichever date comes first and at time of surgery will be permanently discontinued from study 
treatment and perform the efficacy and safety asse ssments planned at the EOT visit and return to 
the site for additional visits as described in Section  10.3.1. 
In any case, patients who prematurely discontinue the treatment will be encouraged to return to the study site for the efficacy and safety assessmen ts planned at EOT visit and for additional visits 
as described in Section  10.3.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 49 8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
Dupilumab and placebo will be provided in identically matching 2 mL prefilled syringes. To 
protect the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL ( dupilumab/placebo) glass pr efilled syringes will be 
prepared such that the treatments (dupilumab and its matching placebo according to its dose) are identical and indistinguishable and will be labeled with a trea tment kit number. The randomized 
treatment kit number list will be generated by sanofi. Both the patient and Investigator will be blinded to assigned active drug or placebo fo r the whole study period. For further details, see 
Section  8.5, Packaging and Labeling. 
Study patients, Investigators, and study site pe rsonnel will not have access to the randomization 
code list except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected adverse drug  reaction (SUSAR) unblinding by the 
Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
If possible, a contact should be initiated with the Monitoring Team before breaking the code. Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by calling any other 
phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day,  and reason for code breaking. 
Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is made at the site level, not the study level. This means that if the Emergency Unblindi ng transaction is performed by the Investigator 
(ie, at the site level), then the patient will be withdrawn from treatment. However, if the Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by  the Global Safety Officer (GSO) (ie, at the 
study level, as the GSO is not s ite based), it is not re quired to withdraw the patient from treatment. 
At the facilities where the PK measurements, ADA and selected biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to database lock leading to unblindi ng of responsible bioanalysts. 
Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. 
The DMC will receive blinded by treatment group or unblinded (if necessary ) confidential reports 
from an independent statistician for review, which have to be handled  strictly confidentially. None 
of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 50 8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by sanofi. The IMP 
(dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list. 
The sanofi Clinical Supplies team will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and the 
Study Biostatistician will provide  the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment 
allocation system. This centralized treatment allocation system will generate the patient 
randomization list according to which it will a llocate the treatments to the patients. 
Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms using a 1:1 randomization ratio: 
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w until Week 24. 
• Arm B: placebo matching dup ilumab SC q2w until Week 24. 
Approximately 240 (120 pa tients/arm) patients shall be randomized. Randomization will be 
stratified based on asthma status (history of asthma or not), prior NP surgery (yes or no) and 
country.  
In order to have adequate number of patients for the subgr oup analysis of patients with 
asthma/NERD and prior surgery enrollment of the following categories of patients will be limited 
as follows (see rationale Section  4.2):  
• Patients without asthma and/or  NERD history will be limited to 120 patients (out of the 
total 240 randomized patients). 
• Patients without prior surgery will be limited to 120 patients ( out of the total 
240 randomized patients). 
At randomization, IVRS will allocate to a patient  a treatment number for dupilumab or placebo. A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. 
Patients who meet exclusion criteria may be rescreened and a different patient identification will 
be issued. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen-failure date and the rescreening date. The IVRS/IWRS report will flag rescreened patients. Patients who are rescreened must sign a new consent form a nd all V1 procedures must be repeated. The 
Investigator obtains treatment kit numbers at ra ndomization and subsequent  scheduled visits via 
the IVRS/IWRS which will be available 24 hours a day. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
From randomization (V2) up to Week 22, dupiluma b 300 mg or placebo will be supplied as one 
glass prefilled syringe packed in one patient kit box. The kit boxes for Arm A (300 mg q2w 
administration) will contain only dupilumab 300 mg syringes and the kit boxes for Arm B 
(placebo q2w administration) will contain only placebo syringes.

Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Dupilumab and placebo IMPs should be stored  at a temperature between 2°C and 8°C. 
Mometasone furoate nasal spray storage conditions are specified on the bottle and its box.  
All IMP and NIMP should be stored in an appropr iate, locked room under the responsibility of the 
Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) in accordance with local regulations, 
policies and procedures. NASONEX should be stored at room temperature. 
Control of storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructi ons for handling the sanofi compound should be 
managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Investigators to inform the patients regarding the mandatory storage requirements for the IMP. No temperature monitoring will be performed at the patients’ homes. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc.) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator suppl y IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-
patient shipment, for which a courier company ha s been approved by the Sponsor), allow the IMP 
to be used other than as directed by this clini cal trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other

for drug accountability purposes. Patients will also  return used prefilled syringes to the site 
in a sharps container. 
• The Investigator (or designee) will track tr eatment accountability/compliance, by diary, 
and by counting the number of used and unus ed treatment kits and syringes and will 
complete the appropriate page of the patient treatment log. 
• The monitor in charge of the study will check the data entered on the IMP and NIMP administration page by comparing them with the IMP and NIMP that have been retrieved and the patient treatment log forms . Reconciliation will occur with paper and electronic 
diary as appropriate depending on study visit/period.  
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Whenever possible all partially used, used or unused IMP and NIMP provided by the Sponsor will 
be destroyed on site according to the standard practices of the site. A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP and NIMP supplied by the Sponsor w ill be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by th e Investigator and the monitoring team. The Investigator will 
not destroy any IMP and NIMP supplied by the Sponsor unless the S ponsor provides written

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) substrates  
The impact of dupilumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes activity has not been studied 
and the effect on dupilumab on the levels of IL -4 and IL-13 cytokines has not been fully 
characterized. 
However, literature data of studies in human hepatocytes indicate that the IL-4 was able to 
upregulate CYP450 2E1, 2B6, 3A4 mRNA expr ession or down regulate CYP1A2 mRNA 
(26, 27). Another study in human peripheral blood m ononuclear cells incubate d with various Th2 
cytokines, reports that Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL -13 generally increased the protein expression of 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 ( 28). 
A drug-drug interaction study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected CYP450 substrates in adu lt patients with moderate to severe AD was 
completed recently.  The data indicated no clini cally meaningful effect of dupilumab on CYP1A2, 
CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2C9 activity. 
During the study medication and at least up to the end of follow-up, caution should be used for 
drugs with narrow therapeutic index that are metabolized via these CYP450 isoforms. 
This means that unless the drug is prohibited in the study Section  8.8.1, close clinical observation 
and/or laboratory monitoring as a pplicable are required in order to enable early detection of toxic 
manifestations or lack of activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or their 
withdrawal if needed.

9.1 COPRIMARY ENDPOINTS 
There are 2 coprimary endpoints for this st udy for countries other than Japan:  
1. Change from baseline in nasal conges tion/obstruction (NC) at Week 24:  NC is 
assessed by the patient on a daily basis from V1  and throughout the study, using an e-diary 
using a 0 to 3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms) ( 2).  
Nasal congestion/obstruction will be scored as a reflective score (evaluation of symptom severity 
over the past 24 hours) by the patient (see Table 1 ). 
Table 1 – Symptom severity score 
Scale Symptoms 
0 No symptoms 
1 Mild symptoms (symptoms cl early present, but minimal awareness and easily tolerated) 
2 Moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sym ptoms that is bothersome but tolerable) 
3 Severe symptoms (symptoms that are hard to tolerate , cause interference with activities or daily living) 
 
The e-diary is dispensed at V1 and informa tion is downloaded from this device on the other 
indicated days.  
A severity ≥ 2 on the day of V1 and a weekly average severity greater than 1 at time of 
randomization (V2) is required and will be provided to the site to determine patient eligibility. If 
there are 4 or more measurements collected with in 7 days prior to randomization, the baseline will 
be the average of these measurements; if less than 4 measurements are collected, the baseline will 
be the average of the most recent 4 prior to randomization. 
For the baseline to EOT analysis, 4 weeks average of the symptom scores will be used. 
2. Change from baseline in NPS at Week  24: NPS (17, 18, 24) is assessed by central video 
recordings of nasal endoscopy. The score (NPS) is the sum of the right and left 
nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasa l endoscopy. NPS is graded based on polyp 
size described in Table 2 .

2 Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate  
3 Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate 
4 Large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity 
 
Nasal endoscopy should be performed at the end of  the scheduled visits before the administration 
of IMP and preceded by local administration of anesthetic drugs in combination with a 
decongestant. 
Standard video sequences will be downloaded or sent to centralized reader. Centralized imaging 
data assessments and scoring by independent physician reviewer(s) for the imaging data will be performed for all endoscopies. To confirm eligib ility at V2, only the V1 central reading will be 
made available to the site. In addition at V2 th e Investigator will perform the nasal endoscopy to 
confirm eligibility score and enter the result in the e-CRF. Thus the patient is considered eligible based on a V1 central reading followed by a V2 local  reading NPS score of 5 or more and at least 
2 each side. The final results of central reading from V2 onward will be made available after the study. 
For the analysis of primary endpoint, central reading of V2 will be used for comparison with the 
Week 24 reading. The sites will remove patient-identifying information from the imaging data 
header prior to sending the imaging data to the central reader. 
Further details on nasal endoscopy  will be available in a separa te operational ma nual provided to 
the sites. 
3. Lund-Mackay score 
For Japan, in addition to the two coprimary e ndpoints above, the following will also be a 
coprimary endpoint: 
The LMK system is based on localization with  points given for degree of opacification: 
0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total op acification. These points are then applied to the 
maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinus on each side. The OC is 
graded as 0 = not occluded, or 2 = occluded de riving a maximum score of 12 per side. This 
scoring system has been validated in several studies ( 29, 30, 31). 
For patients in whom the OC is missing (because  of a previous surgery) the reader should 
consider the location of the former OC and provide a scoring (as if the OC was there). 
CT scan should be performed anytime during the r un-in period before first administration of IMP, 
and at V8 (Week 24). Whenever possible a cone b eam CT scan should be u tilized. In countries for 
which a specific approval procedure for the CT scan is required by a different committee than the

On a daily basis from V1 and throughout the study, the patient will use an e-diary to: 
• Respond to the morning individual rhinosinusitis symptom questions using a 0 to 
3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms) ( 2):  
- Congestion and/or obstruction. 
- Loss of sense of smell. 
- Anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose). 
- Posterior rhinorrhea (postnasal drip). 
The total symptom score is a composite score (ranging between 0 and 9) consisting of the sum of the following symptoms assessed daily in the morning: NC, decreased/loss of sense of smell, rhinorrhea (average of anteri or/posterior nasal discharge). 
9.2.1.2 Smell test: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) 
The UPSIT (UPSIT 40-odorant test) is a rapid and easy-to-administer method to quantitatively 
assess human olfactory function. The UPSIT show s a high test-retest reliability (r: 0.981) and 
scores on this test are strongly correlated with th e detection threshold for phenyl ethyl alcohol in 
the same individuals. When the UPSIT is administered in the standardized manner, clinical subjects show a high degree of uniformity in UPSIT performance when tested in different 
laboratories. 
The test will be dispensed to the patient by the study site personnel and consists of 4 booklets, 
each containing 10 odorants with one odorant per page. The test-time is about 15 minutes. The 
stimuli are embedded in 10 to 50 (mu) diameter plastic microcapsules on brown strips at the 
bottom of each page. Above each odorant strip is  a multiple choice questio n with 4 alternative 
words to describe the odor. The subject is asked to release the odorant by rubbing the brown-strip

receives a score out of 40 possible correct answers. The final score will be recorded in the e-CRF.  The odorants of the UPSIT test utilized in this study will take into acc ount cultural differences. 
The 40-odorant UPSIT is used in over 1500 clinic s and laboratories thro ughout the US, Canada, 
South America, and Europe, and has been ad ministered to nearly 200 000 people since its 
development in the early 1980s. A particular strength  of this test is that it provides an olfactory 
diagnosis based on comparing the patient's test score with normative data, providing a percentile 
score of an individual relative to his or her age-matched normal group. Fu rthermore, a clinician 
can distinguish patients with a normal sense of smell ("normosmia ") from those with different 
levels of reduction ("mild, moderate and severe microsmia") or loss ("anosmia") ( 32). 
9.2.1.3 Decreased/loss of sense of smell 
The decreased/loss of sense of smell severity is assessed by the patient on a daily basis from V1 
and throughout the study, using an e-diary to using a 0 to 3 categorical scale (where 0 = no 
symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms). 
9.2.1.4 Lund-Mackay score 
Lund-Mackay score is a secondary efficacy endpoint in countries other than Japan. Details of this 
endpoint are presented in Section  9.1.

planned to undergo surgery for NP 
SCS rescue 
Oral steroids for rescue treatment of nasal polyps or for another reason will be prescribed to the 
patient by the site depending on local legislation/regulation. PROs and a nasal endoscopy should 
be performed before starting treatment with SCS.  The Investigator (or designee) records the date 
and dosing information (daily dose, duration, INN) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF. Indication for SCS use will also be captured by selecting one or more of the following categories:  
1. Nasal polyposis 
2. Asthma 
3. Other respiratory disease (specify) 
4. Other ear, nose or thro at disease (specify) 
5. Other reason (specify).

For patients who have a surgery or have a schedul ed date for sino-nasal surgery for NP, the reason 
(worsening signs and/or symptoms during the study) , the expected or actual surgery date, the type 
and outcome of surgery will be recorded in a specific CRF page. If surgery: 
• Is performed during the study treatment peri od, patient and Investigator may decide to 
continue IMP up to the time of surgery or EOT whichever date comes first. At the time of 
surgery patients will be permanently discontinued from study treatment and assessed as soon as possible using the procedures norma lly planned for the EOT Visit and will be 
instructed to return to the study site as described in Section  10.3.1. An AE or SAE page 
will be completed. 
• Is performed during the follow-up the patients will be assessed according to the procedures normally planned for the EOS Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in Section  10.3.1 An AE or SAE page will be completed. 
• If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be performed ar ound the time of planned surgery to document 
the surgery date and outcome. Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
9.2.1.6 22-Item Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) 
The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire to a ssess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on 
HRQoL (Appendix B ). The SNOT-22 has 22 items on a 5-cate gory scale applicable to sino-nasal 
conditions and surgical treatments. The range of  the global score is 0 to 110 and a minimal 
important difference (MID), the smallest difference between clinical trial arms mean change from baseline (point estimates) that will be interprete d as important, of 8.9 ( 33). Lower scores indicate 
less impact and the recall period is the past 2 weeks. There are 5 domains that can be described within SNOT-22, including nasal, ear, sl eep, general and practi cal, and emotional.

9.2.2.1 SCS dose and number of courses 
Total SCS rescue dose prescribed (in mg/year) during the study period and total SCS rescue 
intake in days and courses during the study period could be derived based on SCS dose  
prescribed and intake days  of SCS during the study, recorded in e-CRF pages. 
A course of SCS is considered continuous if treatment is separa ted by less than 7 days. Various 
doses of systemic corticoste roids will be converted to prednisone-equivalent OCS.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 60 9.2.2.2 Visual analog scales (VAS)  
The visual analog scale (VAS) for rhinosinus itis is used to evaluate total severity ( 2). 
Rhinosinusitis disease can be divided into  MILD, MODERATE and SEVERE based on total 
severity VAS score (0 to 10 cm): 
• MILD = VAS 0 to 3 
• MODERATE = VAS >3 to 7 
• SEVERE = VAS >7 to 10. 
The patient is asked to indicate on a VAS the answer to the question: “How troublesome are your 
symptoms of rhinosinusitis?” 
The VAS ranks from 0 (Not troublesome) to 10 (Worst thinkable troublesome) (Appendix D ). 
9.2.2.3 Nasal peak inspiratory flow 
Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) evaluation represents a physiologic measure of the air flow 
through both nasal cavities during forced inspiration expressed in liters per minute. The NPIF is the best validated technique for the evaluation of  nasal flow through the nose. Nasal inspiration 
correlates most with the subjective feeling of obs truction and is the best validated technique for 
monitoring nasal flow in clinical trials. 
On V1, patients will be issued an NPIF meter for recording morning NPIF. Patients will be 
instructed on the use of the device, and written instructions on the use of the NPIF meter will be provided to the patients. In additi on, the Investigator will instruct the patients on how to record the 
following variables in the e-diary on a daily basis. 
• AM NPIF performed within 15 minutes after arising (before 12 noon) prior to taking MFNS.  
Three NPIF efforts will be performed by the patient; all 3 values will be recorded by the patient in the e-diary, and the highest value will be us ed for evaluation. The procedure takes about 
5 minutes. 
Baseline AM NPIF will be the mean AM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to the first 
dose of IMP. If fewer than 4 measurements are collected during the 7 days, the average of the most recent 4 prior to randomization during th e run-in period will serve as the baseline.  
The NPIF will be performed daily from V1 to Week 24 (V8). After V8 the NPIF will be performed every 4 weeks. 
The nasal flow is expressed in liters per minute, and consecutive measurements are performed. 
Taking the best of 3 outcomes with less than 10% variation is consid ered to be the best means of 
expression of the result ( 32).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 61 9.2.2.4 Asthma Control Questionnaire, 6-question version (ACQ-6) in those patients 
comorbid with asthma 
The asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) was designed to measure both the adequacy of 
asthma control and change in asthma control whic h occurs either spontaneously or as a result of 
treatment. Only patients with como rbid asthma will be asked to co mplete the questionnaire in the 
e-diary during clinic visits. Patients should comple te the questionnaire before the spirometry test. 
The ACQ-6 has 6 questions which assess the most common asthma symptoms: 
• Frequency in past week awoken by asthma during the night. 
• Severity of asthma symptoms in the morning. 
• Limitation of daily activities due to asthma. 
• Shortness of breath due to asthma. 
• Frequency of wheezing. 
• Short-acting bronchodilator use. 
Patients are asked to recall how th eir asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to 
the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment) (see 
Appendix E ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-6 score is the mean 
of the 6 questions and, therefore, between 0 (t otally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). 
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Pa tients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately 
controlled asthma and patients w ith scores above 1.0 reflect inad equately controlled asthma. On 
the 7-point scale of the ACQ-6, a change or differ ence in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that 
can be considered clinically  important, corresponding to th e minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID) defined by the developer. 
Measurement properties such as reliability, ability to detect change have been documented in the 
literature ( 34). 
9.2.2.5 Health related quality of life (HRQoL) 
9.2.2.5.1 Euro-QOL-5D 
The European quality of life-5D scale (EQ-5D) ( Appendix C ) is a standardized HRQoL 
questionnaire developed by the EuroQoL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of 
health for clinical a nd economic appraisal ( 35). EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by 
patients. 
The EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The 
EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, se vere problems, and extreme probl ems. The EQ VAS records the

9.2.2.5.2 Short Form 36 (SF-36) Version 2 
The SF-36 (Short-Form-36 (SF-36)-Version 2.0) ( Appendix G ) is a generic questionnaire 
measuring general health status (QoL) in the la st 4 weeks before completing the questionnaire. 
The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire that meas ures eight multi-item d imensions of health: 
physical functioning (10 items) social functioning (2 items) role limitations due to physical 
problems (4 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), mental health (5 items), energy/vitality (4 items), pain (2 items), and general health perception (5 items). 
For each dimension, item scores are coded, summe d, and transformed on to a scale from 0 (worst 
possible health state measured by the questionna ire) to 100 (best possible health state). Two 
standardized summary scores can also be calc ulated from the SF-36; the physical component 
summary (PCS) and the mental h ealth component summary (MCS). 
In this study SF-36 will be assessed only at V2 to evaluate the baseline QoL impact in the defined 
phase 3 population.

clinical chemistry). Clinical laboratory values w ill be analyzed after conversion into standard 
international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. 
• Hematology includes: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell count 
with five-part differential count, and total red blood cell count.  
• Serum chemistry includes: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, uric acid, total 
cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal 
range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), ALT, aspartate 
aminotransferase, alkaline phos phatase, lactate dehydrogen ase, electrolytes (sodium, 
potassium, chloride), bicarbonate, and CPK. 
• HIV screening (anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies)  
• Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). Note: Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is 
positive (≥1:160 titer). 
9.4.3 Hepatitis screening 
Clinical laboratory testing at V1 includes hepatitis screen covering HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), HBcAb including HBcAb IgM and total, and HCVAb. In case of results showing HBsAg (negative), and HBcAb total or HBcAb IgM (positive), an HBV DNA testing must be performed prior to randomization to rule out a false positivity if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive, or to clarify the serological status if the Investigator finds it unclear to interpret in absence of known HBV infection. In case of results showing HCV Ab (positive), an HCV RNA testing may be performed to rule out a false positivity, if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive. 
In countries where there is local regulatory re quirement, for patients who are HBsAg negative and 
HBsAb positive at V1, hepatitis B viral load will be tested at V2 and V8.

9.6 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
Not all of the samples collected during this study may be required for the tests planned in this 
clinical trial. For patients who ha ve consented to it, the samples th at are archived, unused or left 
over after planned testing may be used for additi onal research purposes  
 For patients who have c onsented to it, archival 
blood samples will be collected at the visit specified  in the study flow chart, 10 mL each, will be 
collected into a dry, red topped tube with clottin g activator (or into smaller tubes of equivalent 
total volume) kept at room temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at approximately 
1500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The se rum will then be transferred, in equal portions, 
into 3 storage tubes, which will be immediately capped and frozen in an upright position at -20°C 
or colder. 
These archived serum samples, and any residual or leftover serum, plasma or blood remaining 
from planned laboratory work, may be used for re search purposes related to airway disease, 
response to dupilumab treatment, additional drug safety asse ssments or development and 
validation of bioassay methods beyond t hose defined in the present protocol. 
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers as the ones used during the study (ie, Subject ID, Sample ID). They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting patient confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 
and Section  14.5). 
9.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
Refer to Section  4.4.1 for rationale on the coprimary and secondary endpoints. The proposed 
study design and endpoints will answer important clinical que stions about the efficacy on 
symptoms and objective signs of the disease a nd the effect of dupilumab on reduction of SCS 
rescue therapy and surgery, which are the most re levant clinical practice assessments and reflect 
current standard of care.

Medical history should be recorded consistent with Good Clinical and local practice.  This would 
typically include atopic medical history (including asthma history, hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs, NERD, allergy/atopy history), history of surgeries, concomitant medications, etc. 
10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
This section describes how the visits are carried out, in chronological order (according to the flow chart Section  1.2 and identical to the order shown in the e-CRF): 
The clinical trial consists of 3 periods, using an add-on therapy approach to INCS: 
• Run-in period (28 days +/-3 days; V1). 
• Randomized treatment period (up to 24 weeks +/-3 days; V2 to V8). 
• Post treatment period (24 weeks +/-3 days; V9 and V10). 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection), as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to within the +/-3 day visit window. 
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from treatment, every attempt should be made for the 
patients to return to the study site as soon as possible after last IMP administration to perform all 
assessments planned at the EOT visit, and patients will be asked and encouraged to return to the study site for the visit scheduled as described in Section  10.3.1 (early treatment discontinuation) 
for a 24-week follow-up. 
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form including HIV as required by local regulations,  
must be signed and dated (see Section  12.2). 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of a single visit 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perfo rmed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as 
long as the visit window prior to Day 1 (V2) is respected. These patients do not need to sign a 
new consent form and be allocated a new patient number within  this same window. 
Rescreening 
Patients that fail screening between V1 and V2 may be rescreened for study eligibility only once 
for the following criteria: 
• They do not meet the inclusion criteria for a weekly average NC >1 at V2. 
• They had an acute illness such as acute sinusitis, nasal infection or upper respiratory infection ( E 07). These patients can be rescreened only after complete resolution of 
symptoms. 
• They took one of the proh ibited treatments listed in Section  8.8.1 below between V1 and 
V2.

repeated (refer to Section  8.4 for further instructions related to rescreening) unless a prior 
assessment is performed within the time frame permitted prior to study entry or the V1 baseline 
CT scan of sinuses and spot urine for biomarker sampling were performed. 
Note, no waivers will be approved for randomization; all patients must fulf il all eligibility criteria 
before randomization into the study. 
If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility criteria, these laboratory assessments 
may be repeated, at the discretion of the investigat or, if it is judged to be likely to return to 
acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window. 
For patients who do not fulfil other exclusion crite ria, rescreening should be discussed with the 
Sponsor. In all cases, a given patient can only be re-screened once. 
Order of assessments 
During the treatment and post tr eatment period if necessary, it is possible to perform the study 
procedures within a 3 day period as long as these days are within the scheduled visit window and 
the order of procedur es is maintained. 
It is recommended that assessments/procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order 
if applicable: 
1. Patient-reported outcomes a nd other questionnaires: 
- Daily symptoms of NC, loss of smell a nd anterior and posterior rhinorrhoea 
- SNOT-22 
- VAS rhinosinusitis 
- Reduced sense of taste severity 
- EQ-5D 
- ACQ-6 (in patients with asthma)

Source data is all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are cont ained in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hos pital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. 
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central laboratories, endoscopy, CT scan, NPIF 
measurement, and patient diary meter will be considered source data. HCRU will be collected 
directly in the e-CRF. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Patients who permanently discon tinue treatment earlier than planned during the randomization 
period, will be assessed as soon as possible usin g the procedures normally planned for the EOT 
visit (Refer to Section  10.1.10 Visit 8 (Week 24 +/- 3 days): End of treatment)  
Those patients who permanently discontinue during the post-treatment period will be assessed using the procedures normally planned for the EOS visit.   
Furthermore, all patients will be instructed as follows: 
• Return to the study site for evaluation of NPS, SNOT-22 for all remaining visits 
corresponding to study flowchart.  . 
- CT Scan will be performed at time of  early treatment discontinuation.   
- For those patients where discontinuation occurs  during the treatment period, CT scan 
will  be performed at W24 and not at ETD. An optional CT may be performed at Week 
48. 
- For those patients where early treatment  discontinuation occurs during the post-
treatment period, the week 48 CT  scan will not be performed. 
• Perform PK, ADA sampling at the initially scheduled visits for ADA. 
• Continue to complete the e-diary for NC, an terior and posterior rhinorrhea and loss of 
smell daily symptom evaluation up to Week 48.

• Advise patients with comorbid atopic conditi ons (such as asthma) not to adjust their 
treatment without consultation with their physicians. 
• Report any AE up to the last scheduled visit (Week 48). 
• Contact the Investigator during the post treatment period up to the EOS visit if the 
symptoms worsen requiring medical attention 
- The Investigator will record in the corresponding e-CRF pages rescue medication 
prescribed or surgical interventions during the planned study treatment period. Use of oral steroids for rescue treatment of wors ening nasal polyps or for another reason will 
be captured by the Investigator (or design ee) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF 
page and the date and dosing information (d aily dose, duration, INN) will be informed. 
Details on planned date for surgery, type and outcome (whenever possible) of surgery 
will be recorded in a specific e-CRF page. If surgery is performed during the study 
treatment period or follow-up an AE or SAE page will be completed. 
If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up 
contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date 
and outcome. Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
For patients undergoing surgery for NP please refer to Section  9.2.1.5. 
Procedures to perform and/or report at Week 36 and 48 are as follows: 
• Blood draw and laboratory studies as detaile d in study flowchart for these visits 
• NPIF 
• Vital Signs 
10.3.2 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consid ered by the Investigator because of AEs. 
Reinitiation of treatme nt with the IMP will be made under cl ose and appropriate clinical and/or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with IMP. 
In addition, any of the following conditions  will be a cause for temporary treatment 
discontinuation: 
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the infection is resolved 
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix H .

the appropriate pages of the e-CRF. If the IMP is  interrupted for more than 2 doses, then the 
patient should permanently disc ontinue the study treatment. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients must be withdrawn from the study (ie, fro m any further IMP or study procedure) for the 
following reasons: 
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuati on in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s wellbeing. 
• In case of surgery for NP, refer to Section  9.2.1.5 for details. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a critical protocol deviation, at the request of the Investigator or the 
Sponsor. 
• Any code broken requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
• In the event of an anaphylactic systemic allergic reaction that is related to IMP and that requires treatment. 
• In the event that the patient is diagnosed w ith a malignancy during the study, excluding 
carcinoma in situ of the cervix  or squamous or basal cell. 
• Pregnancy  
• Any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculos is or other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunocom promised status (refer to Appendix J ). 
• Serum ALT >3 ULN and total bilirubin > 2ULN. 
• Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT <2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline ALT >2 ULN.  
Stopping rules described in Appendix H  should be applied.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 87 10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to  recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whicheve r comes last.  
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic and participate in follow-up assessments described in Section  10.3.1. 
Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis ba sed on the overall clinical presentation at the 
time of discontinuation. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of  consent for treatment should be distinguished 
from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient 
contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. If po ssible, the patients shoul d be assessed using the 
procedures normally planned for the end-of-study visit including a systemic drug concentration 
sample with the exception of CT scan. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the I nvestigator in the appropriate screens of the e-
CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at 
least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Inve stigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, re viewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, re ceipt for sending a registered letter). A patient should only be 
designated as lost to follow-up if the site is una ble to establish contact with the patient after 3 
documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e-ma il, certified letter, etc.).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints will be considered.  
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific ju dgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizati on but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medicall y important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix I  for definition of anaphylaxis) 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
• Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse. 
• ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN.

• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling). 
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions. 
• Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study. 
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or nonser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added or removed dur ing a study by protocol amendment. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described Section  10.4.4, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion.  
AESIs for this study include: 
• Anaphylactic or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and that require 
treatment (refer to Appendix I  for the definition of anaphylaxis). 
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours. 
• Any infection meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: 
- Any serious infection (SAE) 
- Requires parenteral (IV, IM, SC) antimicrobial therapy  
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks 
- Is a parasitic infection  
- Is an opportunistic infection (see Appendix J ) 
Note:  Antimicrobial therapy refers to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents. For 
safety instructions, please see Section  10.6.3. 
• Significant elevation of ALT (see Appendix H ) 
- ALT >5 × ULN in patients with baseline ALT < 2 × ULN; or 
- ALT >8 × ULN if baseline ALT >2 × ULN. 
• Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner 
of a male patient entered in the clinical trial.  It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills 1 of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.

participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by 
the Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic 
syringes or pills count) and defined as at least twice the intended dose during an 
interval of less than 11 days.  The circumstan ces (ie, accidental or intentional) should 
be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms. 
Of note, asymptomatic overdose has to  be reported as a standard AE. 
10.4.2 Serious adverse events waived from expedited regulatory reporting to regulatory 
authorities 
Not applicable for this study. 
10.4.3 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, 
corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by 
the study procedure(s). 
The Investigator should take appropriate measures  to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, 
or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that a dditional investigations may be 
requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor. 
When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end 
of the study as defined in Section  10.3.1. 
Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
• Symptomatic and/or  
• Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
• Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
• Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
• Defined as an AESI.

10.4.4 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designee must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to 
further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest  
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE 
notification guidelines described in Section  10.4.4, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
using the corresponding pages of the CRF (to be se nt) or screens in the e-CRF. Instructions for 
AE reporting are summarized in Table 5 . 
10.4.6 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in

10.6.1 Hypersensitivity  
An allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic mAB 
treatments. 
Allergic reactions may be define d as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms experienced 
by patients during or shortly after the pharmacolo gic or biologic agent is given. These reactions 
may present in a variety of ways, including di zziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, hypotension, 
tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticaria/angioedema, flushing, nausea or vomiting, and joint pain with 
fever. Allergic reactions may begin within a few hours and persist up to 24 hours post dosing. 
Refer to Appendix I  “Definition of Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical criteria for the 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
Patients should be monitored for at least 30 mi nutes (or minimum time required by your local 
regulator) after each study-site administered IMP administration for any signs or symptoms of a 
hypersensitivity reaction. Any instance of allerg ic reaction should be reported as an AESI. Any 
anaphylactic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate treatment will be AESI with immediate reporting (within 24 hours) a nd study medication must be permanently 
discontinued. Trained personnel and medications should be available to treat anaphylaxis or any 
severe allergic reaction if it occurs. Furthermore, the study patients will be advised, when the IMP 
is administered at home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a 
hypersensitivity reaction for at least 30 minut es (or minimum time required by your local 
regulator) after administration. 
10.6.2 Severe injection site reactions 
Based on the SC mode of administr ation of high doses of protei n and on a higher incidence of 
local injection site reactions observed at the highest dose level (300 mg weekly) in dupilumab studies, severe injection site re actions, are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience 
an injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site reaction with a future injection. Any severe  injection reaction that lasts over 24 hours will be 
reported as an AESI with immediate notification. ADA and PK sample s will be collected near the 
onset and completion resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis. 
 Prophylactic treatment/premedication for an injection site reaction is not permitted.   
10.6.3 Infections, including opportunistic and parasitic infections 
Some immuno-modulating biologics have been associ ated with an increased risk of infection, 
including opportunistic infection. Though dup ilumab has not been shown to increase the

is required to carefully monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection such as, but not limited to, 
increased body temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, or serious febrile systemic illness. 
Since dupilumab binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 binding and activation of their 
respective receptors, it inhibits the Th2 cytokines productions. Infections with a diversity of 
helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 
response is characterized by production of IL -4 and IL-5, subsequently generating IgG1 
[Immunoglobulin Gamma 1] and IgE-secreting ce lls, and eliciting eosinop hilia. Eosinophilia is 
prominent in a number of helminth ic parasitic diseases. The eosi nophilic response to helminths is 
determined both by the host's immune response an d by the parasite, including its distribution, 
migration, and development within the infected host. Therefore, patient s with treatment of 
dupilumab may potentially have an incr eased risk of parasitic infection. 
Infections defined in Section  10.4.1.3 should be reported as AESIs within 24 hours. 
A complete diagnostic work-up shoul d be performed (ie, cultures, hi stopathological or cytological 
evaluation, antigen detection and serum antibody titers).  Patients should be referred to an 
infectious disease specialist if deemed nece ssary for diagnostic work up and appropriate 
treatment. 
Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the infection is resolved. 
For any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis  or other infections whose nature or course 
may suggest an immunocompromised status (see Appendix J ), patients must be permanently 
discontinued from study medication. In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection is excluded from the 
study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic  infection, or those at high risk of parasitic 
infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (i f necessary) laboratory assessments have ruled 
out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms 
(such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever,  fatigue hepatosplenomegaly) that could be 
associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, extended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers and vectors,  etc.). Subsequent medical a ssessments (eg, stool exam, blood 
tests, etc.) must be performed in order to ru le out parasitic infecti on/infestation. Confirmed 
parasitic infections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate notification.

No preclinical or clinical data  have suggested any hepatic toxi city of dupilumab; however, as a 
general consideration of clinical developmen t, the administration of immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulating agents may represent an addi tional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. 
In order to closely follow liver function tests (LFT), assessment of total protein, albumin, total 
bilirubin, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, and al kaline phosphatase are measured as part of the 
clinical laboratory testing. Clin ical laboratory testing at V1 adds hepatitis screen (HBsAg, 
HBsAb, HBcAb, hepatitis C antibodies [HCAb]). Active hepatitis or patie nts with positive or 
indeterminate HBsAg, HBcAb or positive HCAb at V1 are excluded from the study. 
Guidance for the investigation of elevated LFTs is provided in Appendix H . 
10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and

11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size is chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the efficacy between dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo with regard to the 2 coprimary endpoints, changes from 
baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24.  
The observed mean NC reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 0.95 
and the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To calculate the power, a conservative estimate is used that assumes the placebo adjusted NC reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% of the effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg qw. Thus, the mean NC 
reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w is then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 * (0.95 – 0.26) + 0.26 at 
Week 24. Assuming normal distribution of the cha nge in NC, a common standard deviation (SD) 
of 1.03, which has incorporated a 20% inflati on from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% 
dropout rate, with 120 patients per group, the study will have 95% power to detect an effect size 
of 0.534 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus placebo.  
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilu mab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 1.85 
and the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group is 0.30. Using the same conservative 
approach that assumes the placebo adjusted NPS reduction with the dupilumab 300 mg q2w is 
80% of the effect observed with dupilumab 300 mg  qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is then assumed to be 1.54 = 0.8 * (1.85 – 0.30) + 0.30. Assuming normal 
distribution of the change in NPS, a common SD  of 2.11, which has incorporated a 20% inflation 
from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dr opout rate, with 120 patients per group, the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 96 study will have 98% power to detect an effe ct size of 0.588 using a two-sided test with 
alpha = 0.05 for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group versus 
placebo.  
Therefore, with a sample size of 120 patients per group, the combined power of the 2 coprimary 
efficacy endpoints is at least 93% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming 
no negative correlation between the 2 endpoints. 
The observed mean LMK reduction of the dupilu mab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 9.07 
and the observed mean LMK reduction of the placebo group is 0.23. Using same conservative 
approach that assumes the placebo-adjusted LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
is 80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group is then assumed to be 7.30 = 0.8*(9.07-0.23 )+0.23. Assuming normal distribution of the 
change in LMK, a common standard deviati on (SD) of 5.50, which has incorporated a 20% 
inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 120 patients per 
group, the study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 1.285 using a two-sided test with 
alpha = 0.05 for the change in LMK at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group. 
Therefore, with the same sample size of 120 patients per group, the combined power of the 3 
coprimary efficacy endpoints for Japan is at least 92% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group with 
alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative co rrelation between the 3 endpoints. 
With the same sample size of 120 patients per group, the study w ill have greater than 99% power 
to detect difference between the treatment gr oups for key secondary endpoints change from 
baseline in TSS, UPSIT and loss of smell at Week 24, and will have 98% power to detect 
difference between the treatment groups for the key secondary endpoint change from baseline in 
SNOT-22 at Week 24, using a similar assumption pr ocedure as the change from baseline in NC 
and NPS at Week 24. 
The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor 7.0. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patie nt who signed the informed consent.

For all continuous efficacy endpoints, in the pr imary approach for missing data handling, for 
patients who are indicated to undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data 
collected postsurgery or post SCS will be set to  missing, and the worst postbaseline value on or

visit (for patients whose postbaseline values are al l missing, the baseline will be used to impute), 
and for patients who discontinue th e treatment without being rescue d by surgery or receiving SCS 
on or before the analyzed visit, a MI approach will be used to impute missing value at the certain analyzed visit, and this MI will use all patients who have not been rescued by surgery or receiving 
SCS at that analyzed visit and data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included in 
the analysis. 
For responder type endpoints, patients who are in dicated for surgery for NP or receive SCS for 
any reason will be considered as nonresponders fo r time points after using SCS or surgery; for 
patients who discontinue treatment without using SCS or su rgery, data collected during the 
off-treatment period will be used to determine the responder/non-  responder status, and missing 
data will be considered as non-responders. In addition, the reason and pattern of missing data will be carefully examined and tipping point 
analyses and other sensitivity analyses will also be performed. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by treatment groups . All safety analyses will be 
performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
The baseline value is defined generally as th e last available valu e before randomization. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  the Sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG. 
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the treatment 
emergent period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment 
period, including unscheduled or repeated ev aluations. The number of all such patients 
will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.

Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabeti cal order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage 
(%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurre nces of the same event in the same patient 
will be counted only once in the tables w ithin a treatment phase. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safe ty population within each treatment group.

response, treatment-boosted, a nd undetermined response will be specified in the SAP. 
11.4.4.3 Pharmacodynamics 
The values to be used as baselines will be those collected on Day 1 (predose assessments). If any of the scheduled assessments on Day 1 are techni cally disqualified (eg, insufficient sample) and 
the parameters are measured at any of the run-in pe riod visits, then values determined at the run-in 
period visits can be used as baseline. 
For all parameters, raw data, changes from baseline and percent changes from baseline will be 
summarized in descriptive statistics by treatment arms and time points. 
Summary plots (mean +/- SEM) on raw data, ch anges from baseline and percent changes from 
baseline will be provided by treatment arms.

economics variables) 
Change from baseline in the quantitative variables of EQ-5D-5L (index score) and EQ-5D VAS 
(self-rated health) will be analyzed using the hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in the same fashion as for the coprimary endpoints. Descriptiv e statistics including num ber of patients, mean, 
SEM, and LS means will be pr ovided. In addition, difference in LS means and the corresponding 
95% CI will be provided along with the p-values.  
11.5 FIRST STEP ANALYSIS 
A first step analysis may be performed when a ll patients complete the Week 24 visit, including 
early dropouts. Since this analysis is the final analysis of the coprimary endpoints and other 
24-week endpoints and no decision on the conduct of  the study will be made based on the first 
step analysis (in particular, no decision to prematurely stop the study), there will be no alpha 
adjustment due to the interim analysis. Specific steps will be taken to maintain the blind of the 
study to all individuals involved in th e conduct of the study and/or analysis. 
Individuals involved in the first step analysis of the study will not be involved in the conduct of the study afterwards; individual patient identification will not be released to anyone who is directly involved in the conduct of the study.

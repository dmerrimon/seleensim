1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
  
1.11 To test the hypothesis that treatment with multi- day methotrexate is  
inferior to treatment with pulse actinomycin -D in patients with low -risk 
gestational trophoblastic disease with respect to complete response.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.21 To describe the frequency of post protocol surgical treatment for each arm.  1.22 To describe the frequency of post protocol multi- agent chemotherapy 
treatment for each arm.  
 1.23 To compare multi- day methotrexate to actinomycin -D with respect to 
frequency and severity of adverse events in patients with low- risk 
gestational trophoblast ic neoplasia.  
 1.24 To investigate the impact of treatment on overall QOL and explore the 
influence of treatment on issues such as body image, sexual functioning, and patient reported side effects and disruption. 
 1.25 To assess whether uterine artery pulsatility index (UAPI) can provide 
independent prognostic information predictive of single- drug resistance.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Prior Clinical Trial Evidence  
 Both methotrexate and actinomycin- D are effective first -line drugs for persistent lo w-risk 
gestational trophoblastic disease.  There are several dosing/cycling options for each drug.  When GOG-0174, a phase III randomized trial of bi- weekly IV actinomycin -D versus 
weekly IM methotrexate was initiated in 1999, the most commonly used North American regimen was low dose IM methotrexate.
1,15   In a follow-up phase II dosing study, the 
GOG demonstrated that escalating the methotrexate dose up to 50mg/m2 did not 
significantly alter response when compared to the fixed dose of 30 mg/m2 in the previous 
study.16  Furthermore, Elit et al found that high dose methotrexate  did not demonstrate 
significant additional benefit over the study dosage.23  Single agent actinomycin -D was 
initially reported as a five -day parenteral regimen but it lost favor beca use of alopecia and 
nausea (Wong et al).24  More recently single- injection actinomycin -D was reported to be 
as effective first treatment as weekly methotrexate.19, 20, 22  
 GOG-0174 demonstrated a higher complete response rate for bi- weekly actinomycin -D 
regimen than for the weekly IM methotrexate regimen.
1 GOG-0174 included patients 
with a World Health Organization (WHO) risk score of 0- 6 and patients with metastatic 
- 7 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
disease or choriocarcinoma.  Of the 216 eligible patients, bi-weekly intravenous (IV) actinomycin-D at 1.25mg/m
2 was statistically superior to weekly intramuscular (IM) 
methotrexate at 30 mg/m2 (complete response: 70 vs. 53%; p=0.01).  Similarly, in 
patients with low risk GTN as defined prior to the 2002 WHO risk score revisions (risk score of 0 -4 and excluding choriocarcinoma) response was 58 and 73% in the 
methotrexate and actinomycin -D arms, respectively (p=0.03).  Both regimens were less 
effective if the WHO risk score was 5 or 6 or if the diagnosis w as choriocarcinoma 
(complete response: 9 and 42%, respectively).  There were two potential recurrences; one at four months (actinomycin-D) and one at 22 months (methotrexate).  Not all patients completed follow- up.  Both regimens were well tolerated.  
 Whil e the results of GOG -0174 are compelling evidence that pulse actinomycin- D is the 
more effective single day regimen, many Trophoblastic Disease Centers continue to use multi- day methotrexate regimens because of a perception of higher complete response 
rates in the absence of a randomized controlled trial.  Controversy exists over the relative toxicity and efficacy of these commonly used regimens compared with the pulse actinomycin -D regimen.   
 
Rationale for Selected Approach and Trial Design  
 
The abrupt ps ychological shift experienced by a woman facing a diagnosis of gestational 
trophoblastic disease can be traumatic.
4 The excitement and anticipation of a future child 
to the sadness associated with the loss of a viable pregnancy to the anxiety and fear connected with a potentially malignant and life -threatening condition is profound and 
certainly unique to this disease entity.
5 However, low- risk gestational trophoblastic 
neoplasia (GTN) is a highly curable disease.    There are many effective single-drug chemotherapy regimens; however, the choice of both the drug and regimen is highly institution specific.  There is no consensus on the best regimen for the primary treatment of GTN.  While the most important objective of treatment in these young reproductive-a ged women is effectiveness and lower risk of 
exposure to multi-drug second-line regimen, other considerations, including short- term 
toxicity, side -effects and treatment issues (i.e., cost efficiency, administration, patient 
preference and compliance) and Q OL become paramount and warrant investigation as 
targeted outcomes.  The goal would be to identify the most effective single agent chemotherapy, recognizing the significant negative impact of multi- agent chemotherapy 
on possible reproductive issues (early menopause),
6 risk of secondary cancer7, 8 and 
ultimately QOL if multi-agent chemotherapy is required for cure.  The GOG-0174 study conducted by members of this study team, as mentioned above, examined biweekly actinomycin -D and weekly methotrexate and both regimens were 
well tolerated.
1 However, questions remain regarding differences in drug dosages, 
schedules, administration methods and length of therapy delivered after hCG normalization.
9 These concerns have been addressed within the design of the proposed 
randomized clinical trial by clearly outlining the treatment modalities for each study arm.  The proposed study will also include areas not formally assessed in previous studies 
- 8 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
using patient reported outcomes (PROs) to prospectively examine patient’s overall QOL during the treatment process and immediate surveillance period.  This will enable us to examine to the influence of treatment factors, short -term toxicities, and side effects on 
QOL, which may be crucial when survival outcomes are both excellent and expected to be equivalent.   This comparative effectiveness research has the potential to establish a new resource sensitive standard acceptable worldwide.  This study will compare pulse actinomycin- D 
with the standard therapies used at the expert centers around the world.  If the com plete 
response rate for multi-day methotrexate is not better than bi- weekly pulse actinomycin -
D, women will have a clear option for a more convenient, less toxic treatment regimen.  QOL assessment will also provide valuable information from the patient’s p erception to 
be included in determining a worldwide standard.   Upfront complete response is an important endpoint because approximately 25%
1, 2 of 
women failing to achieve complete response with their initial chemotherapy regimen ultimately require surger y and/or multi-agent etoposide based chemotherapy.  In GOG-
0174 the complete response rate for pulse actinomycin- D was 71%.
1  Lurain et al.2 
described the toxicity and efficacy of the 5 day methotrexate regimen noting 4.7% of patients experienced toxicity requiring a change from methotrexate to actinomycin -D and 
an 89.3% (226/253) complete remission rate to initial single- agent methotrexate 
(0.4mg/kg IV push qd x 5d qo week).  Berkowitz described the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center experience with the 8 day methotrexate with folinic acid 
rescue regimen with a 90% complete response rate.
3  A recent Cochrane review 
concluded that the 8 day regimen did not offer an advantage in efficacy or adverse event profile over the 5 day regimen.    While past research has described various treatment outcomes from chemotherapy and surgery, the health consequences and psychosocial aspects have been minimally explored and rarely in a prospective manner or with PROs.  Survey studies have shown quality of life to be negatively impacted by chemotherapy, regardless of the regimen.
10,11  A trend 
of lower QOL exists between those requiring chemotherapy treatments to those who do not.
10 In a cross -sectional survey study, women with active disease (n=11) demonstrated 
greater concerns, fear and threats to self -esteem than women in remission.11  Yet, another 
recent study described no significant effect of chemotherapy on QOL, but the number of patients surveyed during active treatment (out of n=54) was not provided.
12  Formal 
assessment of QOL over the course of treatment will allow for a more thorough 
examination of possible treatment influences on QOL such as delivery, number of chemotherapy cycles, type of chemotherapy, compliance and life disruption.   Attention to acute side -effects/short -term toxicities and their impact on QOL is an 
important area for consideration and noted need in the comparison of chemotherapy regimens.
9  This is of particular relevance in a population with an excellent survival 
outcome of more than 98%.8  For example, the side- effects of alopecia is often under -
reported in oncology clinical trials,1 and has been coded as a dermatologic event in past 
studies.  Difficulty with body image (unattractive, feeling less of a woman) and sexuality 
- 9 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
(difficulty with  sex and fear that sex would worsen disease) have been described in 
women with active disease with greater levels of distress.11  Patient reported outcomes are 
needed to understand patient’s perception (i.e. body image) and the experience of treatment effects on QOL.    It is recognized that overall QOL is a multi-faceted domain including physical, functional, social, and emotional factors.  We will examine these subcomponents within this study design based on the GTD/GTN literature.  Our goal is to determi ne which 
treatment is best tolerated with less negative impact on QOL while simultaneously assessing the effectiveness of the proposed chemotherapies.  Issues of social support, emotional well-being and gynecologic issues have been described as having influence on QOL in this population.  For example, studies investigating QOL after GTD have identified greater social support (p<.0001) and less disease specific distress (p<.0001) to be associated with high quality of life scores.
5  In additional analyses, le ss gynecologic 
concerns (i.e., pain) were significant predictors of positive QOL.5  Other research in 
women with a history of molar pregnancies found issues of emotional well-being (anxiety, depression)
10 and sexual dysfunction were experienced by participants.10,13 
While these studies highlight some significant psychosocial effects experienced by survivors of GTD, acute and short-term health consequences of newly diagnosed GTN patients requires further prospective investigation.  In particular, psychosocia l distress has 
been noted to be more pronounced in the initial months of diagnosis.
10 
  This study will prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of two types of chemotherapy treatments and explore factors (social support/ emotional/ gynecologic issues) that may influence QOL.  In addition, we will determine if these findings may vary by type of chemotherapy treatment, number, or length of treatment and/or in surveillance.  Quality of life predictors of social support may also buffer distress in these women.
14   As we 
measure QOL within this study, we will also examine for potential buffering effects.  
 It should be noted that long- term toxicities have also been identified as an important area 
for future research.  However, difficulties arise when studying this population, as many women are not followed at cancer centers beyond the 6 months after hCG normalization due to low recurrence rates.
1,8,9  Although it is recognized as important for further 
research, it is beyond the scope of this comparative effecti veness chemotherapy trial.  
 Rationale for Optional Doppler Ultrasonography of the Uterine Artery   Neo-angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a critical step in 
tumorogen esis.
27  Neo -angiogenesis is associated with increased tumor growth, 
acquisition of metastatic potential, drug resistance and poor prognosis in a number of solid tumo center s such as breast, lung and ovarian cancer.
28,29,30,31  Histological 
asssessment of m icrovessel density (MVD) with CD34 immunostaining is used to assess 
angiogenesis in these tumors. In contrast, MVD assessment is not possible in GTN as biopsy is frequently contraindicated because of the risk of precipitating life- threatening 
hemorrhage in this highly vascular disease. Instead, the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of rising hCG levels post-molar pregnancy. Agarwal et al.  previously proposed the 
- 10 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
use of Doppler ultrasonography as a non- invasive alternative to assess tumor vascularity 
in GTN, using the uterine artery pulsatility index (UAPI) .32 The UAPI is inversely 
proportional to tumor vascularity, and a low UAPI is indicative of increased arteriovenous shunting, a feature of the abnormal neo- angiogeneisis characteristic of 
tumors.  In that sudy of 164 patients with GTN, a UAPI of ≤1 was shown to be an 
independent predictor of methotrexate resistance (MTX -R) and in combination with the 
Charing Cross Hospital (CXH) scoring system improve prediction of MTX- R.  In 
particular, the risk of MTX- R in patients with medium- risk CXH scores of 6 –8 with a 
UAPI of ≤1 was increased to 72.7% from a baseline risk of 56.3% in this group. These findings suggested that UAPI might be a useful additional variable to incorporate into the prognostic scoring sys tems to help refine which patients might be treated with EMA -CO 
chemotherapy upfront.   To assess whether the UAPI could also contribute to the FIGO scoring system Agarwal et al. recently repeated this single center study. The  results , published in 2012, c onfirm that 
UAPI is an independent predictor for MTX-R in low risk GTN patients (FIGO score 0- 6) 
following a hydatidiform mole .
33 In this study, 239 patients were assessable for both 
UAPI and MTX-R. The median UAPI was lower (higher vascularity) in MTX- R 
compared with MTX-sensitive patients (0.8 vs 1.4, p<0.0001). In multivariate logistic regression, UAPI≤1 predicted MTX-R, independent of both CXH and FIGO scores. The risk of MTX -R in patients with a FIGO score of 6 and UAPI ≤ 1 was 100% vs 20% in 
patients with UAPI ≤ 1 ( chi-sq. p<0.0001).   
 It was  proposed that it might be helpful to consider adding the UAPI to the FIGO scoring 
system.  We believe it would be helpful to first prospectively validate these findings in a 
multicente r study. This would demonstrate the utility of the approach across cente rs in 
many countries.      
 In the case of gestational trophoblastic tumors where nearly all patients are cured with existing therapies, the incorporation of UAPI into the scoring system would help to more accurately select patients for combination chemotherapy,  resulting in less total treatment time and toxicity.
32  Based on these prior data, we are asking institutions to collect and 
report Doppler assessments of the uteri ne arteries, to further validate these findings in the 
context of a multi-center randomized prospective study, to determine if UAPI should be considered for incorporation in to FIGO scoring.  While this is an optional study and does not preclude institutio ns from participating in the main study, we strongly encourage 
centers to participate, as the Doppler assessment can be conducted rapidly at the time of baseline staging ultrasound scans prior to commencement of chemotherapy.

basis.  To access OPEN, the site user must have an active CTEP -IAM account 
(check at < https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/index.jsp >) and a 'Registrar' role 
on either the LPO or participating organization roster.  All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study.  It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data .  OPEN can be 
accessed at https://open.ctsu.org or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ 
side of the website at https://www.ctsu.org . 
 All site staff  will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study.   OPEN can be 
accessed on the GOG web menu page by clicki ng on the OPEN link.  
  
Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should verify the following:   
- 20 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated 
timeframes.  Site staff should use the registration forms provided on the 
group web site as a tool t o verify eligibility.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form  (if applicable).   
  
Note:   The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of 
registration and treatment information.    Please print  this confirmation for your 
records.   
 Access requirements for OPEN:  
  
• Site staff will need to be registered with CTEP and have a valid and active 
CTEP -IAM account. This is the same account (user id and password) used 
for the CTSU members' web site.  
• To perform registrations, the site user must have been assigned the 
'Registrar' role on the GOG or CTSU roster.  
• To perform registrations you must have an equivalent 'Registrar' role on 
the Lead Group roster.  Role assignments are handled through the Groups 
in which you are a member.  
  
Note:   The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable 
confirmation of registration and treatment information.    Please print this 
confirmation for your records.    Further instructional information is  provided on the CTSU members' web 
site OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL.  For any additional questions 
contact the CTSU Help Desk at 1 -888-823- 5923 or 
ctsucontact@westat.com .  
 NOTE:  Each participating site must make a O NE TIME declaration of the 
methotrexate administration schedule to be used exclusively at their site. Prior to the registration of a site’s first patient, a representative must sign on to the GOG Web Menu and use the GOG methotrexate declaration application located under 
the Registration column. Sites will indicate the methotrexate administration 
schedule that will be used exclusively at the site for the duration of the study. The representative will choose the methotrexate  schedule from a drop down list 
provided.  The site representative must be in the GOG roster with an active status at 
the site who is a DM1, DM2, PI1, or PI2.  The site must have approved IRB status to make the declaration.  Once a site registers their first patient, they will no longer be 
able to change the selected methotrexate administration schedule.   This schedule 
must be used for all other patients put on this study.  (03/11/2013)

NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
The methotrexate administration choices are as follows:  
 IV methotrex ate daily for 5 days. 
 OR 
 IM  methotrexate on days 1,3,5,7. 
 
5.3 Treatment Plan  
 One of two treatment regimens will be randomly allocated in equal proportions within strata.  The strata are determined by the following factors:  
  Country where treatment is given (US, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, United Kingdom, etc.) 
 Multi- day methotrexate regimen (8 - or 5 -day) used by the participating 
site as stated on the one time methotrexate declaration form.    
 
5.31 Study Regimens  
 
Eligible, consented patients will be randomized to one of the following two study regimens:  
 Regimen 1 :  Patients will receive IV pulse actinomycin -D (1.25 mg/m
2) 
once every 14 days.  Maximum dose is 2 mg.    Regimen 2 :  Patients will receive their institutional preference of either IV 
methotrexate (0.4mg/kg) daily for 5 days every 14 days with a maximum 
daily dose of 25 mg.  
OR 
IM methotrexate (50mg) on Days 1,3,5,7 (4 doses per cycle) with Leucovorin (15mg) orally on Days 2, 4, 6, 8 within 24-30 hours of the preceding day ’s injection.  R epeated every 14 days.     
 Leucovorin Administration 
 
 Patients receiving IM methotrexate will be instructed to take Leucovorin PO between 24 -30 hours after the preceding injection. If a patient misses a dose of Leucovorin she should be instructed to take the pill as soon as she remembers unless it is within 12 hours of the next scheduled methotrexate dose. If it is 12 hours or closer to the next IM methotrexate injection, the patient should be instructed to skip that dose. 
  A medication calendar (Appendix IV) is provided for patients to record 
intake of Leucovorin. Completed calendars should be returned with empty bottles of drug. (03/11/2013)

5.32 Potential Drug Interactions 
  
It is anticipated that nausea and vomiting may be a side effect of both 
methotrexate and actinomycin -D.  Institutional guidelines for antiemetic 
administration should be followed.  It is suggested that NCCN guidelines be followed ( see GOG -0275 webpage to download).  (03/11/2013) 
 Supplements with a high folic acid level should not be taken while on study.  
 In addition, patients should be advised to avoid taking NSAIDS while on treatment with methotrexate and to discuss with their physician.  
 Use of sunscreen should be advised for all study patients as actinomycin -
D and methotrexate can cause skin reactions when exposed to sun.  
 
5.33 Treatment Schedule  
 
A Cycle is 14 days .  
The patient must receive her first cycle of treatment 
within 2 weeks of entry onto the study.  
  A call  (by site staff)  will be placed to the patient prior to every other 
treatment cycle to (1) assess toxicity and (2) encourage compliance.   
  Patients will be treated for three cycles after hCG<5mIU/ml or until evidence of treatment failure (biologic progression), disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications.  Upon normalization of hCG (<5mIU/ml), patients will be treated with three additional cycles.  
HCG levels will then be monitored every 4 weeks  beginning with the 1
st 
day of the last  chemotherapy  cycle , for the next 52 weeks to complete one 
full year of follow up.  QOL questionnaires are to be completed by all patients at 26 weeks.     
 Patients will be treated for a maximum of 20 cycles if hCG remains 
elevated  (above 5mIU/ml). (05/28/2013) 
 
5.34  Doppler Ultrasound to Measure UAPI  
At the time of the baseline pelvic ultrasound, centers participating in the optional UAPI component of the study should use Doppler ultrasound  to measure the left and right uterine artery pulsatility indices (UAPI).  UAPI 
can be calculated automatically by most machines using the autotrace functionality.  The PI value is calculated by the machine and appears on the report.  A representative sample of 3 cardiac cycles (pulses) should be measured for the left artery as close to the uterus as possible.  Perform this 
- 23 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
measurement three separate times and record the lowest of the three PI values on the Pelvic Ultrasound GTN (PUG) form. Repeat this same process for the right uterine artery, recording the lowest PI value on the PUG.  
 If Doppler ultrasonography is performed but the UAPI is not recorded, please mark “not specified” on the report.  If your site does not have access to Doppler ultrasonography, please record “not done” on the Pelvic Ultrasound Measurements Report. 
 
5.4 Criteria for Removal from Treatment  
 
5.41 Inability to tolerate the lowest dose because of toxicity  (e.g., inability to 
tolerate the allocated treatment due to repeated grade 4 toxicity that does not respond to supportive measures). 
 5.42 Treatment failure (biologic progression) or disease progression that is 
defined in Section 8. 
 5.43 Treatment non -compliance that  is defined to be less than 75% of planned 
or protocol-modified dose over 3 cycles. 
 5.44 Patients may refuse further intervention or completely withdraw consent 
from the study at any time for any reason.  If a patient elects to discontinue further study treatment and/or intervention prior to protocol specification and elects to receive alternate therapy, this information should be specifically documented as consent allows.  Additionally, if the patient 
withdraws from the treatment portion of the study, hCG levels should still be obtained per protocol schedule. 
 
5.45 Pregnancy  
 
5.5 Quality of Li fe Assessment  
 
Quality of Life surveys are to be obtained at 5 time points:  Prior to cycle 1  
 Prior to cycle 3 (If off study  therapy , 4 weeks after starting study 
treatment)  
 Prior to cycle 5 (If off study  therapy , 8 weeks after starting study 
treatment)  
 Prior to cycle 7 (If off study therapy , 12 weeks after starting study 
treatment)  
 26 weeks after starting study treatment

6.5 Gastrointestinal and Other Toxicities  
 
6.51  Nausea and emesis:  
 
6.511   Nausea and emesis are anticipated with all regimens but are not 
expected to be incapacitating .  Reassessment of IV and oral 
antiemetics for appropriate adjustments should be considered.  Please refer to  the NCCN guidelines (on the GOG-0275 webpage) 
for supportive care guidelines. (03/11/2013) 
 6.512   No dose adjustment is to be made for nausea and emesis.  6.513   Treatment will be delayed for Grade 3 toxicity until resolution to             Grade 2 or less is reached.  Protocol treatment will be discontinued 
for Grade 4 toxicity. 
    
6.52  Stomatitis and other GI, renal or hepatic toxicities:  
 6.521 If a patient experiences Grade 2 stomatitis, treatment will be delayed until resolution to Grade 1.  Grade 3 stomatitis will require a one dose level reduction at the start of the next cycle once resolution to Grade 1 is reached.  Protocol treatment will be discontinued for Grade 4 stomatitis. 
 6.522  Treatment will be delayed for Grad e 3 gastrointestinal, renal or 
hepatic toxicity until resolution to Grade 2 or less is reached .  
Protocol treatment will be discontinued for Grade 4 toxicity  
 
6.53 Pleuritis:  
 
6.531 For Grade 3 pleuritis, hold treatment until resolution to Grade 2 or 
lowe r. 
   6.532 For Grade 4 toxicity the patient will be taken off study treatment.  
 
6.54 Potential modifications for other non- hematologic toxicities not listed, 
with an  impact on organ function of Grade 3 (or greater) require 
discussion with one of the study chairs. 
 
Applicable to all toxicities, study treatment should be discontinued if 
treatment is delayed longer than 2 weeks.

7.4 Quality of Life  
 
7.41 Refer to sections 5.4; 7.1; 7.42; 8.6 and 10.2 for description and collection 
times of the QOL study assessments . 
 7.42 Timing of the Quality of Life Assessments  
 
To measure the difference in QOL  following initiation of treatment on this 
study, the following time points for QOL assessments  are planned:  
 
7.421 At baseline (prior to cycle 1) 7.422 Prior to cycle 3 (4 weeks after starting study treatment if off study treatment prior to cycle 3)  
7.423 Prior to cycle 5 (8 weeks after starting study treatment if off study treatment prior to cycle 5)  
7.424 Prior to cycle 7 (12 weeks after starting study treatment if off study treatment prior to cycle 7)  
7.425 26 weeks after the start of study treatment.  
    
While still on study treatment, assessments will be completed as planned at initial treatment visits for appropriate cycles prior to obtaining knowledge of hCG value changes or treatment changes.    
7.43     Quality of life forms will be provided by the SDC upon request.  Requests 
for non-English versions should be made to the Statistical and Data Center.   
 7.44     Whenever possible, the QOL survey should be administered at the clinic 
visit before the patient is seen by the physician, before evaluations are performed, and before test results are shared with her.  In the event that the questionnaires are not administered at the clinic visit, the QOL data can be collected by telephone or mail as back -up methods, with telephone data 
collection being the preferred back -up method.   
  
7.45     The Quality of Life Liaison (GOG Nurse/Data Manager) at each 
institution has overall responsibility for the administration of the study questionnaire. 
  7.46     The GOG Nurse/Data Manager should read the instructions printed on the 
questionnaire to the patient and ensure that the patient understands the instructions.  It is important to assure the patient that all material on the 
- 29 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
questionnaire is confidential and will not be shared with the health care team, and that it will not become part of the medical record.  
  
7.47     Assistance in reading the questionnaire is permitted if the patient is unable 
to complete the questionnaire on her own (e.g., difficulty in reading, elderly).  It is important not to influence the response of the patient.  Note why the patient required assistance and what assistance was given.   
  7.48     Patients should be instructed to answer all the questions regardless of 
whether the symptoms or conditions asked about are related to the cancer or cancer treatment.  Discourage family members from being present during questionnaire completion or from influencing the patient's response.   
  7.49     Review the questionnaire for completeness before the patient leaves.     
7.491   If the patient has marked more than one answer per question, ask 
the patient which answer best reflects how she is feelin g.    
  
7.492   If the patient has skipped a question or questions, assure that she 
noted in the space provided that she has chosen not to answer those questions.   
  7.410   It is essential that the questionnaires be completed according to the 
schedule described in Section 7.42.   
  7.411   If the patient refuses or cannot complete the questionnaire at any time, she 
should be asked to do so at the next scheduled admini stration time.   
  7.412   Prior to submitting the QOL Scantron to the GOG Statistical and Data 
Center, be sure the following information is recorded and coded in: 
    a) patient's complete GOG number  
b) date of form completion 
   c) study time point for which the form is being completed

NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
8.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA   
 
8.1 Evaluability  
 
8.11 Patients evaluable for response are those who have received one or more cycles of drug and have a sufficient number of bi- weekly  test results to 
fulfill one of the response categories. 
 8.12 Patients are evaluable for assessment of adverse effects (toxicity) if they have received a minimum of one injection or infusion of treatment. 
 
8.2. Clinically Assessed Response  
   
Institutiona l hCG test results will be used to define the dichotomous primary 
clinical response measure and to evaluate the primary objective.  Reporting should be in terms of the best response achieved in a given case. 
 
8.21 Complete Response  will be defined as 3 consecutive bi- weekly values of 
hCG<5 over a minimum of 4 weeks of normal hCG values with no values greater than 5 mIU/ml on the BMR form.  Report best response as 
“Complete Response” on Form Q0 per Section 10.2  
 
8.22 Treatment Failure (biologic progression) is defined as: 
 
8.221  A < 10% decrease in the hCG levels using as a reference first value in the series of 4 values taken over at least a 3-week  period.  
  OR  
 
8.222  A > 20% sustained rise in the hCG taking as a reference the first 
value in the series of 3 values taken over at least a 2 -week period.  
 OR  
 8.223  Two consecutive hCG levels above 5 mIU/ml after the institutional 
normal has been reached taken at least one w eek apart.  
  OR  
 8.224 hCG levels remain elevated above 5 mIU/ml after 20 cycles of 
treatment.  (05/28/2013) 
 OR 
 8.225  New metastatic disease based on either clinical findings or radiologic Investigations while on study treatment or during the follow-up period. 
 
If any of the criteria in 8.221-8.225 are met then report “Biologic Progression” as best response on Form Q0.   
- 31 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
 
8.23  Persistent disease  is defined as 4 consecutive hCG values over 6 weeks 
that fluctuate within the range of 5 to 50 mIU/ml .  Special consideration  is 
required for patients with persistent hCG levels  as this may not reflect 
treatment failure . For patients that develop persistent disease with less 
than 50 IU/ml, steps need to be taken to rule out false positive hCG, quiescent hCG, or phantom hCG. You should contact the study chair for discussion.  
  
8.3 Disease Progression  is defined as new metastatic disease findings from clinical or 
radiological investigations or a sustained elevation in hCG levels above 5 mIU/ml after documentati on of a complete response (two consecutive levels above 
5mIU/ml taken at least one week apart).   
 
8.4 Other Objective Parameters  
 
8.41  A cycle is defined as planned treatment for a period of 14 days.   8.42  The major toxicities of each regimen will be collected and compared using 
standard CTCAE version 4.0 toxicity criteria. 
 
8.5  Quality of Life Assessments  
   
The measures selected to comprise the Quality of Life assessment will include: 1) an overall quality of life measure addressing: physical sympto ms, functional well -
being , social well -being and emotional well-being, 2) supplemental items drawn 
from the FACIT scales addressing additional domains based on the GTN literature regarding potential toxicities, side -effects and treatment issues that can 
impact QOL and 3) two exploratory items about treatment factors.  The QOL assessment will be administered at medical appointments and take approximately 15 to 20 minutes. 
 
8.51 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT -G) will be used to 
measure overall quality of life .  The FACT -G is a 27 -item scale measuring 
QOL in patients with cancer.25 It includes four subscales: 1) physical well-being {FACT-PW subscale} with 7 items  (a=.82) - e.g., I have lack 
of energy; 2) functional well-being {FACT- FW su bscale} with 7 items 
(a=.80), - e.g., I am able to work; 3) social well-being {FACT- SW 
subscale} with 7 items (a=.69) - e.g., I feel close to my friends; and 4) emotional well-being {FACT- EW subscale} with 6 items (a=.74) - e.g., I 
feel sad .  The total alp ha coefficient is.89, supported by factor analysis.  
Participants rate on a 5 -point Likert -type scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 
2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much).  The subscales are summed for a total score ranging from 0 -108, and a higher score  i ndicates better QOL .  
The mean in a population of mixed cancer patients was 82.06 +/- 15.86.  The FACT -G is available in multiple languages.  
- 32 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
 
8.52 FACIT Supplemental Items: have been added to the QOL assessment 
based on a review of previous GTD/ GTN studies and identified toxicities and side effects  from actinomycin -D and methotrexate noted in the 
literature.  As the FACIT items are available in multiple languages, specific items were selected from the FACT disease specific subscales addressing potential factors that may influence the QOL of GTN patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment.  Three items from FACT- N 
(Neutropenia) addressing blood counts, energy and mouth sores; Three items from the FACT -O (ovarian) addressing hair loss, appearance; Three 
items from FACT -Cx (cervical) addressing body image & sexual function 
and two from FACT- En (endometrial) addressing fatigue and gyn concern 
(pain).  These items are also available in multiple languages.  
   
8.53 Two exploratory items were created specific to t reatment concerns: 1) 
Likert scale evaluation degree of life disruption from chemotherapy treatment and 2) rank item addressing factors associated with chemotherapy treatment ( e.g. requirement per week and length of time per 
treatment) .  These will be avai lable for an exploratory analysis in English 
speaking patients.

9.0 DURATION OF STUDY     
  
Patients will be treated for three cycles after hCG <5mIU/ml  or treatment failure 
(biologic progression), disease progression or unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications .  All subjects will be followed for a period ending 2 years after study entry .  
Quality of life will be assessed for all study patients at 26 weeks from the start of treatment, regardless of treatment status .  
  NOTE:   The Q0  form  is due at  treatment completion  (See Section 10.2).  The Q form is 
due quarterly during the follow-up period.  HCG values will be reported every 4 weeks on the BMR form.

10.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES   
 10.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR A COMMERCIAL AGENT  
(11/24/2014) 
  
 
10.11 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
 An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that occurs in a patient administered a medical treatment, whether the event is considered related or unrelated to the medical treatment.  
 The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting .  All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0.  A copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The CTCAE v4.0 Manual is also available on the GOG member web site ( http://www.gog.org under MANUALS).  
 
10.12 Reporting Expedited Adverse Events  
 Depen ding on the phase of the study, use of investigational or commercial 
agents, and role of the pharmaceutical sponsor, an AE report may need to reach multiple destinations.  For patients participating on a GOG trial, all expedited AE reports should be submitted by using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) .  All CTEP -AERS  submissions are 
reviewed by GOG before final submission to CTEP -AERS .  Submitting a 
report through CTEP -AERS  serves as notification to GOG, and satisfies 
the GOG requirements for expedited AE reporting.  All adverse reactions will be immediately directed to the Study Chair for further action.  
 The requirement for timely reporting of AEs to the study sponsor is specified in the Statement of Investigator, Form FDA -1572.  In signing the 
FDA -1572, the investigator assumes the responsibility for reporting AEs 
to the NCI.  In compliance with FDA regulations, as contained in 21 CFR 312.64, AEs should be reported by the investigator.

• Grade 4 and Grade 5 unexpected events  
CTEP -AERS  7 calendar day report:  
• Grade 3 unexpected events with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 5 expected events  
 
2 Although a CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification is not required for death clearly related to progressive disease, a full report is 
required as out lined in the table.  
 
 Please see exceptions below under the section entitled, “Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited 
Reporting Requirements for Phase 2 and 3 Trials Utilizing a Commercial Agent .”          March 2005  
 
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
• Expedited AE reporting timelines defined: 
 “24 hours; 3 calendar days” – The investigator must initially report the AE via CTEP -
AERS within 24 hours  of learning of the event followed by a complete CTEP -AERS  
report within 3 calendar days  of the initial 24 -hour report. 
“7 calendar days” – A complete CTEP -AERS  report on the AE must be submitted within 
7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event. 
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization 
(or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported regardless of attribution  and designation as expected or unexpected  with the exception of any 
events  identified as protocol- specific expedited  adverse event  reporting  exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/in capacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects must be reported to GOG via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs 
following treatment with a commercial agent.

10.141 CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reports : Expedited reports are to be 
submitted using CTEP -AERS  available at http://ctep.cancer.gov .  
The CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for expedited adverse event reporting requirements are also available at this site.   
 
AML/MDS events must be reported via CTEP -AERS (in addition 
to routine AE reporting mechanisms).  In CTCAE v4.0, the event(s) may be reported as either: 1) Le ukemia secondary to 
oncology chemotherapy, 2) Myelodysplastic  syndrome, or 3) 
Treatment related secondary malignancy.  
 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted a 24-hour notification is to be made to GOG by telephone at: 215-854-0770.  An electronic report MUST
 be submitted immediately upon re-
establishment of internet connection.  Please note that all paper CTEP -AERS  forms have been removed from the CTEP website

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
 
11.1 Study Design and Treatment Randomization: 
This study is designed as a two arm randomized phase III non- inferiority trial 
with a control arm using actinomycin -D (ACT -D) and an experimental arm using 
one of two multi-day methotrexate (MTX) regimen chosen by the participating site.  The design will provide a direct assessment of the null hypothesis that the efficacy attributed to multi- day methotrexate regimens is inferior to that of ACT -
D given every two weeks.  Each IRB- approved participating site will declare 
upfront which MTX regimen they will use for the duration of the trial.   
  Prior to patient registration, eligibility will be reviewed by FFS verification.  The sequence of treatment assignments will be concealed from institutions and patients until registration with verification of eligibility.  Patients will be registered by the participating site through OPEN and randomization will be carried out centrally by the GOG Statistical and Data Center.  The randomization will be stratified by the country (a surrogate for health care system) where treatment is given and the multi- day methotrexate regimen to be used by the 
institution using a minimization procedure that tends to allocate two study arms in a ratio of 1 to 1 within strata.  
 
11.2 Efficacy and toxicity measures                                                                                       
The principal observations for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of treatments are listed below (see Section 8 for definitions).  
 11.21 Primary efficacy endpoint:  complete response vs, treatment failu re 
 
11.22 Safety endpoints:  severity of adverse events 
 
11.23 Factors to be tested for association with treatment failure:  W.H.O. risk score, choriocarcinoma histology, uterine artery pulsatility index 
 
11.3 Statistical study design and planned analyses of therapeutic efficacy  
 11.31 Accrual goal: 38 4 patients  
The maximum target accrual includes an expected 5% of patients to be deemed ineligible after central review.  
 
11.32 Accrual rate: Originally, 80 patients per year was the expected accrual rate.  However during the first  3 years the accrual was much lower than 
anticipated.  Efforts to expand accrual to international sites were 
completed near the end of the third year of accr ual.   
 
The following is a revised estimate of annual accrual rates over time.   
Year 1:  9  Year 2:  14  Year 3:  27  Year 4 +:  ≥ 60  
  
- 40 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
GOG accrual for protocol 174 averaged 31 patients per year.  We expect ed 
increased GOG site participation based on the flexibility in the experimental arm.  Assuming a 25% increase in accrual rate (40) from that observed on GOG 174 from GOG sites and additional accrual of 40 patients per year from non-GOG sites that have expressed support for this study the expected annual accrual rate was 80 patients.  This accrual rate 
has been revised based on actual accrual through the first 2.5 years. (  )  
 
11.33 Study duration: 60 months assuming an average annual accrual rate of 80.  
Assuming the revised accrual rates, the accrual  duration is expected to be 
8.6 years or less.  A follow-up period of up to 6 months may be necessary to observe and report response in all patients .  Additional time may be 
necessary to obtain all required QOL assessments.  All required follow-up will end 24 months following the last enrollment.  (  ) 
 11.34 Primary hypothesis  
The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the complete response attributed to multi- day methotrexate treatment is inferior to that of 
actinomycin -D.  
  H
0:  p d - pm ≥ M 1 vs. H 1:  p d – p m < M 1 
 In this statistical represen tation of the primary hypothesis, p
d represents the 
proportion of complete responses on ACT- D, p m represents the proportion 
of complete responses on multi- day methotrexate,  and M 1 represents the 
non-inferiority margin.  
 11.341 Non -inferiority margin and ef fect of the active control: M
1 = 0.05 
and p d = 0.70 
 
GOG 174, a randomized phase III clinical trial comparing weekly methotrexate to ACT -D, demonstrated a superior complete 
response rate to ACT -D over weekly methotrexate.  Hence, ACT -
D is considered the active control in this non-inferiority study.  The estimated difference in response rates was 0.15.  The response rate to ACT -D was 0.70.  The non- inferiority margin for this study is 
defined to be 0.05, 1/3 of the effect of ACT- D relative to weekly 
MTX.  
 11.342 Type I error for non -inferiority:  0.05 
 11.343 Type I error for superiority:  0.05  11.344 Statistical power:  0.95 calculated under the alternative that p
d = 
0.70 and p m = 0.80

11.35 Primary analysis  
This study design requires the assumption of a consistent effect size relative to ACT -D for both MTX regimens.   The statistical analysis plan 
will incorporate a stratified primary analysis comparing the binomial proportion of complete responses between the treatment arms among eligible patients.  A test of the difference in proportions responding will utilize a test statistic that does not pool the variance across treatment groups.  In the event that the null hypothesis of inferiority is rejected, a test of  the superiority of the methotrexate regimen will be carried out and 
reported.  There will be approximately 80% power to detect an increase in response rate of 11% if the true response rate in the reference arm is 70%.  Reports and publications will include a complete accounting of all patients registered to this study.

 Under the null and alternative hypotheses, the average sample size is 2 77. 
 11.351 Delta value to reject H
0 at final analysis: p d – p m < -0.0252 
In this case, the observed response rate to methotrexate will need to be at least 2.5 2%  better than that of actinomycin- D at the final 
analysis to accept methotrexate with its associated intensive scheduling.    
11.352 Compliance monitoring: 
Compliance to protocol treatment will be monitored for early 
discontinuation or non-protocol based dose adjustments.  The total dose reported will be compared to the planned or protocol modified dose for each cycle. 
 11.353 Exploratory analysis of treatment efficacy : 
An indirect comparison of the Multi- day regimens can be 
performed by assessing the relative effects across stratum of each methotrexate regimen against the control arm.  This would be Interim and final analysis plan details

considered an exploratory analysis and used to provide an approximate evaluation of the assumption of a constant effect size across multi-day regimens.   
 
11.36 Interim analysis  
An interim analysis plan is outlined above assuming the interim analysis occur s at exactly 55% of the information fraction.  The information 
fraction is estimated by the number of eligible patients evaluated for response at a given time divided by the target sample size of eligible patients.  However, the timing of the interim analyses will likely vary from this exact schedule for practical reasons.  At the interim analysis, the test statistic for the primary analysis will be compared with the critical boundaries defined by the statistical design parameters described above an O’Brien  and Fleming alpha spending function as proposed by Lan and 
DeMets.  If a boundary is crossed, consideration will be given to terminating study accrual, if still active, and/or early release of data.  Additional decisions may include recommendations on instructions for patients on study treatment.  These rules are non -binding. 
 The results of interim analyses are scheduled to be reviewed by the GOG Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) at its semi -annual meetings.  
This committee meets in January and July each year.  The precise dates for 
these meetings are set more than one year in advance by individuals who have no knowledge of efficacy results.  Approximately eight weeks prior to each of these meetings, the database is locked in order to prepare a progress report.  If the prerequisite number of patients evaluated for response has been attained, an interim analysis is also prepared and presented to the DSMB at their next scheduled meeting.  The decision to terminate accrual to any particular regimen includ es consideration of 
adverse events, treatment compliance and results from external studies.  Additionally, the GOG Safety Review Committee (SRC) reviews accumulating summaries of toxicities and all serious adverse event (SAE) reports on an ongoing basis (not efficacy results).  This committee also reviews those deaths in which the study treatment may have been a contributing cause.  The SRC reports to the DSMB and may recommend study amendments pertaining to patient safety.

11.4 Safety analyses  
Patients adverse events will be captured by individual adverse event ter ms and 
grade defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
- 43 - 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0275 
Version Date: 03/25/2015 
version 4.  The maximum grade of any adverse event observed during active treatment period or within 4 weeks of completing study treatment for each eligible patient will be tabu lated.  The proportion of patients with a serious adverse event 
or reported Grade 3 or worse adverse event, regardless of attribution, will be compared between the treatment regimens using a chi -square test.  Additionally, 
the frequency of any hospitalization while on study therapy, frequency of early study treatment discontinuation not due to complete response or treatment failure, number of patients who receive non-protocol therapy and number of patients who receive non -protocol multi- agent chemotherapy.  
 
11.5 Quality of life analyses  
The QOL objective for this study is to measure the difference in QOL between patients in each randomized study arms.  The FACT- G scale will be used to 
measure the overall QOL and is considered the primary QOL endpoint.  The FACIT supplemental items will be used to measure treatment-related symptoms.  
Analysis of the FACIT supplemental items and treatment disruption will be treated as exploratory.   
 
The QOL assessment time points are scheduled with the intention to achieve 
maximum compliance; however, there is still a possibility of noncompliance 
especially for patients whose disease does not respond to study treatments .  These 
patients might seek other therapies that  might interfere with their compliance to 
the QOL assessments .  In GOG #174, treatment with actinomycin- D was 
discontinued due to lack of response in about 5% of patients before 2 cycles of treatment ; another 14% before cycle 4 and 7% before cycle 6.  Thus we expect 90% eligible patients will complete QOL assessment at 2
nd assessment (prior to 
cycle 3), 80% at the 3rd assessment (prior to cycle 5), and 70% at the 4th 
assessment (prior to cycle 7) .  With a sample size of 36 5 eligible patients, this 
study will achieve at least 88% statistical power to detect an effect size of 0.4 at a significance level of 5% using a two -sided two -sample test.  Assuming the 
standard deviation of the FACT-G score is 15.86 in both groups, an eff ect size of 
0.4 corresponds to a difference of 6.3 points between the two groups, which is considered clinically important (MID)
26.  The statistical power could be higher 
than estimated if the correlations among the repeated measures are taken into account .  A linear mixed model that accounts for the correlation among the 
repeated measures will be fitted for the FACT -G score adjusting for baseline 
score and other covariates .  The patient -reported symptom measurement scores 
and treatment disruption on QOL wi ll be summarized by treatment arms with the 
estimated means for continuous variables or frequency tables for categorical variables accompanied with 95% confidence intervals.  The 6 month follow-up assessment will be considered non- definitive since at that 
time point the QOL will likely capture a mixture of effects not directly related to the study therapy, e.g. patients whose disease does not respond will be treated with surgery, single agent and/or multiple agent chemotherapy; some

reproductive- aged patien ts may get pregnant; or study treatment may continue for 
26 weeks. 
 11.6 Uterine Artery Pulsatility Index  Analysis  
Investigators at Charing Cross Hospital have assessed the association of uterine artery pulsatility index with resistance to single agent methotrexate treatment and reported that patients with persistent GTN, FIGO score 0 -6, treated with 
methotrexate and UAPI≤1 had increased risk of treatment resistance regardless of FIGO score (referred to as WHO score in this protocol) and this increased risk was more pronounced in patients with a score of 6.
27, 28  In this study, the analysis 
of UAPI will focus initially on testing the statistical significance of UAPI (values ≤ 1 vs. > 1) and an interaction factor of UAPI and WHO score (UAPI ≤ 1 and WHO score  = 6 vs. UAPI >1 or WHO score < 6).  In the two previous studies 
46%-51% of patients had a UAPI of ≤ 1 and 2-4% of patients had UAPI ≤ 1 and WHO score = 6.  Given the small proportion of patients with UAPI ≤ 1 and WHO score = 6, statistical power for inference on the coefficient for the interaction term will be extremely limited for moderate effects.  The model of treatment resistance will also include an indicator for treatment and a treatment by UAPI interaction term.  The main effect term for WHO score is not expected to be related to resistance in univariate analyses since the range of scores is generally associated with similar risks of resistance but it will be included in the model, nonetheless, when the UAPI/WHO score interaction term is included.  T he treatment/UAPI 
interaction term will only be kept in the model if significant at the 20% level (two sided).  Additional analyses will report predictiveness curves
 34 (with observed risk for 
assessing calibration) for UAPI with and without the interactio n term, functions of 
sensitivity, specificity and risk, risk distribution by treatment outcome, and AUC from ROC analysis.  These analyses will help to evaluate the predictive accuracy of UAPI when predicting resistance to standard single agent therapy.   
 Measurement of UAPI in this study will be optional since it requires use of Doppler ultrasonography.  At this time the degree of participation in this component is unknown.  This study does not specify a priori  a threshold of risk to 
determine recommendation for treatment with single versus multi- agent 
chemotherapy. Given the optional nature of this secondary objective, this study will not provide a final recommendation on how to incorporate UAPI into the curren t prognostic index, but will either confirm or refute its prognostic 
significance.

F.I.G.O. 2000 staging criteria for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia17 
 
A. Criteria for the diagnosis of post-hydatidiform mole trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) based 
on the modified W.H.O. risk/prognosis scoring schema.  
  1. GTN may be diagnosed* when the plateau of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) 
lasts for four measurements over a period of 3 weeks or longer; that is, days 1, 7, 14, 21. 
   2. GTN may be diagnosed* when there is a rise of hCG of 3 weekly consecutive 
measurements or longer, over at least a period of 2 weeks o r more; days 1, 7, 14. 
  3. GTN is diagnosed when the hCG level remains elevated for 6 months or more.**   4. GTN is diagnosed if there is a histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. 
 * The actual level of hCG or the amount of rise will be determined by the 
individual investigator. 
** This may not apply for patients with unexplained low-level hCG without 
clinical or imaging evidence of GTN.  
 
B. Investigative tools to diagnose metastases  
  1. Chest x -ray is appropriate to diagnose lung metastases and it is chest x -rays that are 
used for counting the number of lung metastases to evaluate the risk score. 
  2. Liver metastases may be diagnosed by ultrasound or CT scanning.   3. Brain metastases may be diagnosed by MRI or CT scanning.  
C. F.I.G.O. staging schema for GTN  
 
 Stage I  Disease confined to the uterus  
 
 Stage II  GTN extends outside the uterus but is limited to the genital structures (adnexae, vagina, and broad ligament). 
   Stage III  GTN extends to the lungs with or without genital tract involvement. 
  Stage IV  All other metastatic sites.

Leucovorin Calendar 
 
Patient Name:  ______________________________  Patient Study ID __________________ Date: ______ /______ / _______   
This is a calendar to help you track when to take your Leucovorin pill and when you have taken it.  Each time you return to your treatment center or doctor’s office for the next injection, please bring this calendar with you.   
 
When should you take your Leucovorin pill? 
When taking Leucovorin, it should be taken between 24 & 30 hours after your injection of met hotrexate.  For example, if you are 
injected on Monday at 10 am, then you should take 1 Leucovorin (15mg) pill on Tuesday between 10am & 4pm.   
 
What if you forget to take your pill? 
If you forgot to take your Leucovorin pill on Tuesday between 10 am & 4pm, you should take the missed pill as soon as you 
remember if there is at least 12 hours before your next scheduled injection time.  If there is less than 12 hours before your next injection time, then skip that pill. For example, you remembered your missed pill at 8 pm and you are scheduled to get your next methotrexate injection on Wednesday morning at 10 am.  Because there are more than 12 hours before your next injection, you should take the missed pill.

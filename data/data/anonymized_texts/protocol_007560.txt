Investigational	Product: 	LOAd703	(delolimogene	mupadenorepvec) 	is	an	oncolytic	adenovirus	
serotype	5/35	expressing	human	trimerized	CD40L	and	full- length	4-
1BBL	under	a	CMV	promoter. 	Atezolizumab	is	a	humanized	IgG1	
monoclonal	antibody	that	binds	to	PD- L1.	
	
Study	Design:	 Single	arm,	open -label,	multicenter 	trial.	
	
Patients	will	receive	 up	to	 12	LOAd703	intratumoral 	treatments 	in	
combination	with	 intravenous	infusions	of 	atezolizumab.	 LOAd703	will	
be	tested 	at	two	dose	levels	to	determine	the	maximum	tolerated	dose	
(MTD)	 of	LOAd703	 evaluated 	in	the	study	using	a 	BOIN	 design .	
	
.	Atezolizumab	will	be	tested	at	a	fixed	dose.	 	
At	least	 25	response	evaluable	patients	will	be	enrolled	at 	the	MTD	 for	
evaluation	of	their	 response	 .	The	total	number	
of	patients	 to	be	enrolled	 in	the	study	 to	achieve	at	least	25	evaluable	
patients	at	MTD ,	should	not	exceed	50.		
	
	
Objective s:	 The	primary	 objective 	is	to	determine	the	tolerability 	of	LOAd703	
administered	 by	intratumoral 	injection (s)	in	combination	with	
intravenous	 atezolizumab. 	
		 The	secondary	objectives	 are	to	determine	the	 antitumor	activity	as	well	
as	the	pharmacokinetics	and	biological	mechanisms -of-action	of	
LOAd703	 in	combination	with	 atezolizumab .		
	Endpoints:
		 Primary	 Endpoints 	
1. The	primary	endpoint	is	safety, 	determined	by	 the	National	Cancer	
Institute	Common	Toxicity	Criteria	for	Adverse	Events	(NCI	CTCAE 	
v5.0).	
	
Secondary	Endpoints:	
1. Overall 	response	rate	evaluated	by	 the	Response	Evaluation	Criteria	
in	Solid	 Tumors	(RECIST ),	v1.1.

	2.0	BACKGROUND	
2.1	Tumor	Immunology 	and	Cancer	Immunotherapy 	
The	immune	system	can	recognize	and	kill	tumor	cells	 using	 the	same	mechanisms	as	 it	recognizes	
and	kills	virally	infected	cells	to	save	the	host	against	 lethal	infections.	Like	 virally	infected	 cells,	
tumor	cells	are	self- cells,	and	viral -	or	tumor -associated	epitopes	are	presented	 to	CD8+	cytotoxic	T	
lymphocytes	(CTLs) 	via	major	histocompatibility	complex	I	(MHC- I)	on	the	cells.	Both	 virally	
infected	cells	and	tumor	cells	may	prevent	CTL	recognition	by	downregulating	MHC	molecules ,	
making	the	cells	target s	for	natural	killer	(NK)	cells.	 While	 viruses	initially	activate	an	 anti- viral	
immune	response 	by	alerting	antigen -presenting	cells	such	as	dendritic	cells	(DCs)	to	activate	
lymphocytes ,	tumor	cells	and	its	stroma	tend	to	 produce	substances	that	inhibit	immune	 activation	
and	tumor	immunity.	 In	order	to	evade	the	immune	system,	tumors 	inhibit	DC	maturation	and	
promote	 the	differentiation	and	attraction	of	immunosuppressive	 (type	2)	cells	to	the	tumor	milieu	
such	as 	myeloid- derived	 suppressor	cells	(MDSCs)	and	T	regulatory	cells	(Tregs).	 These	immune	
regulating 	cells	produce	suppressive	cytokines	and	growth	factors 	that	suppress	activated	CTLs	in	
the	tumor	mileu	and	lead	to	T	cell	anergy	(unresponsiveness)	or	even	death .1,2	
The	principal	goal	 of	cancer	immunotherapy	is	to	break	tumor	 tolerance	(e.g.,	 break	anergy)	and	
revert	the	ongoing	type	2	immune	responses	to	type	1.	Type	1	is	characterized	by	activation	of	T	
helper	1	(Th1)	lymphocytes,	CTLs,	NK	cells	and	M1	macrophages	as	well	as	by	a	cytokine	pool	 that	
includes	IFNγ,	IL12,	IL21	and	TNF a.3		
The	implementation 	of	checkpoint	blockade	antibodies	targeting	CTLA4	and	PD -1/PD -L1	for	
various	 solid	malignancies ,	as	well	as	chimeric	antigen	receptor	(CAR)	T	cells	for	B	cell	
malignancies,	 has	made	 immunotherapy	 a	cornerstone	in	cancer	management.4,5	Nevertheless,	
most	patients	with	solid	malignancies	 do	not	respond 	to	checkpoint	blockade	therapy 	or	become	
resistant .	Novel	concepts	to	treat	cancer	by	stimulating	the	immune	system	are	currently	being	
investigated	 that	may	be	used	alone ,	or	in	combination	with	checkpoint	antibodies,	 such	as 	
immunostimulatory	gene	therapy	utilizing	oncolytic	viruses	as	gene	delivery	vehicles .6	
2.2	Oncolytic	Virus 	(OV)	T herapy	
2.2.1	Oncolytic	 Viruses 	
The	ability	of	certain	viruses	to	infect	cells,	propagate	and	kill	them	by	lysis	during	the	release	of	
new	virions	means	that	they	can	be	utilized	as	cancer	therapeutics.	To	limit	oncolysis	to	tumor	cells,	the	expression	of	viral 	replication	genes	 is	restricted	by	adding	promoters	that	are	preferentially	
active	in	the	tumor.
6,7,8	For	maximum 	potency,	the	OVs	should	infect	all	tumor	cells.	However,	this	 is	
challenging	if	the	tumor	has	metastasized ,	since	systemic	spreading	 of	the	virus	 to	distal	tumor	may	
be	limited	by	the	immune	system .	Nevertheless,	by	arming	the	OVs	with	immunostimulatory	genes	
(transgenes) ,	it	is	possible	to	inject	one	or	a	few	lesions 	to	induce	a	systemic	anti -tumor	response	
whereby	activated 	tumor -specific	T	cells	can	circulate	and	reach	all	tumor	lesions.	There	are	many	
different	OVs	being	evaluated	both	 preclinically 	and	clinically.	Most	of	the	clinically	advanced	OVs	
encode	GM -CSF	such	as	the	FDA -	and	EMA -approved	OV	Imylgic ®.9	Other	options	such	as	LOAd703	
described	herein	encodes	one	or	more	immune	stimulators.	Imylgic ®	and	other	OVs	are	currently	
being	combined	with	checkpoint	blockade	antibodies	in	clinical	trials. 	
2.2.2	 The	Investigational	Product	LOAd703 	
LOAd703	is	a	novel	immunotherapy	for	cancer.	It	is	an	oncolytic	adenovirus	serotype	5	with	a	fiber	(shaft	and	knob)	from	serotype	35	(Ad5/35)	to	increase	cell	binding	and 	infectivity 	of	cells	
expressing	human	CD46 .	Virus	replication	and	oncolysis	is	restricted	to	cells	with	a	dysfunctional	
retinoblastoma	(Rb)	pathway	due	to	an	E1AΔ 24	and	multiple	E2F -binding	domains	upstream	of	
		
	 Sponsor	Study	ID:	LOKON00 3	
	 Protocol	Version:		6.1 ,	2023-06- 09	
26	/	 88	
	E1A.8	Rb	in	normal	cells	is	bound	 to	the	transcription	factor	E2F	 which	blocks	its	intrinsic	capacity	
to	induce	transcription	of	genes	that	promote	transition	from	G1	into	S	phase	of	the	cell	cycle.	 When 	
Rb	is	phosphorylated,	E2F	is	released	 and	stimulate s	cell	proliferation.10	Human	tumors	have	a	
wide	spectrum	of	mutations	t hat	alter	the	Rb	protein	 and/or	factors 	that	lead 	to	hyper -
phosphorylation	of	Rb .	Hence,	in	cancer	cells	E2F	is	free	to	drive	transcription	of	the	virus.	The	
virus	infects	and	kills	tumor	cells	via	oncolysis	due	to	excessive	virus	replication	while	healthy	non -
malignant	cells	can	be	infected	but	new	virus	particles	are	normally	not	pr oduced.	Therefore,	
LOAd703	does	not	kill,	and	is	therefore	not	toxic	to	healthy	cells.	LOAd703	has	a	transgene	cassette	
with	two	immunostimulatory	genes	(TMZ -CD40L	and	4- 1BBL)	driven	by	a	CMV	promoter. 	The	CMV	
promoter	is	not	tissue- restricted	and	the	immunostimulatory	genes	can	be	expressed	in	all	cells	
that	are	infected	by	LOAd703 ,	independent	of	virus	replication .	Thus,	LOAd703	targets	both	the	
tumor	and	its	stroma 	to	induce	transgene	expression	but	virus -mediated	oncolysis	will	only	occur	
in	tumor	cells.	Since	the	virus	is	administered	by	 intratumoral	( i.t.)	injection,	the	expression	of	the	
transgenes	is	localized	to	the	tumor	area.	 	
CD40L	is	a	potent	stimulator	of	myeloid	cells	and	an	inducer	of	Th1	type	immune	responses .11	The	
TMZ- CD40L	 transgene	is	a	specially	 designed 	human	CD40	ligand	(CD40L;	CD154)	that	lacks	the	
intracellular	signaling	domain	and	 instead	 fuses	 the	extracellular	and	transmembrane	domains	to	
an	isoleucine	zipper	domain .12	This	creates	a	membrane -bound	trimerized	CD40L	molecule	that	
lacks	intracellular	signaling	in	the	TMZ -CD40L- expressing	cell	but	still	bind s	and	transmits	 signals	
to	other	cells	that	express	its	receptor ,	CD40. 	TMZ- CD40L	can	mature	DCs	to	become	potent	
stimulators	of	T-	 and	NK	cells	and	can	enhance	the	expression	of	adhesion	receptors	on	endothelial	
cells	which	promotes	lymphocyte	attachment	and	migration	into	inflamed	areas.12,13	On	the	other	
hand,	 CD40L	can	also	play	a	role	in	tumor	cell	death	 due	to	a	dysregulated	signaling	cascade	
whereby	 CD40	ligation	in	CD40+	cancer	cells	can	lead	to	tumor	growth	 inhibition	 and	apoptosis .11		
The	4-1BB	ligand	(4- 1BBL;	CD137L) 	transgene	is	the	full- length	human	4 -1BBL	gene.	It	binds	to	its	
receptor	4- 1BB	(CD137)	expressed	on	activated	T	cells	and	NK	cells.	4 -1BBL	stimulation	of	T	cells	
and	NK	cells	pro tects	the	cells	from	activation- induced	cell	death	(AICD)	via	upregulation	of	
apoptosis	inhibito rs	such	as	BCL -xL.	4 -1BBL	stimulation	also 	promotes 	efficient	 lymphocyte 	
proliferation	 and	memory	T	cell	formation .14,15		
The	LOAd703	virus	is	not	functional	in	animal	models	since	it	 requires	 human	CD46	for	infection	
and	cannot	replicate	even	 when	 animal	cells	are	modified	to	express	human	CD46.	Further,	human	
TMZ- CD40L	and	4- 1BBL	do	 not	cross	react	 with	their	 murine	 receptor	counterparts .	Hence,	toxicity	
studies	cannot	be	performed	in	 in	vivo	models.	 Oncolytic	effect 	can	be	demonstrated	in	immuno-
deficient	xenograft	mice	implanted	with	human	tumors	and	treated	with	LOAd703.	This	leads	to	tumor	growth	control	and	tumor	regres sion,	 but	in	this	model,	the	effect	of	the	transgenes	cannot	
be	evaluated	since	the	mice	lack	adaptive	immunity .
13	Effect	of	the	immunostimulatory	transgenes	
can	be	evaluated	in	immunocompetent	mice	implanted	with	a	murine	tumor	expressing	human	CD46	and	treated	with	a	LOAd703	virus	 containing	murine	TMZ-CD40L	and	4- 1BBL.	 This	leads	to 	
the	robust	stimulation 	of	DCs,	T	cells	and	NK	cells .	Further,	LOAd703	can	potentiate	the	effect	of	
anti- PD-L1	antibodies	in	an	animal	cancer	model.	 	
The	major	effector	mechanisms	of	LOAd703	 are:	1)	induction	of	cell	death	via	 either	oncolysis	or	
CD40- mediated	 apoptosis,	and	2)	activation 	of	the	immune	system	via	CD40L,	4- 1BBL	and	the	
adenoviral	backbone .	The	major	effector	arm	is	likely	immune	activation,	 but	the	induction	of	cell	
death	by	oncolysis	further	strengthen s	anti- tumor	responses	due	to	the	release	of	tumor	antigens	
resulting	in	tumor	antigen -specific 	immune	stimulation .	
Detailed	preclinical	information	can	be	found	in	the	LOAd703	Investigator’s	Brochure	 (IB)	Section	
6.0	NONCLINICAL	EVALUATION	OF	LOAd703	 which	is	an	integral	part	of	this	protocol.

exhaustion.	To	overcome	these	inhibitory	signals	and	sustain	T	cell	activation	during	the	anti -tumor	
response,	checkpoint	 blockade	antibodies	have	been	developed	to	block	inhibitory	immune	
checkpoints	such	as	CTLA4	or	 PD-L1/PD -1.	
Recently,	checkpoint	blockade	therapy 	has	shown	impressive	results	in	cancer	patients,	in	
particular	in 	malignant	melanoma.	However,	most 	patients	are	refractory	to	treatment	or	become	
resistant	after	an	initial	response.	Resistance	is	likely 	due	to	 the	patient’s	immune	status,	e.g.,	
having	an	 immunosuppressive	tumor	microenvironment 	with	very	few	activated	anti- tumor	
reactive	T	cells ,	which	may	not	depend	on	PD -L1/PD -1	interactions. 	Studies	combining	oncolytic	
virus	with	checkpoint	blockade	inhibition	have 	demonstrated	enhanced 	effect	in	preliminary	
reports.	The	use	of	Imylgic ®	with	pembrolizumab	increased 	response	rates	from	approximately	
30%	to	60% .16		
2.3.2	Atezolizumab	
Atezolizumab	is	a	humanized	IgG1	 monoclonal	antibody	that	 targets	PD -L1,	a	ligand	expressed	on	a	
variety	of	cell	types	as	well	as	malignant	cells.	 Overexpression	of	PD -L1	on	tumor	cells	may	be	a	
mechanism	of	tumor	evasion	and	has	been	demonstrated	to	inhibit	anti -tumor	responses .17	
Atezolizumab	inhibits	the	interaction	between	PD -L1	and	its	receptors 	PD-1	and	B7 .1	(CD80),	
which	would	otherwise	 inhibit	T	cell	proliferation,	cytokine	production	and	cytolytic	activity .18,19	In	
addition,	atezolizumab 	demonstrates 	minimal 	binding	to	Fc	receptors,	eliminating	detectable	
Fc-effector	function	and	associated	antibody- mediated	clearance	of	activated	effector	T	 cells. 	
Therapeutic	blockade	of	PD -L1	binding	by	atezolizumab	has	been	shown	to	improve	anti -tumor	
activity	by	enhancing	tumor -specific	T 	cell	responses .20,21	Atezolizumab	shows	anti -tumor	activity	
in	both	nonclinical	models	and	cancer	patients	and	is	being	investigated	as	a	potential	therapy	in	a	
wide	variety	of	malignancies.	Atezolizumab	is	approved	for	the	treatment	of	urothelial	carcinoma	
and	non- small	cell	lung	cancer 	and	is	currently	being	studied	as	a	single	agent	in	advanced	cancer	
and	adjuvant	therapy	settings,	as	well	as	in	combination	with	chemotherapy,	targeted	therapy,	and	
cancer	immunotherapy.

Nonclinical	Studies	 which	is	an	integral	part	of	this	protocol. 	
2.4	LOAd703	 Previous	Clinical	Studies 	
Currently,	LOAd703	is	being	evaluated	in	combination	with	 standard-of- care	 (SoC)	 chemotherapy	
treatment	in	two	ongoing	phase	I/II	clinical	trials.	 In	one	of	the	trials,	atezolizumab	is	added	to	the	
combination	treatment	in	a	second	study	arm.	 Briefly,	the	trials	are	open	label	studies	to	evaluate	
dose,	safety	and	efficacy.	In	both	trials,	 three	 dose	levels	are	evaluated 	followed	by	expansion	of	the	
maximum	tolerated	tested	dose.	 An	overview	of	the	trials	is	shown	in	 Table	 1.

	2.7	Rationale	for	the	Phase	 I/II	D oses	
This	study	will	begin	at	the 	LOAd703	dose	level	 1x1011	VP	per	treatment 	(cohort	1),	 and	if	safe,	 the	
dose	will	be	 escalated	to	5x1011	VP	per	 treatment	every	 3	weeks	(q3w) 	(cohort	2).	Th ese	dose	
levels	 have	been	demonstrated	to	be	 safe	in	the	ongoing	LOKON001	 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])	and	
LOKON002 	( )	trials	where	patients	were	treated	 i.t.	every	other	week	
(q2w)	 with	 6-12	and	8	LOAd703	treatments,	respectively.	No	intra-patient	dose	escalation	is	
allowed.	Dose	reductions	may	be	applicable	due	to	toxicity	(see	 5.5	Dose	Limiting	Toxicity	(DLT) ,	
and	5.6.8	LOAd703	Dose	Modifications ).	
Atezolizumab	will	be	given	as	a	fixed	dose	(1200 	mg,	q3w)	which	is	the	approved	dose	level 	and	
schedule	 for	the	treatment	of	 urothelial	carcinoma	and	non -small	cell	lung	cancer .	Atezolizumab	
may	be	 subject 	to	dose	adjustments	due	to	toxicity	(see	5.7. 7	Atezolizumab	Dose	Modifications ).	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.8	Patient	Population 	
Melanoma 	is	a	cancer	that	develops	from	melanocytes	in	the	epidermal	layer	of	the	skin.	 Melanoma	
is	the	fifth	most	common	cancer	among	men	and	women .32	It	is	often	diagnosed	in	older	patients	
but	is	 also	one	of	the	most	common	cancers	in	young	adults,	especially	young	women .33	Risk	factors	
include	 sun/UV	exposure,	skin	type	(white/fair	skin,	moles,	etc.) ,	genetic	disposition ,	and	sex;	the	
risk	is	higher	for	women	before	the	age	of	50,	and	higher	for	men	after	50 	years	of	age .34	More	than	
90%	 of	melanoma	 cancers 	are	due	to	skin	cell	damage	from	ultraviolet	radiation	exposure.35		
The	incidence	of	melanoma	has	doubled	in	the	 last	three	decades	 in	the	US	 from	an	incidence	of	
11.2	to	22.7	 per	100,000 .36	In	2019,	it	is	projected	that 	96,480	adults	 in	the	US	 (57,220	men	and	
39,260	women)	will	be	diagnosed	 with	melanoma .32	Although	it 	accounts	for	only	1%	of	all	skin	
cancers,	melanoma	is	the	 deadliest	type	of	skin	cancer,	 accounting	for	>90%	of	skin	cancer	deaths .37	
In	2019,	it	is	estimated	that	 over	7000	people	in	the	US	 will	die	from	 melanoma .32		
While	localized	melanoma	is	typically	curable	with	surgery,	metastasized	melanoma	in	 regional	and	
distant	 areas	 have	a	5 -year	survival	rate	of	63%	and	20%,	respectively .37	Metastatic	melanoma	is	
known	to	be	refractory	to	traditional	therapies	like	chemotherapy	and	radiation ,	and	until 	2010,	
there	was	no	 evidence- based 	therapy 	available	that	could	demonstrate 	significantly	improved	
overall	survival	(OS)	for	patients	with	unresectable	advanced	melanoma.	In	patients	with	stage	IV	
metastatic	melanoma,	less	than	half	survived	>1	year	and	only	20%	were	alive	after	 3	years.	Since	
2010,	new	systemic	therapies 	such	as	checkpoint	inhibitors	have	improved	treatment	options	 for	
patients	with	unresectable	advanced	melanoma .38	In	addition	to	immunotherapy,	targeted	
therapies	(BRAF -	and	MEK -inhibitors)	 can	be	 utilized	in	patients	with	BRAF	mutations ,	which	may	
account	for 	over	half	of	all	melanomas .34	In	2015,	the	first	 oncolytic	virotherapy ,	T-VEC	(Imlygic®;	
talimogen	lahparepvec) ,	was	approved	for	the	treatment	of	melanoma	 (FDA	and	EMA) .	T-VEC	as	
well	as	 several	other	oncolytic	viruses ,	such	as	CAVATAK,	 are	being	actively	developed,	as	
monotherapies	or	as	combination	therapies	together	with	checkpoint	inhibitors.

All	patients	enrolled	will	receive	LOAd703	combined	with 	the	checkpoint	inhibitor	atezolizumab .	
LOAd703	treatment	stimulates	DCs,	NK	and	T	cells	while	atezolizumab 	blocks	the	inhibitory	
signaling	via	PD- L1/PD -1	which	may 	prolong	T	cell	activation	and	the	anti -tumor	response.

3.3	Summary	of	Trial	 Design 	
This	trial	is	a	multi center,	open	label,	single	arm,	dose -escalation	Phase	I/II 	trial.	The	 study	 will	
have	 a	Bayesian	Optimal	Interval	(BOIN)	design	(target	DLT	rate=0.3)	to	determine	the	 MTD	 of	
LOAd703	against	a	fixed	dose	of	atezolizumab .	This	design	has	algorithmic	escalation/de -escalation	
rules	like	a	traditional	3+3	design ,	but	it	also	allows	for	specification	of	the	target	DLT	rate	and	
expanded	accrual	beyond	N=6	with	continued	 and	consistent	toxicity	monitoring .	This	means	that	
the	assessment	of	DLT	rate	continues	throughout	the	study ,	giving	a	well -defined	safety	evaluation	
of	the	entire	study .	Refer	also	to	sections	 10.0	STATISTICS,	5.5	Dose	Limiting	Toxicity	(DLT)	and	5.6.9

4.3	Screening,	 Enrollment 	and	Registration 	Log,	Identification	List	and	Numbering	of	
Subjects	
It	is	the	responsibility	of	the	Investigator	that	all	patients 	considered	candidates	for	the	study	 be	
listed	in	the	“ Screening,	E nrollment	 and	Registration	 log”.	The	reason	for	rejecting	a	patient	before	
informed	consent	is	obtained	should	be	 specified	in	the	comments	 field	of	the	log. 	Patients	will	
receive	a	consecutive	patient 	number	when	signing	the	informed	consent	and	are	thereafter	
considered	 enrolled	as 	study	patients	so	they	can	initiate	 the	screening	visit .	The	patient	number	
will	have	the	following	format:	
.	The	trial	site	will 	keep	an	 “Identification	 list”	of	all	
enrolled	patients	 that	connects	the 	subject ’s	identity 	to	the ir	study	number. 	
Study	patients 	who	have	been	screened	and	excluded	before	 the	week	 0	visit	are	considered	
screening	 failures	 and	will	be	 noted	as	such	in	the	 “Screening,	Enrollment	 and	Registration	log”.	The	
reason	for	excluding	the	patient	 from	 the	study	should	be	specifie d	in	the	comment s	field	of	the	
“Screening,	 Enrollment	 and	Registration	log”.	
When	the	inclusion	 criteria	 and	none	of	the	 exclusi on	criteria	have	been	fulfilled,	the	site	can	
request	a	study	slot	by	the	CRO .	When	the	study 	slot	is	confirmed	by	the	CRO,	 the	patient	is	
considered	 registered 	in	the 	study	and	 the	registration	date	is	documented	in	the	 “Screening,	
Enrollment	and	 Registration	log.	The	study	investigators	participate	in	 regular	phone	conferences	
with	the	CRO	and	Sponsor	to	follow	the	recruitment	process	and	study	development. 	
NOTE: 	During	dose	escalation,	 the	slots	are	limited	to	3	per	cohort,	of	which	the 	first	 patient	 must	
receive	 	
before	patient	 2	and	3	can	start.	During	dose	escalation 	it	is	
therefore	important	to	have	close	communication	with	the	CRO	before	 screening,	 in	order	 to	
confirm	the	timing	and	avoid	having	eligible	patients	ready	for	treatment	when	there	is	no	slot	
available.	 	During	dose	escalation,	the	first	dose	will	not	be	given	to	two	or	more	patients	on	the	
same	day	(within	24	hours	of	dosing).	 	
Instructions	on	communication	and	the	registration	procedures	are	found	in	the	Investigator	Site	
File.

	4.4	Withdrawal	of	Patients 	
A	patient	has	the	right	to	withdraw	his	or	her	 consent	for	 participating	in	 the	study ,	at	any	time ,	and 	
without	giving	any	specific	reason.	 	
The	study	treatment 	can	be	discontinued	(i.e.	 from	either	LOAd703	or	 atezolizumab	or	from	both	
treatments)	at	any	time	if	it	is	medically	necessary,	as	judged	by	 the	Investigator	or	the	Sponsor ,	
based	on	the	development	of	toxicity	as	specified	in	sections	5.5	 Dose	Limiting	Toxicity	(DLT),	5.6.8	
LOAd703	Dose	Modifications ,	5.6.9	LOAd703	 Maximum	Tolerated	Dose	(MTD) 	and	5.7.7	Atezolizumab

If	only	one	of	the	study	treatments 	is	discontinued ,	the	patient	still	continues	with	the	other	study	
treatment	and	follows	the	study	schedule	according	to	the	protocol.	 	
4.4.1	Off -treatment	patient 	
The	patient	 is	discontinued 	from	 both	 LOAd703	and	atezolizumab 	( )	or	from	Atezolizumab	
( )	if	the	following	criteria	are	met:	
1. The	development	of	toxicity,	which 	precludes	further	treatment 	with	both	study	treatments ,	
in	the	Investigator’s	judgment ,	and	as	specified	in	section s	5.5	Dose	Limiting	Toxicity	(DLT),	
5.6.8	LOAd703	Dose	Modifications ,	5.6.9	LOAd703	 Maximum	Tolerated	Dose	(MTD) 	and	5.7.7	
Atezolizumab	Dose	Modifications .	
2. A	response	 that	is	sufficient	to	downstage	the	patient	to	resectable	or	borderline	resectable	
disease,	in	which	case	the	 Investigator	 may	decide	to	pursue	chemoradiation	and/or	
surgical	resection.	 	
3. 	Patient	has	confirmed	progressive	disease 	
4. Patient	request s	to	discontinue	treatment. 	
5. Female	patient	becomes	pregnant. 	
Off-treatment	patients :	should	continue	to	be	followed	 according	to	a	modified	 clinical	follow- up	
schedule	( see	section	 6.4	Evaluation ,	Modified	Follow -Up	and	Final	Follow -Up	Visit 	and	14.3	
Appendix	III:	Modified	Follow -Up	Schedule ).	This	means	that	patients	will	continue	 his/her	
participat ion	in	the	study	 and	return	to	 visits	for	AE 	assessment,	sampling,	and	 radiology	
(according	to	protocol)	but	not	receive	treatment.

	5.3	Study	Sites	
5.3.1	General	Description	
The	patients	recruited	in	this	trial	will	participate	in	the	trial	activities	at	 the	study	s ites	under	the	
guidance	of	the	 site	Principal	I nvestigator.	 As	soon	as	a	patient	is	enrolled	in	the	trial,	the	
Investigator	is	responsible	for	the	patient .	
LOAd703	is	administered	by	 i.t.	injection .	The	selection	of	injectable	lesions	is	decided	by	the	
Investigator	after	consultation	with	the	interventional	 radiologist. 	The	injections	are	performed	by	
the	radiologi st	or	Investigator 	following	the	same	procedures	as	when	a	biopsy	is	taken ,	see	
“Instructions	for	tumor	lesion	selection	for	LOAd703	injections	and	effect	evaluation”	 in	the	
Investigator	 Site	File.	
The	hospital	personnel	involved	in	this	trial	ha ve	experience	 and/or	training	 using	
immunostimulatory	adenovirus -based	treatments.	 Study	patients	are	treated	in	a	hospital	with	a	
fully	equipped	emergency	care	unit.	 The	study	nurse /coordinator	 brings	the	patient	and	the	
LOAd703	virus	to	the	injection	suite	and	stays	during	the	injection,	where upon 	the	patient	is	
transferred	to	the	 appropriate	hospital	 unit	for	monitoring	and	 atezolizumab 	administration.	Trial	
visits	such	as	sampling	and	meetings	with	the	study	team	will	also	take	place	 at	the	hospital 	unit.	
5.3.2	GMO	Regulation	at	Trial	S ite	
The	LOAd703	v irus	will	be	handled	only	by	genetically	modified	microorganism	(GM O)-trained 	
staff.	 The	Sponsor	is	responsible	for	GMO	training .	Trained	staff	 are	receiving	a	 GMO	 certificate,	and	
a	copy	is	archived	in	the	Investigator	Site	File	as	proof 	that	they	have	received	 appropriate	training .	
Beside	information	in	section	5. 6	LOAd703	Drug	Product ,	a	GMO	 booklet 	with	training 	material ,	
instructions	for 	GMO	 handling	and 	accidents 	(see	instruction:	LOKON003	H andling ,	preparation	and	
treatment	with	 LOAd703) ,	and	a	 list	of	certified	staff	will	be	 available	at	each	 trial	site .	
5.4	Referrals	from	Other	 Hospitals	
If	a	patient 	is	referred	to	a	study	site 	by	another 	hospital 	to	participate	in	this	trial ,	all	study	
activities	will	be	carried	out	only	at	the	study	site	including	treatments,	sampling	and	assessments.	
The	site	Principal	I nvestigator	is	responsible	for	all	trial	pa tients 	during	their	participation	in	the	
trial.	
5.5	Dose	Limiting	Toxicity	(DLT) 	
As	LOAd703	will	be	dose	escalated,	 the	patients	will	be 	monitored	for	dose	limiting	toxicity	(DLT).	
DLT	is	defined	as	any	grade	3	or	higher	toxicity	(CTCAE	Versio n	5.0)	that	is	attributed	(definitely,	
possibly	or	probably)	 to	LOAd703 .	A	DLT	attributed	to	LOAd703	will	lead	to	 dose	reduction	 (see	
5.6.8	LOAd703	Dose	Modifications ).		
Phase	I:	The	first	patient	on	each	dose	level	must	have	been	evaluated	for	 DLT	 	
before	patient	2	and	3	 in	the	same	cohort	 can	start	
treatment.	Patient	2	and	3	should	start	treatment	at	least	24	hours	apart.	 	
All	3	patients	in	the	cohort	must	have	been	evaluated	for	DLT	before	decision	on	dose	escalation	is	
taken	for	the	next	cohort.	 	
Phase	II: 	Patient	enrollment	continues	and	 evaluation	for	DLTs	 	
	(see	 10.2	Sample	Siz e).			
Toxicity	attributed	to	atezolizumab	will	not	be	assessed	as	DLTs	in	the	study	but	can	still	lead	to	dose	modifications	(see	 5.7.7	Atezolizumab	Dose	Modifications ).

will	undergo 	their 	final	follow- up	evaluation	visit	 		
6.1	Schedule	of	Events	 	
All	study	evaluations	are	summarized	in	 14.1	Appendix	I:	Schedule	of	Events .	
6.2	Screening	
Before	beginning	 the	screening	 visit,	the	patient	will	be	informed	about	the	trial	and	sign	informed	
consent	whereupon	the	patient	is	enrolled	in	the	trial .	The	patient	will	be	evaluated	for	health	
status,	pregnancy	(if	applicable) 	and	tumor	load	(by	 appropriate	radiological	imaging).	If	the	
patient	has	been	subjected	to	radiology 	examination 	within	 three 	weeks 	prior	to	registration,	this 	
imaging	can	be	reused	for	evaluation	at	the	discretion	of	the	Investigator.	 	
Also,	if	samples	have	been	taken	for	routine	analysis	<7	days	prior	to	screening,	the	results	can	be	
used	for	eligibility	evaluation	at	the	discretion	of	the	 Investigator.	 	
If	all	of	the	inclusion	criteria	and	none	of	the	exclusion	criteria	are	met,	the	patient	is	 registered 	to	
participate	in	the	trial.

7.5.1	Tumor	S ize	
Tumor	size	will	be	determined	 using	a	suitable	imaging	 technique,	 depending	on	the	localization	of	
the	tumor. 	Computer	tomography	(CT)	will	preferably	be	selected. 	Radiology	exam s	will	be	
performed	every	9th	week	(± 1	week)	post -treatment	initiation	(i.e.,	 	
).	However,	at	screening,	if	the	patient	has	been	subjected	to	radiology	
examination	within	3	 weeks 	prior	to	registration,	this 	imaging	can	be	used	 as	baseline	at	the	
discretion	of	the	Investigator.	Definitions	of	measurable	disease	and	response	to	treatment	will	
follow	RECIST	1.1	criteria. 	For	research	purposes,	other	methods	such	as	immune -related	(ir)	
RECIST	may 	be	compared	to	the	RECIST	v 1.1	outcome.	Furt her,	a	study- specific	tumor	evaluation	
will	also	be	performed	(see	 “Instructions	for	lesion	selection	and	effect	evaluation” 	provided	by	the	
Sponsor	in	the	Investigator 	Site	File).	
Definition	of	Measurable	Disease 	
Tumor	lesions	must	be	accurately	 measured	in	at	least	one	dimension	(longest	diameter	in	the	
plane	of	measurement	is	to	be	recorded)	with	a	minimum	size	of	10 	mm	by	CT	scan	(irrespective	of	
scanner	type) ,	10	mm	caliper	measurement	by	clinical	exam	(when	superficial),	or	20	mm	by	chest

	In	addition	to	CT/MRI	 imaging,	position	emission	tomography	(PET)	 may	be	performed 	as	a	
part	of	tumor	assessment,	 at	the	discretion	of	 the	Investigator.	If	PET	is	used,	the	measures	 are	
documented	according	to	the	 EORTC	assessment.  The	 PET	 evaluation	will	be	exploratory. 	
7.5.2	Tumor	M arkers	
Tumor -specific 	genetic	marker s	such	as	BRAF	mutation	 or	mutations	in	DNA	repair	(i.e. ,	mismatch	
repair- deficient	cancers) 	will	be	listed	if	available	during	 .	Otherwise,	the	tumor	biopsy 	
( 	can	be	used	for	analysis .	Genetic	analysis	of	the	biopsy	 within	the	study	is	done	via	the	
Research	 Laboratory ,	if	applicable 	or	send	for	analysis	within	Sweden	and	EU	or	third	country	(US,	
UK).	After	the	analysis,	sample	will	be	destroyed	or	returned	to	the	biobank .	
7.5.3	Survival	Follow- Up	
After	the 	final	 clinical	follow- up	visi t	at	the	clinic,	overall	survival	(OS)	will	be	recorded	 	
.	OS	will	be	collected	until	the	trial	is	closed,	 i.e	until	 LPLV.	OS	may	be	
collected	via	medical	records	 (Sweden,	US)	 or	by	telephone /email	(US)	 from	the	Investigator	or	
research	nurse/research	coordinator	to	the	patient	and	will	consist	only	of	questions	regarding	the	
patient’s	health .	If	the	patient	is	initiating	another	 anti- cancer	 treatment ,	the	treatment 	will	be	
documented 	if	the	information	is	available ,	since	it	may	affect	the	OS.	The	 day	of	death	will	be	
documented .		
8.0	Response	Criteria		
8.1	RECIST 	
The	tumor	response	will	be	evaluated	using	 an	appropriate	imaging	technique,	 depending	on	the	
localization	of	the	tumor.	Tumor	regression	or	progression	will	be	evaluated	according	to 	RECIST	
v1.1	criteria. 	
Complete	Response	(CR) 	
Complete	macroscopic	disappearance	of	all	tumors. 	
Partial	Response	(PR)	
A	reduction	of	at	least	30%	in 	the	sum	of 	all	tumor	diameters	from	baseline. 	
Stable	Disease	(SD) 	
Neither	PR	nor	progressive	disease. 	
Progressive	Disease	(PD) 	
At	least	a	20%	increase	in	the	sum	of	all	tumor	diameters	from	the	smallest	tumor	 size	and/or	the	
appearance	of	 new	tumor	lesion(s).	
Confirmation	of	Progression:	 Due	to	the	potential	immunostimulatory	capacity	of	the	study	
treatments ,	it	is	possible	that	the	induced	immune	stimulation	may	induce	an	inflammatory	
swelling	of	the	tumor	that	initially	may	be	mistaken	for	progression.	Therefore,	PD	during	study	participation	leading	to	discontinuation	of	repeated	treatment	needs	to	be	conf irmed	by	
radiological	imaging	at	a	later	time	point	( within	 4-12	weeks) 	and/or	by	a	biopsy 	and/or	tumor	
serum	marker 	to	confirm 	tumor	progression .	
	Mixed	Response	(MR) 	
One	or	more	lesions	fulfilling	the	criteria	for	PR	and	other(s)	 for	PD. 	
Clinical	Benefit	Rate	(CBR) 	
CBR	is	 defined	as	MR	or	better.

	Overall	 Response	Rate	(ORR) 	
ORR	is	defined	as	PR	 plus	CR .		
	
	
	
8.2	OS,	TTP	and	PFS 	
Time -to-Tumor	Progression	(TTP) 	
TTP	is	the	time	from	start	of	treatment	to	disease	progression. 	
Progression -Free	Survival 	(PFS)	
PFS	is	the	time	from	start	of	the	treatment	to	 progression	or	 death. 	
Overall	Survival	(OS) 	
OS	is	defined	as	the	time	from	the	start	of	treatment	to	death	due	to	any	cause. 	
9.0	Adverse	Events 	(AE)	
Reference	safety	information	(RSI)	for	LOAd703	and	atezolizumab	is	listed	in	the	Investigator’s	
Brochure	for	each	study	drug. 	Note	 that	both	LOAd703	and	atezolizumab	are	regarded	as	
experimental	drugs	within	this	protocol	and	safety	evaluation	including	attribution	needs	to	carefully	be	considered	for	both	agents. 	
9.1	Definitions	
9.1.1	Adverse	Event	(AE) 	
An	AE	is	any	untoward	medical	occurrence	that	does	not	necessarily	have	to	have	a	causal	relationship	with	the	treatment.	An	AE	can	therefore	be	any	unfavorable,	unintended	clinical	sign,	
symptom,	disease	or	clinically	relevant	change	in	laboratory	variabl es	or	clinical	tests	temporally	
associated	with	the	use	of	an	investigational	product,	whether	or	not	considered	related	to	the	
investigation	product,	that	require s	clinical	intervention	or	further	investigation	( beyond	ordering	
a	repeat/confirmatory	test) .	Injury	or	accidents,	medical	condition s	for	operations	 that	are	not	pre-
planned,	or	deterioration	 of	the	 concurrent	illness	are	also	considered	as	AEs.	
9.1.2	Serious	Adverse	Event	(SAE) 	
A	serious	adverse	event	is	defined	as	any	untoward	medical	occurrence	that	at	any	dose: 	
• Results	in	death .	
• Is	life -threatening	(i.e. ,	the	patient	was	at	risk	of	dying 	at	the	time	of	the	event.	It	does	not	refer	
to	an	event	that	hypothetically	may	have	caused	death	if	it	was	more	severe). 	
• Requires	in -patient	hospit alization	or	prolongation	of	existing	hospitalization	excluding	that	for	
pain	management,	disease	staging/re -staging	procedures,	prolonged	monitoring	for	possible	
AE,	or	catheter	placement	unless	associated	with	other	serious	events. 	
• Results	in	persistent	or	significant	disability	or	incapacity. 	
• Is	a	congenital	anomaly	or	birth	defect. 	
Important	medical	events	that	may	not	result	in	death,	be	life -threatening,	or	require	
hospitalization	may	be	considered	serious	adverse	drug	events	when,	based	on	appropriate	

		
	 Sponsor	Study	ID:	LOKON00 3	
	 Protocol	Version:		6.1 ,	2023-06- 09	
70	/	 88	
	medical	judgment,	they	may	jeopardize	the	patient	or	subject	and	may	require	medical	or	surgical	
intervention	to	prevent	one	of	the	outcomes	listed	above. 	
The	term	“severe”	is	often	used	to	describe	the	intensity	(severity)	of	an	event ,	even	if 	the	event	
itself	may	be	of	relatively	minor	medical	significance	(e.g.,	a	severe	headache).	This	is	not	the	same	as	“serious”	which	is	based	on	patient/event	outcome	or	action	criteria	usually	associated	with	events	that	pose	a	threat	to	 the	patient’s	life. 	
Planned	or	elective	hospitalizations	(e.g.,	for	administration	of	protocol	therapy)	and	the	hospitalization	 per	se 	should	not	be	considered	SAEs.	However,	should	an	adverse	event	occur	
during	this	planned	or	elective	hospitalization	due	to	the	administration	of	protocol	therapy ,	it	will	
be	regarded	as	an	AE,	unless 	the	severity	 of	the	event	would	justify	hospitalization,	if	the	patient	
was	not	already	hospitalized. 	 	
9.1.3	Suspected	Unexpected	 Serious	Adverse	 Reactions	(SUSAR)		
An	unexpected	adverse	event	is	defined	as	any	adverse	drug	experience 	where	there	is	evidence	to	
suggest	a	causal	relationship ,	the	specificity	or	severity	of	which	is	not	consistent	with	the	
Reference	Safety	Information	(RSI)	in	the	 current	LOAd703	and/or	atezolizumab	IBs .	
Unexpected,	as	used	in	this	definition,	refers	to	an	adverse	drug	experience	that	has	not	been	
previously	observed	(e.g.,	included	in	the	 IB)	as	opposed	to	the 	adverse	drug	experience	not	being	
anticipated	from	the	pharmacological	properties	of	the	pharmaceutical	product.	
9.1.4	Serious 	Adverse	Reactions	(SAR) 	
A	serious	adverse	reaction	(SAR)	is	any	AE	for	which	there	is	evidence	to	suggest	a	causal	
relationship	(reasonable	possibility)	between	the	study	drug	and	the	AE.	By	definition,	all	SARs	are	
AEs,	nevertheless,	not	all	AEs	are	SARs. 	Both	LOAd703	and	atezolizumab	are	regarded	as	study	
drugs	in	this	study. 	
9.1.5	Non-Serious	Adverse	Event 	
All	AEs	not	fulfilling	the	previous	definitions	are	classified	as	non- serious. 	
9.2	Evaluating	and	Documenting	Adverse	Events	(AE) 	
AEs	are	graded	 in	the	study	 according	to	the	NCI	Common	Terminology	Criteria	for	Adverse	Events	
(CTCAE)	version	5.0	( refer	to 	http://ctep.cancer.gov ).	All	AEs	(except	 for	grade	1	and	2	laboratory	
abnormalities	that	do	not	require	an	intervention)	are	to	be	recorded	on	the	AE	page	in	the	e CRF	
and	source	documentation.		
During	 ,	the	Investigator	will	note	the	occurrence	and	nature	of	each	patient’s	existing	
medical	condition(s) .	Occurrence	and	nature	of	AEs	(including	lab	events)	directly	observed	by	the	
study	personnel	or	spontaneously	reported	by	the	patient	during	the	study	will	be	reported.	Each	
patient	will	be	asked	about	AEs	at	each	visit	after	the	first	dose	of	 the	investigational	product s	
LOAd703	and/or	atezolizumab .	
The	general	AE	reporting	period	for	this	trial	begins	upon	receiving	the	first	LOAd703	and/or	
atezolizumab	treatment	and	 continues	until	 final	 clinical	follow -up	visit	 at	 		
If	both	study	treatments	are	prematurely	 discontinued ,	AEs	should	be	recorded	 	
	
see	4.4.1	Off -treatment	patient ).	
If	patients	are	prematurely	withdrawn	from	the	study	 and	enter	survival	follow -up	(i.e.,	 survival	
follow -up	patients), they	will	be	followed	for	a	minimum

	 Protocol	Version:		6.1 ,	2023-06- 09	
71	/	 88	
		(see	
4.4.2	 	Survival	follow	up	patient ).	
If	a	patient	experiences	an	AE	after	signing	the	informed	consent,	but	before	treatment	is	started,	
the	event	will	be	recorded	as	an	existing	medical	condition	unless	the	Investigator	believes	that	the	event	may	have	causal	relationship	to	a	study- specific 	procedure	described	in	the	protocol.	If	
LOAd703	and/or	atezolizumab	have	been	administrated	when	an	AE	occurs,	its	relationship	to	the	study	drugs	will	be	judged	by	the	Investigator. 		
9.2.1	Severity	Grading 	
The	Investigator	must	determine	the	intensity	of	any	 AEs	according	to	the	NCI	CTCAE	Version	 5.0	
(see	 http://ctep.cancer.gov )	and	the	causal	relationship.	Those	AEs	not	covered	by	these	criteria	
will	be	graded	as	follows:		
1.	 Mild:	Discomfort	noticed,	but	no	disruption	of	normal	daily	activity.	Prescription	drug	not	
ordinarily	needed	for	 relief	of	the	symptom	but	may	be	given	because	of	 the	patient ’s	
personality/character .	
	
2.	 Moderate:	Discomfort	sufficient	 enough	 to	reduce	or	affect	normal	daily	activity.	Patient	is	
able	to	continue	in	the	study;	treatment	for	 the	symptom	may	be	needed. 	
	3.	 Severe :	Incapacitating,	severe	discomfort	with	inability	to	work	or	to	perform	normal	daily	
activity.	Severity	may	cause	cessation	of	treatment	with	test	drug;	treatment	for	symptom	may	be	given	and/or	patient	hospitalized. 	
	4.	 Life-t hreatening :	Symptom(s)	place	the	patient	at	immediate	risk	of	death	from	the	reaction	
as	it	occurred;	does	not	include	a	reaction	that,	 had	it	occurred	in	a	more	serious	form,	
might	have	caused	death. 	
	5.		 Fatal :	Event	caused	the	death	of	the	patient.	 	
9.2.2	Attribution	Definitions 	
The	Investigator	will	attempt	to	assess	the	relationship	of	the	event	to	the	study	drug s	separately .	
An	AE	 is	considered	to	be	associated	with	the	use	of	 any	or	both	of	the	i nvestigational	products	 if	
the	attribution	is	determined	as	possible,	probable	or	definite.	Attribution	of	AEs	will	be	recorded	in	the	CRF	as: 	
-	Unrelated:		 The	AE	is	clearly	NOT	related	to	 LOAd703	(or	atezolizumab) .	
-	Unlikely:	 	The	AE	is	doubtfully	related	to	 LOAd703	(or	atezolizumab) .	
-	Possible:	 	The	AE	may	be	related	to	 LOAd703	(or	atezolizumab) .	
-	Probable:		 The	AE	is	likely	related	to	LOAd703	(or	atezolizumab) .	
-	Definite:	 	The	AE	is	clearly	related	to	 LOAd703	(or	atezolizumab) .	
Attribution	will	be	specified	for	LOAd703,	atezolizumab,	treatment	procedure	(i.e .,	intratumoral	
injection 	and/or	intravenous 	infusion),	disease	or	other. 	
9.2.3	Duration	of	Event 	
The	date	of	onset	(and	time	if	relevant) ,	change	of	severity	 and	the	duration	of	the	AE	(i.e. ,	date	of	
resolution)	will	be	recorded. 	Events	that	are	ongoing	 at	the	time	the	patient	completes	follow -up	
will	be	documented	as	ongoing.

should	occur	during	study	participation.	 Pregnancy,	in	and	of	itself,	is	not	regarded	as	an	AE,	unless	
there	is	suspicion	that	study	medication	may	have	interfered	with	the	effectiveness	of	a	
contraceptive	medication.	If	the	patient	becomes	pregnant	while	 participating	in	the	study ,	the	
study	drugs	 should	be	immediately	discontinued.	Pregnancy	information	about	a	female	patient	or	
a	female	partner	of	a	male	patient	should	be	reported	immediately	from	the	time	the	Investigator	first	becomes	aware	of	a	pregnancy	or	its	outcome.	This	will	be	performed	 by	the	Investigator	by	
completing	a	Pregnancy	Form.	
Any	pregnancy	complication,	spontaneous	abortion,	elective	termination	of	a	pregnancy	for	medical	
reasons,	outcome	of	stillbirth,	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect,	or	 SAE	in	the	mother	will	be	
recorded	as	an	SAE	and	reported .	
10.0	STATISTICS 	
10.1	 Statistical	Analysis	Plan 	
A	Statistical	Analysis	Plan	(SAP)	will	be	prepared	as	a	separate	document	and	will	include	a	more	technical	and	detailed	description	(including	templates	for	Tables,	Listings,	and	Figures)	of	the	
planned	statistical	summaries	regarding	safety	and	effect	ev aluation.	The	SAP	will	be	finalized	
before	initiating	any	statistical	analysis.	Unless	otherwise	stated ,	tabulation	of	summary	statistics	
and	data	analysis	will	be	performed	using	SAS®	Version	9	or	later. 	
Statistical	Methods 	
Statistics	will	be	displayed	for	response	evaluation	for	the	patients	treated	at	MTD.

11.0	QUALITY	CONTROL	AND	QUALITY	ASSURANCE 	
11.1	 Direct	 Access	to	 Source	D ata/D ocuments	
The	Investigator(s)/institution(s)	will	permit	 study- related	monitoring,	audits,	review	and	
regulatory	inspection(s) 	and	will 	provid e	access	to	source	data/hospital	records.	 The	Sponsor	
verifies	that	each	patient	has	consented	in	writing	to	 grant	 access	to	the	original	source	
data/hospital	records	 by	means	of	the 	written	patient	information	and	signed	 informed	c onsent. 	
During	monitoring,	the	data	recorded	in	the	CRFs	by	the	Investigator	 or	designee	 will	be	 checked	
for	consistency	with	the	source	data/hospital	records	by	the	 Monitor	( i.e.,	source	data	verification).	
Any	data	d iscrepancies	will	be	documented	and	explained	in	the	monitoring	reports.	 	
11.2	Source	D ata	
The	requirements	for	the	information	 contained	 in	the	 patient’s	 medical	records	 corresponds	to	the	
requirements	of	the	“Patientdatalagen”	(SFS	2008:355) ,	“The	Medical	Product	Agency’s	regulations	
on	clinical	trials	of	medicinal	products	for	human	use”	(LVFS	2011:19),	 and	Department	of	Health	
and	Human	Services	Standards	for	Privacy	of	Individually	Identifiable	Health	Information,	45	CFR	
164.508	 which	means	that	 in	addition	to 	information	that	is 	pertinent	to	the	 care	and	well -being	 of	
the	patient,	the	follo wing	minimum	study -specific	information	must	be	recorded:	
• Date	when	patient	information	was	given	and	when	signed	i nformed	c onsent	was	obtained 	
• Patient	study	number 	
• The	name	of	the	study,	EudraCT	 /IND/NCT	number	and	short	study	description 	
• Fulfilment	of	inclusion	criteria 	
• Diagnosis	
• Dates	of	all	 visits	during	the	study	period 	
• Any	information	relating	to	AEs 	
• All	treatments	and	medications	prescribed/administered	(including	dosage) 	
• Date	of	study	termination	

		
	 Sponsor	Study	ID:	LOKON00 3

79	/	 88	
	For	information	that	 is	study	 specific	and	of	no	interest	to 	the	medical 	care	of	the	patient,	 other	
documents	may	be	considered	as	source	data.	Prior	to	study	start,	the	 site	Principal	
Investigator/ study	nurse /coordinator	 and	the	 Monitor	must	identify	and	document	the	expected	
location	of	the	source	data	(e.g. ,	medical	record	notes,	laboratory	reports ,	etc.).	This	will	be	done	by	
completing	a	site -specific	source	data	verification	log	(Origin	of	Source	Data).	The	site	must	clearly	
communicate	any	deviation	from	the	expected	source	data	location	to	the	 Monitor.	 	
11.3	Monitoring 		
In	accordance	with	the	principles	of	Good	Clinical	Practice	(GCP),	 the	Sponsor	is	responsible	that	
the	trial	is	adequately	 monitor ed.	In	this	study,	the	CRO 	will	be	responsible	for	monitoring	activities	
on	behalf	of	the	Sponsor.	During	the	study,	the	 Monitor	will	have	regular	contacts	with	the	study	
site,	including	 monitoring	 visits	to	ensure	that	the	study	is	conducted	and	documented	properly	in	
compliance	with	the	protocol,	GCP	and	applicable	regulatory	requirements.		
The	Monitor	will	ensure	that	accountability	of	investigational	products	is	performed	and	will	
review	source	documents	 to	verify	consistency	with	the	data	recorded	in	the	CRFs.	All	patients	that	
have	performed	any	study -specific	assessment s	will	be	monitored	for	 signed	 informed	c onsent	and	
all	patients	that	have	received	study	drug	will	be	monitored	for	date	of	study	visits,	
inclusion /exclusion	criteria	and	AE/SAE.	 	
The	Monitor	will	also	check	the	Investigator	Site	File	and	provide	information	and	support	to	the	Investigator(s).	 The	extent	of	monitoring	will	be	described	in	a	monitoring	plan,	which	will	be	
approved	by	the	Sponsor.	 	
The	study	site	may	be	subject	to	quality	assurance	audit (s)	by	the	Sponsor	as	well	as	inspection	by	
regulatory	authorities .	The	Investigator	and	other	responsible	personnel	must	be	available	during	
the	monitoring	visits,	audits	and	inspections	and	should	devote	sufficient	time	to	these	processes.	 	
For	investigational	sites	in	the	 EU:	All	site	Principal	 Investigators	 should	provide	a	curriculum	vitae	
(CV)	to	the	CRO 	to	be	responsible	for	the	study.	All	 Sub-I nvestigators	and	other	responsible	
personnel	should	be	listed	 on	the	delegation	list ,	together	with	their	 study	responsibilities, 	and	
provide	their	CVs	 to	the	CRO .	GCP	certificates	for	the	Principal	 Investigator	and	all	study	team	
members	on	the	delegation	log	must	be	provided. 	
For	investigational	sites	in	the	US :	All	site	 Principal	Investigators	will	be	required	to	provide	a	
current	signed	and	dated	CV,	medical	license,	proof	of	human	subject	research	protections	training,	a	completed	FDA	Form	1572	(required	in	the	US)	and	a	financial	disclosure	statement	(required	in	
the	U S)	to	the	 CRO.	All	Sub-Investigators	will	be	required	to	provide	a	current	NIH	biosketch	or	CV,	
medical	license,	proof	of	human	subject	research	protections	training	and	a	financial	disclosure	
statement	 (required	in	the	US)	 to	the	 CRO.	 GCP	certificates	for	the	 Principal	 Investigator	and	all	
study	team	members	on	the	delegation	log	must	be	provided. 	
12.0	ETHICS	
12.1	Protocol	Modifications 	
No	modification	of	the	protocol	should	be	implemented	without	the	prior	written	approval	of	the	
Sponsor.	Any	such	changes,	which	may	affect	a	patient’s	treatment	or	informed	consent,	especially	
those	increasing	potential	risks	or	scientific	quality	of	the	study,	must	receive	prior	approval	by	the	
relevant	regulatory	authorities/ethics	committees	before	implementation.	The	exception	to	this	is	
where	modifications	are	necessary	to	eliminate	an	immediate	hazard	to	trial	subjects,	or	when	the	
change	involves	only	logistical	or	administrative	aspects	of	the	trial	(e.g.,	change	in	Monitor	or	
telephone	number).	Other	administrative	revisions,	which	may	impact	the	clinical	portion	of	the	
study,	will	be	duly	reported	to	the	regulatory	authority	by	the	Sponsor	and/or	 ethics	committee	by

protocol	amendments,	patient	information	and	 informed	c onsent	from	the 	relevant 	IEC/IRB 	before	
enrollment	of	any	subject	into	the	study.	 	
The	Sponsor	or	designees	 shall	report	all	SUSARs	to	the	IEC /MPA.	If	a	study	stops	prematurely	at	a	
study	center	for	any	reason,	the	IEC	must	be	informed.	At	the	end	of	the	study,	the	Sponsor /site	
Principal	Investigator 	should	notify	the	IEC.	 	
The	Sponsor/site	 Principal	Investigator	should	file	all	correspondence	with	the	 relevant	IEC/IRB 	
and	provide	the	other	party	with	copies.		
12.3	Ethical	Conduct	of	the	 Study 	
The	study	will	be	conducted	in	accordance	with	the	protocol,	applicable	regulatory	requirements,	
GCP,	 and	the	ethical	principles	of	the	latest	version	of	the	Declaration	of	Helsinki .	
12.4	 Patient	Information	and	Informed	Consent 	
It	is	the	responsibility	of	the	Investigator	to	provide	each	subject	with	full	and	adequate	verbal	and	written	information	about	the	objectives,	procedures	and	possible	risks	and	benefits	of	the	study.	
All	subjects	should	be	given	the	opportunity	to	ask	qu estions	about	the	study	and	should	be	given	
sufficient	time	to	decide	whether	or	not	to	participate	in	the	study.	The	written	patient	information	
must	not	be	changed	without	prior	discussion	with	the	Sponsor. 	
The	subjects	will	be	notified	of	their	voluntary	participation	and	of	their	freedom	to	withdraw	from	
the	study	at	any	time	and	without	giving	any	particular	reason.	Subjects	must	also	be	informed	that	
withdrawing	from	the	study	will	not	affect	their	future 	medical	care,	treatment	or	benefits	to	which	
the	subject	is	otherwise	entitled.	 	
The	Investigator	is	responsible	for	obtaining	written	 informed	c onsent	from	all	subjects	(or	their	
legally	acceptable	representatives	and/or	witnesses,	where	applicable)	prior	 to	enro llment	in	the	
study.	 	
Upon	signing	informed	consent,	the 	subject	consent s	to:	
- Participating	in	the	study. 	
- Allowing	p ersonnel	 connected 	with	 the	Sponsor	 or	regulatory	authorities	to	gain	full	access	to

	13.0	DATA	 MANAGEMENT 		
13.1	 Data	 Management	
The	CRO 	is	responsible	for	Data	Management	and	will	write	a	study -specific	Data	Management	Plan	
(DMP)	where	further	details	will	be	specified.	All	data	will	be	recorded	in	 electronic	 CRFs 	(eCRFs).	
The	Investigator	is	responsible	for	ensuring	the	accuracy,	completeness	and	legibility	of	the	data	
reported	in	the	e CRFs ,	and	this	will	be	checked	by	the	Monitor. 	
13.1.1	Data	Entry	and	Data	V alidation	 	
Data	will	be	entered	into	the	study	eCRF	and	will	be	subject	to	both	logical	computerized	checks	
and	manual	validation	checks	against	listings	in	accordance	with	the	 study- specific 	DMP.	All	
inconsistencies	detected	during	these	procedures	will	be	resolved	through	 electronic	 Data	
Clarification	Forms	(DCFs) 	in	the	eCRF ,	issued	to	the	 Monitor	or	investigational	site	personnel.	 	
13.1.2	Database	C losure		
When	all	patients	have	been	completed,	all	data	have	been	entered	into	the	 eCRF	 database,	all	
coding	 is	done	and	approved,	and	all	queries	 are	solved,	the	Database	Closure	procedures	will	
begin.	Decisions	will	be	made	 on	how	to	classify	patients	into	analysis	populations,	and	how	to	
handle	protocol	violations	and	deviating	or	missing	data.	All	decisions	will	be	dated	and	documented	in	a	Database	Closure	document.	After	finalization	of	the	Database	Closure	document,	the	dat abase	will	be	locked.	 Any	changes	in	the	database	thereafter	will	be	documented.	
13.2	 Electronic	Case	Report	Forms 	(eCRFs)	
The	Investigator	is	responsible	for	ensuring	the	accuracy,	completeness,	legibility	and	timeliness	of	the	data	recorded	in	the	eCRFs.	 An	eCRF	is	required	and	should	be	completed	for	each	included	
subject 	on	a	visit -by-visit	basis.	 The	eCRF	should	be	completed,	monitored	and	corrected	( if	
needed )	within	6	months	from	 the	last	visit	of	the 	study	patient. 	The	subject’s	identity	must	always	
remain	 confidential.	All	information	in	the	 eCRFs	should	be	in	English.	If	necessary,	the	Monitor	
should	translate	any	information	or	comments	recorded	in	 other	languages.		
The	completed	 eCRFs	are	the	sole	property	of	the	Sponsor	and	should	not	be	made	available	in	any	
form	to	third	parties	(except	for	authori zed	representatives	of	 relevant 	regulatory	authorities)	
without	written	permission	from	the	Sponsor.	All	 eCRF	electronic	 files	 should	be	kept	in	the	
Sponsor’s	 Trial	Master	File	and	a	copy	of	all	e CRFs	 electronic	files	 should	be	kept	in	the	Investigator	
Site	F ile.	
In	this	study,	clinical	data	including	AEs	and	concomitant	medications 	will	be	 entered	into	a	21	CFR	
Part	11- compliant	eCRF	 .	The	eCRF	includes	password	
protection ,	audit	trails 	and	internal	quality	checks,	such	as	automatic	range 	checks	to	identify	data	
that	appear	inconsistent,	incomplete,	or	inaccurate.	Clinical	data	will	be	entered	directly	from	the	
source	documents.	Backups	of	 the	data	are	automatically	performed	on	a	regular	basis.	Backups	are	
stored	and	encrypted	on	both	magnetic	and	optical	media	in	a	separate	physical 	location.	This	
process	guarant ees	the	minimum	data	loss	in	the	events	of	a	disastrous	failure.	 	
13.3	R ecord	Keeping	
To	enable	audits	and	evaluations	by	the	Sponsor	and	inspections	by	regulatory	authorities,	the	
Investigator	shall	keep	records	(essential	documents)	of	the	study	for	 at	least	10	years 	after	final	
report.	This	includes	any	original	source	data	related	to	the	study,	the	subject	identifi cation	list	
(with	subject	identification	 numbers,	full	names	and	addresses),	original	signed	 informed	c onsent	
forms,	copies	of	all	 eCRF- generated	files	and	detailed	records	of	 the	investigational	product ’s	
disposition.

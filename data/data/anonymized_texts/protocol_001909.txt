Decades of observational data have documented that sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a
devastating medical disorder.  Over 50,000 affect ed persons in the United States have inherited
SCA, and the vast majority of them are African-American.  To date, there have been few therapeuticoptions for persons with SCA. Bone marrow transplantation, which can provide a cure forindividuals with a matched sibling donor, and chronic blood transfusions to prevent cerebrovasculardisease are possible therapeutic options that are not appropriate or available for all patients.  Noother treatment has yet been demonstrated to prevent the chronic end organ damage seen in thisdisorder.
SCA is characterized by acute complications and chronic organ damage that cause lifelong
morbidity and early mortality.  Acute events result from erythrocyte sickling and vaso-occlusion, andbegin early in life with dactylitis, other painful  events, and acute chest syndrome. Chronic organ
damage from sickling is more insidious but also begi ns early in life as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels
begin to decline.  During the first two years of life, sickling begins to damage the spleen, renderingthe child susceptible to overwhelming infection.  The kidney also is affected in infancy andmanifests abnormality first as increased glomerular filtration, followed by proteinuria in olderchildren and finally renal failure in young adults.  Other organs (e.g., brain, liver, and lungs) are alsoaffected by chronic sickling, but damage that begins  in infancy typically does not become manifest
until an older age.
The anti-neoplastic agent hydroxyurea has emerged recently as an oral medication that can
increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production and thereby reduce intracellular sickling.Hematological benefits of hydroxyurea therapy include higher HbF values, higher hemoglobinconcentration, and less hemolysis.  The clinical efficacy of hydroxyurea therapy in reducing acuteevents (crisis, acute chest syndrome, hospitalizations, rate of transfusions) in severely affectedadults with SCA was demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial -- the Multicenter Study ofHydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) -- long- term follow-up suggests that hydroxyurea therapy
may be associated with reduced mortality as well.  The short-term safety of hydroxyurea therapyhas been demonstrated in school-aged children (HUGKIDS) and infants and very young children(HUSOFT) with SCA, but its clinical effica cy has not been proven in this younger age group.
Importantly, the effects of hydroxyurea on chronic end organ damage in SCA have not beeninvestigated, although children in HUSOFT had the suggestion of reduced splenic dysfunction
compared to historical controls, and their observed increases in glomerular filtration rate with agewere inversely correlated with the amount of HbF.
 With these encouraging results, the challenge now is to determine the appropriate and
optimal use of hydroxyurea therapy for children with SCA.  Several important questions must beaddressed, and the proposed answers must be sensitive to the history of medical investigationinvolving African-Americans.  
Highest priority must be given to patient prot ection and to assuring that patients’ families
make their decisions regarding participation in BABY HUG freely, with confidence and trust in thechoices offered. Conversely, however, it woul d be unethical to allow hydroxyurea to be used
indiscriminately in this vulnerable patient population without demonstrated benefit in a randomizedclinical trial.  A recent survey by the Americ an Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology noted that
30% of pediatric hematologists already use hydroxyurea in children under age 5 years, and somealready use it as early as age 1 year of life.  It is essential, therefore, to design and conduct a formal
randomized clinical trial to ensure that hydroxyu rea will be used appropriately in young children with
SCA.  The following are three critical study design questions with proposed answers:  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/B HUG-Preface.wpd —  8/09 Page P2 of P2   1. What is the best age range in which to consider hydroxyurea therapy for the prevention of
chronic organ damage?  
The pathophysiology of sickling in SCA begins during the first year of life, and organ
damage to the spleen and kidney clearly begins before 2 years of age. The onset ofdamage appears to be associated with the decline in Hb F levels that begins at 6 monthsof age.  Since the onset of disease begins in infancy, the first year or two of life is theappropriate age range to study.  In BABY HUG, enrollment will begin at 9 months of life andcontinue through age 17 months.
2. Should hydroxyurea be reserved only for patients with severe disease, or might less
severely affected infants benefit as well?
Even though only a subset of infants with SCA will manifest acute clinical sickling
complications during the first two years of life, chronic (subclinical) sickling occurs in allpatients.  Treatment that is limited to severely affected infants might not address thecapacity of hydroxyurea to prevent organ dam age.  Conversely, the exclusion of well-
appearing infants would be inappropriate  since they might be denied beneficial therapy.Functional asplenia is recognized as a poor prognostic sign, hence the prevention of splenicdamage is a worthwhile goal for all infants.  In BABY HUG,  very young children with SCAwill be randomly assigned to either hydroxyurea or placebo therapy.
3. Can hydroxyurea help prevent the chronic end organ damage in sickle cell disease that
begins early in life?
This question will be addressed directly in BABY HUG.  The spleen and the kidneys are the
organs commonly affected early in childhood; hence these organs will be the primary studyendpoints.  
Summary
.  Based on the known pathophysiology of SCA, previous data from studies using
hydroxyurea in infants and children, and careful consideration of sociological and ethical factors,we propose that hydroxyurea should be tested in a formal randomized clinical trial for theprevention of chronic organ damage in infants with SCA.  We propose a randomized double-blindedplacebo-controlled trial to prevent damage to the spleen and kidney, since these organs are the firstto be affected early in life.  We propose to determine if we can enroll children with SCA who arebetween 9 and 17 months of age, to prevent chronic damage to the spleen and kidneys. With
proper precautions to ensure safety of all participants, we believe that this is the optimal trial designthat allows equipoise, ethical patient protection, and the opportunity to determine the true efficacyof hydroxyurea in preventing chronic organ damage in children with SCA.

CHAPTER 1
BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 OVERVIEW OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
The term Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) refers to a group of genetic hematological disorders
characterized by the predominance of sickle hemoglobin (HbS).  SCD is one of the most commoninherited diseases in the United States, affecting approximately 1 in 375 African-American livebirths.  Currently it is estimated that there are over 75,000 persons in the United States with SCD.A single inherited amino acid substitution in beta globin results in the formation of HbS (containingbeta-globin S instead of beta-globin A).  HbS undergoes polymerization in the deoxygenated state,leading to deformation of the cellular membrane and alteration of cellular physiology.  Sickle CellAnemia (SCA) is characterized by homozygous st ate for HbS and represents the majority of SCD
patients. 
Clinical manifestations of SCA result prim arily from hemolytic anemia and the effects of
intravascular sickling, including both acute tissue hypoxia and chronic organ damage.  Patients withSCD commonly develop acute vaso-occlusive events due to sickling of erythrocytes within thecapillaries and small venules.  Acute vaso-occlusiv e sickling events can manifest in many ways,
including painful crisis, priapism, splenic sequestrat ion, acute chest syndrome, or stroke.  Over a
period of years, patients with SCA develop or gan damage from repeated acute and chronic sickling
events.  The primary organs that are affected ch ronically by sickling include the spleen, kidneys,
brain, and lungs.  Data gathered during the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD)demonstrate clearly that chronic organ damage is a major cause of morbidity and mortality forpatients with SCA.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-2 of 1-15    1.2 CHRONIC ORGAN DAMAGE IN SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
1.2.1 Spleen
Of all internal organs affected by chronic sickling, the spleen is the one damaged most
severely early in life.  The slow circulation within the spleen provides an ideal milieu for sickling,which leads to tissue hypoxia and organ infarction.  In most children with sickle cell anemia, thespleen is non-functional by the age of 2 years (Pearson et al, 1979).  This acquired state offunctional asplenia (Diamond, 1969) leads to a susceptibility to infection by encapsulated bacteria(Zarkowsky et al, 1986; Gill et al, 1995; Kabi ns and Lerner, 1970; Pearson, 1977).  Splenic damage
can be identified by the absence of radioactive tracer uptake, or the presence of increased numbersof pitted erythrocytes (Pearson et al, 1979; Rogers et al, 1982; Pearson et al, 1985; Fatunde andScott, 1986).  Transfusion therapy has been associated with a “reversal” of splenic hypofunction(Buchanan et al, 1989; Barrios et al, 1993),  suggesting that splenic damage may be reversibleduring the first few years of life.  Similarly, bone marrow transplantation in children with SCD maybe able to correct splenic dysfunction (Ferster et al, 1993).  Splenic regeneration may also occurwith hydroxyurea (HU) therapy in patients with SCA (Claster and Vichinsky, 1996). 
1.2.2 Kidneys
The term “sickle nephropathy” refers to the constellation of chronic renal damage that
occurs in patients with SCA.  For decades, it has been known that defects in renal tubular function,specifically in acidification (Oster et al, 1976) and concentrating ability (Francis and Worthen, 1968)begin early in childhood, along with papillary necrosis (Eknoyan et al, 1982).  More recently, sicklenephropathy has been characterized by proteinuria, occasionally with urinary protein loss in therange of the nephrotic syndrome (Tejani et al, 1985).  The prognosis of nephrotic syndrome is poor,
with chronic azotemia and acute renal failure occurring frequently (Bakir et al, 1987).  Theestimated prevalence of proteinuria in SCA is about 6% for children (Wigfall et al, 2000) and 25%for adults (Falk et al, 1992).  Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferation
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-3 of 1-15    have been described histologically, and probably result from glomerular hyperfiltration (Tejani et
al, 1985).  
An elevated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) is a common feature in patients with sickle
nephropathy that begins very early in life (Allon et al, 1988), and may portend later severe renaldamage.  Therapy to reduce glomerular capillary hypertension significantly can reduce urinary
protein excretion in adults with  SCA (Falk et al, 1992).  Renal damage from chronic sickling is a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality; in the CSSCD, 18% of deaths in adults with SCAoccurred secondary to overt organ failure, primarily renal (Platt et al, 1994).  
1.2.3 Brain
The CSSCD has collected prospective data on chronic organ damage to the brain in over
300 children with SCD.  Using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 22% of children age 6-12years had infarction/ischemia and/or atrophy, including 13% who had no history of a clinical CVA(Leong et al, 1997).  The lesions in these latter children are referred to as “silent infarcts” that reflectsubclinical organ damage to the brain.  Most of the lesions were present at entry into the study (age6 years).  More recently, 39 infants with SCA, 7 - 48 months of age, were found to have an 11%prevalence of brain abnormalities on MRI (Wang et al, 1998). 
Organ damage to the brain in SCD is often associated with changes in the large intracranial
arteries, most commonly stenosis within the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and proximal middlecerebral artery (MCA).  Abnormal cerebral blood flow can be identified in some children by magnetic
resonance angiography (MRA ), while transcranial doppler (TCD) has been shown to identify
children with an increased risk of developing stroke.  An abnormal time averaged maximum TCDvelocity (>200 cm/sec) in the distal ICA or prox imal MCA is associated with a high risk of stroke
(Adams et al, 1992).  In the Stroke Prevention (STOP) Trial, children with SCA and an abnormal
TCD who received monthly blood transfusions had significantly fewer strokes than children whowere simply observed (Adams et al, 1998).  
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-4 of 1-15    Taken together, these data suggest that chronic organ damage to the brain from sickling
begins early in life.  Moreover, therapeutic inte rvention may help prevent the development of organ
damage to the brain.  Even in the absence of overt neurological disease, SCA puts some childrenat risk for neuropsychological sequelae including lowered intellectual functioning, academic skillsdeficits, impaired fine-motor functioning, and attentional deficits (Bonner et al, 1999).
1.2.4 Lungs
The lungs are also frequent target organs in patients with SCA.  Episodes of acute chest
syndrome (ACS, with intrapulmonary sickling) can re sult in obstructive lung disease with reactive
airways (Leong et al, 1997).  However, repeated organ damage from ACS and chronic sickling inthe lungs most frequently leads to a restrictive pattern of lung disease with diminished lungcompliance (Bowen et al, 1991).  Recent studies using pulmonary function tests (PFTs) havesuggested that abnormal lung function in SCA may begin in early infancy (Koumbourlis et al, 1997).
1.3 SICKLE CELL ANEMIA AND FETAL HEMOGLOBIN
1.3.1 Fetal Hemoglobin
There is great clinical heterogeneity observed in SCD, even for patients with an identical
hemoglobin phenotype (Platt et al, 1991; Powars, 1991; Seward et al, 1993; Steinberg et al, 1995).This clinical variation is partly explained by differences in the hemoglobin concentration, meancellular hemoglobin concentration, proportion of dens e cells, erythrocyte rheology, % adhesive cells,
presence of alpha-thalassemia, and the beta-globin haplotype (Platt et al, 1994; Platt et al, 1991;Steinberg et al, 1984; Baum et al, 1987; Powars, 1991; Phillips et al,1991; Embury and Steinberg,1994).  The amount of fetal hemoglobin (% HbF) is perhaps the most important parameterinfluencing clinical severity in SCA (Charache, 1990).  Normal adults have <1% HbF (Wood, 1993),while patients with SCA have 1-20% HbF (Serjeant, 1975).  Patients with hereditary persistence offetal hemoglobin (HPFH) can have fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels that reach 30-40% (Wood et al,1975).  Higher % HbF is associated with decreased clinical severity and fewer painful events,
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-5 of 1-15    transfusions, and hospitalizations in sickle cell anemia (Platt et al, 1991; Rucknagel et al, 1987;
Odenheimer et al, 1987).  A threshold of 10-20% HbF has been postulated, above which patientsexperience fewer clinical events (Powars et al, 1984).  The % HbF also predicts early mortality inpatients with SCD (Platt et al, 1994; Leikin et al, 1989). 
Except in the case of HPFH, HbF is not found in all erythrocytes, but rather is located in a
subset known as HbF-containing cells or “F cells” (Dover et al, 1978; Boyer et al, 1975).  In normaladults, the percentage of F cells ranges from 0.5% to 7%, while in patients with SCA, the % F cellshas a much broader range (Wood et al, 1975; Dover et al, 1978).  Because F cells have a decreasedtendency toward sickle formation, they survive pref erentially in the peripheral blood of patients with
SCA (Dover et al, 1978).  The number of F cells, therefore, may be of equal or greater importancethan the absolute amount of HbF in influencing the clinical severity of an affected individual with
SCA.  F cells can be quantitated accurately by several methods, including immunological stainingof HbF by monoclonal antibodies, followed by enumer ation by visual methods (Horiuchi et al, 1995)
or flow cytometry (Dover and Boyer, 1987; Campbell et al, 1999; Marcus et al, 1997).
1.3.2 Physiologic Decline of HbF
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF), the predominant hemoglobin produced in utero, comprises
approximately 80-90% of the total hemoglobin at birth.  In normal persons, the % HbF declines toadult levels during the first year of life (Wood, 1993).  For patients with SCA, this physiologic declineoccurs more slowly, and the HbF nadir may not be reached until age 5 years (Mason et al, 1982;Brown et al, 1994).  Clinical events from SCA rarely  occur in the first 6 months of life, due primarily
to high HbF levels.  Events occur during the first two years of life, however, including splenichypofunction (Pearson et al, 1979; Rogers et al, 1982), pneumococcal sepsis (Zarkowsky et al,
1986), splenic sequestration (Topley et al, 1981), dactylitis (Gill et al, 1995), and acute chestsyndrome (Gill et al, 1995).  These observations suggest that maintaining high HbF levels mightprevent acute and chronic sickling damage.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-6 of 1-15    The physiologic decline in % HbF and % F cells in a cohort of infants homozygous for HbSS
between birth and 24 months of age was recently investigated (Marcus and Ware, 1999).  The %HbF was measured by 2-minute alkali denaturation and % F cells by flow cytometry (Marcus et al,
1997).  The amount of HbF per F cell was calculated using the formula:  (mean corpuscularhemoglobin) x (% HbF) ] / (% F cells).  Over this period of time, the HbF parameters declined in anexponential fashion (Figure 1-1).  At 24 months of age, the average % HbF was 14.6 
± 7.3% and the
% F cells was 64.7 ± 16.9%.  The average amount of HbF per F cell fell below 15 pg/cell by age 12
months, confirming data from a previous study (Mai er-Redelsperger et al, 1994).  Previous in vitro
studies have suggested a threshold value of 15 pg HbF per F cell, below which sickling occurs(Sunshine et al, 1979; Poillon et al, 1993).  These data demonstrate clearly that HbF parametersdecline significantly during the first 1-2 years of life, below levels sufficient to inhibit sickling.  Theseresults support the concept of early pharmacologi c intervention for very young children with SCA,
with the intention to increase HbF parameters to levels that inhibit in vivo sickling.
1.4 EFFICACY OF HYDROXYUREA IN SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
1.4.1 Induction of HbF
The pharmacologic enhancement of HbF can be achieved using a variety of agents including
cytotoxic drugs (e.g. 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea), hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. erythropoietin),and short chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate and derivatives).  Each of these therapeutic agents hasbeen shown to have efficacy for increasing the % HbF in patients with sickle cell anemia (Goldberg
et al, 1990; Charache et al, 1992; Perrine et al, 1993; Dover et al, 1994; Charache et al, 1995).However, side-effects and toxicities vary considerably and no direct comparisons of efficacy havebeen reported.  Hydroxyurea is a prototypic therapeutic agent due to its efficacy, ease ofadministration, and modest toxicity profile.
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-7 of 1-15    1.4.2 Hydroxyurea For Adults With SCA
Hydroxyurea has been tested in adults with sickle cell anemia, and in most patients will
increase both the absolute amount of HbF as well as the number of F cells (Goldberg et al, 1990;Charache et al, 1992).  Charache and co-workers (Charache et al, 1992) reported a mean increase
in HbF of 11% in a Phase I/II study of adults receiving daily HU treatment.  In the Multicenter Studyof Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) Phase III clinical trial (Charache et al, 1995), adultpatients were randomized prospectively either to daily HU or placebo.  The study resultsdemonstrated that HU therapy led to a significant reduction in the annual number of painful events,episodes of acute chest syndrome, and erythrocyte transfusions (Charache et al, 1995).  The meanincrease in % HbF was 8.6%, although the range of HbF responses was substantial and some
patients did not respond, possibly due to either non-compliance or exhaustion of marrow reserves(Steinberg et al, 1995).  Even when compliance was assured, approximately 20% of adults with SCAdid not respond to HU therapy (Rodgers et al, 1990).  The primary toxicity of HU therapy was dose-dependent and reversible bone marrow suppression (Charache et al, 1992; Charache et al, 1995).
1.4.3 Hydroxyurea For Children With SCA
After the Phase I/II adult HU trial was completed, several anecdotal reports suggested that
HU therapy might be beneficial for children with SCA (Jayabose et al, 1996; Scott et al, 1996;Ferster et al, 1996; de Montalembert et al,1997).  To determine the safety and efficacy of HU therapyfor children, investigators from seven institutions administered HU therapy to a total of 84 school-aged children with SCA in an NHLBI-sponsored Phase I/II clinical protocol (HUG-KIDS).  HUG-KIDSprovided convincing evidence that HU therapy is associated with improved hematological
parameters in this younger patient population, including increased % HbF and % F cells (Kinney et
al, 1999).  The toxicity profile of HU was mild and included primarily reversible myelosuppression.
Clinical efficacy was not a stated goal of this Phase I/II study, but it was clear that the pediatricpatients with SCA had a less severe acute clinical course while on HU therapy.  Based on theseencouraging results in older children, it is reasonable to consider HU therapy for very young children
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-8 of 1-15    with sickle cell anemia, to allow therapeutic intervention before in vivo sickling leads to acute clinical
events and chronic organ damage.  
1.4.4 Hydroxyurea For Very Young Children With SCA
A recent report provided short-term data regarding HU therapy for young children with SCA.
Eight children, age 2-5 years, received HU with ev idence of both hematological and clinical efficacy,
and with minimal toxicity (Hoppe et al, 2000).  To determine the feasibility of HU therapy for veryyoung children with SCD, a Phase I/II pilot trial (HUSOFT) was recently performed.  Childrenbetween age 6-24 months were eligible for enrollment from four institutions, including DukeUniversity Medical Center, St. Jude Children’s Res earch Hospital, University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, and Medical College of Wisconsin.  A total of 21 completed two years of therapy at
20 mg/kg/day. All patients then on study desired to  continue treatment for an additional two years
at 25 and 30 mg/kg/day.  Laboratory studies and physi cal examinations were performed every four
weeks.  Patients were closely monitored for toxicities, especially of the blood counts and growthparameters, and for compliance.  Routine testing of the complete blood count, %HbF and %F cellswere used to document hematological efficacy  in before-after comparisons and compared to
untreated children with sickle cell anemia.  Additional studies included brain MRI/MRA,neurodevelopmental testing, and liver-spleen scans.  Hematological toxicities in HUSOFT were well-
tolerated, and laboratory efficacy was demonstrated (Wang et al, 2001).  Recently, follow-up of themajority of patients from the HUSOFT study w ho were continued on hydroxyurea treatment for an
additional 2-4 years, showed that these patients tolerate prolonged hydroxyurea therapy withsustained hematologic benefits, fewer acute chest syndrome events, improv ed growth, and possibly
preserved organ junction (Hankins et al, 2005). 
Preliminary results of clinical efficacy in HUSOFT relate to the potential prevention of chronic
organ damage, specifically the possibility that hydroxyurea can help preserve splenic and renalfunction in some infants with SCA (Wang et al, 2001).  Splenic function, as evidenced by uptake ofradioactive tracer, was present in eight of 17 HUSOFT children (47%) after two years on study.  This
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-9 of 1-15    compares favorably with data from CSSCD (Pearson et al, 1985) that document elevated pitted cell
counts (consistent with functional asplenia) in >80% of children with SCA at the same  median  age
of 39 months.   Renal function was assessed primarily by GFR estimation, calculated using the
formula  [(height)  x k] divided  by (creatinine),  as described  by Schwartz  (Schwartz  et al, 1987).   The
estimated  GFR  is normal  (100 ± 20 ml/min)  in infants  with SCA during  the first 6-12 months  of life,
but quickly  rises  to 150 ml/min  by age 2-4 years  and >200  ml/min  by age 6-10 years  (Wigfall  et al,
2000;  Kinney  et al, 1999;  Russell  Ware,  unpublished  observations).   Analysis of HUSOFT data
reveal  that the estimated  GFR  was 121 ± 20 ml/min/1.73  m2 at study  entry  (median  age 15 months,
n=28)  and 162 ± 43 ml/min/1.73  m2 at study  exit (Franca Barton and Russell Ware, unpublished
observations).   The absolute change in GFR was strongly associated with change in %HbF (Pearson
coefficient -0.60, p=0.004), suggesting that preservation of HbF can help prevent the elevation of
GFR observed over time in untreated children with sickle cell anemia.  
Recently two groups of investigators have pr esented evidence that hydroxyurea therapy in
children is associated with lower TCD velocities (Zimmerman et al, 2002; Bernaudin et al, 2001). 
1.5 TOXICITIES OF HYDROXYUREA THERAPY
1.5.1 Organ Damage
The short-term toxicities of HU for patients with SCA have been carefully studied in two large
Phase I/II trials.  In the safety trial for adults with SCA (Charache et al, 1992), the only observedshort-term toxicity was bone marrow depression.  Neutropenia was most common (76%), followedby reticulocytopenia (22%), anemia (4%), and thrombocytopenia (1%).  The myelosuppression wastypically mild, dose-dependent, and reversible.  In the safety trial (HUG-KIDS) for children with SCA
(Kinney et al, 1999), laboratory toxicity occurred at approximately 8% of the clinic visits.  Neutropeniawas the most common hematological toxicity (63%), followed by reticulocytopenia (19%), anemia(13%), and thrombocytopenia (4%).  Hepatic toxicity (>2-fold increase in ALT levels) was observedat only 0.3% of clinic visits, and was not associated with HU dose or additional medications.  Noepisodes of renal toxicity were noted, nor other  significant clinical adverse events during this
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-10 of 1-15    pediatric HU safety trial.  Growth (assess ed by height and weight) and development (menarche,
puberty) also were not adversely affect ed by HU therapy (Kinney et al, 1999).
1.5.2 Neurodevelopmental Effects
There are limited data in children with SCA regarding the effects of HU therapy on
neuropsychological development.  Previous small studi es of HU therapy for children with SCA did
not report any obvious neurodevelopmental decline.  Similarly, the Phase I/II HUG-KIDS pediatric
safety trial did not specifically test for neurodevelopmental progress, although no obvious declines
in neurocognitive function were noted (Kinney et al, 1999).  In the HUSOFT infant pilot trial, a subsetof patients had full neurodevelopmental testing both at study entry (median score = 93) and at study
exit (median score = 89).  These values were not statis tically different by t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum
test (Wang et al, 2001).  A recent abstract has suggested that HU therapy is associated withimprovement in neurodevelopmental  scores (Bernaudin et al, 1999).
Animal data suggest, however, that HU therapy can be toxic for the developing brain.  Almost
thirty years ago, prenatal treatment with HU was found to cause substantial postnatal effects on rats:perinatal mortality was increased (Fritz and Hess, 1980), weight gain was inhibited (Butcher et al,1973; Adlard and Dobbing, 1975), locomotor activity was reduced (Fritz and Hess, 1980; Butcheret al, 1973), and maze learning was impaired (Butcher et al, 1973; Adlard and Dobbing, 1975).Given early in gestation, HU therapy also can be embryolethal or have embryotoxic effects on the
eyes, face, brain, heart, and limbs (Aliverti et al , 1980).  Neuronal cells such as the dorsal root
ganglia may be especially susceptible to impairment of DNA synthesis by HU (Theisen, 1979).  Arecent abstract suggests that post-natal HU therapy also impairs weight gain, organ size, and braindevelopment of rats (Horiuchi et al, 1998).  It mu st be emphasized that all of these studies used
doses of HU up to 1000-2000 mg/kg/day.  No studies have documented embryotoxicity or severeneurodevelopmental toxicity using pharmacologic HU doses (20-40 mg/kg/day).  Also, effects of HUexposure may be considerably different in rats than in primates (Wilson et al, 1975).  Differences inHU plasma levels, half-life clearance, and tissue penetration exist; previous studies suggest that the
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-11 of 1-15    effects on rodents do not accurately reflect the effects of HU in primates (Wilson et al, 1975).  Taken
together, the available laboratory and clinical data neither establish nor exclude the possibility thatpharmacologic HU doses in early childhood are related to any marked neurodevelopmental toxicityfor the human brain, although very high doses of HU could be. 
1.5.3 Mutagenic And Carcinogenic Potential
Although the short-term toxicities of HU are typically well-tolerated, the long-term risks
associated with HU therapy are unclear.  Specifically, the risk of developing leukemia or othermalignancies following HU exposur e has not been determined.  Hydroxyurea has been shown
experimentally to have clastogenic (Gebhart, 1981; Oppenheimer and Fishbein, 1965), teratogenic
(Murphy and Chaube, 1964; Aliverti et al, 1980) and in some settings mutagenic effects (Ziegler-Skylakakis et al, 1985), but its potential as  a carcinogen at therapeutic doses has not been
established.  Since HU is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and reduces intracellulardNTP pools, HU interferes not only with DNA synthesis but also with DNA repair mechanisms(Snyder, 1984).  In vitro, DNA damage that devel ops either spontaneously or from environmental
mutagens cannot be fully repaired in the presence of HU, leading to the accumulation of somaticmutations and chromosomal damage (Li and Kaminskas, 1987).  These laboratory observationsprovide a plausible biochemical mechanism by wh ich in vivo HU therapy could lead to somatic DNA
mutations and eventual carcinogenesis.  
The carcinogenic potential of HU therapy has been investigated most carefully in patients
with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).  The Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) reported a
5.9% incidence of acute leukemia in 51 adults with PV treated with HU (Fruchtman et al, 1994;Landaw, 1986) compared to 1.5% of historical counterparts who received phlebotomy alone(p=0.12).  Reports of acute leukemia in adults with MPD treated with HU alone (Sedlacek et al, 1986;Lofvenberg et al, 1990; Holcombe et al, 1991; Weinfeld et al, 1994; Furgeson et al, 1996) haveadded concern regarding the long-term leukemogenic potential of HU therapy in this clinical setting.Recently, large studies have provided some evidence that long-term HU therapy for patients with
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-12 of 1-15    MPD is associated with an increased risk of developing acute leukemia (Najean et al, 1997a;
Sterkers et al, 1998; Najean et al, 1997b).  Taken together, these data suggest that hydroxyureatherapy may have a mutagenic and carcinogenic potential for patients with MPD, especially withlong-term usage. 
The carcinogenic potential of HU therapy is not evident in the setting of other hematological
diseases.  Sixty-four patients with erythrocyt osis secondary to cyanotic congenital heart disease
were treated with HU (mean 5.6 years) and had no cases of secondary malignancy (Triadou et al,1994).  In the United States, some adults with SC A have received HU therapy for over 10 years; no
cases of secondary leukemia from the MSH trial have been observed (Steinberg et al, 1999).However, anecdotes of malignancy or myelodysplasia in patients with SCA on hydroxyurea therapyhave been reported.  These cases need to be evaluated in light of the incidence of cancer in theAfrican-American population in general, and specifically in patients with SCD.  
The incidence of cancer among African-American children in the US is about 11 new cases
per 100,000 children per year (Gurney et al, 1995), of which one-third are leukemia or lymphoma.
The incidence among African-American children under age four years, however, is at least 15 cases
per 100,000 children per year (Gurney et al, 1995) , due primarily to leukemia, neuroblastoma, and
Wilms’ tumor (Miller et al, 1993).  In the setting of SCA, the incidence of malignancy is not known.The CSSCD identified 1 child with Wilms’ tumor in the original study period and 14 subsequentcases of cancer were reported in children and adults with SCD (Dianne Gallagher and Duane Bonds,unpublished observations).  In a large retrospec tive survey performed by members of the
International Association of Sickle Cell Nurses and Physician Assistants (IASCNAPA), a total of 41cases of cancer were reported in patients with sickle cell anemia.  These cases included childrenand adults of all ages, and a wide variety of cancer types were reported (Schultz et al, 1999).
1.5.4 Acquired DNA Mutations In Association With Hydroxyurea Therapy
The inhibitory effects of HU on DNA repair mechanisms could lead to an accumulation of
acquired DNA mutations that eventually could result in malignant transformation.  Two in vitro
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-13 of 1-15    assays of DNA damage can measure the mutagenic effects of in vitro and in vivo hydroxyurea
exposure:  the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransfera se (HPRT) assay that measures the frequency
of mutations at the selectable hprt gene locus (Albertini et al, 1982; O’Neill et al, 1987), and the VDJ
gene locus assays that detect “ illegitimate” interloc us recombination events between the T-cell
receptor V ( and J$ gene loci within chromosome 7 (Stern et al, 1989; Lipkowitz et al, 1992).  Using
these two quantitative assays, the mutagenic effects of in vitro and in vivo hydroxyurea exposurewere measured (Hanft et al, 2000).  In vivo HU exposure was not associated with more DNAmutations in adults with SCD or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), but was associated with asuggestively higher numbers of VDJ events in children with SCD (Table 1).  These results suggestthat the mutagenic potential of HU exposure is low, and serial studies should be performed in youngSCD patients on HU therapy.

VDJ events compared to those with no HU exposure, P=0.04 by ANOVA (Hanft, 2000).
1.6 SUMMARY
Decades of observational data, including landmark studies from the CSSCD, have documented
that sickle cell anemia is a severe, debilitating hematological disorder.  The morbidity and mortalityof SCA arise from both acute vaso-occlusive events and chronic organ damage.  Protection from
HbF is typically lost in infancy and early childhood, with the physiologic decline of HbF.  Accordingly,
____________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-1.wpd —  8/09 Page 1-14 of 1-15    therapy designed to prevent chronic organ damage in SCA should be considered early in life.
Hydroxyurea has emerged as an exciting therapeutic agent for patients with SCA, due to its easeof oral administration, modest toxicity profile, laboratory efficacy with increased %HbF, and clinical
efficacy for acute vaso-occlusive events.  The efficacy of HU in preventing chronic organ damage
has not been tested, but data from the pilot HUSOFT trial suggest that HU may help prevent damageto the spleen and kidneys compared to expec tations from the CSSCD and nonrandomized groups
(Wang et al, 2001; Hankins et al, 2005) not given HU.  Finally, hematological andneurodevelopmental toxicities from HU in infant s and young children with SCA appear to be mild or
absent.  Taken together, the available data make a compelling case for the proposed Phase III trialof hydroxyurea in very young children (9 through 17 months of age) with SCA, designed to prevent
chronic organ damage.

CHAPTER 2
OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN OF THE TRIAL
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Hydroxyurea (HU) has demonstrated laboratory and clinical efficacy for adults with sickle
cell anemia (SCA).  In this patient population, several studies have demonstrated that HU increasesthe hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) parametersincluding %HbF and % F cells.  Toxicities are mild and primarily include transient and reversibleneutropenia.  In the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) clinical trial,which was an NHLBI-sponsored randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adults withSCA, HU reduced the number of acute vaso-occlusive episodes such as painful events and acutechest syndromes, transfusions, and hospitalizations (Charache et al, 1995). 
Pediatric patients with SCA also benefit from HU therapy.  A Phase I/II trial (HUG-KIDS)
involving 84 children who were 5-15 years old concluded that HU was well tolerated by pediatricpatients with SCA, and the laboratory effects were similar to those observed in adults (Kinney etal, 1999).  Several smaller studies have further suggested that HU has clinical efficacy in thisyounger age group (Hoppe et al, 2000; Bernaudin et al, 1999), and reduces the number of acutevaso-occlusive events.  A pilot trial involving infants and very young children with SCA (HUSOFT)
has provided preliminary data demonstrating that HU is well-tolerated in this very young age group,with laboratory effects similar to those for older children (Wang et al, 2001; Hankins et al, 2005).
Although HU therapy has emerged as an exciting and efficacious therapeutic agent for
patients with SCA, important issues remain regarding its use, especially for children less than 2years old.  Perhaps the most important issue is  whether or not HU therapy can prevent chronic
organ damage secondary to vaso-occlusive sickling.  HUSOFT data are suggestive, but notconclusive, regarding the potential for hydroxyurea to prevent chronic organ damage, specifically
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-2 of 2-10  in the spleen and kidney.  Ideally, HU therapy to  prevent organ damage would begin early in life,
before repeated sickling events begin to damage the spleen, brain, kidneys, and lungs.  Anotherimportant issue regarding HU therapy relates to its mechanism of action, e.g., whether or not HbFparameters mediate the prevention of chroni c organ damage.  Finally, there are questions about
the long-term safety of HU administration for young patients with SCA, including its effects ongrowth and development, as well as its mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. 
At this time, however, there are limited data regarding the toxicities, effects on growth and
development, and occurrence of adverse events in this very young age group (9-17 months).
Moreover, the accurate and reproducible quantitat ive measurements of splenic and renal function
have not been fully validated.  For these reasons, a Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study has beenperformed to (1) determine the feasibility of the protocol design, (2) provide additional safety andtoxicity data, and (3) validate the proposed methods of evaluating splenic and renal function.
2.2 SPECIFIC AIMS
The primary aim of this trial is:
 1. To determine whether daily oral hydroxyurea can reduce by 
$50% chronic organ
damage that develops in young children with sickle cell anemia.  
Secondary objectives of this trial include: 1. To determine the relationship between fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and chronic
organ damage in young children with sickle cell anemia;
 2. To investigate the safety of HU for young children with sickle cell anemia regarding
 a. physical growth and development, b. neuropsychological development, c. immunological responses, and  d. mutagenic effects on DNA.

2.3.1 Overview of the Trial
This NHLBI- and NICHD-sponsored Phase III therapeutic trial will be a randomized,
placebo-controlled double-blinded study  and will involve 14 Clinical Centers, a Medical Coordinating
Center, and eight core laboratories within the United States.  The Phase III study will include 200children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) aged 9-17 months.  A Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study hasenrolled 40 children from 12 to 17 months of age.  Each child was randomly assigned to eitherhydroxyurea or placebo and will receive study treat ment for no more than two years (see Figure 2-
1).   Selected data from all 40 children in the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study have been presentedto the DSMB and a decision has been made regarding reopening recruitment for the full study.After the children’s treatment period has ended, t hey will remain in study follow-up to determine
whether or not there are untoward effects of di scontinuing study treatment.  After study treatment
ends, renewed consent will be requested for continued follow-up clinic visits for up to five yearsafter the end of study treatment. 
The target dose of hydroxyurea will be 20 mg/kg/day in liquid formulation or equivalent
volumes of placebo.  A Medical Coordinating Cent er and Pharmacy Distribution Center will ensure
that patients and investigators are blinded to the treatment assignments of individual patients.  Abattery of laboratory tests and special studies w ill be performed at entry and exit.  Clinical events
(including death, acute chest syndrome, and stroke) and other outcomes will be classified by acentral evaluation panel, blind to treatment assigned and under the direction of the MedicalCoordinating Center.  Interim results will be monitored by an NHLBI-appointed Data and SafetyMonitoring Board according to statistical plans outlined in the Protocol (Chapter 4) and elaboratedin a separate document prior to the start of recruitment.  Long-term follow-up in an observationalstudy after study treatment is terminated in BABY HUG is anticipated so that children enrolled in
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-4 of 2-10  BABY HUG will be observed for growth and safety outcomes for at least five years, if resources for
the follow-up can be obtained.  
2.3.2 The Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study
The 40 children enrolled in the Feasibility and Sa fety Pilot Study will be on study treatment
for two years. The DSMB authorized immediately continuing recruitment for the remaining 160children in the full Phase III BABY HUG Clinical Trial.  The anticipated recruitment and follow-upperiods are presented in Figure 2-1.  The Primary Aims of the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Studywere:
1. To determine the feasibility of BABY HUG in terms of recruitment, follow-up,
adherence to study treatment, and compliance with the study schedule ofprocedures;
2. To assess hydroxyurea toxicity, effect on growth and development, and occurrence
of severe/unexpected adverse events;
3. To establish the distribution and inter-observer and intra-observer variability of
spleen function based on dual, independent readings of liver-spleen scans; 
4.
To evaluate  the validity  and variability of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as
estimated  by serum  creatinine  and height  (the Schwartz  formula)  compared  with a
“gold standard” such as DTPA clearance; and,
5. To assess  some  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of hydroxyurea  in the BABY  HUG  age
group.
At study  entry,  plasma  specimens for pharmacokinetics were collected from the blood
collected  as part of the radionuclide (DTPA) study (at 1, 2 and 4 hours following radionuclide
injection), in addition to plasma specimens collected at time 0 and 8 hours from the start of the test.After counting radioactivity in the plasma for the renal function study, the plasma from eachspecimen was saved, frozen (-70° C) for at leas t a month (well after all radiation decays) and
shipped on dry ice for pharmacokinetic evaluations.  The 8-hour specimen was collected after the
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-5 of 2-10  DTPA  study  and was handled  similarly  to the other  four specimens.   Measurements of hydroxyurea
levels  were  made  on specimens  from all 40 children  in a commercial  laboratory  recommended  by
the manufacturer  for regulatory  purposes.   Children assigned to placebo were also tested for DTPA
according  to the same  schedule;  their plasma  was prepared  and shipped  for HU determination  just
as the HU-assigned specimens.  
The DSMB  Chair,  Executive  Secretary  of DSMB,  the NHLBI  Project  Officer  and the Steering
Committee  reviewed  monthly  and semi-annual  Feasibility  and Safety  Pilot Study  reports  including
information on:
1. Recruitment: Expected vs. Actual (overall), and reasons for ineligibility
2. Patients screened, eligible and randomized
3. Patient characteristics at baseline (overall)

cases were summarized also for immediate review by the DSMB Chair, theExecutive Secretary of the DSMB, and the NHLBI Project Officer.
Based on individual patient and group safety monitoring reviews, the Executive Secretary
of the DSMB, the NHLBI Project Officer and/or DSMB Chair could recommend full DSMB reviewor individual treatment interruptions.  All individuals whose treatment was interrupted continued tobe monitored.  There were monthly reviews of accumulating data.  
If height, weight, or Bayley scores were worse among children assigned to HU than children
assigned to placebo through the early months (at l east three) of randomized study treatment, the
DSMB could have recommended to the NHLBI that the full Phase III trial not proceed in children
less than 18 months of age.  If serious  adverse events (e.g., death, stroke, or splenic sequestration)
were more frequent among children assigned to HU than among children assigned to placebo, to
a greater degree than could be expected by chance, the DSMB could have recommended to theNHLBI that the study be discontinued.  If spleen function according to liver-spleen scan readings
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-7 of 2-10  was absent at entry for more than 40% of the children enrolled, the DSMB could have
recommended to the NHLBI to re-design the primary outcome or other features of the study design(e.g., eligibility criteria) as necessary.  See Chapter 4 for detailed study stopping rules. 
2.4 ENDPOINTS
 1. The primary endpoints are chronic organ damage to the spleen and kidney.
 a. Spleen -- organ damage will be defined as decrease or loss of radionuclide
99mTc uptake (relative to the liver) at 2 years from baseline; and, 
 b. Kidney --  Deleted as of May 29, 2009.
 2. Secondary endpoints for this study include the following:
 a. Spleen -- pitted cell count, size as measured by ultrasound; b. Kidney--urine specific gravity, osmolality, urinalysis including
microalbuminuria, size as measured by ultrasound;
 c. Lung -- oxygen saturation (percutaneous monitor);  d. Hepatobiliary – cholelithiasis (ultra sound evaluation), serum bilirubin (direct);
 e. Hematology and Chemistry -- hemoglobin F, serum bilirubin (indirect); f. Clinical events -- e.g., hospitalization, pain, splenic sequestration,
splenomegaly, and acute chest syndrome occurrence; and, 
 g. Transcranial doppler – time averaged maximum flow velocity in the distal
internal carotid/proximal middle cerebral arteries. 
 3. Safety endpoints include the following:
 a. Death, stroke, TIA, splenic sequestration, prolonged hospitalization (greater
than 7 days), life threatening events, acute chest syndrome, ICUadmissions;
 b. Growth -- weight, height, head circumference; c. Brain -- neurodevelopmental testing, neurological examination;
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-8 of 2-10   d. Mutagenesis -- VDJ recombination events (first 140 patients), chromosomal
karyotype and breakage studies; 
 e. Hematology and Chemistry -- hemoglobin, platelets, liver function, etc.; and f. Immune System -- antibody response to immunizations, T-cell counts and
antigen-specific responses.  
2.5 SAFETY MONITORING
 1. Individual patients will be monitored according to routine hematology and
biochemistry parameters (see Section 6.5).  Patients will have treatment
interruptions if any of the following occur: a. a “toxicity” level, as defined in Chapter 10; b. the DSMB confirms a central review recommendation that a decline across
two major percentile lines, or drop below the 1.5
th percentile on age-specific
standard growth curves based on confirmed measurements in height, orweight or head circumference growth warrants a treatment interruption(central reviewers for this aspect of the study are two physicians who are notseeing patients and are not associated with any of the Clinical Centers); 
 c. Bayley standardized Mental score that falls to < 70 (confirmed on repeat
evaluation within three months); or
 d. clinical stroke, or failure of head circumference to increase according to
normal growth curves. 
Treatment will not be terminated unless a to xicity condition persists or therapy that
contraindicates study treatment – such as chronic transfusion – is initiated, to allowthe determination of primary, secondary and safety endpoints in that patient.Children whose treatment is terminated, whether assigned to hydroxyurea orplacebo will complete as much follow-up in BABY HUG as possible (e.g., all primaryendpoint assessments and growth and development assessments will be expected).
______________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-2.wpd — 8/09 Page 2-9 of 2-10    2. Group comparisons between hydro xyurea-assigned patients and placebo-assigned
patients will be included in semi-annual reviews of the data by the Data and SafetyMonitoring Board (see Section 4.4).  These reviews will include all secondary andsafety endpoints defined in the study.  Safety comparisons and inferences based onthem will be discussed by the DSMB as data accrue in the study.
3. Monitoring for unanticipated adverse clinical effects will be done using adverse
event (AE) forms that will be submitted to the Medical Coordinating Center (MCC)
and tabulated based on the affected organ system. A central review group(consisting of two pediatric hematologists with expertise in sickle cell disease andwithout association with the Clinical Centers) will designate each event as seriousor non-serious.  Each suspected serious AE (SAE) will be reported to the MCCwithin 24 hours of the event.  MCC staff will immediately review the material andforward it to the central review group. If the central review group finds that an eventis serious, MCC staff will send the info rmation to the NHLBI and NICHD Project
Officers for review.  The NHLBI Project O fficer will forward the information to the
FDA.  The Clinical Centers will report the occurrence of serious AEs that occur attheir institution according to the requirements of their local IRB.  Further plans foradverse event detection and assessment are in Sections 4.3, 4.4 and Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 3
PATIENT ELIGIBILITY, RECRUITMENT, ORIENTATION, AND INFORMED CONSENT  
3.1 INTRODUCTION
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether hydroxyurea administration can
prevent organ damage commonly found in young child ren with sickle cell anemia.  This will be
accomplished by the administration of hydroxyur ea or placebo to a group of very young children
with sickle cell anemia (or sickle beta zero thalassemia) at an age before extensive organ damagehas usually occurred.  Patients will be randomly a ssigned to receive either hydroxyurea or placebo.
Investigators and patients/parents will be blinded to treatment assignments.
Parents (or guardians) of the first forty patients enrolled were informed that they were
participating in a Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study -- randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind -- testing oral hydroxyurea for the prevention of primary end organ damage (spleen andkidney) in children with sickle cell anemia 12 through 17 months of age at entry.  The DSMB hasauthorized additional recruitment after the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study without an interim wait.All families will be informed that their renewed agr eement will be sought at the end of treatment for
five years or up to ten years of follow-up clinical visits. Primary aims of the Feasibility and SafetyPilot Study are outlined in Section 2.3.  
The end-organ damage found in sickle cell anemia is not uniform in time of onset or
distribution across organs.  While all organs and systems may ultimately be affected, the timing andseverity of organ damage is variable.  For example, damage to the spleen and brain is known tobegin early in life, while that affecting the bones and eyes occurs later.  An additional 160 patientsfrom 9 months  through 17 months of age will be enrolled, before the frequency of extensive organ
damage is high.  However, even at that young age,  some children will already have early evidence
of disease-specific organ damage.  
___________________________________ ______________________ ____________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-3.wpd —  8/09 Page 3-2 of 3-9Care will be taken to avoid coercion of this vulnerable population of parents of children with
sickle cell anemia.  Many of these parents will be young, some single heads of households, somelimited in English language skills, and some may have highly constrained financial resources.Patient/Family advocates have been identified at  each Clinical Center to advise families
independently of any discussions with study investigat ors or health care providers (see Exhibit 3-1).
The services of these advocates will be support ed from study resources.  Documentation of
thorough review of the study and consent form with a Patient/Family Advocate will be required ofeach family enrolling a child in BABY HUG.  The consent form will be appropriately worded andavailable in translation as needed at individual Clinical Centers.  Clinical Center PrincipalInvestigators and staff will be sensitive to the need to diminish the burdens of the study on patientsand families without compromising safety; funds will be provided to families for the purpose ofremoving barriers to participation rather than being inducements for enrolling dependent childrento provide experimental observations.  3.2 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria    • Children with majority fetal and sickle (FS or SF) hemoglobin pattern confirmed centrally byelectrophoresis, who are 9  through 17 months of age, and whose parents have provided writteninformed consent can be eligible for BABY HUG.  Patient screening may begin at 7 months of age.    • For the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study, eligible children were enrolled between 12 and17 months (up to 18 months) of age.  The age r ange of organ damage onset is usually between six
and 23 months of age.  Children less than nine months of age will be excluded from BABY HUGdue to potential toxicity concerns; nine to twelve-month old children were excluded until a finalsafety analysis (April, 2005) was performed on the 12-17 month old children enrolled in theFeasibility and Safety Pilot Study; enrollment of 18-23 month old children will not be allowed inBABY HUG.

3.3 RECRUITMENT
The 14 BABY HUG Clinical Centers will have an active recruitment phase designed to enroll
patients  into the BABY HUG study. Each Clinical Center will draw upon its own patient rosters forpotential patients, as well as additional local patients who fall within its catchment area. Patientswho are not normally followed at a Clinical Center  will still be eligible for enrollment. Publicity for
the sickle cell community and physicians conc erning the BABY HUG study will occur at each
Clinical Center according to local needs and will be at the discretion of the Principal Investigatorwith appropriate Institutional Review Board, NICHD and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Instituteapproval. The BABY HUG study will have a quarterly newsletter for patient families which may alsobe used for recruitment.  
Potentially eligible children will be identified by the Clinical Center staff.  It is anticipated that
most eligible children will be known to the Clinical Centers through referrals after identificationthrough newborn screening programs.  All potential study patients’ families will be referred toindependent, Patient/Family advocates who are not otherwise involved in BABY HUG or in
providing health care to these children or their families (see Section 3.7).  Parents (or guardians)will receive information on BABY HUG after t hey have been provided education about sickle cell
anemia.  Chart review and initial visits will be used to exclude children who would not be eligiblefor BABY HUG.  
___________________________________ ______________________ ____________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-3.wpd —  8/09 Page 3-5 of 3-9For the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study, children began to be evaluated for eligibility as
early as 10 months of age in anticipation that they would qualify for the study in two months.  Nochild was randomized prior to his/her first birthday.  For the main study, children may begin to beevaluated for eligibility as early as 7 months of age, with randomization occurring no earlier than9 months of age.    3.4 PARENT/GUARDIAN ORIENTATION
The experience with hydroxyurea will be pres ented, including evidence of clinical benefit
in adults and apparent safety in children above one year of age. 
Known risks will be described in detail along with the fact that relatively little is known about
drug effects in this age group. A list of the known and possible risks (including possible malignancyor growth retardation which are not definitely known to be risks of HU) will be provided to families.
The Protocol and related issues will be discussed in detail and a copy of the consent form
provided to the parents or guardians to consider at home.  Parents (or guardians) will be given a
list of baseline evaluations that must be completed prior to study entry (see Appendix B), and anexplanation that children who do not complete the baseline evaluations cannot enroll in BABY HUG.They will then be provided with a list of procedures that will be required after they enroll their child
in BABY HUG (see Appendix B).  Explanations of these procedures will include the risk of radiationexposure associated with the radionuclide kidney function test and the liver-spleen scan. Finally,parents (or guardians) will meet with assigned independent Patient/Family advocates to discuss
making a decision whether or not to enroll their child in BABY HUG. 
Parents (or guardians) will be informed that their child’s participation in BABY HUG and their
child’s treatment, which will be made known to them at the end of the last-enrolled child’s treatment
in the study (along with study conclusions), should be noted in their child’s medical record.  Thisinformation should be provided by the parents (or guardians) to all doctors taking care of their child.At the start of each child’s long-term follow-up, the parents (or guardians) will be contacted for
___________________________________ ______________________ ____________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-3.wpd —  8/09 Page 3-6 of 3-9permission to examine their children for up to five to ten years to learn about any long term effects
the study treatment may have. 
Parents (or guardians) who express interest in BABY HUG will be advised of the importance
of adherence with study visits and procedures.  Evidence of compliance with clinic visits and of
compliance with standard care for sickle cell anemia such as prophylactic penicillin administration(see Section 8.3) will be documented in BABY HUG.  Study personnel will use this information toestimate the family’s likelihood of complying with study requirements. 3.5 BASELINE ASSESSMENT
The children of those parents who express inte rest in participation will undergo the pre-
enrollment studies listed in this section.  Children who are unable to complete baseline evaluationswill not be enrolled in BABY HUG.  After obtaining informed consent (see attachment to thischapter) from the parent or guardian, baseline studies will be performed before randomization and
enrollment.  Baseline assessment includes:  • Directed history and physical examination (including neurological evaluation)  • Hemoglobin electrophoresis  • Complete blood count and other baseline blood determinations  • Urinalysis, including urine concentrating ability  • Anthropometry: Height, weight and head circumference  • Neuropsychological evaluation and parent questionnaire  • Liver-spleen scan  • Abdominal sonogram (for gallstones, spleen size and kidney size)  • Transcranial doppler measurements (interpretable study not required, but confirmed velocity
>
200 cm/sec results in ineligibility)
Renal  DTPA  clearance  studies will be evaluated after the first dose of medication is given
(i.e., after randomization) for all children enrolling in BABY HUG. 
___________________________________ ______________________ ____________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-3.wpd —  8/09 Page 3-7 of 3-9Children whose hemoglobin electrophoresis does not document an FS or SF pattern will not
be eligible for BABY HUG.  Any serious medical problems unrelated to sickle cell anemia, forexample, leukemia or cerebral palsy or mental re tardation, identified in the course of pre-enrollment
evaluations (e.g., history and physical examination, complete blood counts, neuropsychologicalevaluations) will result in referral for appropriate medical care and ineligibility for BABY HUG.  3.6 INFORMED CONSENT
Individual Clinical Center consent form s will be prepared based on a model informed
consent approved by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  Recruitment brochures (including the
BABY HUG study quarterly newsletter) or advertisem ents, consent forms and the Protocol will be
submitted for approval by local Institutional Re view Boards.  Each final consent form will be
reviewed by a member of the BABY HUG Data and Safety Monitoring Board (See Section 13.3) toensure all appropriate issues are addressed.  Patient/Family advocates  have been identified at
each Clinical Center to advise families independent ly of any discussions they have with study
investigators or health care providers.  
The Clinical Center Principal Investigator w ill obtain the consent from each family.  If both
parents are reasonably available and responsible for the child, they will both be asked for signed,informed consent.  Copies of the signed consent form will be given to the parents (or guardians)and placed on the child’s medical record.  The original will be maintained in study files by thePrincipal Investigator.3.7 PATIENT/FAMILY ADVOCATES
Each BABY HUG Clinical Center will develop a plan to have a third party person
(Patient/Family advocate) involved in the consent process to eliminate any coercion, in particular
because of the vulnerable study population.  Some BABY HUG Clinical Center Institutional ReviewBoards employ a full time staff to function in  this capacity.  The Patient/Family advocate role
focuses on ensuring that systems are in place and working effectively to minimize research-related
___________________________________ ______________________ ____________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-3.wpd —  8/09 Page 3-8 of 3-9risks experienced by patients and families, addressi ng concerns or complaints that arise from
treatment or research, and facilitating resolution of substantive issues that could have negative
impacts on patient/family understanding of and partici pation in research (see Exhibit 3-1).  The
Patient/Family advocate acts as an impartial advoc ate to ensure that patients/families are treated
fairly and equitably, are directed to appropriate resources within the institution for resolution of non-clinical, operational problems and are assisted in their communication with all Clinical Center staff.The Patient/Family advocate is responsible for appropriately collaborating with all internal andexternal resources required to bring closure to the issues presented.  Meeting(s) with thePatient/Family advocate will be documented for each child enrolling in BABY HUG.

CHAPTER 4
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The primary objective of Pediatric Hydroxyurea Phase III Clinical Trial (BABY HUG) is to
determine the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyurea (HU) in the prevention of chronic end organinjury occurring among sickle cell anemia patients who are 9 through 17 months of age at the timeof study entry. A Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study  initiated BABY HUG recruitment with 40 patients
12 through 17 months of age to (1) determine the feasibility of the protocol design, (2) provideadditional safety and toxicity data, and (3) validate the proposed methods of quantitating splenicand renal function.  This initial group was studied intensively and monitored closely.  The DSMBhas recommended that 160 additional participants be enrolled in BABY HUG for a total of 200patients in the full Phase III trial.  The primary analysis in the full study will compare the frequencyof worsening of spleen function (from normal to decreased or absent, or from decreased to absent)as measured by splenic uptake on a technetium -99m  sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan at two years
of follow-up after study entry in patients randomly  assigned to treatment with hydroxyurea versus
those assigned to placebo.  Data monitoring anal yses are scheduled every six months from the
start of enrollment in the study.  
The analysis of the primary study outcomes of the full Phase III trial will be conducted on
an "intention to treat" basis, with two-sided statistical tests comparing the outcome between groupsof patients defined at study entry by random assignment to the hydroxyurea and placebo groups.
Blinding of outcomes in the primary analysis is protected by use of placebo, standardized methodsfor performance of spleen scintigraphy studies  in nuclear medicine departments not otherwise
involved in the BABY HUG, and bli nded central reading of spleen scans by nuclear medicine
specialists not otherwise involved in BABY HUG.  There will be more than 90% power to detect a

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-2 of 4-37  50% reduction in the incidence of categorical wo rsening of spleen function, if 60% or more of
patients assigned to placebo experience categorical worsening of spleen function (80% areexpected to experience this effect by 3 to 4 years of age).  A more detailed presentation ofanticipated analyses is provided in Sections 4.4 through 4.7.  4.2 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS4.2.1 Spleen Scintigraphy
The spleen is damaged early in life in a large percentage of children with sickle cell anemia
or sickle beta zero thalassemia.  The consequences of splenic injury -- episodes of splenicsequestration and invasive pneumococcal infection -- are clinically significant and quantifiable.These clinical events will not form the spleen endpoint per se, but will be evaluated along with otherclinical events during the course of the study. 
Nearly 40 years ago it was recognized that young children with sickle cell anemia were at
high risk of bacteremia with encapsulated organisms, and that the consequence of those invasiveinfections was often fatal septicemia.  This susceptibility was attributed to splenic dysfunction, andindeed many of these young children had Howell- Jolly bodies on their peripheral blood smears;
however, on clinical examination these patients also often had palpable, enlarged spleens.  Thusthe concept of functional asplenia, in which a palpable, enlarged spleen did not function normally,was developed or invoked to explain the clinical observation in children with sickle cell disease(Pearson et al, 1969).  The standard procedure used to detect functional asplenia is the 
99mTc
sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scan.  Liver-spleen scans are available in all participating BABY HUGinstitutions and their performance in each center is well standardized.  Pediatric hematologists areaware that spleen function declines with age in infants and toddlers with sickle cell anemia;however, there are no good data on the cross sectional frequency or rate of loss of splenic uptakeof 
99mTc sulfur colloid at a given age in young patients with sickle cell anemia.
The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), a National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) - sponsored observational study that has been responsible for documenting the
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-3 of 4-37  clinical course of sickle cell disease in the U.S., examined pitted cell counts and liver-spleen scans
in a cross-sectional cohort of 8 to 13 month old patients.  Pearson (Pearson et al, 1985) reportedthat by 8 to 13 months of age, 23% of infants with HbSS had absent and 8% had decreased splenicuptake of 
99mTc sulfur-colloid on liver-spleen scan indicating functional asplenia.  Decreased or
absent visualization of the spleen on liver-spleen scan correlated with a pitted cell count over 3.5%in this group of young children with sickle cell disease.  
Spleen function will be assessed by uptake of 
99mTc sulfur colloid on liver-spleen scan before
initiation of treatment and 2 years later.  The re sults of each of the two scans will be categorized
as normal, functional but abnormal, or not functional by a panel of nuclear medicine specialistsblinded to treatment assignment.  In HUSOFT, the intra-observer agreement on re-reading scanswas over 90% (33/36 scan readings) (Rogers, unpublished observations).  The difference betweenthe HU and placebo groups in the proportion of patients worsening in spleen function over the studyperiod will be tested. 
The CSSCD further examined spleen function by serial performance of pitted cell counts.
Their data indicated that by one year of age pitted cell count values over 3.5%, which areassociated with absent visualization on liver-spleen scan, occurred in 28% of SCA patients, by 18months 44%, by 24 months 58%, by 36 months  78%, and by 48 months 89% of SCA patients.
They concluded that the average age of onset of a pitted cell count greater than 2% but less than3.5%, i.e., impaired spleen function, was 13 months and could be as early as 5 months (Pearsonet al, 1985).  Thus, up to one-third of enrolled children could be unassessable for worsening ofspleen function (will have absent spleen function at entry). 
At entry into the HUSOFT pilot trial, liver-spleen scans showed absent uptake in 24% of
patients at entry (mean age 15 months).  Afte r 2 years on HU (mean age 39 months) 47% of the
scans were interpreted as demonstrating absent uptake (functional asplenia).  Since the CSSCDpitted cell count data suggest that functional asplenia should have been present in 34% of patients
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-4 of 4-37  at entry and 80% at exit, HUSOFT suggests a possible spleen protection benefit compared to
untreated patients (Pearson et al, 1985; Wang et al, 2001; Hankins et al, 2005).  
Therapy with hydroxyurea, however, may alter the ability of the pitted cell count to
accurately reflect spleen function.  A longer red cell life span (which may be expected to occurwhen fetal hemoglobin rises and intravascular hemol ysis decreases during hydroxyurea therapy)
will likely increase the pitted cell counts.  Elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin may increase the rateof endocytosis, and thereby also increase the pitted cell counts.  Conversely, preservation of spleenfunction while on HU therapy could maintain low pitted cell counts.  Restoration of splenic functionon HU therapy, analogous to the effect observed on chronic transfusion therapy, would be expected
to decrease the pitted cell counts (Sills et al, 1988; Lane et al, 1996).  
The entry and exit 
99mTc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scans will be individually read by a panel
of three radiologists not involved in the acquisition of the images.  Scans will be categorized asshowing normal, decreased, or absent spleen function, and then will be compared for change.  Inthe unlikely event of an apparent increase in splenic uptake of sulfur colloid, splenic function willbe counted as stable.  The proportion of patients whose paired scans demonstrate a decline insplenic function will be compared in the HU versus placebo groups.  Statistical power to detectdifferences that are 50% (relative) or greater in the incidence of worsening of spleen function shouldbe good to excellent, in view of the fact that over 80% of children with sickle cell anemia would beexpected to lose splenic function completely by  the end of the treatment period (Pearson,  1988).
Scintigraphic assessment of splenic function is one of the two primary endpoints of BABY HUG. 
In a recent publication (Santos et al, 2002) on splenic function in older children (none in the
BABY HUG age range) treated with hydroxyurea for sickle cell anemia, semi-quantitative analysesusing spleen/liver ratios were conducted. However, only two of 21 (9.5%) patients in this before-after comparison showed large degrees of improvement, and one showed a large degree of
deterioration. Small differences that were inte rpreted as improvement could be random noise.  In
HUSOFT, only one of 17 (5.9%) patients (most in the BABY HUG age range) had improved spleen
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-5 of 4-37  function in a before-after assessment of hydroxyurea therapy. To evaluate the potential for splenic
function improvement in BABY HUG, a blinded review of spleen function will be made in the BABYHUG study. 
Tables 4-1 and 4-2 show the power to detect a difference between categories of a
trichotomous endpoint for varying levels of treatment and placebo patient improvement rates (inincrements of 0.05) that are possible given the placebo incidence rate; the calculations in Table 4-1assume a placebo incidence rate of worsening spleen function of 80/100 patients (see Section4.4.3) over the course of two years whereas Table 4-2 is based on 60/100 (see Section 4.4.1.5).The boldface line in each table denotes the power “break-even” point between the dichotomousendpoint (assuming 20% of the patients have no spleen function at study entry and thus cannotworsen) and the ordi nal endpoint.  For example, in the current study design with a dichotomous
endpoint, we have 96.8% power to detect a difference between the two categories (assuming aplacebo incidence rate of 0.60 and 80 patients in each group).  Thus, the boldface line in Table 4-2is drawn along the 96.8% power continuum.  For all treatment/placebo improvement ratecombinations to the left of the line, the dic hotomous endpoint w ill provide greater power; for all
combinations to the right of the line, the ordinal endpoint will provide greater power.

4.3 SECONDARY AND SAFETY ENDPOINTS4.3.1 Central Nervous System
In addition to potential HU toxicity or protection of brain development, CNS infarction may
occur during this study period and this will affect outcome.  In the CSSCD, at the time of first CNSevaluation (around 6 years of age), 5% of children with HbSS disease had experienced a clinicalCVA (Armstrong et al, 1996; Moser et al, 1996).  Other CSSCD findings related to stroke suggestthat the first clinical CVA may occur by 2- 3 years of age (Ohene-Frempong, 1991).  Evaluation of
neurodevelopmental functioning will help determine whether HU (a) increases developmental risk,
either through an increase in the occurrence of CNS infarction or some other pathophysiologicprocess (e.g., vascular formation and function, metabolic activity, hypoxia; Brown et al, 1993), (b)decreases infarction risk, or c) has no effect on CNS development.  These evaluations areparticularly sensitive to a child’s neurodevelopmental  course during the first years of life. They make
comparisons based on  normative motor (gross motor and fine motor) and language and verbal skilldevelopment during the first 3.5 years of life, and these discriminate between children with disease
progression and those with no disease progression (Gay et al, 1995).
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-9 of 4-37  Neurological examinations and neuropsychologic evaluations with Bayley and Vineland
tests will be performed annually, and compared betw een treatment groups as part of early and
ongoing monitoring as well as for the 2-year out come.  Head circumference measurements will be
performed quarterly and compared to a normal black population (Pivnick et al, 1999). 4.3.2 Spleen
99mTc sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scans provide significant information about spleen function
but, since they involve radionuclide exposure, cannot be repeated frequently.  During the processof aging, the red cell membrane forms vacuoles, which appear on the surface of the cell as “pits”under Nomarski optics.  Pitted or pocked red cells are removed from the circulation by splenicmacrophages.  Thus t he percentage of red cells with pits increases as splenic function declines
(Pearson et al, 1985).  Pearson reported that pit counts >3.5% correlated with nonvisualization ofthe spleen on liver-spleen scan (Pearson et al, 1969).  Thus, serial pitted cell counts cantheoretically serve as a surrogate for liver-spleen scan determinations of splenic function in themost patients with sickle cell anemia.  However the cumulative effect of hydroxyurea therapy onpitted cell counts is not known.
Pitted cell counts are performed as follows:  One drop of EDTA anticoagulated fresh venous
blood is fixed in 0.5 ml of isotonic 1% buffered glutaraldehyde.  One thousand cells are countedunder Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy and scored for percentage of pittedcells by an experienced technologist.  The test should be performed in a laboratory withdemonstrated long term interest and expertise in order to assure that the numerical values at theend of the study can be compared to those at the start.  
Entry, exit and interim pitted cell counts will be compared.  Statistical models will be used
to compare entry and exit values and test for trends.  In this manner we may be able to validate theuse of the pitted cell count, which is less invasive than the liver-spleen scan, to assess splenicfunction during hydroxyurea therapy.  The proportion of patients in the HU treatment groupcompared to the placebo treated group with pitted cell counts above predetermined thresholds will
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-10 of 4-37  be a secondary outcome measure in BABY HUG.  
4.3.3 Kidney Function and Bladder Control
Proteinuria occurs in 6.2% of children with sickle cell anemia, and the rate increases with
age (Wigfall et al, 2000). Microalbuminuria is an early marker of other nephropathies, and occursin 26.5% of children with sickle cell anemia (Darnidharka et al, 1998); however, it was not detectedin children under 7 years of age in the only reported study in children. Ultrasound imaging of thekidneys often reveals increased size and echogenici ty (Miller, unpublished observations).  Normal
kidneys increase from approximately 6 to 8 cm in lengt h over the first 4 years of life; in infants with
a single functioning kidney, hypertrophy results in a length of 10 cm by the age of 3-4 yr. (Laufer
and Griscom, 1971). 
Not only is renal failure a significant problem in adults with sickle cell anemia, the problem
of enuresis and/or nocturia is nearly ubiquitous in children with sickle cell anemia, and isembarrassing and inconvenient.  The CSSCD documented nocturia in 58% of 6 year-olds, andenuresis in 58% (75% of males).  Forty-one percent of males remained enuretic at age 12 years.In comparison, 75% of normal children have noctu rnal bladder control by 4 years of age (Rudolph
and Kamei, 1998).  Treatment of enuresis is often ineffective.  Enuresis is related to loss of abilityto concentrate urine.  Enrolled patients’ urine concentration will be evaluated by measuring urineand serum osmolality, after overnight and early AM withholding of water at baseline (prior torandom treatment assignment) and at the end of st udy treatment (e.g., this could be incidentally
accomplished when the children are NPO for abdominal sonogram studies).  Urine and sera willbe shipped to the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory for measurement of the urineosmolality (mOsml/kg water), and serum osmolality and creatinine (LaPorte-Wijsman and Struyker-Boudier, 1967).  Specific gravity will be measured locally at the Clinical Center on routine
urinanalysis.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-11 of 4-37  4.3.4 Abdominal Sonogram
Although hepatomegaly commonly occurs in in fants and young childr en with sickle cell
anemia and some patients have total indirect bilirubin levels in excess of that attributable solely tohemolysis (recently attributed to mutations of the glucuronosyl transferase gene), hepaticdysfunction, as detected by direct hyperbilirubinem ia, elevation of liver specific enzymes (ALT),
hypoalbuminemia, or coagulopathy, is rare; in fact if it occurs, other causes must be carefullysought.  However, as with most chronic hemolytic disorders, cholelithiasis is common in sickle cellanemia.  Bilirubinate pigment stones have recently been estimated to occur in 14% of children byage 10 years.  However, an early study using only radiography found gallstones in 17% of childrenunder the age of ten (Schubert, 1986; Stephens and Scott, 1980).  Only about 50% of pigment
stones are radio-opaque, suggesting that there may have been a much higher incidence of stonesin this early series.  While often stones are asymptomatic, cholecystectomy is nonetheless acommon elective surgical procedure in individuals with sickle cell anemia and sometimes must beperformed urgently (Vichinsky et al, 1995).  Common duct obstruction is a common and morbidcomplication of cholelithiasis.  Cholelithiasis is best diagnosed by ultrasonography (Sarnaik et al,1980).  Hydroxyurea therapy, by increasing total and fetal hemoglobin and reducing hemolysis,might reduce the incidence of gallstones. 
Abdominal ultrasonography techniques will visualize the kidneys and right upper quadrant,
and sonograms can be read centrally with attention to presence or absence of gallstones or sludge,the presence or absence of gall bladder thickening or duct dilation, renal volume and echogenicity,liver enlargement and spleen volume and size. 4.3.5 Pulmonary
The pulmonary system is adversely affected by SCA, in particular because of the
phenomenon of the acute chest syndrome (ACS).  There is evidence that the development of
chronic lung disease in adults with SCA is associated with recurrent episodes of ACS (Santoli etal, 1998).  Several methods have been used to assess pulmonary function in patients with SCA,
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-12 of 4-37  including transcutaneous pulse-oximetry.  The progression of pulmonary dysfunction in SCA may
be assessed with pulse oximetry, which measur es hemoglobin oxygen satu ration transcutaneously.
Although there are some methodologic problems with its use in sickle cell anemia due to abnormalhemoglobin oxygen half-saturation (P-50) in HbSS patients, this non-invasive, inexpensivetechnique has been the most widely studied method in SCA.  In a study of 108 children with SCA,those with histories of ACS had lower saturati ons (mean = 94%) than those without a history of
ACS (mean = 98%) (Rackoff et al, 1993).  Oxygen sa turation by pulse oximetry will be measured
at entry and every three months.  4.3.6 Anthropometry
Standing or sitting weight will be measured at every clinic visit (see Appendix E).
Recumbent length (standing height after 18 months of age) and head circumference (see AppendixE) will be obtained quarterly. These measurements will be checked for quality with longitudinal dataanalysis methods and compared between treatment groups using t-tests and longitudinal dataanalysis.  4.3.7 Chromosome Analysis
Karyotype and chromosome breakage studies will be performed to determine whether or
not hydroxyurea is clastogenic in children.  Hydroxyurea has been clastogenic in onion root tips andalters mouse testicular kinetics and sperm chromosome structure, but it is not certain whetherhydroxyurea is clastogenic in humans (Evenson and Jost, 1993). 4.3.8 Acquired DNA Mutations
Mutation events will be evaluated centrally in  a defined DNA model to determine whether
or not hydroxyurea is mutagenic.  The mutagenicity of hydroxyurea is controversial.  Mutationanalyses will be performed for illegitimate T cell receptor (VDJ) recombinations in the MutationAnalysis Core Laboratory at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-13 of 4-37  4.3.9 Immune Function
Because hydroxyurea has the capacity both to suppress immune response and to alter
spleen function, it is of interest to observe directly the effect of hydroxyurea on antibody formationand on immune cell populations.  To this purpose, specific antibody titers and opsonization assaysbefore and after measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization and conjugate pneumococcalimmunization will be compared between the treatm ent groups.  Also, T-cell subpopulations will be
evaluated by flow cytometry.  4.3.10 Clinical Events
All patients will be monitored for the occurrence and severity of clinical events.  These will
be identified through the use of standardized history questions administered at each clinicalencounter. At each visit, parents will be asked to describe any illnesses experienced since the lastvisit.  If illness is reported, a directed history will be obtained to allow its characterization.  All eventswill be reported utilizing standardized definitions (See Appendix F) on an Events Form.Documentation (discharge summaries, clinic/emergency department records, local laboratoryvalues or radiology reports) for all fatal or life threatening events will be collected by Clinical Center
staff for review.  Events of interest include bacteremia with known pathogens, meningitis, splenicsequestration, acute chest syndrome, stroke or trans ient ischemic attacks, osteomyelitis, all hospital
admissions and any event for which the patient receives a transfusion.  Selected events and
supporting documentation collected by Clinical C enter staff will be reviewed centrally by two
pediatric hematologists who are not involved in the BABY HUG Clinical Center.  
Pain (Platt et al, 1991) and acute chest syndrome (Castro et al, 1994) are the most frequent
complications of sickle cell disease and most frequent causes of hospitalization.  In addition tocausing substantial morbidity, both have been associated with early death (Platt et al, 1994), andacute chest syndrome has been associated both with chronic sickle cell lung disease (Powars etal, 1988), a major cause of morbidity in adults, and also with increased risk of infarctive stroke(Ohene-Frempong et al, 1998).  One of the earliest clin ical manifestations of sickle cell disease,
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-14 of 4-37  dactylitis, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes later in childhood in the Jamaican cohort
(Stevens et al, 1981), and recently early onset of  dactylitis was associated with an increased risk
of death, stroke, or recurrent pain and acute chest syndrome later in childhood in the CooperativeStudy of Sickle Cell Disease (Miller et al, 2000).  
The Multicenter Hydroxyurea Study (MSH) was stopped early due to significant reduction
in these major sickle cell complications (Charache et al, 1995).  Several single institution pediatrictrials have suggested that similar beneficial clin ical effects will be seen in children treated with
hydroxyurea (Ferster et al, 1996; Jayabose et al, 1996; Maier-Redelsperger et al, 1999; Olivieri andVichinsky, 1998; Scott et al, 1996).  In the newbor n cohort, comprised of infants enrolled to the
CSSCD prior to six months of age, frequencies of complications in infants with Hb SS per 100patient-years of observation were reported (Gill et al, 1995). Table 4-3 summarizes the frequencies.

In comparison, event rates among the HUSOFT children, who were treated with
hydroxyurea starting at six to twenty four months of age and followed for up to two years were17/100 patient years for pain events and 15/100 patient years for acute chest syndrome
occurrences.  These data suggest that hydroxyurea may have clinical efficacy in these very youngchildren.  
While the acute chest syndrome in children may be different than that seen in adults (Castro
et al, 1994; Golden et al, 1998; Vichinsky et al, 1997), with children having more infectious causes,
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-15 of 4-37  it is clear that, at least in older children with sickle cell disease, chronic transfusion substantially
reduces the frequency of this complication in the pediatric population.  Both in a retrospectivereview by Oakland Children’s Hospital (Styles and Vichinsky, 1994) and in a prospective analysisof the patients enrolled in the Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) (Miller et al, 2001)there were reductions in acute chest syndrome with transfusion.  Hydroxyurea therapy may similarlyreduce frequency of these events in BABY HUG. Since the primary concern of the BABY HUGinvestigators is the prevention of organ damage, the study will not be terminated for anydemonstrated advantage of hydroxyurea over placebo in  terms of the occurrence of clinical events.
If these expectations are proven incorrect, and hydroxyurea is associated with a demonstrablyincreased frequency of death, stroke, acute chest syndrome or c onsequential sp lenic sequestration
events, the study would be terminated.  
Events to be centrally reviewed include all Serious Adverse Events (e.g., death, events that
are life-threatening, events that cause or prolong hospitalization greater than 7 days, splenicsequestration crisis, acute chest syndrome, stroke , transient ischemic attacks, ICU admissions and
any AE that is related to study treatment and unexpected).  Other clinical occurrences will bedenoted as having occurred or not occurred on clinic visit reports.  There is adequate statisticalpower in BABY HUG to detect 50% differences bet ween treatment groups at alpha = 0.01 if the
event rates are in the range expected from the CSSCD and the study is completed with 200patients.  The BABY HUG investigators do not plan for early termination based on clinical eventsother than demonstrated inferiority of hydroxyurea for the outcomes death, stroke or splenicsequestration.  4.3.11 Transcranial Doppler Measurements
In children between the ages of 2 and 16 years, an abnormal TCD velocity (200 cm/sec or
more) in the proximal middle cerebral artery or  distal internal caroti d artery has been found to
predict a high risk of stroke.  In the STOP study, a randomized trial in which chronic transfusion wascompared with observation in patients with abnormal TCD velocities, a greater than 90% reduction
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-16 of 4-37  in stroke risk was associated with transfusion (Adams et al, 1998).  More recently, Zimmerman and
Ware (Zimmerman et al, 2002) have presented evi dence that hydroxyurea treatment in school-aged
children is associated with a lower TCD velocity, in part related to improved hemoglobin levels.  Inaddition, Bowman and Adams (Bowman et al, 2002) hav e recently presented information indicating
that TCD measurements can be performed in very young children with sickle cell disease, ages 2-
21 months (mean 11 mo.); 23 of these 27 children were able to have TCD studies performed andin 22 of those 23, meaningful results were obtained (although only 7 had complete studies).  Themean TCD velocity was 109 cm/sec., substantially lower than in school-aged children.  Studies fromthe French group led by Bernaudi n (Bernaudin et al, 2001) have al so shown a lowering of TCD
velocity in children (age 3-18 years) when treated with hydroxyurea.  
These data raise the possibility that infants who are randomized to hydroxyurea in the BABY
HUG trial may have a lower TCD velocity compared to the control group receiving placebo.  If TCD
velocity is considered a surrogate marker for stroke risk in this population, velocities may providea continuous variable which can be used as an endpoint of hydroxyurea efficacy.  There are,however, a number of unanswered questions:  Are the lower velocities seen in infants with sicklecell disease likely to be modulated by hydroxyur ea?  Are the effects, if any, mediated by changes
in hemoglobin level and other red cell properties?  Does a lowering of TCD within the normal range(for example, from 150 to 130 cm/sec) actually result  in a reduced stroke risk?  At this time, these
questions cannot be fully addressed and, therefore, TCD would not be likely to be useful foraddressing the primary objective of BABY HUG:  Does hydroxyurea prevent organ damage?However, the potential for TCD measurements to provide relevant data on the risk of CNS eventsin this population warrants inclusion of these studies as a secondary endpoint for evaluatingprevention of organ damage by hydroxyurea.

4.4.1 Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study
The Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study has been completed and these sections have been
removed for the sake of Protocol continuity. The relevant modifications, based on information fromthe Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study, have been incorporated into this Protocol revision. 4.4.2 Primary Treatment Comparison (Full Phase III Trial)
Most of the studies conducted in BABY HUG w ill compare the effect of treatment with
hydroxyurea (HU) to treatment with placebo (PLB O).  This study will be conducted with one primary
endpoint: worsening of spleen function from normal to decreased or absent, or from decreased toabsent on uptake of technetium sulfur colloid.
The primary analysis in the full Phase III trial will be done using an intention-to-treat
principle.  Patients randomly assigned to a tr eatment will be analyzed according to the assigned
treatment, irrespective of whether the treatment  was actually given.  The spleen endpoint will be
tested at an overall alpha = 0.04.  An interim monitoring plan is proposed for each of theseendpoints.  The interim monitoring plan will be constructed such that the experiment-wise error rateof the study is preserved at the specified overall alpha levels (0.04 for spleen).  The monitoring planwill reserve most of the alpha level for the final comparison.  The shape of the rejection regions willfollow a Haybittle (Haybittle, 1971) type plan with consistent, wide bounds set for the interimanalyses and a bound for the final analysis approximately equal to the critical value that would beused if there were no interim monitoring.  Actual allocation of alpha will be done using the spendingfunctions of Lan and DeMets (Lan and DeMets, 1983).  
The BABY HUG investigators considered using a single primary endpoint for this study and
developing composite scores of different endpoints.  Five different organs were considered:  thebrain, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney.  The rationale follows:  
Primary endpoints based on neurological and neuro-imaging evaluations were excluded
because the incidence of central nervous system injury is too infrequent (e.g., stroke less than 1
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-18 of 4-37  per 100 children per year) for a study of 200 very  young children.  Also, central nervous system
outcomes will be monitored for safety as are continuous measures of brain function(e.g.,neuropsychological tests and head circumference).  Differences in transcranial doppler (TCD)velocities have not yet been confirmed as clinic ally important below 170 cm/sec and have not been
shown to be clinically useful in children less t han two years old.  All of these assessments are of
interest as secondary endpoints.
The lung was excluded since there are no reproducibly good pulmonary function tests over
this age range; spirometry is hard to obtain on infants and pulse-oximetry lacks the variabilitynecessary to be considered as a primary endpoint (e.g., infants do not vary much from 94-98%under normal circumstances).  
Liver damage that could be detected using standard measures is rare in untransfused very
young children.  The incidence of gallstones in very young children is expected to be low.  
As described fully in Chapter 1, spleen function deteriorates rapidly in the absence of
treatment, and treatment with HU may have a subst antial effect on this endpoint over a two-year
period.  Spleen function on 
99mTc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan can be characterized as normal,
decreased or absent.  This evaluation of the spleen is categorical in nature.  Categorical endpointsgenerally require greater sample sizes than cont inuous measures to detect clinically meaningful
differences.  
DTPA GFR was originally a primary endpoint for this study but its measurement was
discontinued as of May 29, 2009.
The features common to power evaluations for this endpoint are the critical values used to
determine the alpha level and power.  We have designated these values as Z
" and Z$ respectively.
”N” is the number of children in each treatment group necessary for this study.  We have presented
the formulas for study size calculations, but each of these formulas can be algebraically rearrangedto provide corresponding power calculations.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-20 of 4-37   is the average of p1 and p2,  = 1-  and N = study size (each group).  The overall alpha level p q p
of this comparison will be alpha = 0.04 (two-tailed).  
We will test the null hypothesis:H
O: p1 = p2
versus the alternative:H
A: p1 …p2.
There are four planned interim reviews of this endpoint by the DSMB over the course of the
study.  Allowing for sequential tests of the endpoint, nominal values of Z = 3.5 will be used forinterim looks, the final comparison will be performed at a nominal alpha level of 0.0394 (Z
" =2.06).
It is assumed that the rate of worsening function of the spleen will be at least 80% in the PLBOgroup.  Figure 4-1 presents the power to detect 50% reductions in the spleen endpoint event rateas a function of a range of anticipated placebo event rates for categorically worse or absent spleenfunction by the end of the study, and of a range of possible sample sizes from 20 to 100 per group.A review of this figure shows that the proposed study will have adequate power (80% or more) todetect 50% reductions in the rate of absent spleen function in the HU group, provided that thesample size is 70 or more in each of the treatment arms.  Even with 20% of the initial study population classified as having absent spleen function, the realized sample size of 160 infants (80in each group) will have more than 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of theendpoint as a result of the administration of HU, if the PLBO group incidence of this endpoint is60% or more.   With 30% of the initial study population classified as having absent spleen function,the realized sample size of 140 infants (70 in each group) will have more than 80% power to detecta 50% reduction in the incidence of the endpoint as a result of the administration of HU.  Based onCSSCD data, by 48 months of age, at least 80% of patients assigned to placebo are expected tohave absent spleen function.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-21 of 4-37  The power to detect a 50% reduction in worsening of spleen function for the current study
design is shown graphically in Figure 4-1 for five  placebo incidence (of wors ening) rates.  In the
presence of treatment crossover, both the placebo and treatment incidence rates are adjusted (theplacebo rates decrease and the treatment rates increase), and the power to detect a difference iscalculated based on these adjusted incidence rates.
Table 4.4 shows the reductions in power resulting from crossovers (children assigned to
hydroxyurea who discontinue taking the treatment or children assigned to placebo who takehydroxyurea) according to four levels of treatment and placebo crossover rates (0.05, 0.10, 0.15,0.20), two levels of placebo (0.80 and 0.60) and tr eatment initial incidence rates, two levels of
sample size and alpha=0.04.  The adjusted rates are the initial incidence of worsening ratesadjusted for the specified crossover rate and are shown in the table in parentheses under thecrossover rates.  The sample sizes used assume either 20% or 30% of the initial study populationare classified as having absent spleen function, resulting in N=80 and N=70 (in each group),respectively.
The first two sub-tables in Table 4-4 show that for a placebo incidence rate of 80% for
worsening of spleen function (dichotomous outcome) and low crossover rates (i.e., 10% or less),the study has at least 97% power to detect a difference between the treatment and placebo.  Thislevel of crossover presents no threat to the integrity of BABY HUG.  The last two sub-tables showthat for an incidence rate of 60% for the placebo combined with low noncompliance rates, the studyhas at least 80% power to detect a difference.   Thirty percent crossover will be a threat to study
integrity.  The BABY HUG investigators will do everything possible to prevent treatment crossovers.

4.4.4 Data Analysis4.4.4.1 Introduction
Primary analyses for BABY HUG will focus on estimating treatment effects on the
designated primary endpoint: loss of spleen function.  Assessment of treatment differences will bebased on pooling data across all participating Clinical Centers using all patients entered.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-24 of 4-37  Secondary analyses will develop statistical models to determine associations and relationships
between dependent variables, risk factors and the treatment variable.  
Analysis of binary endpoints will be accomplished using contingency table analysis.
Significance of results will be assessed with the Chi-square test uncorrected for continuity orFisher’s exact test.  If necessary, contingency table analyses will be adjusted for confoundingvariables using logistic regression.  
For continuous variables, comparisons of groups will be accomplished using Student’s t test
or the Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on the distributional properties of the data.  Stratifieddesigns will be analyzed using regression methods with the strata represented as randomizedblocks for the analysis.
Analysis of continuous and categorical endpoints that are measured repeatedly over time,
such as serial neuropsychological tests, weight, height, etc. will use longitudinal data analysismodels (Laird and Ware, 1982; Schlucter, 1992; Liang and Zeger, 1986; Andersen and Gill, 1982).Estimation in these models can be in terms of point and interval estimates or trends (i.e., slopesof growth curves) over time. 
The comparison between two treatments of time  to event endpoints will be evaluated using
the log-rank statistic.
  We will use the LIFETEST procedure in SAS to perform the test.  The
cumulative distributions of this outcome will be estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier(Kaplan and Meier, 1958).  Multivariate adjustments to this comparison will also be made using the
PHREG procedure for SAS to accomplish Cox proportional hazards models analyses (Cox, 1972).
Non-proportionality of the hazards will be investi gated by plotting log[-log(S(t))], in which S(t)
is the survival function, for important strati fying variables such as age and gender.  Should the
above functions be non-parallel (and/or cross) for any of the specified variables (p < 0.01), theprimary analysis will be stratified by those variables.  Cox proportional hazards models will bestratified for variables that demonstrate non-proportional hazards (crossing or non-crossing).  Oncedetermined, we will include these variables as stratification variables in the Cox regression.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-25 of 4-37  Analyses for the regressors will be summarized across the strata.  Patients who are lost to follow-up
before the end of the follow-up interval will be censored at the time of their last visit. 4.4.4.2 Regression Analyses and Adjustment
We will adjust study results for potential confounding factors in secondary analyses.  The
most important of these analyses may test whether the distributions of the primary and secondaryendpoints differ by the age of enrollment of the infant.  For these evaluations, we will divide theinfant population into those who are less than 15 months of age at the time of enrollment and thosewho are 15 months of age or more at the time of enrollment. 
Tests of interaction will be performed to determine if treatment effects are different in these
two groups of infants.  We plan to use regression methods to evaluate the significance of thehypothesized interactions.  This will be done by multiplying an indicator variable for the birth cohort(1 = less than 15 months, 0 = 15 months or older) times treatment (1 = HU, 0 = PLBO) andevaluating the beta coefficient associated with this variable.  If significant (p < 0.01), we will reportthat treatment effects differed according to the age of enrollment.  Interaction tests such as theseare low in power to detect specified alternatives (half the efficiency of a main effects comparison).Additional analyses will be required to support the discovery of a proposed interaction, as a largenumber of interaction tests will be performed and some, by chance, will be found to be significant.
The addition of confounding variables generally improves the operating characteristics of
analyses of the main effect, but given the small sample size, the number of confounding variableswill be small in any secondary analysis.  Given the small sample size proposed for this analysis,it may be necessary to limit the number of confounders in any one analysis to five or ten.  We willuse step-wise regression methods to isolate and include the most important confounding variablesin the regression model.
We will use SAS procedures to perform adjusted analyses, PROC GLM to perform
randomized block analysis of variance, PHGLM to perform stratified and standard Cox proportionalhazards analyses, PROC GENMOD and MIXED to  perform longitudinal data analyses, and PROC
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-26 of 4-37  LOGISTIC to perform unconditional logistic regr ession.  The standard output  from these procedures
provide point estimates for the regression coefficients, standard error estimates and confidenceintervals.  The results of these analyses are printed into computer files so that they can be directlyinserted in progress reports using PROC REPORT.  In some instances, the procedures in SAS willnot suffice since SAS procedures usually do not include methods to incorporate information aboutmissing data, nor do they include complex models specifically designed to relate a biologicalprocess with the risk of disease progression.  We will use PROC IML and PROC NLIN to programthe required models if necessary.  4.4.4.3   Missing Data - Prevention and Analysis
BABY HUG will use the me thods of Probstfield (Shumaker et al, 1990; Probstfield et al,
1986) for improving adherence with follow-up.  A key feature of this approach is the managementof parents who show signs of dropping out of the study. Senior level clinical staff will contact thesefamilies in an effort to improve compliance with the next visit.  This action conveys a sense of how
important the child is to the study and can increase the parent’s compliance with future follow-upvisits.  For those patients who are already missing visits, the Principal Investigator of a Clinical Center can contact the parents to assure that they continue with the follow-up visits.  As part of theconversation, the Principal Investigator can negotiate with the parents (or guardians) on the partsof the study they are willing to complete.  By pr ioritizing the components of the Protocol, a mutually
acceptable follow-up procedure can be established for the patient.  
We will generally use the methods of Rubin (Little and Rubin, 1987) to impute missing data
from patients’ records with complete data to complete the records for patients with missing data.This method has been accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a legitimatemethod for correcting for missing data.  We will also use analyses involving rank statistics in whichpatients who die or have bad clinical events are given the worst rank for other dependent variables.We have successfully used this technique in the analysis of the MSH (McMahon et al, 1992;McMahon et al, 1997).  For categorical data, or time to event data, the composite endpoint of death
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-27 of 4-37  or the event (such as occurrence of acute chest syndrome) can be used.  
4.4.5 Interim Monitoring
During the course of this study, the BABY HUG Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
will carry out interim data analyses to monito r the study for evidence of beneficial and adverse
treatment effects. The DSMB will review repor ts on study performance including recruitment,
protocol violations, complications of treatment, patients lost to follow-up, submission of forms,quality of laboratory and forms data submitted, monthly during the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Studyand semiannually (months 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 42 and 48) from the start of Feasibility and Safety PilotStudy enrollment.  The study will also be monitored fo r efficacy with respect to the two co-primary
endpoints and for adverse events.
Below we present the proposed interim monitoring plan for efficacy for the BABY HUG
study.  This plan will call for five primary endpoint analyses (four interim analyses and one finalanalysis) during the course of the study.  The fi rst interim analysis will be conducted with data
collected on children enrolled in the Feasibility and Sa fety Pilot Study.  Ex treme evidence (nominal
alpha = 0.0005, Z = 3.5) of treatment differences will be required in the interim analyses todemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed interventi on for either endpoint.  The use of these extreme
Z values will allow for final nominal alpha levels for each co-primary endpoint to be just under thespecified alpha level for the study (nominal alpha = 0.0394, Z = 2.06 for spleen function.  Table 4-7shows the nominal alpha levels expected to be used during the course of the study.

proposed number and/or dates of the interim analysis; the method of Lan and DeMets (Reboussinet al, 1992; Lan and DeMets, 1983) will be used to determine the actual “spending” of the alphaover the course of the study.

4.4.6 Safety Related Outcomes  
Adverse event (AE) forms will be submitted to the MCC and tabulated based on the
affected organ system according to standardized monitoring procedures (e.g., the National CancerInstitute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Ad verse Event Expedited Reporting System).  Table
4-8 defines adverse events and specifies classification and reporting considerations. 
The timing of the AE report will depend upon the nature of the AE.  If the AE is serious, Clinical
Center staff will be instructed to report the AE to the MCC within 24 hours of the event.  MCC staffwill immediately review the material and forward it to the central review group. If the central reviewgroup finds that an event is serious, MCC staff will attach the treatment assignment to the report,and send the information to the DSMB Chair, Executive Secretary of DSMB and the NHLBI andNICHD Project Officers for review.  This AE will be tabulated with the other AEs that have beenreported for the study and a systematic review will be made to determine if one treatment has more
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-31 of 4-37  reports of serious AEs than the other treatmen t.  The occurrence of serious AEs will be reported
to the FDA promptly after the Executive Secretar y of the DSMB and the Project Officer review.  The
Clinical Center will report the occurrence of serious AEs that occur at their institution according tothe requirements of their local IRB.  
Other AEs will be collected and tabulated by treatment group on a monthly basis.  A critical
value corresponding to p = 0.05 will be used for each AE evaluation (except for the eventsdiscussed earlier).  The approach here will be to err on the side of detecting a trend early ratherthan protecting alpha.  Depending upon the evidence accumulated and severity of the events, it willbe the responsibility of the DSMB Chair, Executive Secretary of DSMB and the Project Officer todecide whether a full meeting of the DSMB is necessary to discuss the results and makerecommendations, whether a conference call is necessary, or whether the report warrants nofurther action. 
The MCC staff plan to send a written notification to the DSMB Chair, Executive Secretary
of DSMB and the Project Officer for each severe complication and if any severe complication isfound six times in one treatment group without a single occurrence in the other treatment group.If six complications have been observed, all in one of the treatment groups, the alpha level ofrejecting the null hypothesis of no treatment effe ct on the appearance of the adverse event is less
than 0.05 and suggests that the risk of this complication in one group is not equal to the risk ofcomplication in the other group.  The alpha level of rejecting the null hypothesis of no treatmenteffect is obtained by using a binomial approximation for the log-rank statistic.
If complications occur in both treatment groups, a 95% confidence interval for the difference
between proportions for the assigned study treatments will be used to compare the occurrence ofsymptoms which are potential adverse effects of treatment, such as a neurological deficit.  If theconfidence interval for the difference in these proportions does not cover zero, the Project Officerwill be notified promptly.  The Executive Secretary of DSMB and the Project Officer in consultation
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-32 of 4-37  with the DSMB Chair will t hen recommend whether there should be an emergency meeting (or
conference call of the DSMB) to determine the appropriate actions for this trial.  4.4.7 Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxyurea (HU)
NOTICE: Exit PK Studies are not being collected as of May 29, 2009.Full pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of hydroxyurea will be performed on all children (both HU
and placebo) at entry and exit, at the times that the DTPA measurements for GFR are made.  Theresults of PK analyses from the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study suggest that the time frame forsample selection should be changed from 0,1,2,4,and 8 hours to 30,90, and 210 minutes.  Theseinformative times of blood collection for the PK studies will coincide exactly with blood collectiontimes for the DTPA measurement without any further requirements for additional blood byadministering the daily dose of study treatment 30 minutes after the DTPA procedure is started.Figure 4-2 shows an overlay of the collection schedule for these two PK and DTPA studies.  
Standard blood collections for the DTPA study were collected at 1,2, and 4 hours after the
DTPA procedure was initiated.  By lagging the administration of the study treatment, the bloodcollections will yield PK data points at 30, 90, and 210 minutes.  Based on data from the Feasibilityand Safety Pilot Study, trivial residual HU concentra tions are predicted to persist from a previous
dose, thus collecting a pre-dose concentration adds little information, and these three post-doseblood collections will allow estimation of the PK curve for each infant.  In addition, the collectiontimes will allow the measurements to bracket the expected peak concentration for an infant asshown in the PK concentrations curve for the first 22 infants studied in the BABY HUG Feasibilityand Safety Pilot Study (Figure 4-3).  The collection of entry and exit PK specimens in this fashion
imparts minimal risk and discomfort to the child.  
A third PK study will be done approximately one month (at the week 004 visit) after each child
begins taking study treatment.  Blood specimens will be collected at only two time points for thisthird study as it does not coincide with a DTPA procedure.  The time points for collection will be 30and 90 minutes after the daily dose of study treatm ent is administered.  The collection of specimens
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-33 of 4-37  at these two time points after one month of st udy treatment administration will allow the study
investigators to confirm that first dose HU pharmacokinetics predict HU exposure with chronicadministration.  The collection of these two additional data points represents a minimal riskassessment since only one extra venipuncture is required.
All of the data from the HU assays will be analyzed using population pharmacokinetic models.
A one-compartment open model with first order elim ination will be utilized.  First order absorption,
with and without lag times, will be evaluated as well as other input functions justified by the data.The data will be modeled recognizing the two stages of a non-linear hierarchical model.  The firststage introduces the structural model (e.g., the one compartment open model), the population
parameters, individual effects, and within-patient variation.  The second stage of the modelrecognizes that variation between patients in pharmacokinetic parameters exists, and will attemptto determine covariates that may identify different pharmacokinetic subpopulations.  The collectionof these data will support the New Drug Application to the FDA for package insert specificationsabout the metabolism of the liquid formulation of hydroxyurea for use in infants with sickle cell
disease.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-4.wpd — 8/09 Page 4-34 of 4-37  8. Any AE related to study treatment and unexpected.  
Serious Adverse Events that are sickle cell related have been added to the list, as defined by
the FDA. Item #3 has been modified from the FDA definition given that frequent hospitalizationsoccur as a consequence of having sickle cell anemia without being enrolled in a clinical trial. 
In addition, a centralized over-ride system (the central review group) will be carried out by
individuals with knowledge about the treatment assignments. These individuals will review adverseevents that are not thought to be serious in the eyes of the blinded investigators and make adecision about whether an adverse event is “serious” and reportable to the FDA. The two centralreview individuals will be the NHLBI Project Officer and MCC Medical Consultant. Either of theseindividuals will have the ability to elevate an adv erse event being reported to the MCC to the
“serious” category. 
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be listed individually and according to body
system, will be designated according to severity (mild , moderate, severe, life-threatening, or fatal),
will be designated according to likelihood of relation to study treatment (not related, possibly,probably or definitely related), will be classified according to action taken (none, treatment stoppedor interrupted, specific treatment instituted) and according to outcome (recovery without change inprevious condition, some impairment, significant impairment, or death).

CHAPTER 5
RANDOMIZATION AND ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS
5.1 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT
Potential patients are identified by the Clinical Center Principal Investigators and
coordinators.  Patients’ parents or guardians will complete orientation and provide informed
consent, and patients will complete the pre-enrollment assessment period and procedures.  All pre-enrollment forms must be received at the Medical Coordinating Center (MCC) where eligibility will
be assessed based on data submitted.  
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria in a Clinical Center enrolling BABY HUG patients will
be able to enroll in the study.  Patients who are not eligible may be re-evaluated as long as theenrollment period is still open and baseline evaluations can be completed before the close of theenrollment period.  Exclusion criteria, which could change and allow re-evaluation for eligibility,include: age less than 9 months for the main study (12 months for the Feasibility and Safety PilotStudy); transfusion within two months of enrollment unless HbA < 10%; abnormal liver function orrenal function tests; Bayley Mental Scale standardized score <70; low hemoglobin, reticulocyte orneutrophil count.
5.2 RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT ALLOCATION
MCC staff will prepare a unique randomization schedule for each BABY HUG Clinical
Center.  Each randomization schedule will be known only to a small group of people at the MCC.Individual treatment assignments will be availabl e to selected MCC staff only on a "need-to-know"
basis.  Clinical Center investigators forced by urgent circumstances to unblind an individual patient's
treatment will be required to follow procedures and provide documentation as set out in Section6.6.1.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-5 —  8/09 Page 5-2 of 5-2MCC staff will use an automated telephone res ponse system (ATRS) to randomly assign
treatments to patients enrolling at a Clinical Center in sequence according to the randomizationschedule for that Clinical Center.  Each treatment  assignment will specify a kit number for a kit that
contains either hydroxyurea or placebo.  Treatment group allocations will be stratified according toClinical Center to ensure balance of numbers to each treatment arm within each Clinical Center.A standard procedure for stratified, blocked randomization will be used.  
5.2.1 Treatment Allocation
The MCC will identify eligible patients on a daily basis throughout the enrollment period.
The MCC will provide a continual report of pending requirements for patients still in eligibility
assessment.   After the child’s parents or guardians have provided written informed consent, thechild’s baseline evaluations are completed and the child has been declared eligible, the ClinicalCenter staff may use the MCC automated telephone response system (ATRS) to enroll a child andto obtain a study treatment kit assignment.  The MCC will send the Pharmacy Distribution Center
directions to maintain the supply of study treatments for this patient at the Clinical Center pharmacy.For each eligible patient the ATRS will issue to the Clinical Center a confirmation of enrollment intothe study, including the BABY HUG Patient Identification Number and Alphabetic Code.  ClinicalCenter staff will return to the MCC the form confirming the date the patient starts study treatment.

CHAPTER 6
STUDY TREATMENTS  
6.1 OVERVIEW
For children enrolled in BABY HUG and assigned to study treatment, treatment will begin
at a fixed dose of 20 mg/kg/day, and remain at this dose unless repeated or prolonged toxicity isencountered, in which case the dose will be reduced to a lower stable dose.  The goal for doseadjustment is given in Table 6-1.  Patients will be maintained at 20 mg/kg/day or the lower stabledose for the duration of the 2-year period on blinded study treatment.  
The NHLBI has submitted an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use of hydroxyurea in BABY HUG (IND #67,289).  Administrationand monitoring of treatment in BABY HUG will follow all accountability and reporting requirementsof the FDA.  
Hydroxyurea will be formulated as a liquid pr eparation (100 mg/ml).  Parents will be advised
to administer treatment at approximately the same time each day (e.g.  each morning or eachevening before bedtime) to assist with compliance.  All study medications (hydroxyurea andplacebo) will be distributed by the Pharmacy Distribut ion Center in bottles of powder to the Clinical
Centers.  Each child’s treatment supply will be fo rmulated by the appropriate Clinical Center before
the patient’s scheduled visit.
Before each scheduled clinic visit, the Medical Coordinating Center will recommend a dose
for the upcoming 2- or 4-week therapy period, and transmit this information electronically to the
Clinical Center Principal Investigator and coordinator.  On the day of the clinic visit (Day 1), the childwill be weighed, examined, and monitored for toxicity.  At each 2- or 4-week visit, the used bottlewill be collected, and the family will be given a new  bottle with an appropriately marked oral syringe.
The instructions will be to continue therapy using the new bottle, unless they receive a phone call
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-2 of 6-12  to stop administering treatment.  If a treatment had been stopped in the previous 2- or 4-week
period, a new bottle of study medication will be dispensed.  The family will be instructed to startadministering the study medication with the possibility that a phone call for a stop order may beissued within three days.  
Blood specimens for routine study visits will be sent to the local Clinical Center laboratory
for CBC determinations.  Within one day of collecting the blood or by 9:00 a.m.  of the followingmorning, the Primary Endpoint person will review local laboratory results for alert and toxicity valuesand data-enter the CBC values into the Internet Data Entry System.  The MCC will also analyze thelocal CBC results.  If the specimen is unusable (e.g. clotted), Clinical Center staff will be given anopportunity to collect a second hematology blood specimen.  However, the second hematologyspecimen must be collected within 48 hours of the first specimen. By Day 3, the MedicalCoordinating Center will send out a recommendati on for stopping or continuing study medication
for the next 2- or 4-week period based on review  of all blood counts received, study medication
prescription history, toxicities and adverse reactions.  The Clinical Center physician verifies that therecommendations and prescriptions are consistent on Day 3.  When indicated, Clinical Center staffwill notify families to “STOP” using the study treatm ent (if it is currently being administered).  Failure
to contact families to “STOP” using study treatment  can jeopardize patient safety (see section 12.9).
If appropriate efforts are made to contact a family  with a “STOP” order, but the family is not
contacted, the Clinical Center Principal Investigator will provide the Operations Committee with awritten explanation of the reason contact could not be established and a plan to avoid inability tocontact this patient in the future.  If a family cannot be contacted for two “STOP” orders, thepatient’s treatment will be interrupted until the Operations Committee assesses that it can be safelyrestarted (see Section 6.6.2).  
Every six months at designated visits whic h must occur on a Monday - Thursday, blood will
also be sent to the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory by overnight courier, and arrivethere early on Day 2.  Within six hours of receipt of the blood, the Hematology and Biochemistry
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-3 of 6-12  Core Laboratory will transmit hematology and biochem istry results to the Medical Coordinating
Center.  No toxicities will be determined from the Core Laboratory results.  However, the MCC willanalyze the results for alerts and notify the Clinical Center PEP of any alerts.  6.2 DOSE TITRATION6.2.1 Hydroxyurea 
The plan for dose reduction and toxicity monitoring in BABY HUG (Table 6-1) is based on
data obtained from HUSOFT (Wang et al, 2001).  The starting dose of hydroxyurea will be 20 mg/kg(once a day, orally).  If toxicity occurs (e.g., neutropenia), treatment will be stopped and blood
counts will be checked every two weeks until they retu rn to non-toxic values.  Transient toxicity will
not cause a dose reduction, but prolonged or repeated toxicity will.  Following a toxic blood count,treatment will be discontinued for 14 days.  If count s recover, treatment will be resumed at the
previous dose.  If the toxicity persists, treat ment will continue to be held for an additional 14 days
and treatment will resume at a daily dose 2.5 mg/kg lower than the previous dose once the toxicityis resolved.  If that dose does not cause toxicity for eight weeks, an attempt will be made toincrease the daily dose by 2.5 mg/kg; if toxicity occurs, the lower dose will be assigned as thestable dose.  If transient toxicity occurs more than twice at the same dose within a 12-week period,treatment will resume at a dose 2.5 mg/kg lower than the previous dose and continue for theduration of study.  If blood counts reach the toxic range while on an established stable dose,treatment will be stopped until toxicity resolves and then treatment will resume with the previously
established stable dose; repeated toxicity in a 12- week period will reduce the stable dose by 2.5
mg/kg for the remainder of the study.  An outline of the dose titration algorithm is presented in Table6-1.   6.2.2 Placebo 
Patients assigned to placebo will be given identically-appearing bottles containing placebo
powder and the same flavoring as the HU-containing bottles.  The placebo-containing bottles willbe labeled identically to the HU-containing bottles .  The Medical Coordinating Center will devise
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-4 of 6-12  schedules of treatment stops and dose reductions and escalations for placebo patients based on
the experience of bone marrow suppression, recovery, dose reduction and dose escalations seenin the open-label HUSOFT patients.  Enough individual plans will be devised so that each of thechildren assigned to placebo in each Clinical Center will follow a different course of stops and dosechanges that would just as readily occur in a child assigned to hydroxyurea.  The goal of the plansis that the distribution of the final dose achieved among the placebo assigned patients will be similarto the final dose distribution among those assigned to hydroxyurea, and that the same proportionof children have treatment stops.  This type of plan was implemented in the Multicenter Study ofHydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) (Handy et al, 1996).  6.3 TREATMENT PREPARATION
An independent manufacturing facility will prepare and send bottles containing powdered
hydroxyurea or placebo to the Pharmacy Distribution Center, which will forward these bottles,grouped as individual treatment kits, to each Clinic al Center (Investigational) Pharmacy.  Bottles
for each patient will be reconstituted with water and simple syrup by each Clinical Center(Investigational) Pharmacy to formulate the medications into liquid preparations.  Hydroxyureapowder and flavoring will be dissolved in water and si mple syrup to achieve a final volume of 120
ml with a final concentration of 100 mg/ml.  Placebo will be dissolved in an identically appearing andflavored solution.  Each Clinical Center (Investi gational) Pharmacy will bottle the liquid formulation
in a child-proof container, label it with the subject's study acrostic/number, study ID number andinstructions (including the "Investigational New Drug" warning, "BABY HUG Hydroxyurea Study for
Sickle Cell Anemia", a prescription number, and the "emergency call" telephone number of thePrincipal Investigator).  Inventory records fo r hydroxyurea and placebo will be kept by Pharmacy
Distribution Center staff, and the Medical Coordinat ing Center will keep inventories of kit numbers
used.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-5 of 6-12  Several days before a patient’s four-week visit, the Medical Coordinating Center staff will
generate a prescription recommendation for the patient to be reviewed by a physician  or physicianconsultant at the MCC with a synopsis of rec ent blood counts.  The MCC physician will check all
prescription recommendations, and the MCC will notify each Clinical Center of the officialprescription.  The Clinical Center (Investigational ) Pharmacy will generate a label that includes the
patient’s dose for the next month with instructions on how to take the liquid.  All verifiedprescriptions will be prepared by the Clinical Cent er (Investigational) Pharmacy, the bottles will be
labeled appropriately, and the study treatment given to  the family on the day of the patient’s clinic
visit.  The Clinical Center (Investigational) Pharmacy will prepare a 35-day supply of the liquidformulation, and dispense it to each patient with the appropriate dose marked on the label and onsyringes.  6.4 DEFINITIONS OF TOXICITY
The most common toxicity observed in prelim inary studies has been tr ansient and reversible
bone marrow depression.  Hydroxyurea has only rarely been reported to be the cause of fever, skinrash, nausea, vomiting or hair loss.  Such mani festations will be investigated locally and will be
reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adverse reactions if other etiologies are notapparent.
Toxic bone marrow depression is defined as an absolute neutrophil count < 1250/cu mm,
absolute reticulocyte count < 80,000/cu mm (if the hemoglobin concentration is below 7 gm/dL),platelet count < 80,000/cu mm, a hemoglobin concentration < 6.0 gm/dL, or >20% fall inhemoglobin concentration from the 3-month rolling average.  
The following occurrences will also be defined as toxicity:  unexplained gastrointestinal
disturbance, or unexplained rash or hair loss.  
Toxicity levels are used for adjustment of study  treatment dose and are distinct from alert
levels which are used for clinical management of the child (see section 7.2.4 and Table 7-3).  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-6 of 6-12  6.5 MONITORING FOR TOXICITY
Patients will be seen at the Clinical Center s and will have blood sampled every two weeks
until a stable dose is reached, then every four weeks thereafter.  A few infants will be seen inperipheral clinics that are visited by the clinic director every four weeks.  Blood specimens forroutine study visits can be collected any day of the week provided blood is not also scheduled for
collection and shipment to the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory, which must occuron a Monday - Thursday.  If a patient misses the clinic visit, and the visit can be rescheduled withinthe extended visit window, the Clinical Center staff should complete the clinic visit (and bloodcollection) within the extended window.  If a patient misses a visit that cannot be rescheduled duringthe extended window, the family will be advised to  complete the available study medication
(interrupting daily doses when the treatment runs out) and return in two weeks.
One pediatric tube of blood (0.5 ml) in EDTA will be obtained for a blood count including
hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, platelet count, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC)and absolute neutrophil count (ANC).  The local laboratory will perform  automated (manual if
automated is invalidated) CBC counts and the Primary Endpoint Person (PEP) will data enter theminto the BABY HUG database via the Internet Data Entry System within one day of collecting theblood or by 9:00 a.m.  the following day. An additional EDTA purple-top tube (0.5 ml) forhematology and a red-top tube (1.0 ml) for serum chemistries will be collected every six months(see Table 7.1) and sent to the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory.  The Hematologyand Biochemistry Core Laboratory will perform blood counts and chemistries, and transmit resultsto the Medical Coordinating Center within six hours of receipt of the sample.  No toxicities will bedetermined from the Core Laboratory results.  
The PEP will review the local results to determine if a toxicity is present in the data.  If there
is a toxicity, the PEP will notify the Clinical Center staff of the need for a stop order.  If there is nota toxicity, the PEP will open a previously delivered notice from the MCC that will instruct whether
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-7 of 6-12  the PEP is to report a sham toxicity for the visit.  Once reported, all other aspects of the reporting
mechanism will be done in the same manner as if the toxicity is real (e.g., a meeting with ancillarystaff, etc.  to perpetuate the notion that the report is in fact a real toxicity).  
In addition to the PEP review of the local laboratory results, the Medical Coordinating Center
will scan the in-coming local laboratory reports for "toxic" results.  If the specimen is unusable (e.g.clotted) the Clinical Center staff will be given an opportunity to collect a second blood specimen.
However, the second specimen must be collected within 48 hours of the first specimen.  If there areno local laboratory results, the Medical Coordinating Center will notify the Clinical Center of theneed for a stop order.  After MCC staff issue/confirm a stop order, they will notify the Clinical Centercoordinator, who will call the family and give the or der to stop treatment if it has not already been
done.  The clinic coordinator and thus the family will be told to "stop treatment", without use of theword "toxicity."  The coordinator will inquire concerning the child’s health (e.g., regarding fever,lassitude, weakness).  Parents (guardians) of any child whose condition is worrisome will be askedto bring in the child for an examination to rule out complications with potentially severeconsequences such as parvovirus B-19 infection or splenic sequestration (see Section 8.4).  Patientfamilies will be notified of stop orders within 48 hours of the clinic visit.  The child must then returnfor two week visits until the toxicity is resolved.  
Medical Coordinating Center staff will provi de the Clinical Centers with stop orders for
placebo patients, in a similar manner as patients with toxicity due to HU.  If the MCC physician(s)and other Medical Coordinating Center staff dis agree on the toxicity evaluation, any stop orders,
and/or the dose recommendation for the next therapy period, the laboratory results and treatmentrecommendation will be referred to the Study Chairman for immediate action.  6.6 BLINDING
In the Clinical Centers, the patients, their fa milies, Clinical Center Principal Investigators,
coordinators, and other study staff will be blinded to treatment assignments.  The central event or
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-8 of 6-12  image reviewers will not be able to link study treat ment assignments to individual event reports or
other outcome data.  Pharmacy Distribution Center  staff and Medical Coordinating Center staff will
have access to individual subject treatment assignment and current dose on a "need-to-know"basis.  The Medical Coordinating Center will mainta in records of each child’s treatment assignment
and current dose.  
Plans have been made to prevent toxicity monito ring from resulting in unblinding of patients’
assigned study treatments.  Despite these precautions, if the Clinical Center Principal Investigatorthinks he/she inadvertently has become unblinded, contact with the child and his/her family andclinical site staff must be carefully managed to avoid any comments regarding unblinding.  The
person who has the most patient contact, usually the coordinator, must be absolutely excluded fromany contact with laboratory data.  The Primary Endpoint Person (PEP), who monitors the local CBCevaluations for toxicity, will have access to in formative data about treatment assignment and must
not share that information with the Principal Investigator or coordinator.  In addition, the child’s 3-month rolling average hemoglobin concentration will be provided by the MCC to the Clinical Center
PEP every month for use with standard medical practice guidelines (see Chapter 8) as neededlocally.
The Clinical Center Principal Investigators have agreed to avoid seeking information that
may unblind them with regard to individual treatment assignments, especially laboratory results.Clinic coordinators will conduct follow-up visits and process and maintain files of study documents.Study documents that contain potentially unblinding information or baseline characteristics onindividual patients (e.g., local lab reports, liver/spleen scan results, GFR results) will be maintainedby the PEP.  Although not preferred, Clinical Center Principal Investigators may be the primary careproviders for BABY HUG children, and will be aware of the need to maintain blinding under normalcircumstances and maintain the child on study drug even during hospitalization.  Discussion among
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-9 of 6-12  Clinical Center staff or with families regardi ng a child’s treatment assignment is inappropriate.
Clinical Center coordinators must avoid any information that may unblind them.  6.6.1  Emergency Unblinding
Every family will be given an identification card describing the child’s participation in the
BABY HUG study, listing emergency study telephone num bers (e.g., the Clinical Center Principal
Investigator’s telephone number and the Central Study Emergency Contact’s telephone number).The Central Study Emergency Contact’s telephone will be answered by a pediatric sickle cellanemia consultant to the Medical Coordinating Center at all times.  If BABY HUG children becomeill, treating physicians will be urged to call the Clinical Center Principal Investigator before alteringthe child's study regimen.  
In an emergency, family members will be inst ructed to call a telephone number that will be
manned by a pediatric sickle cell anemia consultant  to the Medical Coordinating Center 24 hours
a day.  Arrangements will be made so that the child ’s medication can be disclosed to the Clinical
Center Principal Investigator after consultation between the Clinical Center Principal Investigatorand the pediatric sickle cell anemia consultant to the Medical Coordinating Center.  Reasons forunblinding are limited and are based on clinical grounds.  Unblinding must be initiated by theClinical Center Principal Investigator.  Reasons for unblinding include overdose of the studymedication, accidental ingestion of the study  medication by another person, development of
infection or bleeding that could be due to reduced white blood cell or platelet counts and for whichmanagement might be changed if the nature of the study  drug were known.  Examples of clinical
situations when information on study treatment could be useful include severe thrombocytopeniacalling for a decision to use prednisone versus platelet transfusion or severe neutropenia callingfor a decision on choice of antibiotics.  If a child's therapy is unblinded, the Clinical Center PrincipalInvestigator or staff member who unblinded the treatment must send a report to the MedicalCoordinating Center.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-10 of 6-12  Each Clinical Center will assign another non-BABY HUG hematologist and nurse practitioner
to be available for acute care visits.  The study coordinator will have the most contact with patientsand families and will be excluded from contact with  laboratory data collected during acute events.
The Primary Endpoint Person will, however, have access to a patient’s 3-month rolling average
hemoglobin value every month, which will be provi ded by the MCC for use in evaluation of anemia.
Unblinding will occur only after consultations between the Clinical Center PI and an external,Consultant Pediatric Study Hematologist.  U nblinding events will be discussed by the Operations
Committee and often will result in discontinuing study treatments.  However, all patients, includingthose whose treatments have been unblinded, will continue to be followed in BABY HUG for safetyoutcomes and clinical outcomes not already declared at the time of unblinding.  Since analysis willbe conducted accord ing to the principle of Intention to Treat and unblinding is expected to occur
infrequently, the impact of unblinding is anticipated to be less than that of possible crossovers (seeSections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4).  6.6.2 Treatment Interruptions
There may be instances related to medical conditions (e.g., acute, intercurrent illnesses
such as an infection) or other reasons (e.g., study medication is lost by the family or “STOP” orders
cannot be delivered) when it may be advisable to interrupt study therapy without unblinding.Interruptions for medical conditions should be allowed only with consultation of the Clinical CenterPrincipal Investigator.  The Clinical Center Principal Investigator is responsible for notifying theMedical Coordinating Center of treatment interr uptions.  These notifications are important because
they may in turn have an influence on dose titration.  6.7 ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
Study treatment will be measured at each regular follow-up visit.  If the volume of study
treatment remaining in the bottle is not consistent with the prescribed dosing plan, staff will inquireabout any difficulties that may have occurred.  The importance of compliance will be emphasized
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-6 —  8/09 Page 6-11 of 6-12  for all patients.  Even if patients are repeatedly considered to be non-compliant, they will continue
to be followed and will continue to receive t heir study reimbursements (i.e., travel/telephone
allowances).  6.8   MISSED VISITS AND DROP-OUTS 
Each regularly scheduled clinic visit missed by a patient will be reported to the Medical
Coordinating Center.  Families who do not wish to continue attending clinic visits in the BABY HUGstudy will continue to be telephoned by the Clinical Center coordinator to ascertain the medical
condition, any identifiable events and vital status.  Attempts will be made to obtain semi-annual andannual evaluations for all study participants.6.9 DURATION OF STUDY TREATMENT
The goal of the study treatment plans will be to maintain patients on the assigned study
treatment until the end of the 24-month period and on the maximum non-toxic dose (up to 20mg/kg/day) of study treatment for at least 18 months of the two-year trial period.

PEDIATRIC HYDROXYUREA PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL (BABY HUG)
DOSE TITRATION ALGORITHM
Goal: To treat at 20 mg/kg/day or a lower, stable dose, defined as the highest dose maintained
for eight weeks without observed blood count toxicity; and to maintain the patient at stabledose thereafter.
Titration Phase (visits every 2 weeks)
:
 1.  Begin hydroxyurea at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. 2.  Continue treatment and monitor for toxicity.   3.  If toxicity develops:
a. A stop order is issued, and the patient will have repeat blood counts performed every 14
days until toxicity resolves.  
b. If the toxicity resolves at 14 days, then the study drug will resume at the pre-toxic dose.  If
the toxicity requires more than 14 days to reso lve, then the daily dose will be lowered by 2.5
mg/kg.  A patient must take a prescribed dose before a lower subsequent dose will beprescribed (i.e., toxicities that require more than 14 days to resolve will have the dosereduced 2.5 mg/kg from the last dose that was actually administered to the patient).  
c. As long as the patient does not become toxic over the subsequent eight-week period on the
lower dose, the daily dose will be increased by 2.5 mg/kg not to exceed 20 mg/kg/day.  
d. If a patient becomes toxic at any given dose twice in a 12-week period, no further increases
will be made.  The highest dose that does not produce toxicity for an eight-week period isdesignated the stable dose.
 4. No patient will receive more than 20 mg/kg/day.Stable Dose Phase (visits every 4 weeks):
 1. If the patient becomes toxic after the stable dose is established, a stop order is issued and the
study drug is stopped.  When the toxicity resolv es, the study drug will be resumed at the pre-
toxic stable dose.  If toxicity recurs within a 12-week period, the stable dose will be lowered by2.5 mg/kg.

CHAPTER 7
LABORATORIES AND SPECIMENS  
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Eight Core Laboratories (a Hematology and Biochemistry Core, an Immunology Core, a
Mutation Analysis/DNA Core, a Pitted Cell Core, a TCD Core, a Biomarkers Core, an HU AssayCore and a Cytogenetics Core) and an NHLBI Specimen Repository will be utilized for processingof BABY HUG study specimens, collected at the time s specified in Table 7-1.  In addition, the
Clinical Center local hematology laboratories will process specimens collected at every study visit.
7.2 HEMATOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY CORE LABORATORY
The Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory will provide standardized hematology
and routine blood chemistry results which will be used to monitor for alerts and for analysis ofeffects of HU on these parameters.  
The Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory will assay specimens according to the
schedule in Table 7-1.  If the specimen is deemed untestable, insufficient quantity, or missing, theClinical Center should continue to re-draw for up to two more subsequent study visits.  Bloodsamples will be collected and sent to the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory fromMonday to Thursday by overnight ex press carrier so that they arrive within 24 hours.  Blood counts
and chemistry assays will be performed, reports generated, and results transmitted to the MCCwithin 6 hours of receipt.
7.3 LOCAL (CLINICAL CENTER) HEMATOLOGY LABORATORIES
7.3.1 Monitoring for Toxicity
The major toxicity of HU is bone marrow depression which will be detected by complete
blood count (CBC with white blood cell differential).  HU has rarely been reported to be the causeof clinical manifestations such as fever, rash, nausea, vomiting or hair loss.  Since HU is excreted
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-7 —  8/09 Page 7-2 of 7-9  in the urine, renal function will be monitored closely based on BUN and creatinine results. Clinical
manifestations and toxicity will be investigated locally and will be reported to the FDA as adverse
reactions if other etiologies are not apparent.  Toxic bone marrow depression and other organtoxicities in BABY HUG are defined in Section 6.4. 
The MCC staff will screen incoming local CBC reports for “toxic” results.  If toxic values are
noted on the local CBC reports, the MCC will issue a stop order to the Clinical Center.  Clinical
Center will notify the patient’s parent(s) and tell them to stop treatment without the use of the word“toxicity”.  The MCC will notify the Clinical Center  of placebo patients whose treatments are to stop
in the same manner as HU patients.  Stop orders will be used for all placebo patients whoselaboratory results are “spontaneously” (i.e., without hydroxyurea treatment) at levels that would beconsidered “toxic” with hydroxyurea therapy.  The parent(s) will be notified of the stop order within48 hours of a clinic visit.  The remaining study drug must be returned at the next clinic visit.  Dosesfor placebo patients and HU patients will be adjusted in  similar manners.  The MCC staff will receive
and edit incoming local CBC reports, and compare them to previous reports for the patient.  MCCstaff will check for discrepancies between the central computer reviews and the stop orders. 
7.3.2 Blinding
In the Clinical Centers, the patients’ families,  Principal Investigator s, coordinators, and other
study staff will be blinded to treatment assignments.   On the Central Event Adjudication Panels and
in the Core Laboratories, staff will not be able to  link study treatment assignments to specimens,
event reports or other outcome evaluations.  The staff of the MCC will have access to individualpatient treatment assignment codes and current dose on a “need to know” basis. The MCC willmaintain records of each patient’s drug assignment and current dose.
The Clinical Center Principal Investigators will assert their intention to avoid seeking
information that may unblind them with regard to individual patient’s treatment assignments,especially laboratory parameters.  The Primary E ndpoint Person (PEP) will monitor the local CBC
evaluations for toxicity and thus have access to  potentially unblinding information. The Clinical
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-7 —  8/09 Page 7-3 of 7-9  Center coordinator will conduct follow-up patient visits and will be the primary contact person for
the patient and families. She/he will maintain files of study documents and must be rigidly excludedfrom any contact with laboratory data, including data which may be collected on hospitalizationsor outpatient visits.  For these purposes it is preferred (but not required) that physicians and nursepractitioners outside BABY HUG manage the primary care and laboratory data during these events.The Clinical Center Principal Investigators and coordinators will be responsible for maintaining theirblinded status and maintaining the patient on study drug during hospitalizations, if appropriate.
7.3.3 Emergency Unblinding
Each patient’s family will be given an identificat ion card describing the patient’s participation
in BABY HUG, listing emergency study telephone num bers (the Study Chairman, and the Clinical
Center Principal Investigator’s telephone numbers).  If a BABY HUG patient becomes ill, parentswill be instructed to show this identification card to the child’s treating physician.  The card willrecommend to treating physicians that they contact t he Clinical Center Principal Investigator before
altering the patient’s study regimen.  The MCC w ill be allowed to disclose the patient’s treatment
assignment only in cases of emergencies, such as accidental drug ingestion or in cases of severecytopenias associated with severe infections or bleeding where therapeutic options may bedependent on identification of the study treatment assignment.
7.3.4 Alert System
The Primary Endpoint Person (PEP) will review the local CBC results to determine if an alert
is present in the data. In addition, the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory data and localCBC data will be used by the MCC to monitor electr onically for values exceeding alert levels (Table
7-2).  Local CBC results will override Core Laboratory results. If an alert level is detected, theClinical Centers will use the following guidelines for responding to notification of an alert.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/BABY-HUG/BHUG PROTOCOL/August-09/ CHAP-7 —  8/09 Page 7-4 of 7-9  Every time a value exceeds the alert level:
1. The PEP will handle the alert in a straightforward manner when possible, or, more
likely, contact a Hematologist/Sickle Cell Specialist who is not directly connectedwith the BABY HUG Trial. 
2. When indicated, the PEP and the Hematologist will develop a plan for a clinical
response to the alert value. (For example: If the patient were severely neutropenicand febrile, the patient would be hospitalized for antibiotic treatment; if the patienthad > 20% decrease in hemoglobin level, the patient would be hospitalized and/ortransfused; if the patient met criteria for a splenic sequestration, the patient wouldbe hospitalized and/or transfused; etc.) 
3. In the event that no non- BABY HUG Hematologist was available, the PEP would
need to contact the BABY HUG PI and discuss a course of action. In doing so, thePEP would provide the PI only with “need to know” laboratory information. In mostcases this will not create an unblinding problem because, for example: severeneutropenia may more likely be related to an acute viral infection rather than HUtoxicity; worse anemia might be caused by an aplastic crisis or splenic sequestrationrather than HU; splenic sequestration might or might not be related to HU, etc. Inmost situations, CBC values would not readily distinguish between treatment withhydroxyurea or placebo, although it is important that the MCV should not berevealed to the PI or BABY HUG Study Coordinators.
4. In the ensuing management of the child, the bulk of the decision-making should be
carried out by the non-BABY HUG Hematologist and the PEP. 
5. The alert values for increased hematologic blood counts would not necessarily
warrant any immediate reaction by a clinician.

CHAPTER 8
GUIDELINES FOR STANDARD CLINICAL CARE
8.1 INTRODUCTION
The basic principles of supportive care for the infants with sickle cell anemia enrolled in the
BABY HUG trial are based upon the recommendations found in several publications (MountainStates Regional Genetic Services Network, 2000; Council of Regional Networks for GeneticServices (CORN), 2000; Ohene-Frempong, 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services,
Public Health Service, 1993).  Supportive care s hould be similar whether t he patient is receiving
hydroxyurea or placebo.  For the ease of clinicians involved with participants, all
 patients should
be treated as if they were receiving hydroxyurea.   The cooperation of all medical staff involved in
the clinical care of study patients will be solicited to enhance patient adherence to the BABY HUGProtocol and avoid compromise of blinding of treatment assignments.
Common clinical events are addressed in specific sections below.  At no time should the
performance of the study Protocol be allowed to compromise the elements of good clinical care ofBABY HUG participants.8.2 IMMUNIZATIONS
All routine pediatric immunizations should be given as per standard clinical
recommendations, including vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles,mumps, hepatitis B, rubella and Haemophilus influenzae  type b.  Immunizations against hepatitis
A and varicella may be given if indicated and commonly available locally.  These vaccines shouldbe provided through usual local pediatric primary care mechanisms if possible.  Any and allvaccines may be withheld for medical indications (e.g., allergy or history of prior reaction) orparental preference.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-2 of 8-10  All participants should receive all recommended doses of pneumococcal vaccine according
to the following schedule.  A history of vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar
or PCV7) , including date(s) given, must be documented by the BABY HUG Clinical Center and
reported to the Medical Coordinating Center for each infant enrolled.  Patients deficient in PCV7immunizations at study entry should be brought up to date by the Clinical Center as soon aspossible.  Bacteremia and meningitis with S.  pneumoniae  will be monitored closely as clinical
events in BABY HUG.  Further, the antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination will bemeasured in the study.  The total number of doses required is dependent upon the age of the
patient when the first dose is given even if the interval between doses is longer than intended.Adequate series of vaccinations are indicated in the table below.  
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Series (Prevnar or PCV7)
Age at first dose (mos) Primary Series Additional Dose**
2-6 3 doses, 2 months apart* 1 dose at 12-15 months
7-11 2 doses, 2 months apart* 1 dose at 12-15 months12-23 2 doses, 2 months apartmore than 24 months 1 dose
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (pneumovax or PV23)
Age at first dose (mos) Primary Series Additional Dose**
less than or equal to 24 months 1 dose 1 dose at 60 months*  For children vaccinated before 1 year the minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks.
**Additional dose should be 8 or more weeks after the primary series has been completed.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-3 of 8-10  Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine (MMR) :  one dose of the vaccine should be
documented as given between 12 and 15 months of age and then repeated between 4 and 6 years
of age.  The immunologic response to this vaccine will be assessed to document the ability ofpatients receiving either hydroxyurea or placebo to respond to these antigens.  Thus, the date ofthis immunization must be recorded for each patient  by the Clinical Center and reported to the
Medical Coordinating Center.  Parents will be encouraged, and assisted by the BABY HUG Clinical
Center as necessary, to obtain this vaccine as early in the scheduled vaccine interval as possible.
Influenza vaccine
: the annual flu vaccine is encouraged for all infants 6 months of age or
older.  The first year this is administered this s hould be given as two 0.25 ml doses, with a minimum
of four weeks between doses.  Each subsequent flu season, one dose is given.  A single dose of0.25 ml is given to patients from 6 to 35 months of age and 0.5 ml to patients over 36 months ofage.  8.3 PROPHYLACTIC MEDICATIONS
Twice daily prophylactic penicillin will be prescr ibed from first medical contact.  This should
have already been initiated prior to enrollment in BABY HUG.  The doses are from birth to 35months of age - 125mg po BID – and over 36 months of age - 250 mg po BID.  Either the liquidformulation, which must be kept refrigerated and refilled every 2 weeks, or tablets may be used(Mountain States Regional Genetic Services Network, 2000; American Academy of Pediatrics,2000).  Erythromycin estolate 250 mg po BID may be used for penicillin allergic patients (MountainStates Regional Genetic Services Network,  2000; Council of Regional Networks for Genetic
Services (CORN), 2000; Ohene-Frempong, 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services,
Public Health Service, 1993).  Reminders about the need for this prophylactic agent should beoffered at each clinical contact.
Folic Acid supplementation will not
 be required for patients on BABY HUG.  It may be
prescribed at parental or Clinical Center preference.  It is very unlikely that infants enrolled on thisstudy will be deficient in folate.  The majority will either still be drinking or just have been weaned
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-4 of 8-10  from high folic acid containing infant formula.  The widespread fortification of a variety of foods with
folic acid and the generally adequate diets of young patients with sickle cell anemia should prevent
folate deficiency.
Supplemental iron will be prescribed only for documented iron deficiency or bleeding or
similar reasons.  Adequacy of iron stores will be documented at study entry and every six months
and supplemented as necessary.8.4 PARENT EDUCATION
All parental and caregiver education routinely offered to families of patients with sickle cell
anemia should be provided to BABY HUG participants.  However, in order to standardize someaspects of care the following suggestions are offered for each Clinical Center to review with BABYHUG families at quarterly visits :
Fever
:  The temperature should be measured if the child feels hot.  Families should be
advised to have a thermometer at home and taught how to accurately use it.  They should beinstructed to seek medical attention for any temperature over 101.5
0F regardless of route (oral,
axillary or rectal) measured.  The parent or caregiver should be cautioned against use ofantipyretics unless recommended by treating physi cians.  They are encour aged to seek medical
attention for all febrile episodes.  The medical response to a reported history of fever should includea complete blood count, blood culture, and an empiric dose of parenteral antibiotics (usuallyceftriaxone) effective against encapsulated organi sms.  Admission or outpatient management will
be at local option (Mountain States Regional Genet ic Services Network, 2000; Council of Regional
Networks for Genetic Services (CORN), 2000).  
Neutropenia
:  A complete blood count with differential white blood cell count should be
performed at the Clinical Center or site of care with each febrile event.  If the absolute neutrophilcount (ANC) on the local blood count is below 1,000/uL,  the child should be admitted
 to the hospital
for observation and parenteral antibiotics.  BABY HUG study medication should be stopped andthe Medical Coordinating Center notified.  If the ANC on the local blood count exceeds 1,250/uL
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-5 of 8-10  prior to hospital discharge, BABY HUG study medication should be resumed at the same dose as
on admission.  If on hospital discharge the ANC on the local blood count is still below 1,250/uL, thepatient and family should be instructed not to resume treatment until a local scheduled bloodspecimen shows a count of 1,250/µL or greater.  
If the absolute neutrophil count on local blood count is between 1,000/uL and 1,250/uL
during evaluation for a febrile event, the BABY HUG study medication should be stopped.  Thepatient may be treated as an outpatient or admitted at local option.  If admitted, BABY HUG studytreatments will be stopped as above.  If managed as an outpatient, the patient should remain off
BABY HUG study medication until a local scheduled blood count is performed and the count is1,250/µL or greater.
Hospitalization
:  The BABY HUG study medication should be continued during all clinically
indicated hospitalizations unless the ANC of a BABY HUG participant is found to be below1,250/uL.  Then the study medication should be stopped and the Medical Coordinating Centernotified.  Study treatment should be resumed at the same dose when the ANC on the local bloodcount exceeds 1,250/uL.  If the patient is otherwise able to be discharged to outpatientmanagement before the ANC recovers, the patient and family should be instructed not to resumetreatment until the next scheduled local blood specimen can be reviewed.  The Clinical CenterPrincipal Investigator and Nurse Coordinator will not review the local blood counts for meancorpuscular volume (MCV) or other parameters that may compromise blinding of the patient’s studymedication assignment.
Positive Cultures
:  The blood culture (plus cerebrospinal fluid -- CSF -- or urine cultures if
performed) obtained at all febrile encounters will be monitored by each Clinical Center.  Positivecultures from normally sterile sites will be man aged according to Clinical  Center preference and
reported to the Medical Coordinating Center.  The organism should be identified; if possible, andantibiotic sensitivities obtained.  The serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from sterile
sites for patients on this trial should be obtained if possible.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-6 of 8-10  Varicella :  The family should be instructed to contact the Clinical Center for suspected
varicella infection.  If the child is febrile, management should be as above.  If fever does not exceed101.5
0 F, no extra CBC is required.  BABY HUG study medication should be stopped for all
episodes of varicella and the Medical Coordinating Center notified.  BABY HUG medication shouldbe resumed at the same dose when all lesions are crusted over.  Acyclovir may be prescribed atClinical Center discretion.
Tuberculosis
:  Surveillance for exposure to tuberculosis is standard in many pediatric clinic
populations.  If a patient receiving BABY HUG study medication is incidentally found to have apositive tuberculosis skin test (PPD), a repeat PPD and chest radiograph should be done perstandard practice.  If the chest radiograph and physical examination show no signs of activetuberculosis, the child should be treated as appropriate and the study medication continued oncethe PPD treatment is no longer a risk for continuation of the study treatment.  If the chestradiograph is positive or there is evidence of active infection with tuberculosis, the child’s situationshould be discussed with the Operations Committee.
Transfusion Therapy
:  The use of blood products as therapy for a clinical event will be at
the option of the Clinical Center.  The red cell products selected should be matched for Rh (CcDEe)and Kell if possible.  Similarly leukofiltration of all cellular blood components should be considered,if available.  Chronic transfusion therapy for any indication, an option that would remove the patientfrom study treatment, should be discussed with t he Operations Committee prior to implementation.
Steady State Hematologic Values
:  Many clinical decisions in the young patient with sickle
cell anemia are based upon steady state hemoglobin le vels.  Obtaining such data on patients in
BABY HUG Clinical Centers could undermine blinding of treatment assignments.  The MedicalCoordinating Center will provide the unblinded Prim ary Endpoint Person at each Clinical Center 3-
month rolling averages of steady state hemoglobin m easurements monthly.  Steady state is defined
by intervals when the patient is not having a febrile , acute chest syndrome, aplastic crisis or splenic
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-7 of 8-10  sequestration event.  MCV and white cell or neutrophil counts will not be included with the
information on hemoglobin level.  
Spleen and Splenic Sequestration :  Parents and caregivers should be instructed in
techniques of spleen palpation at each clinical visi t and asked to feel for the child’s spleen daily.
A newly palpable spleen or one more than 2 cm la rger than previously noted should be reported
immediately to the Clinical Center, and the patient should have a CBC and be examined by a
physician or nurse practitioner knowledgeable about sickle cell anemia.  The span of the spleenbelow the costal margin in the midclavicular and anterior axillary lines should be carefully measuredand recorded (in centimeters) at each clinical visit.  
Splenic sequestration and splenomegaly as defined in Appendix F will be recorded on the
appropriate study form as outlined in the Manual of Operations.  
The management of splenic enlargement (admission, close outpatient follow-up or
transfusion) will be at the discretion of the Principal Investigator at each Clinical Center, but thefollowing guidelines should be used whenever appropriate/possible.  On initial evaluation:
1. Vital signs at presentation and q1-2 hours initially;2. Careful physical examination with asse ssment of pallor, measurement of spleen
size, presence of gallop, liver size; repeat examination q1-2 hours initially;
3. Labs including CBC, WBC differential, reticulocytes STAT.  Type and crossmatch
for packed red blood cells (PRBCs);
4. If hypovolemic or with cardiovascular compromise, emergent infusion of intravenous
fluids (IVF) or PRBC to restore blood volume and maintain normal blood pressure.If normovolemic, start IVF at 1x maintenance.  
5. Admission unless stable over 4-8 hour period; close follow-up.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-8 of 8-10  On admission:
1. Monitor heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry q2 hours until stable,
then q4h; 
2. Repeat CBC studies q4-12 hours;3. Maintain IVF at 1x maintenance;4. If febrile obtain blood culture and begin antibiotics, e.g.  cefuroxime 50 mg/kg IV
every 8 hours;
5. Transfuse for evidence of hypotension, cardiovascular (CV) compromise, enlarging
tender spleen with 10-15 cc/kg over 4 hours.  If no CV compromise, transfuse if Hgb <5 gm/dL for stable splenomegaly regardless of reticulocyte count; if Hgb> 5gm/dL transfuse at Principal Investigatordiscretion.Goal of transfusion is Hgb about 8 gm/dL, (splenic unloading of trapped RBC maycause an "overshoot phenomenon");
6. Supplemental oxygen until condition is stable (or acute episode resolves); 7. Other clinical interventions, including antipyretics and analgesics, at Principal
Investigator discretion.
After the initial splenic sequestration event, the child will be monitored every 2 weeks.  The
decision to continue PRBC transfusions and/or proceed to splenectomy, will be at the discretionof the Principal Investigator.  However, the number of children undergoing splenectomy accordingto local indications will be tabulated in each treatment group.  Chronic transfusion therapy orsplenectomy, options that would remove the patient from study treatment or scintographic
evaluation of the primary (spleen) endpoint, should be discussed with the Operations Committeeprior to implementation.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-9 of 8-10  Episodes of splenomegaly, splenic sequestrat ion and associated measures will be tabulated
and compared according to HU and placebo group assignment.  If an excess of sequestrationevents is found in the HU group, the DSMB may consider stopping the trial.  
Renal
: Parents and caregivers will be educated about the importance of the kidneys in
children with sickle cell disease, and reminded that the kidneys are special organs tested in theBABY HUG trial.  Infants should remain adequately hydrated at all times, as dehydration isdetrimental and could be injurious to the kidneys.  Treatment that has potential risk to the kidneys,such as prolonged use of aminoglycosides or high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,should be avoided.  Frequent urinary tract infections and hematuria will be documented during theBABY HUG trial, as these findings may reflect or cause renal damage.
Painful Events (vaso-occlusive or dactylitis)
: Parents and caregivers will be educated about
dactylitis and painful events as part of their education about sickle cell disease.  They will be taughtto push fluids and use ibuprofen and/or acetaminophen with codeine at home.   Small supplies ofboth analgesics should be prescribed for home use at routine clinical visits.   They and caregiverswill be educated about dactylitis and painful events as part of their education about sickle celldisease.  The definition of a painful event is an event lasting two hours or more without obvious
cause requiring the use of one or more doses of non-steroidal or narcotic pain medication.  Eventstreated as an outpatient (including emergency room) or requiring admission will be reported at thenext Clinical Center contact and included in data entered.  Events requiring admission will bereported to the Medical Coordinating Center on appropriate form, and supporting documentscollected for central review.  
Acute Chest Syndrome, Aplastic Crisis, Priapism
:  All events meeting defined criteria will
be reported to the Medical Coordinating Center  on Event Report Forms.  Clinical management,
including the need for simple or exchange transfusion will be at the option of each Clinical Center.Chronic transfusion therapy, an option that would remove the patient from study treatment, shouldbe discussed with the Operations Committee prior to implementation.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-8.wpd —  8/09 Page 8-10 of 8-10  Parents will be educated about signs of acute c hest syndrome (fever, respiratory symptoms)
and aplastic crisis  (pallor, decreased energy) at regular clinic visits and asked to seek medicalattention should they occur.  Parents of ma le children will be taught about priapism, a prolonged
painful erection of the penis, and asked to seek medical attention, if the episode persists beyondtwo hours.  Briefer episodes of priapism will be recorded at the next clinic visit.  
Neurologic Events
: Families will be taught standardized definitions of TIA, stroke and other
neurologic events and reminded at each clinical contact to call the Clinical Center immediately ifthe child is not able to move arms or legs (unrelated to pain), has facial drooping or dysarthria.Each Clinical Center will promptly evaluate su ch patients.  The minimum evaluation must include
documentation of complete neurologic examination, preferably by a neurologist.  If the neurologistsuspects stroke or TIA clinically, neuroimaging including MRI/MRA must be done.  If a stroke isconfirmed, acute management will be at the preferenc e of the Clinical Center.  Transfusion timing
and technique (exchange or simple) will be at Clinical Center preference.  Chronic transfusiontherapy, an option that would remove the patient from study treatment, should be discussed withthe Operations Committee prior to implementation.
If transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening is part of an individual Clinical Center’s standard
care, such testing should be offered to patients enrolled in BABY HUG as per usual practice.  TCDscreening is not yet universally available or standardized for children less than two years of age.If screening is performed and values are persistently  abnormally elevated in children over 2 years
of age, the parents should be offered chronic transfusion therapy for the child in accordance withstandard practice at each Clinical Center.  Patients for whom chronic transfusion therapy isconsidered should be discussed in advance with the Operations Committee.

CHAPTER 9
SPECIAL STUDIES AND READING GROUPS  
9.1 INTRODUCTION  
Special studies and event reports that will be centrally evaluated by individuals blind to
treatment assignment and independent of the BABY HUG Clinical Centers include liver-spleenscans, pitted cell counts, karyotype and chromosome breakage studies, VDJ mutation studies,immunological function studies, clinical events, and serum Cystatin C levels.  9.2 PITTED CELL COUNTS
Pitted cell counts will be done in a single laboratory, the Pitted Cell Core Laboratory.  Tubes
containing the glutaraldehyde buffer and directions for specimen collection will be provided to theClinical Centers by the Pitted Cell Core Laborator y.  Pitted cell counts from specimens collected
at baseline, six, twelve, and eighteen months , and 24 months will be compared between treatment
groups.  If the proportion of patients in the HU treatment group who have pitted cell count valuesabove a predetermined level (e.g., 3.5 or 7-10%) decreases in relation to the placebo group, thisfinding will be interpreted as secondary outcome evidence of prevention by HU of injury to thespleen.  9.3 CYTOGENETICS (KARYOTYPE AND CHROMOSOME BREAKAGE ANALYSES)
Fresh blood specimens will be analyzed for karyotype and chromosome breakage at
baseline and 24 months in a cytogenetics laboratory.   White blood cells will be taken from fresh
specimens shipped on wet ice, overnight to the cytogenetics laboratory, cultured for 48 hours andprepared with colchicine for morphologic study of the karyotype and chromosomes.  9.4 VDJ/DNA MUTATION STUDIES
Genomic DNA will be isolated using a standard commercially available kit (Puregene DNA
Isolation Kit, Gentra Systems Inc.).  The purif ied DNA will be quantitated using a spectrophotometer
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-9.wpd —  8/09 Page 9-2 of 9-4  and used directly in the VDJ mutation assay.  Leftover DNA will be frozen at -70°C and used for
future studies assuming proper IRB authorization and patient consent is in place.  
The overall goal of the VDJ studies is the investigation and quantification of the mutagenic
and carcinogenic risks of HU therapy for very young children with SCD enrolled in the BABY HUGstudy.  To accomplish this goal, we will analyze peripheral blood for the presence of changes inchromosomal integrity that indicate unrepaired genetic damage.  The specific aims of the VDJmutation study are:  to quantitate the frequency of “illegitimate” VDJ recombination events thatoccur between the T cell receptor gamma (T CR-gamma) and beta (TCR-beta) gene loci located
on chromosome 7; and to compare the frequency of VDJ mutational events among patientsassigned to hydroxyurea as compared with the placebo group, using serial measurements for bothgroups.  
Quantitations of Howell-Jolly bodies will also be performed.  For each of the patients, a
small aliquot of RBC will be fixed in ice-cold methanol and frozen at -85°C according to a previouslypublished protocol.  This sample will be shipped frozen to Litron Laboratories, Inc. in Rochester,NY  and analyzed by flow cytometr y for quantitation of Howell-Jolly bodies (micronuclei) in both
immature and mature erythrocytes.  9.5 LIVER-SPLEEN SCANS 
Tc99m sulfur colloid liver-spleen scans will be performed according to standard techniques.
Results will be assessed at the end of the study by a panel of 3 pediatric radiologists unaware ofthe treatment assignment of the patient.  Two readers will be given copies of the entry and exit
Tc99m sulfur colloid liver-spleen scans and asked to score each scan as splenic uptake “normal”(80-100% of liver uptake), decreased (splenic uptake 20-79% of liver uptake) or absent (splenicuptake 0-19% of liver uptake).  In case of disagreement between the two readers, a third reader
on the panel will evaluate the scan, and the final evaluation will be that of the majority.  Theproportion of patients in each treatment group classified by spleen function (normal, decreased, orabsent) and the proportion of entry and exit scan pairs demonstrating a decline (from one category
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-9.wpd —  8/09 Page 9-3 of 9-4  to another) in splenic function will be compared in the HU vs placebo treated groups.  Paired scans
that demonstrate an improvement in uptake w ill be scored as not demonstrating a decline.  
9.6 ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND
A central reader with specialty expertise in pediatric ultrasound studies will advise the BABY
HUG investigators on performance standards for abdominal ultrasound studies and imagepreparation.  These images will be read centrally, blind to treatment assignment for assessment
for gallstones, kidney size, spleen size and liver enlargement.  9.7 HYDROXYUREA ASSAY
Quantitative assays of hydroxyurea will be performed on selected bottles of study
treatments at the end of manufacturing after reconstitution.  Also, plasma levels of hydroxyurea willbe assessed at the time of first dose, approximately one month after the first dose, and upon exitfrom the study.  9.8 IMMUNE FUNCTION STUDIES
To determine the effects of hydroxyurea treatment on antibody responses to standard
vaccines administered before and during hydroxyurea therapy, baseline pneumococcal antibodylevel (in response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered at two, four and six months ofage -- prior to study entry) and after 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (given at 24months of age) will be measured.  Antibody levels  for measles, mumps and rubella (vaccine given
at 12 - 15 months of age) before and after immunization will be measured for those enrolled priorto vaccination.  
To determine the effects of hydroxyurea treatment on T cell maturation and T cell responses
to a vaccine administered during hydroxyurea therapy, we will measure peripheral blood naïve(CD45RA) and memory (CD45RO) CD4 and CD8 cells at entry and 12 and 24 months thereafter.
To determine the effects of hydroxyurea treatment on serum opsonophagocytic function,
we will measure opsonophagocytic activity against pneum ococci at study entry, after the 24-month
of age pneumococcal immunization, and at the end of  treatment (24 months on study treatment).
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-9.wpd —  8/09 Page 9-4 of 9-4  Measurement of relative contributions of complement and antibody to opsonophagocytic activity
will be accomplished by comparing the activity of fresh versus heat-treated sera.9.9 CLINICAL EVENTS
Description of Clinical Events will be based on C linical Event Forms submitted to the MCC
where they will be classified by independent pedi atric hematologists or neurologists.  Independent
review for adjudication by a third physician w ill be performed in the case of disagreement.
Definitions of clinical events will be based on CSSCD, HUSOFT and other published experience
with pediatric sickle cell anemia and provided in a separate classification criteria document.  9.10 TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER (TCD)
Transcranial Doppler studies will be perform ed by trained technicians from a Central
Laboratory located in the Medical College of Georgia (MCG), Augusta, Georgia, or by local Clinical
Center examiners trained and certified by t he MCG technicians.  The Central Laboratory will
perform standardized readings of the studies (supported by grant funding independent of the BABYHUG contracts). 9.11 CYSTATIN C
Leftover serum from the biochemistry treatment initiation and exit specimens sent to the
Biochemistry Core Laboratory will be shipped to the DNA/VDJ Core Laboratory for determiningCystatin C levels.

CHAPTER 10
FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES  
10.1 INTRODUCTION  
Patients will be followed every two weeks for at least eight weeks after study treatment
initiation. Subsequent visits will be every 4 weeks unless toxicity occurs. The total follow-up is aminimum of 24 months.  During the period of study treatment at each monthly visit, a medicalreview will be conducted to determine any adverse or acute events and adherence to studymedication.  Medical history and adherence forms will be completed. At each of these regularlyscheduled visits, a complete blood count will be assessed locally by a physician who is nototherwise affiliated with BABY HUG , and who will keep this information confidential except as
needed for urgent patient management on the day of the visit.  All adverse events in a patient will
be reported on the appropriate form accompanied by  appropriate documentation from the medical
record.  Appendix A shows an ideal schedule of patient visits and data collection.  A patient’s actualschedule will depend on his/her toxicities.  
10.2 FOLLOW-UP VISITS
The BABY HUG Clinical Center staff will perform all study visit examinations. Study patients
will be evaluated in accordance with good clinical practice.  The Medical Coordinating Center(MCC) will be responsible for organizing and transmitting data from clinical laboratory studiesoutlined in the Protocol and for endpoint adjudication.  Under the direction of the MCC, a PharmacyDistribution Center (PDC) will distribute hydroxyurea and placebo to Clinical Centers where doseadjustments will be prescribed based on information from  the MCC.  At the monthly visits, medical
reviews will be conducted, and measurements of weight (height and head circumference every
three months), ascertainment of possible adverse events, major procedures, and current therapies(including hydroxyurea outside of study treatment) will be recorded.  Blood specimens for CBCs will
be collected and analyzed locally.  Other blood specimens will be collected and prepared for
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-2 of 10-22   shipment to the Core Laboratory every six months or at study entry/exit.  Each patient’s current
address and telephone number will be updated and maintained in the Clinical Center files.Although not mandatory, each Clinical Center is encouraged to set aside a specific day of the weekfor BABY HUG clinic visits, preferably early in the week to allow dose adjustments before theweekend.  In addition, a specified clinic day may help to increase adherence to the Protocol.
10.2.1 Real Time Complete Blood Counts
1. Each Clinical Center will designate the person (a hematologist, or nurse practitioner
or physician’s assistant qualified to perform this task relative to the regulations of the state health regulations, who has no other BABY HUG responsibility) who willmonitor each child's blood work that is performed locally at each clinic visit. 
2. The Primary Endpoint Person (PEP) will data enter the CBCs into the BABY HUG
database vis the Internet Data Entry System within one day of collecting thespecimen or by 9:00 a.m. of the following morning.  
3. The PEP will keep the local laboratory resu lts in a locked file with no access by
BABY HUG staff. 
4. The MCC will check the local lab data for violating BABY HUG toxicity and/or alert
levels and will send the appropriate messages to the PEP.
5. The designee, if in his/her clinical judgment, believes a toxicity and/or alert level has
been crossed, will contact the Clinical Center Principal Investigator to notify of thetoxicity and/or alert and to arrange for appropriate emergency clinical care. 
If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) on the local blood count is below 1250/uL or the Hgb
<6.0 g/dl or the Hgb has dropped 20% or more from the three-month rolling average or the platelet
count is <80,000 mm3, study treatment shoul d be stopped and the child  should be clinically
evaluated to determine if intervention is required .  BABY HUG study medication should be stopped
and the Medical Coordinating Center notified.  
If the ANC on the local blood count exceeds 1,250/uL prior to hospital discharge, BABY
HUG study medication should be resumed at the same dose as on admission.  If on hospitaldischarge the ANC on the local blood count is still below 1,250/uL, the patient and family should
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-3 of 10-22   be instructed not to resume treatment until a scheduled local blood specimen is above 1,250/uL and
reviewed in the Medical Coordinating Center.  
If the absolute neutrophil count on local blood count is between 1,000/uL and 1,250/uL
during evaluation for a febrile event, the BABY HUG study medication should be stopped.  Thepatient may be treated as an outpatient or admitted at local option.  If admitted, BABY HUG studytreatments will be stopped as above.  If managed as an outpatient, the patient should remain offBABY HUG study medication until a scheduled blood count is performed locally and reviewed inthe Medical Coordinating Center. 
10.2.2 Ascertainment of Specified Events and Possible Adverse Effects in Patients
At each visit, parents will be queried regarding recent medical events or procedures.  Events
will be documented to ascertain the nature of the event, including special treatment(s) and theirindication(s).  Reportable events and hospitalizat ions will be recorded on event forms and followed
up by the BABY HUG PEP, who will review hospital charts, medical records and office visit records.These forms will be forwarded to the MCC and maintained in a locked file by the PEP.
The event report forms and documentation will identify the occurrence of death, stroke with
neurologic deficit, splenic sequestration, dactylit is, pain, acute chest syndrome, priapism,
splenomegaly, biliary obstruction, hepatopathy, hepatic sequestration, pancreatitis, fever >101.5°F (38.5° C), acute renal failure, permanent renal failure, sepsis, severe neutropenia, aplastic crisis,acute osteomyelitis, transient ischemic attack and hospitalizations for sickle cell related events.  Ifany study patient dies, efforts will be made to obtai n complete post-mortem information.  Discharge
summaries and narratives of the fatal events will be sent with study forms to the MCC.  All
reportable events, whether treated on an out-patient or in-patient basis, will be reviewed by theCentral Review Group (the NHLBI Project Director and the MCC Medical Consultant). Adversetreatment effects will be reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-4 of 10-22   10.2.3 BABY HUG Adverse Event Reporting
10.2.3.1 Introduction
The safety of interventions and treatments associated with this protocol will be under
continual review by the MCC, NHLBI, NICHD and DS MB.  Accrual, efficacy and safety data will be
monitored by all four groups.  
Accrual and safety data will be reviewed annually  by each center’s Institutional Review
Board (IRB). Prior to implementation of this study, the Protocol and the proposed patient consentforms will be reviewed and approved by the properly c onstituted Institutional Review Board (IRB)
operating according to the 45 CFR 46 code of federal regulations. This committee will also approveall amendments to the Protocol or informed consent, and conduct continuing annual review so longas BABY HUG is open to accrual or follow-up of subjects.  
The NHLBI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review the Protocol at 6 month intervals.
A progress report showing results according to  treatment assignment will be forwarded to the
DSMB at these times and their recommendati ons will be expeditiously implemented. The DSMB
members will be provided with monthly reports documenting each child’s growth, development and
progress in BABY HUG. The DSMB may recommend early termination of the study forconsiderations of safety or efficacy.  
Monitoring for unanticipated adverse clinical effects will be done using event forms.  The
Clinical Center staff will determine the degree of severity (mild to fatal).  Event forms will be
submitted to the Medical Coordinating Center (MCC) and tabulated based on the affected organsystem.  Each serious AE (SAE) will be reported to the MCC within 24 hours of the event;supporting information will be required from the Clinical Center.  MCC staff and the central reviewgroup will immediately review the report to determine if the event is serious. If so, MCC staff will
send the information to the NHLBI and NICHD Project Officers and the FDA for review.  Theoccurrence of serious AEs will be reported to the Clinical Center IRBs within 24 hours of NHLBIreview.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-5 of 10-22   A serious adverse event is any of the following.
1. death2. a life-threatening event3. prolonged hospitalization (greater than 7 days)4. splenic sequestration crisis5. stroke, TIA6. acute chest syndrome7. an ICU admission8. Any AE that is related to study treatment and unexpected Certain Serious Adverse Events that are sickle cell related have been added to the list, as
defined by the FDA.  Item #3 has been modified from the FDA definition given that frequent
hospitalizations occur as a consequence of having sickle cell anemia without being enrolled in aclinical trial.  Any serious adverse events (as defined by the FDA) which are not included in the
above list, will be summarized and reported semi-annually.  The Clinical Centers will be requiredto provide supporting information using a MedW atch Form 3500A for the events in the above list.
In addition to this reporting mechanism, a centralized over-ride system will be carried out
by individuals with knowledge about the treatm ent assignments.  These individuals will review
adverse events that are not thought to be serious in the eyes of the blinded investigators and makedecisions about whether an adverse event is “serious” and reportable to the FDA.  The two centralreview individuals will be the NHLBI Project Officer and MCC Medical Consultant.  Either of theseindividuals will have the ability to elevate an adver se event being reported to the MCC to the
“serious” category which will precipitate the collection of the required information for the MedWatchForm 3500A and a subsequent report to the FDA.   
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be listed individually and according to body
system, designated according to severity (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or fatal), andlikelihood of relation to study treatment (not related, possibly, probably or definitely related), and
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-6 of 10-22   classified according to action taken (none, treatment stopped or interrupted, specific treatment
instituted) and outcome (recovery without change in previous condition, some impairment,significant impairment, or death).
10.2.3.2 DBDR Adverse Event Coverage
NHLBI Division of Blood Diseases and Resour ces (DBDR) staff w ill examine all adverse
event reports from BABY HUG in real time and discuss with the BABY HUG Operations Committeeappropriate clinical management. NHLBI - DBDR w ill hold emergency meetings to review adverse
event reports as they occur. These DBDR staff will alternate night and week-end coverage via cell-phone so that the BABY HUG MCC will have access to a DBDR staff person at all times to discussthe management of adverse events in BABY HUG subjects.
10.2.3.3 Elevated Adverse Event Rate Detection
Events to be centrally reviewed include all seri ous adverse events (e.g., death or events that
are life-threatening, or events that cause or prolong hospitalization), splenic sequestration crisis,acute chest syndrome, stroke, transient isc hemic attacks and ICU admissions.  Other clinical
occurrences will be denoted as having occurred or not occurred on clinic visit reports.  There isadequate statistical power in BABY HUG to detect 50% differences between treatment groups atalpha = 0.01 if the event rates are in the range ex pected from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell
Disease (CSSCD) and the study is completed with 200 patients.  The BABY HUG investigators donot plan for early termination based on clinical events other than demonstrated inferiority ofhydroxyurea for the outcomes death, stroke or splenic sequestration.  
The most important clinical events other than death and stroke are acute chest syndrome
(ACS) and splenic sequestration (defined in Appendix F).  Each child will be clinically evaluatedrepeatedly to determine if he/she has had acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration or aserious, unexpected adverse event in the course of  the study period.  The proportion of very young
children experiencing these adverse events will be compared according to assigned treatment.  A
one-sided test-based confidence interval (alpha = 0.005) will be used to determine if very young
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-7 of 10-22   children treated with HU have significantly higher frequencies than very young children treated with
placebo.  If the test-based, one-sided confidence interval does not cover zero, the SteeringCommittee proposes that the DSMB will consider all relevant information for the study and willrecommend that the clinical trial not continue and HU not be recommended as a treatment for veryyoung children. 
10.2.3.4 Interim Reports 
Adverse events used to evaluate the safety of the BABY HUG regimen will be collected to
include any unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptomsor diseases (i.e. incidence of stroke, renal failure, regimen related toxicities, or infectiouscomplications), which either occur during the study, having been absent at baseline or if presentat baseline, appear to worsen and are determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related tothis investigational treatment.  
Although the size of the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study was chosen to allow the BABY
HUG investigators to evaluate several administrativ e issues of the overall study design, it will be
important to monitor the study in an ongoing fashion with respect to performance criteria and theoccurrence of adverse events.  For analyses other than those discussed above, we will protect ourfindings against finding spurious associations due to the large number of repeated tests ofsignificance that will be performed.  To do this, we propose to use monitoring bounds (for HUversus control comparisons) of 0.01 rather than 0.05 for the safety and adverse event evaluations
listed below.  We propose the following monitoring. Monitoring Safety and Adverse Events
The DSMB Chair, Executive Secretary of DSMB, and NHLBI and NICHD Project Officers
will review monthly reports including:1. Recruitment: Expected vs. Actual2. Patients screened, eligible and randomized3. Patient characteristics at baseline

10.2.3.5 Analysis of Death or Stroke
Death and clinically manifest stroke represent the most adverse outcomes that can occur
within this study, and it will be important to det ermine if HU treatment results in an excess number
of these types of events.  These two outcomes will be evaluated separately from each other.  One-
sided test-based confidence intervals (alpha = 0.05) will be used to determine if very young childrentreated with HU have a significantly higher frequency of either outcome than very young childrentreated with placebo.  If the 95% one-sided confidence interval for either stroke or death does notcover 0, it will be recommended that the trial not proceed and that HU not be used as a treatmentfor very young children.  
Clinical Centers will be expected to report to the Medical Coordinating Center the
occurrence of death or stroke within 24 hours of learning about the event.  The MedicalCoordinating Center will prepare a report immediately with the information at hand for the NHLBIand NICHD Project Officers, Executive Secretary of DSMB and the DSMB Chair.  Within 10 days,the Medical Coordinating Center staff will provide an updated report for the NHLBI and NICHDProject Officers, DSMB Executive Secretary, and fo r the DSMB Chair.  Each case will be reviewed
individually with the DSMB.  The NHLBI Project Officer and DSMB Executive Secretary will filereports on each death or stroke with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the studyIND.  If the p-value for an association of death or of stroke with hydroxyurea is between 0.05 and
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-10 of 10-22   0.20 after any occurrence, the members of the DSMB will review all death or stroke reports in BABY
HUG in aggregate and with other study data to cons ider whether or not there is a concern that
should be addressed with a Protocol revision or study termination. 
10.2.3.6 Analysis of Growth and Development
We will analyze each child’s weight (monthly), height (quarterly), head circumference
(quarterly) and growth velocity (monthly). We will measure their neurodevelopment (Bayley,
Vineland) annually.  Height, weight and head circumference growth will be analyzed using actualmeasurements and percentiles  standardized to the CSSCD population of children with HbSS forheight and weight, and to a normal black American population for head circumference (Pivnick etal, 1999).  Average scores for the two treatment groups will be compared to test: H
O: :2 > :1
versus the alternative:
HA: :2 < :1, 
where :2 is the mean of measurements or percentiles for children assigned to HU and :1 is the
mean of measurements or percentiles for children assigned to placebo.  
Each test will be a t-test performed on the estimates of height, weight and head
circumference calculated for each child.  It is proposed that DSMB members review individualgrowth and height for possible clinical indications of adverse effects of HU on height and weight ifthe mean in HU-treated very young children is bet ween 1 and 2 standard deviations (SD) below the
mean for placebo-treated very young children and to stop the study if the mean of HU-treated veryyoung children is more than 2 SDs below placebo treated very young children. 
For review, DSMB members will be provided with  the growth curves of each child printed
on paper with percentiles from the CSSCD and specifying treatment assignment, and a graph of
the average growth velocity over three month inte rvals according to time from study entry and
treatment.  Growth will be analyzed with cubi c models (mixed model analysis of variance to
incorporate child-specific random effects, and in treatment group comparisons to account for
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-11 of 10-22   correlation of serial measurements) fit to each child.  Growth velocity will be estimated with the first
derivative with respect to time of the cubic models.  Curves will be plotted as each child’spercentiles for growth over time also. 
Neuro-development questionnaires will be administe red annually.   For t he evaluation of this
endpoint, we will compare the one-year cognitive  function between toddlers treated with HU and
toddlers treated with placebo. 
If a test-based, one-sided 99% confidence interval of the difference in mean Bayley score
at one-year does not cover zero, it will be recommended that the trial not continue and that HU notbe used as a treatment for very young children.  
10.2.3.7 Analysis of Acute Chest Syndrome, Splenic Sequestration and Serious,
Unexpected Adverse Events
The most important clinical events other than death and stroke are acute chest syndrome
(ACS) and splenic sequestration (as defined in Appendix F). Each very young child will be clinicallyevaluated repeatedly to determine if he/she has had acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestrationor a serious, unexpected adverse event in the c ourse of the two-year follow-up period.  The
proportion of very young children experiencing t hese adverse events will be compared according
to assigned treatment.  A one-sided test-based confidence interval (alpha = 0.005) will be used todetermine if very young children treated with HU have significantly higher frequencies than very
young children treated with placebo.  If the test-based, one-sided confidence interval does not coverzero, the Steering Committee proposes that the DSMB will consider all relevant information for thestudy and recommend that the clinical trial not continue and HU not be recommended as atreatment for very young children. 
10.2.3.8 Alert and Monitoring Levels
The local Primary Endpoint person will review the local CBC results to determine if an alert
is present in the data.  In addition, the Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory data and thelocal CBC data will be used by the MCC to monitor electronically for values exceeding alert levels.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-12 of 10-22   Alert laboratory values (Table 10-1) are indicators to the MCC and the Center staff that the patient
requires clinical follow-up and are distinct from toxicity values (Section 6.4).  The laboratory alertsare intended as possible indicators of adverse events such as splenic sequestration, aplastic crises,renal insufficiency, etc requiring treatment interruptions and further clinical evaluations orinterventions by the Center staff.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-14 of 10-22   If an alert level is detected, the Clinical Center will use the following guidelines for
responding to notification of an alert.  
1. The PEP will handle the alert in a straightforward manner when possible, or, more
likely, contact a Hematologist/Sickle Cell Specialist who is not directly connectedwith the BABY HUG Trial.
2. When indicated, the PEP and the Hematologist will develop a plan for a clinical
response to the alert value.  (For example: If the patient were severely neutropenicand febrile, the patient would be hospitalized for antibiotic treatment; if the patienthad > 20% decrease in hemoglobin level, the patient would be hospitalized and/ortransfused; if the patient met criteria for a splenic sequestration, the patient wouldbe hospitalized and/or transfused; etc.)
3. In the event that no non-BABY HUG Hematologist was available, the PEP would
need to contact the BABY HUG PI and discuss a course of action.  In doing so, thePEP would provide the PI only with “need to know” laboratory information.  In mostcases this would not create an unblinding problem because, for example: severeneutropenia may more likely be related to an acute viral infection rather than HUtoxicity; worse anemia might be caused by an aplastic crisis or splenic sequestrationrather than HU; splenic sequestration might or might not be related HU, etc.  In mostsituations, CBC values would not readily distinguish between treatment withhydroxyurea or placebo, although it is important that the MCV should not berevealed to the PI or BABY HUG Study Coordinators.  
4. In the ensuing management of the child, the bulk of the decision-making will be
carried out by the non-BABY HUG Hematologist and the PEP.  
5. The alert values for increased hematologic blood counts will not necessarily warrant
any immediate reaction by a clinician.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-15 of 10-22   10.2.4 Adverse Event Management
Spleen and Splenic Sequestration : Parents and caregivers should be instructed in
techniques of spleen palpation at each clinical visit and asked to feel for the child’s spleen daily.A newly palpable spleen or one more than 2 cm la rger than previously noted should be reported
immediately to the Clinical Center, and the patient should have a CBC and be examined by aphysician or nurse practitioner knowledgeable about sickle cell anemia.  In order to assure the
availability of steady state hemoglobin level info rmation, the Medical Coordinating Center will
provide each Primary Endpoint Person with a three-month rolling average of each patient’shemoglobin measurements.  The span of the spleen below the costal margin in the midclavicularand anterior axillary lines should be carefully m easured and recorded (in centimeters) at each
clinical visit. 
Splenic sequestration and splenomegaly as defined in Appendix F will be recorded on the
appropriate study form as outlined in the Manual of Operations.  
The management of splenic enlargement (admission, close outpatient follow-up or
transfusion) will be at the discretion of a non BABY HUG hematologist or unblinded physician ateach Clinical Center, but the following guidelines should be used whenever appropriate/possible.
On initial evaluation:1. Vital signs at presentation and q1-2 hours initially;2. Careful physical examination with asse ssment of pallor, measurement of spleen
size, presence of gallop, liver size; repeat examination q1-2 hours initially;
3. Labs including CBC, WBC differential, reticulocytes STAT. Type and crossmatch for
packed red blood cells (PRBCs);
4. If hypovolemic or with cardiovascular compromise, emergent infusion of intravenous
fluids (IVF) or PRBC to restore blood volume and maintain normal blood pressure.If normovolemic, start IVF at 1x maintenance.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-16 of 10-22   5. Admission unless stable over 4-8 hour period; close follow-up. 
On admission:1. Monitor heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry q2 hours until stable,
then q4h; 
2. Repeat CBC studies q4-12 hours;3. Maintain IVF at 1x maintenance;4. If febrile obtain blood culture and begin antibiotics, e.g. cefuroxime 50 mg/kg IV
every 8 hours;
5. Transfuse for evidence of hypotension, cardiovascular (CV) compromise, enlarging
tender spleen with 10-15 cc/kg over 4 hours.  If no CV compromise, transfuse if Hgb <5 gm/dL for stable splenomegaly regardlessof reticulocyte count; if Hgb> 5gm/dL transfuse at Principal Investigator discretion.Goal of transfusion is Hgb about 8 gm/dL, (splenic unloading of trapped RBC maycause an "overshoot phenomenon");
6. Supplemental oxygen until condition is stable (or acute episode resolves);7. Other clinical interventions, including antipyretics and analgesics, at Principal
Investigator discretion.
After the initial splenic sequestration event, the child will be monitored every 2 weeks. The
decision to continue PRBC transfusions and/or pr oceed to splenectomy, will be at the discretion
of the Principal Investigator.  However, the number of children undergoing splenectomy accordingto local indications will be tabulated in each treatment group.  Chronic transfusion therapy orsplenectomy, options that would remove the patient from study treatment or scintographicevaluation of the primary (spleen) endpoint, should be discussed with the Operations Committeeprior to implementation.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-17 of 10-22   Episodes of splenomegaly, splenic sequestrati on and associated measures will be tabulated
and compared according to HU and placebo group assignment.  If an excess of sequestrationevents is found in the HU group, the DSMB may consider stopping the trial.  
Renal
: Parents and caregivers will be educated about the importance of the kidney in
children with sickle cell disease, and reminded that the kidney is one of the special organs testedin the BABY HUG trial.  Infants should remain adequately hydrated at all times, as dehydration isdetrimental and could be injurious to the kidney.  Medications that have potential risk to the kidneysuch as prolonged use of aminoglycosides or high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,should be avoided.  Frequent urinary tract infections and hematuria will be documented during theBABY HUG trials, as these findings may reflect or cause renal damage.  
Painful Events (vaso-occlusive or dactylitis)
: Parents and caregivers will be educated about
dactylitis and painful events as part of their education about sickle cell disease.  They will be taughtto push fluids and use ibuprofen and/or acetaminophen with codeine at home.   Small supplies ofboth analgesics should be prescribed for home use at routine clinical visits.   They and caregiverswill be educated about dactylitis and painful events as part of their education about sickle celldisease.  The definition of a painful event is an event lasting two hours or more without obviouscause requiring the use of one or more doses of non-steroidal or narcotic pain medication.  Eventstreated as an outpatient (including emergency room) or requiring admission will be reported at thenext Clinical Center contact and included in data entered.  Events requiring admission will be
reported to the Medical Coordinating Center on appropriate form, and supporting documentscollected for central review.  
Acute Chest Syndrome, Aplastic Crisis, Priapism
:  All events meeting defined criteria will
be reported to the Medical Coordinating Center on Event Report Forms.  Clinical management,including the need for simple or exchange transfusi on will be at option of each Clinical Center.
Chronic transfusion therapy, an option that would remove the patient from study treatment, shouldbe discussed with the Operations Committee prior to implementation.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-18 of 10-22   Parents will be educated about signs of acute chest syndrome (fever, respiratory symptoms)
and aplastic crisis  (pallor, decreased energy) at regular clinic visits and asked to seek medicalattention should they occur.  Parents of ma le children will be taught about priapism, a prolonged
painful erection of the penis, and asked to seek medical attention, if the episode persists beyondtwo hours.  Briefer episodes of priapism will be recorded at the next clinic visit.  
Neurologic Events
: Families will be taught standardized definitions of TIA, stroke and other
neurologic events and reminded at each clinical contac t to call the Clinical Center immediately if
the child is not able to move arms or legs (unrelated to pain), has facial drooping or dysarthria.Each Clinical Center will promptly evaluate su ch patients.  The minimum evaluation must include
documentation of complete neurologic examination, preferably by a neurologist.  If the neurologistsuspects stroke or TIA clinically, neuroimaging including MRI/MRA must be done.  If a stroke isconfirmed, acute management will be at the preferenc e of the Clinical Center.  Transfusion timing
and technique (exchange or simple) will be at Clinical Center preference.  Chronic transfusiontherapy, an option that would remove the patient from study treatment, should be discussed withthe Operations Committee prior to implementation. 
If transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening is part of an individual Clinical Center’s standard
care, such testing should be offered to patients enrolled in BABY HUG as per usual practice.  TCDscreening is not yet universally available or standardized for children less than two years of age.If screening is performed and values are persistently elevated in children over 2 years of age, the
parents should be offered chronic transfusion therapy for the child in accordance with standard
practice at each Clinical Center.  Patients fo r whom chronic transfusion therapy is considered
should be discussed in advance with the Operations Committee.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-19 of 10-22   10.2.5 Laboratory Specimen and Data Collection
Blood specimens will be collected at designated follow-up visits by the Clinical Center staff.
A finger/heel stick or venipuncture may be performed for routine hematology evaluations. The bloodspecimens will be analyzed locally (and every six months specimens will be shipped to the
Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory by overnight courier).  Results of blood counts andother blood studies performed locally used to monitor for hydroxyurea toxicity (bone marrowdepression) will be available within 24 hours of collection.  Every six months, blood will be sent forevaluation of liver function (ALT and bilirubin) and for renal function (BUN/Creatinine).  The MCCwill obtain blood test results from the local laboratories daily and will review the studies to determinethe dose recommendation for hydroxyurea or placebo. Dosage adjustments or temporary treatmentstops will be performed for patients assigned to placebo so that patients and Clinical Center staffwill be blind to treatment assignments.  The P harmacy Distribution Center (PDC) will ship
hydroxyurea and placebo supplies to the Clinic Center for each patient on a regular basis.  Nopatient can receive a new drug prescription until a blood specimen has been analyzed locally.Blood specimen containers and mailers will be prov ided by the Hematology and Biochemistry Core
Laboratory.  The MCC will notify Clinical Centers within 48 hours of receipt of blood count to issuedirections to stop study treatment (either hydroxyurea or placebo).  It will be the responsibility of theClinical Center to notify patients of stop orders.  
10.3 PATIENT COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT
The major obstacle to successfully completing follow-up procedures in BABY HUG will be
ensuring adherence with the study protocol, and in particular, study visits.  The major responsibilityfor this task rests with each Clinical Center.  MCC staff will assist the Clinical Center staff withschedules for follow-up, identification of patients whose follow-up is interrupted, and notification ofoutstanding forms/data.  If a patient misses three consecutive appointments, this patient will beconsidered inactive in the study, and study treat ment will be temporarily stopped.  The patient will
become active again and resume study treatments only if the Clinical Center Principal Investigator
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-20 of 10-22   can explain the missed visits and provide a plan for more complete participation in the future.  Extra
effort will be made to increase Protocol adherence for any patient who misses four or more visits(not consecutive) in a six-month period.  
Strategies to increase contact with BABY HUG patients may include:1. providing comprehensive care for management of the complications of sickle cell
anemia, including hydroxyurea therapy;
2. maintaining availability through telephone contact with the patients’ parents;3. promoting accessible, positive contact wi th the Patient/Family advocate at any time
during the study (see Section 3.1 and Exhibit 3-1); 
4. maintaining up-to-date, accessible records of BABY HUG patient enrollees and
locator information including home address, telephone numbers;
5. fostering supportive relationship with BABY HUG families; 6. providing transportation reimbursement and meal vouchers ($30.00 per visit); and
7. providing assistance with telephone serv ice ($30.00 per month) or providing pager
system access for families.
If a patient leaves the study early (before 24 months of treatment) for any reason, every
attempt should be made to secure the exit studies at that time.  The studies in order of priority areTc
99m sulfur colloid liver-spleen scan, blood specimen collection (for pitted cell count, and fetal
hemoglobin determination), and abdominal ultrasound.  If the patient plans to move to an areaserved by another BABY HUG Clinical Center, t he family should be offered the opportunity to
transfer care to the other Clinical Center.  If they accept, the child will not need to become inactivein the study.  Subsequent follow-up and evaluati ons will be at the new Clinical Center and
reimbursement will be transferred to the new Clinical Center.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-21 of 10-22   10.4 LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP
10.4.1 Introduction
At the end of the study treatment each family will be asked to agree to return for long-term
follow-up visits. If NHLBI and NICHD cannot fund this long-term follow-up, the investigators planto follow their subjects at the respective clinical sites for at least ten years.  Hydroxyurea therapyis part of the accepted management of adults, adolescents and school age children with severecourses from their sickle cell disease.  Two limit ed studies observed no additional toxicity from the
use of hydroxyurea by children from 6 months to 5 years of age for periods up to 4 years.  However,
large numbers of persons with sickle cell disease of any age have not been followed for longperiods of time (decades) after initiation of hydroxyurea therapy. 
Although a survival advantage has been suggested for severely involved adult patients who
took hydroxyurea in the MSH, it is unclear if the same benefit will occur in children, particularlythose prescribed the medication before the onset of a severe clinical course.  Further, children mustcontinue to grow and develop toward adulthood.  Problems from early use of hydroxyurea might
only become evident years after the completion of study treatment in BABY HUG.  Thus, veryyoung children with sickle cell anemia must be carefully assessed longitudinally for all potentialtoxicities, including oncogenic potential of this  drug, to accurately determine the risks of
hydroxyurea use.
If benefit is demonstrated from early hydroxyur ea therapy, it will be important to determine
how long that benefit continues.  Thus, clinical ascertainment and structured evaluation should bea part of the long term follow-up of this unique group of patients.  Clinical care after the two-yearstudy treatment might or might not include use of hydroxyurea regardless of initial random treatmentassignment.  An additional five to ten years of follow-up will provide important information to
physicians and parents of very young children with sickle cell anemia, with the goal to follow thesesubjects for 5 to 10 years after the end of their participation in the randomized clinical trial if theirparents and the subjects are willing.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/CH AP-10.wpd —  8/09 Page 10-22 of 10-22   10.4.2 Follow-Up Data Collection
Data will be collected for all BABY HUG patients whose families agree to continue in follow-
up.  A separate protocol and consent form will be developed for long-term follow-up.  Consent willbe obtained after the end of treatment (the full, planned two-year course or earlier termination) inBABY HUG.  If NHLBI and NICHD cannot fund this long-term follow-up, the investigators plan tofollow their subjects at the respective clinical sites for at least ten years.  All families would beencouraged to participate in this portion of the study.  Participating families will remain in follow-upeven if they decline specific follow-up evaluations.
10.4.3 Follow-Up Procedures
Standardized data collection forms will be submitted by the BABY HUG follow-up
coordinators at the times specified using the BABY HUG Internet data collection system.  Even iffamilies decline to participate in specific follow-up testing or move from the area, the coordinatorwill attempt to contact the family at intervals indi cated to obtain information on clinical events (major
events and unusual events), growth, height, weight and head circumference, vital status and useof hydroxyurea.  With the family’s consent, this will include information from other health careproviders.
10.5 DEBRIEFING CONTACTS
After final BABY HUG treatment data have been collected and final reports on treatment
results prepared for presentation or submitted for publication, each patient’s family will bescheduled for a debriefing contact.  The families will be informed of their individual treatments, theprimary results of BABY HUG and the recommendations of the investigators.  At the end of long-term follow-up, the families will be informed of the results of long-term follow-up and anyreconsideration of the recommendations of the investigators.

CHAPTER 11
CLOSE-OUT PROCEDURES  
11.1 OVERVIEW
Assuming no early stop of the study for reason of either efficacy or safety, at 24 months of
randomized study treatment for each patient, individual patients will have study treatment
discontinued and their families will be asked to agree to return for visits for the duration of BABYHUG to allow collection of information on each child’s growth, health and well-being up to fiveyears.  After the last patient enrolled has completed 24 months of randomized treatment, allpatients’ families (i.e., Feasibility and Safety Pilot St udy and all other patients’ families) will be given
information on their children’s assigned treatments and on the findings of the study, as will bedetermined by the Steering Committee, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, the National Heart,Lung, and Blood Institute and the NICHD.  11.2 DURATION OF RANDOMIZED, BLINDED STUDY TREATMENT
Patients will be followed on randomly assigned study treatment for 24 months.  At 24
months, patients’ randomized, blinded study treatm ent will be discontinued.  Patients will continue
being monitored for major medical events (see Section 10.2.1) through their regular pediatrichematology care provider, who is expected to be in the BABY HUG Clinical Center, affiliated with
the BABY HUG Clinical Center, or by previous agr eement the child’s regular pediatrician.  If the
patient changes primary provider, Clinical Center staff will maintain contact with the family and if
necessary through the family with the new primar y provider.  The discontinuation of study treatment
at 24 months on study and the need to maintain contact up to the common termination will beexplained to the parents at the time that informed consent is obtained at study entry.  Theexplanation will be repeated in the course of the study and at the individual patient’s 24-month visit.Contact with the family will be maintained to assu re that monitoring for medical events will continue,
and that the family can return for final close- out when study results will be made available.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-11.wpd —  8/09 Page 11-2 of 11-3  Patients’ families and physicians will not be unblinded at the 24-month end of treatment visit.
Neither blinded study treatment nor open-label hydroxyurea will be provided by BABY HUG for
enrolled patients after 24 months.  An assessment of the use of hydroxyurea for sickle cell anemiain this age group will await final study results and a review of those results by the BABY HUG Dataand Safety Monitoring Board, Steering Committee, the NICHD and the National Heart, Lung, andBlood Institute (NHLBI).  Labelling for use of hydroxyurea in this age group will depend on thedetermination of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if a supplemental New DrugApplication (NDA) is submitted.  11.3 DEBRIEFING CONTACTS
There will be two debriefing contacts.  After final BABY HUG treatment data have been
collected and final reports on treatment results prepared for presentation or submitted forpublication, each patient’s family will be scheduled for a debriefing contact.  The families will beinformed of their individual treatments, the primary results of BABY HUG and the recommendationsof the investigators.  In a second debriefing contact at the end of long-term follow-up, the familieswill be informed of the results of long-term follow-up and any reconsideration of therecommendation of the investigators.  11.4 FINAL STUDY DATA AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS
Data processing and analysis of final study data will proceed on a “time-of-the-essence”
basis.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review the final data (see Section 4.4.4) includingthe specified analysis for efficacy and safety at a planned final meeting.  A final, consensusrecommendation from the DSMB, Steering Committee, NICHD and NHLBI will be shared first withthe study patients’ families (at which time they will also be informed of their assigned treatments).
This recommendation will be made public as soon as possible thereafter.  
Submission of final BABY HUG data to the FDA will proceed under the terms of the
Investigational New Drug (IND) application filed by the NHLBI at the start of BABY HUG.  In theevent that HU is found to be safe and efficacious for infants and very young children with sickle cell
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-11.wpd —  8/09 Page 11-3 of 11-3  anemia, study investigators, the NICHD and the NHLBI will support a submission to the FDA for
labeling for this new indication.  In the event HU is not found to be safe and efficacious, establishedprocedures for submission of the study data in a final IND report to the FDA will be followed in anorderly fashion.
The data closure upon which the determination of HU’s safety and efficacy, if any, is made
will form the basis of the final consensus reco mmendation and informing patients’ families of the
results.  A final data closure, based on cleaned and complete data reporting, will be available forthe submission to the FDA, final archival and databank  studies.  Clinical Centers will implement the
following procedures for finalization of study data.  All queries for data clean-up including resolutionof forms/procedures expected but not completed, as determined by the MCC, will be addressedwithin two months of the last patient visit.  Clin ical Centers will be responsible for archiving records
that document reported events and specified outco mes.  The MCC will archive all electronic study
data.  Data from the Core Laboratories, Endpoints Evaluation Committees and medical recordsserve as the definitive sources for patient outcomes in the study.  
Archival of central source data, including Core Laboratory results, will be consistent with
requirements for a study conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) Exemption andsponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  Storage of frozen andpreserved specimens will be maintained according to  the requirements of NHLBI subcontracts.  The
MCC will archive study data in accordance with FDA guidance and National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute requirements.  Public data files will be made available according to National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute policy.  The NHLBI will finalize the disposition of the IND report(s) according totheir agreement with the FDA under the IND.

CHAPTER 12
CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL
12.1 OVERVIEW
BABY HUG is a randomized, double blind clinical trial.  Study procedures will be designed
and implemented so as to optimize data capture and assure the highest level of quality for thescientific goals of the study while minimizing inconvenience to patients and inefficiencies in theperformance of the study.  Appropriate mechanism s will be implemented to maintain the study on
schedule, provide tools and aids to Clinical Centers and other participating units in the performanceof their activities on behalf of the study and ultimately arrive at a study data set that will provide theanswers to the study primary objectives and key questions.  Patient safety is the overridingconcern, while maintaining the integrity of the study, and consideration of the family’s efforts in theirchild’s participation.  Appropriate checks and m onitoring systems will be implemented so that no
study patient or his/her family experience any  untoward outcome or unnecessary difficulty.  
12.2 TIMELINE
The study timeline is presented in Appendix D.  Planning and study design, development
of the Protocol and Manual of Operations are scheduled for September 2000 through August 2003,including review of the Protocol and model Informed Consent Form by the Data and Safety
Monitoring Board and the participating Institutional Review Boards (IRB).  Meetings of the SteeringCommittee and Data and Safety Monitoring Board are scheduled throughout the first year to meetthese goals.  
Recruitment and enrollment for the Feasibility and Safety Pilot Study began in the fall of
2003.  In January 2005, the DSMB authorized immediate continuation of recruitment following theFeasibility and Safety Pilot Study with a goal of 200 patients total.  Follow-up will continue through2008.  Patients will be taken off study treatment  as they complete two years of randomized
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-2 of 12-16  treatment, but will continue to be followed through 2008.  Final study data will be collected and
cleaned for the next two months, and main study results will be prepared as rapidly as possible forreview first with the DSMB, then with the invest igators, then with the patients, and then with the
public.  
12.3 PLANNING AND STUDY DESIGN
The Steering Committee will meet regularly during the first six months of the planning and
design period (first year) to write the Protocol and Consent Form.  These will be presented to theNHLBI-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Boar d.  Following suggestions for revisions, the
Protocol and Consent Forms will be submitted to i ndividual IRBs for approval.  Model consent forms
will in many instances need to be modified to include local IRB requirements.  Individual institutions’
informed consent forms will be reviewed by the Chairm an of the DSMB to assure that they conform
to the model consent form and they do not allow policies or practices which may be incompatiblewith BABY HUG.  
12.4 TRAINING, CERTIFICATION AND START-UP
After the Protocol and Model Informed Consent Form are approved by the DSMB and the
Protocol and individual institutional consent form s are approved by the local IRBs, the study will be
ready to begin data collection.  A Manual of Operat ions will be written to give specific performance
directions.  Training of Clinical Center staff in procedures of data collection and study procedureswill be conducted by Medical Coordinating C enter staff (MCC).  Training will include:
• completion of study forms• data entry over the Internet • maintenance of study patient data files• completion of data cleaning procedures including response to edit queries• collection, labeling and processing of central laboratory specimens• patient orientation and information 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-3 of 12-16  • obtaining informed consent
• conducting eligibility assessment• the use of the Automated Telephone Randomization System (ATRS)• retrieving initial and continuing prescription recommendations as transmitted over
the Internet and coordinated with the Clinical Center (Investigational) Pharmacy todispense study treatments to the patients
• conduct of clinic visits including assessment of patient compliance.  Clinical Center staff who will complete study  forms or otherwise provide study data will be
certified after successful completion of the training in these areas.  Each will receive a uniquecertification number that will be entered on every study form completed, along with a signature anddate of data collection.  This certification number identifies the individual who is responsible for theaccuracy and completeness of the data collected.  
Clinical staff who will be conducting special evaluations will be trained in BABY HUG data
collection procedures.  Standardized methods for data collection for special evaluations (e.g.,neurological examinations or neuropsychological evaluations) have been set by specialistsdesignated by the Steering Committee.  Clinical staff will be STE certified and given studycertification numbers that will identify the evaluations for which they are responsible.  
Members of adjudication panels have been given detailed instructions on the adjudication
process and have completed several sample cases designed to test the adjudication process.  TheMCC prepared these cases in collaboration with designated specialists (e.g., for radionuclidescanning).  
Clinical Center Principal Investigators and coordinators must attend at least one training
session and successfully complete the certification process, which will include satisfactorycompletion of practice procedures and data collection with patients.  Training is conducted andcertification is issued by the Medical Coordinating Center staff after review with the StudyChairman, Vice-Chairman and Project Officer.

12.5.1 Introduction
The Medical Coordinating Center serves BABY HUG as the repository of all forms,
documents and minutes.  Clinical Centers will use the Medical Coordinating Center Internet Data
Entry System to send to the Medical Coordinating C enter data in electronic format from the original
of each BABY HUG form, which will be completed and kept in a manner acceptable for regulatorypurposes in Clinical Center files.  All BABY HUG data collection forms and transmittal lists for bloodspecimens and other materials (e.g., images) shipped in the course of BABY HUG data collectionwill be sent to the Medical Coordinating Center via Internet Data Entry.  Medical CoordinatingCenter staff will monitor the arrival of data and transmittal lists to identify form and proceduredelinquencies based on appointment schedules and anticipated study forms.  Medical CoordinatingCenter staff will monitor Core Laboratory specimen receipt dates for specimen delinquencies basedon appointment schedules, expected specimen collecti on, and reports of specimens received in the
Core Laboratories.  
12.5.2  Receipt and Inventory
Medical Coordinating Center staff will receive,  log in and store all Internet Data Entry
transmissions.  Clinical Centers should send specimens directly to the Core Laboratories withInternet Data Entry of transmittal lists to the Medical Coordinating Center.  Data from the ClinicalCenters will be automatically linked to the date of receipt.  Transmittal lists are compared with data
received from the Clinical Center and data transmitted from the Core Laboratories.  Anydiscrepancies between crucial patient identifiers (e.g., name code, ID number or date of study
entry/follow-up visit) that Medical Coordinating Center staff find will be brought to the Clinical
Center’s attention immediately by e-mail.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-5 of 12-16  12.5.3  Expected Receipt of Forms
The expected dates for receipt at the Medical Coordinating Center of the BABY HUG
patients' form data will be:  one week after each visit for eligibility screening data; one week aftertheir study entry visit for Treatment Initiation Forms; two days after clinic visit for Core LaboratoryReports and Missing Specimen Lists; two weeks for Follow-Up Visit Forms or Missed Visit Forms;two weeks for Clinical Event Report Forms; and one week for Imaging Study Forms.  Data not sent
to the Medical Coordinating Center or specimens not sent to the Core Laboratory within two weeksof the expected date will be denoted as delinquent.  
Guidance to assist the questioner in obtaining the information (QxQs) for each of the forms
is posted on the Website for ease of use by the Clinical Center staff.  Practice with data entry anddiscussion of the fine points of data entry for neuropsychological evaluations have made clear tothe Clinical Center staff the extent of effort necessary for intelligent, single entry of the BABY HUGdata.  The Internet Data Entry System has been developed to accommodate timely data entry and
preliminary edit at the time of data entry so that the time critical information necessary to keep theBABY HUG patients on study treatments and adequately monitored for safety is available.  Printback capability for Clinical Center verification and sign off as index document is provided by the
Internet Data Entry system.  The system allows for data entry at a rate of 3600 characters per hour(most people key at this rate easily).  At this rate, 200 binary (or single field) variables can beentered in three minutes.  The regular follow-up visit form (Form 31), has 131 keystrokes to the formand takes approximately 1.5 minutes to key.  The it ems entered from a form are registered in the
central data base immediately after entering the data.  Critical forms such as the Form 31 must beentered on a more timely basis than other forms.  In the event of a Clinical Center burdenmanagement problem the MCC recommends that a tw o-tiered system for data entry be established.
Critical forms such as the Form 31 will be entered first and lower priority forms will be entered when
more time is available for the coordinator (or when another designated data entry person isavailable) to enter the lower priority forms.  To cover for the possibility that BABY HUG Clinical
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-6 of 12-16  Center staff are unable to transmit time critical information because of equipment failure (e.  g.  ,
the server at the Medical Coordinating Center or the server at the Clinical Center is down), a
dedicated fax line in the BABY HUG Coordinating area has been established.  This fax line is usedfor BABY HUG transmissions only.  Clinical Center staff will fax their completed, time critical formsto the Medical Coordinating Center where they  will be processed electronically, or if need be,
manually to maintain the processing of time critical information.  Information that is not time critical(e.g., annual neurology exams) can be keyed by C linical Center staff when full functionality is
restored.  BABY HUG Clinical Centers that par ticipate in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
already have experience with Internet data entry and note that this backup plan offers a level ofsecurity and assurance that is not available in other studies that delay Clinical Center data
transmissions until all systems are functioning and data processing staff are available following anyinterruptions.  In the event of national emergencies (e.g., concerted attack on the Internet,communication systems or air transportation), cont ingency plans will be written so that whatever
communications and specimen transportation systems that can be used will be.  In the short term
if fax lines are working, all critical information may be sent by fax to the Medical Coordinating Centerfor data entry.  Disruptions of specimen transportation may require short term stop-ordersinterrupting individual study habits for brief periods until central safety monitoring can bereestablished.  Long term disruptions will have to be addressed with reconsideration of design.Long term failure of Internet data entry will also be addressed with negotiated  design changes suchas installation of distributed systems in the C linical Centers or central data entry of forms
transmitted to the Medical Coordinating Center by the fastest available method (e.g., fax or courier).In the event that certain other aspects of data entry are found to be highly burdensome to thecoordinators, they will be discussed on the coordinators’ bi-monthly conference calls and theirconcerns presented to the Operations Committee and as appropriate to the Steering Committeeand addressed by the Medical Coordinating Center and other members of the Steering Committee.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-7 of 12-16  12.6 MONITORING PROGRESS AND PERFORMANCE
a. Clinical Centers
Clinical Centers will be monitored indivi dually and in the aggregate for unexplained lag in
recruitment, missed visits, missed blood specimen collection, missed scheduled procedures,missing expected forms, agreement between treatment dose recommended and dose dispensed,
study treatment not accounted for, medical ev ents required to be reported, and routine adverse
events.  Weekly lists of expected visits, blood specimens, and scheduled procedures, will be posted
on the web site for each enrolled patient.  Forms and procedures expected but not reported withinthree days and treatment status not reported within one day will be noted on the website and added
to a cumulative delinquency report.  Some delinquencies may be corrected at a later date.  Otherdelinquent information may not be recoverable after the critical time period has elapsed.Unrecoverable delinquent data will be counted in summary reports as Protocol deviations for thetime-critical aspect.  For instance, if a stop or der is issued but is not reported as having been
implemented for three days, the database will show the day it was reported implemented, but the
time-lag will remain on record as a minor Protoc ol deviation.  Certain events such as adverse
events and stop orders not implemented will not be allowed to continue unresolved.  The Study
Chairman will be notified within 48 hours of a stop order not implemented or serious adverse
event(s).  
1. Eligibility 
Status regarding eligibility criteria will be entered into the database for all consented
patients.  Their progress will be posted daily on the w eb site until they either are disqualified or are
fully qualified.  If they have a reversible eligibility disqualification, this will be noted.  Aggregatereports will be generated weekly throughout recruitment showing, according to Clinical Center, the
numbers of patients who are eligible, those disqualified and why, those qualified, those randomizedand enrolled, and those in follow-up.  Steering Committee members will monitor these accruing
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-8 of 12-16  reports and make recommendations to impr ove performance where needed or recommend
changes in procedures.    2.  Follow-Up Clinic Visits 
At every follow-up visit, the form will require a report of specific events (see Chapter 4) and
any unusual conditions or occurrences (write-in).  The Clinical Center investigator will be requiredto review this and provide an assessment of whet her an adverse event has occurred.  Since this
is an IND monitored study, the usual definitions of  adverse event may be implemented, such as the
occurrence of death or a life-threatening condition or an event that causes or prolongshospitalization.  
3.  Study Treatments 
Monitoring study treatments will be one of the most  important activities of the study.  Study
forms will require complete accounting of study treatments to verify that each patient received
his/her correct bottle with the correct dose, and that treatment was administered daily.  If scheduled,blood specimens must be collected for a patient to continue taking prescribed study treatment.  Ifblood results (CBCs) do not arrive from the loca l laboratory at the Medical Coordinating Center
when expected, a stop-treatment order will be i ssued immediately and automatically.  At every
study visit treatments are expected to be retu rned, and they will be assessed for compliance by
measurement of residual treatment returned.  Treatment errors will be reported to the StudyChairman immediately and will be counted cumulatively, if they represent major Protocol violations.
Study policies regarding remedial action on r epeated treatment regimen violations will be
implemented.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-9 of 12-16  4.  Monitoring the Clinical Centers
Medical Coordinating Center staff will produc e recruitment reports weekly during the
recruitment phase from the data entered from forms submitted for each entered patient.  A
sufficiently low recruitment performance will be res ponded to by a site visit from the Study Chairman
or Vice-Chairman, Medical Coordinating Center staff, and NHLBI and NICHD staff.  Failure toimprove performance after such a site visit may result in an end to support for recruitment in aClinical Center.  
On a bi-weekly basis, the Operations Committ ee (Study Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Medical
Coordinating Center staff, Coordinator representatives, Steering Committee representatives andNHLBI and NICHD staff) meet by conference call to review recruitment goals and Protocolviolations reported for each Clinical Center.  Protocol exceptions for eligible patients will beconsidered by the Operations Committee and may be granted as long as study integrity is notcompromised.  If the committee arrives at a recommendation to grant an exception to the Protocol,the local IRB will be notified and the exception will be conducted in accord with the local IRB’sStandard Operating Procedures.  Clinical Centers will be notified of minor violations withsuggestions for remedial action.  Major violations will result in a site visit by the Study Chairman orVice-Chairman, Medical Coordinating Center staff and an NHLBI and NICHD staff member.  
At each scheduled Steering Committee meeting, a report of progress toward
accomplishment of study goals will be presented, both for BABY HUG as a whole and for individualClinical Centers.  These reports will include certification status, number of eligible patientsidentified, number of patients enrolled of those identified, completeness of scheduled visit datacollection, completeness of specimen collection, completeness of clinical event reporting,adherence to Protocol and results of actions taken to improve compliance.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-10 of 12-16  5.  Site Visits
Clinical Centers will be visited during the study to assure quality of data collection.  Medical
Coordinating Center staff will generate computer pr intouts of form data for comparison to Clinical
Center form copies and to actual patient charts.  
If a Clinical Center is under consideration for being discontinued from treatment of patients
in BABY HUG, the Study Chairman or Vice-Chairm an, Medical Coordinating Center staff and
NHLBI and NICHD Project Officers will visit the Clinical Center and provide a site visit report to theData and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for recommendation on final action.  
Clinical Centers with the greatest difficulty in meeting proposed goals for recruitment may
also be site visited, and recommendations for improvement made, with a report to the DSMB.  
b. Central FacilitiesThe MCC will monitor routinely receipt of expected reports from the Core Laboratories and
treatments shipped from the Pharmacy Distribution Center.  Any expected blood result that is notreceived will be tracked by MCC staff by te lephone with the Clinical Center and the Core
Laboratory.  Because many courier shipments can be traced on the Internet, there should be a
rapid resolution to any questions about shipments lost in transit.  
Quality assurance programs will be established to monitor the results from the Core
Laboratories.  In addition, the Core Laboratories will be chosen for their high level internal qualityassurance programs.  Hematology and Biochemistry Core Laboratory values will be monitored bothfor range and for c onsistency with the child’s laboratory measurement history.  Values that are
deemed “alert” values will be discussed immediately between MCC staff and Hematology andBiochemistry Core Laboratory staff.  If the value is confirmed, the alert process will be implemented.Table 7-3 shows the lab alert values.  
Treatments dispensed by the Clinical Center (Investigational) Pharmacies will be checked
for agreement with the treatment kit number assigned to the child, as well as the recommendedprescription.  The Clinical Center Principal Investigator will be notified immediately of any
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-11 of 12-16  discrepancies.  Confirmed discrepancies will be tallied cumulatively.  Pharmacies accruing
unacceptable numbers of discrepancies will be repor ted to the Study Chairman for immediate
action.  
c. Endpoint Evaluation CommitteesMembers of endpoint evaluation committees will receive appropriate guidelines for the
purpose of performing study assessments.  They w ill first adjudicate sample cases.  During the
conduct of the study, various methods of quality assurance will be implemented including maskedduplicate case reviews, both within-reviewer (reader) and between-reviewers (readers).  Resultsof these reviews will be tabulated according to Clinical Center and reviewer.  Between and withinreviewer agreement rates will be available to the DSMB.  The schedule of the reviews or readingsof adverse event reports and images will be monitored and reported routinely to the SteeringCommittee.  Reviewers or readers who fall behind in their assigned study work will be contactedby the Study Chairman and MCC Principal Investigator to assess the situation and propose a planof action.  Repeated failure to perform may result in replacement of a reviewer (reader).  
d.  Medical Coordinating Center
1.  Randomization
The randomization schedule will be devised to assure the appropriate blocking and balance
of treatment groups for clinically important clinic al patient characteristics and within each Clinical
Center.  Two schedules will be devised for use: one for Clinical Center staff to practice using the
ATRS, and one that will be the final study randomization schedule.  The final schedule will also beanalyzed to assure that balance is achieved by age and Clinical Centers, and that there are nounusual sequential runs of treatment assignments within any Clinical Center.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-12 of 12-16  2.  Laboratory Results, Prescrip tion Recommendations and Record of
Treatments 
MCC staff will develop computer programs to take into account each patient’s baseline
laboratory values, new laboratory data and recent laboratory values.  These programs will identifyextreme outliers for possible safety alerts (s ee Table 7-3), and will be used to assess whether
changes from baseline or recent results are unusual.  Outlier results will be verified and reviewedif necessary with the Study Chairman.  Extreme values that constitute an adverse event will bemanaged according to specified procedures.  Abnormal values that do not exceed levels will be
used in formulating treatment recommendations .  The system will follow the dose adjustment
Protocol (see Chapter 6) to make the appropriate dose recommendation for the next 2- or 4-weekperiod.  Dose recommendations will be reviewed along with the attending laboratory results by thedesignated medical staff at the MCC.  Confir med treatment recommendations will be forwarded to
the Clinical Center electronically (e-mail or Website).  
All occurrences of misreported laboratory results will be cumulated and reported, as well as
all alert values, and routine dose changes.  
MCC staff will review accruing information about reported toxicities and their resolution and
consequent dose adjustments to see if the frequency of adjustments  is reasonable or if patientsare being stopped too frequently.  Tabulations of how much of the time patients are not maintainedon assigned treatment will also be reviewed.  Placebo stops and adjustments will be compared for
similarity to the hydroxyurea group to help maintain the blind.  
3.  Data entry and database quality assurance
Because data entry will be from the remote site s, data quality assurance will derive from site
visits that will include complete audits of the data against the medical record.  Periodically copiesof original forms may be requested from Clinical Centers for independent data entry andcomparison in the Medical Coordinating Center to check the quality of Clinical Center data entry.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-13 of 12-16  12.7 ROUTINE REPORTING
Routine reports for the Steering Committee will be prepared on: eligibility and enrollment,
by Clinical Center and overall; recruitment ex pected versus actual; study forms and specimens,
expected and received; unusable result s, alert values, values requiri ng verification, values modified,
values deleted, and stop orders issued on the basis of unavailable results; treatment adjustments,dispensing, return of and compliance with study treatments; special studies expected andperformed or not performed; endpoints evaluation; committee performance (e.g., case reports andimages reviewed and cases pending); and adverse ev ents by Clinical Center and overall.  
12.8 SAFETY AND PATIENT MONITORING
a. Central Review of Laboratory Results
A Medical Coordinating Center physician will confirm all toxicities and alert values and
review individual cases and tabulations of toxicities and alert values. 
b. Adverse Events Any adverse event, regardless of attribution to  study treatment or sickle cell disease will be
reported to the Medical Coordinating Center.  Any event meeting the definition of a serious adverse
event will be reported to the DSMB Chair, Executive Secretary of DSMB, the NHLBI and NICHDProject Officers and to the FDA.  The Clinical C enters will report all occurrences of serious adverse
events that occur at their institution according to their local IRB requirements.  
c.  Data and Safety Monitoring Reports and MeetingsThe DSMB will meet regularly to review cumulative study data.  In addition to the routine
performance reports, they will review data according to the assigned groups.  Interim review of theprimary and secondary endpoint data with statistical testing will be presented according to theinterim monitoring plan (see Section 4.4.5).  All cases of adverse events and laboratory alert valueswill be reviewed in detail.  The DSMB will make recommendations to the NHLBI and NICHDregarding recruitment goals, study performance, and patient safety.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-14 of 12-16  d.  Unblinding
In the event of an emergency that the Clinical Center Principal Investigator or that a local
treating physician considers knowledge of the BABY HUG patient’s treatment assignment isnecessary for determining patient management, the Pr incipal Investigator or treating physician will
telephone the BABY HUG Study Chairman to discuss the need for unblinding.  The Study Chairmanwill be able to use the Automated Telephone Response System (ATRS) to obtain unblindinginformation 24 hours/day as necessary.  
12.9 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
Staff of Clinical Centers, Core Laboratories, Endpoint Evaluation Committee members,
Medical Coordinating Center personnel and any other  personnel who implement the study Protocol,
manage patients on behalf of the study, report, manage or analyze study data share inresponsibility for patient safety and the scientific integrity of BABY HUG.  With the assistance ofoversight provided by the NHLBI and NICHD through the Data and Safety Monitoring Board andthe local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), all matters of Protocol implementation and datareporting will subject to review.  Procedures for monitoring of scientific integrity and qualityassurance in multicenter trials have been promulgated by the Society for Clinical Trials (Knatterudet al, 1998).  Violations of the Protocol will be investigated promptly to maintain patient safety.  
The steps to prevent Major Protocol Violations or reporting of incorrect data are:  training
and certification, site visits, audits, statistical checks, edit checks, and careful follow-up of anyabnormalities that may result in clinic-wide treatment stop and suspension of randomization.  
Data collection by non-certified personnel w ill be prevented by training and certification
(including education that misuse of certification number is a scientific integrity issue), detected byreview of study forms all of which require signature, certification number and date, and if found,acted upon by clinic-wide audit; deletion of data found erroneous; and requirement of assurancesand a plan from the Clinical Center Principal Investigator to keep the problem(s) from recurring. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-15 of 12-16  Failure to provide a Patient/Family advocate will be prevented by training and certification,
detected by review of initial and follow-up Patien t/Family advocate forms, site visits, and data audit,
and acted upon with clinic-wide treatment stop and suspension of randomization.  
Requesting enrollment (randomization) for a child who does not meet eligibility criteria will
be prevented by training and certification, detected on checking eligibility data collection forms, andacted upon with suspension of randomized study treatment and randomization.  
Requesting enrollment (randomization) for a child on whom informed consent has not been
obtained, or whom the Patient/Family advocate has not found the family in agreement will be
prevented by training and certification, detected on site visit, and acted upon with suspension ofrandomized study treatment and randomization.  
Failure to act to implement a treatment stop order within 72 hours will be prevented by
training and certification, detected by review of study treatment data collection forms andPatient/Family advocate follow-up and acted upon wi th suspension of randomized study treatment
and randomization.  
Failure to report a serious adverse event (Section 10.2.3) within 24 hours of learning of
event will be prevented by training and certificati on, detected on review of study treatment data
collection forms and Patient/Family advocate follow-up, and acted upon with suspension ofrandomized study treatment and randomization.  
12.10 IRB APPROVAL
Clinical Centers will submit the BABY HUG Protocol and the Informed Consent Form as
modified for use to the Local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for initial review before any patientcan be screened for BABY HUG.  Clinical Centers will submit local updates to the IRB for annualreview, Protocol amendments and study-wide r eports such as DSMB recommendations and any
other information that may be requested by the IRB.   Clinical Centers will comply with local IRB
requirements regarding reporting serious adverse event s, whether or not related to study treatment.
Clinical Centers will provide the Medical Coordi nating Center with documentation of approval from
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-12.wpd —  8/09 Page 12-16 of 12-16  the IRB.  The approved local consent form will be sent to the NHLBI and submitted to the DSMB
Chair for review to assure that it conforms to the requirements for protection of human subjects.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-13.wpd —  8/09 Page 13-6 of 13-9  tions.  The DSMB reviewed the initial study Prot ocol and will approve all changes made to it during
the course of the study, review Data and Safety Monitoring Reports, and make recommendationson major Protocol changes and/or early release of study results.  The Operations Committee willreport any unexpected or unusual findings to the DSMB which may be convened ad
 hoc for a
special review of BABY HUG any time circumstanc es so warrant.  The DSMB will meet at least
yearly, to review the annual BABY HUG report.  It will review safety as the trial progresses, willevaluate treatment efficacy at pre-specified interi m time points for possible early termination of the
study, and will review any proposals to discontinue treatment of patients in a Clinical Center
because of non-adherence to the Protocol.  
DSMB meetings begin with an Executive Session at which summary notes are taken by a
representative of the NHLBI.  Other BABY HUG Steering Committee members do not participatein the Executive Session.  The Study Chairman,  Vice-Chairman, Medical Coordinating Center
Principal Investigator and invited BABY HUG investigators join the DSMB for other parts of theagenda until the presentation of study outcome data.  The BABY HUG Clinical Center investigatorsare excused for the study outcome presentation and discussion.  Medical Coordinating Center staff
take summary notes of the DSMB meeting fr om the end of the Executive Session through the
presentation of study outcomes and discussion.  At the end of the presentation of study outcomesand discussion, the Medical Coordinating Center st aff are excused for the DSMB to meet in a
second Executive Session.  The NHLBI representative is responsible for recording summary notesof the second Executive Session and the recommendations of the DSMB.  At the end of the secondExecutive Session, the BABY HUG investigators rejoin the DSMB for a preliminary review of DSMBrecommendations.  The NHLBI Executive Secretary of DSMB provides the summary notes andrecommendations of the DSMB, in an expeditious and timely manner, to the Medical Coordinating
Center.  The Medical Coordinating Center communicates these recommendations to the BABYHUG Steering Committee.  At the next DSMB meeting, the DSMB votes to accept (or revise) thesummary notes recording transactions of the meeting and recommendations.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-1 of 14-6  PEDIATRIC HYDROXYUREA PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL (BABY HUG) PROTOCOL
CHAPTER 14
POLICY MATTERS  
14.1 INTRODUCTION  
Procedural guidelines are established to ensure that all investigators adhere to the protocol,
to facilitate optimum use of data generated by the study, and to ensure optimal use of the resources
of the Central Units and Medical Coordinating Center (for quality control in the study see Section10.4).  14.2 QUALITY ASSURANCE
Members of the Steering Committee will create a list of major and minor protocol violations.
Major violations are those which endanger patients, such as repetitive failure to obtain scheduledblood counts or failure to discontinue therapy prompt ly when so advised.  Minor violations are those
which impede the progress of the study, such as not filing reports in timely fashion (formdelinquencies) and excessive delays in supplying materials (e.g, scans, other images or eventreports) for central review.  Also, the Steering Committee will consider exceptions to the Protocoland advise the Operations Committee of its decision.  
After the first major violation, a clinic will be asked to submit a proposal outlining how
recurrence will be prevented.  After a second major vi olation, clinics will not be allowed to recruit
more patients, but will be able to follow those already recruited.  After three major violations theClinical Center may no longer be supplied with study drug.  Prior to suspension of study treatmentsat a Clinical Center, the Study Chairman or Vi ce-Chairman, Medical Coordinating Center Principal
Investigator and NHLBI and NICHD Project Officers will visit the Clinical Center and provide a sitevisit report to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for recommendation on final action.Clinical Centers with the greatest difficulty in meeting their proposed goals for recruitment will alsobe site visited, and recommendations for improvem ent made to them, with a report to the DSMB.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-2 of 14-6  (Clinical Centers which are not having problems wi th performance will also be visited at least once
during the study, to assure quality of data produced).  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board(DSMB) will be made aware of all major violati ons, and will consider discontinuing study treatment
at the Clinical Center after a third violation.  
The Medical Coordinating Center will document minor violations in performance reports, as
well as notifying the Clinical Centers of them.  Repeated minor violations which are not correctedwill result in reports to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the NICHD and the NationalHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  14.3 CHANGES IN PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS
Over the seven year course of the trial, it is expected that changes in Principal Investigators
(PIs) will occur in some of the Clinical Centers.  These changes may be necessitated by movementof the Principal Investigators to another institution, illness, retirement, or change in responsibilitywithin the same institution.  When a change in PI occurs, the viability of the Clinical Center as aBABY HUG participant could become problematic.  In this situation, retention of theestablished/experienced nurse coordinator may help ensure that the Clinical Center can continueto function effectively.  When such a change occurs, it is understood that the contractualarrangement between the NHLBI and the Clinical Center will be reviewed and possibly altered.However, because of the profound influence that such a change may have on the remaining ClinicalCenters in the conduct of BABY HUG, the members of the Steering Committee and/or theOperations Committee should have the opportunity to discuss and provide input into the decisionsthat are made.  
As noted in Section 14.2, problems in the performance of a Clinical Center will be discussed
by the Operations Committee.  The Clinical Centers and/or their representatives, the MedicalCoordinating Center, and the NHLBI and NICHD Project Offices should all participate in anydecisions which involve turnover of Principal Investigators and/or Clinical Centers.

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-3 of 14-6  14.4 TYPES OF BABY HUG RESEARCH 
BABY HUG research and the resulting presentation and publications may be grouped into
the following study categories.  
 1. Endpoint studies; 2. Data bank studies; 3. Ancillary studies.The Steering Committee will exercise responsibility for all endpoint, data bank, and ancillary
studies, and for all publications and presentations evolving from BABY HUG research, through theScientific Affairs and Publications Committee.  BABY HUG investigators have agreed that all BABYHUG research is collaborative in nature.  No investigator will publish BABY HUG data from any oneClinical Center or group of Clinical Centers without the written approval of the Publication
Committee, the NICHD and the NHLBI.  
Investigators at all BABY HUG sites, including the Medical Coordinating Center and the
NHLBI and NICHD Program Offices, have equal status with regard to developing protocols,participating in such studies as are approved and collaborating in the development and publicationof research papers based on BABY HUG material.  
The procedures in this sect ion for endpoint, data bank, and ancillary studies, and for
publication of BABY HUG research results are similar to those used in other cooperative clinicaltrials.  These procedures are intended to protect the interests of all investigators and patients in thetrial, namely, to assure that study data conform to the requirements of study design, are accuratelypresented, authorship is appropriately acknowledged, and the text of all publications is well writtenwith proper attention to the protection of patient privacy.  All BABY HUG presentations are subjectto review and approval by the NHLBI and NICHD.  14.4.1 Endpoint Studies
An endpoint study is a study pertaining to the fundamental goals of the project (e.g., the
evaluation of the efficacy of hydroxyurea in the prevention of chronic end organ damage) or which
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-4 of 14-6  involves data, such as treatment assignmen t, differences in hospitalization by treatment
assignment, or mortality rates, which cannot be released prior to the end of the study.  Thesestudies will summarize the findings of BABY HUG, based on the entire study population, and willbe written at the conclusion of follow-up or data collection.  14.4.2 Data Bank Studies
A data bank study is a study which uses data routinely collected on patients when they are
screened for or enrolled in BABY HUG and analyzes these data to answer some scientific question.Data used in this research are not directly related to the fundamental goals of the study.  14.4.3 Ancillary Studies
An ancillary study is a study which uses supplementary data collected on patients who are
screened for or enrolled in BABY HUG, over and above the data collection required by the BABYHUG Protocol.  Such studies are usually restricted to consideration of a specific test technique orinvolve only supplemental data collected on some or all BABY HUG patients.  
Approval and participation in ancillary studies are considered by the Steering Committee,
the NICHD and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) with the advice of independentreview committees (the Data and Safety Monitoring Board or the Protocol Review Committee).Proposals for ancillary studies are submitted to t he Medical Coordinating Center which distributes
them to the Steering Committee for scientific review and Clinical Center Principal Investigatorconsideration with regard to feasibility and interest in participation in the ancillary study in eachClinical Center.  Steering Committee members reply to a ballot distributed by the MedicalCoordinating Center indicating their approval or di sapproval of the ancillary study, the priority they
would accord the ancillary study and whether or not their Clinical Center would participate in the
ancillary study.  Approval requires a majority vote.  14.5 CLINICAL CENTER ACCESS TO BABY HUG DATA FILES AT THE END OF THE STUDY
At the end of the study, Medical Coordinati ng Center staff will produce a well documented
data tape containing a refined (and reduced) set of the BABY HUG data for the purpose of analysis

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-5 of 14-6  by the BABY HUG investigators and eventual release to the public domain in accordance with
NHLBI policy.  Clinical Center directors may analyze the data on this data tape in their own centers,but prior to submission of articles for publication must submit the analyses proposed for publicationto the Medical Coordinating Center, where they  will be reviewed and computations replicated.
Clinical Center directors who perform their own analyses are responsible for obtaining all supportnecessary for the data bank or ancillary study out side of regular study resources.  The Medical
Coordinating Center will be the center of study analysis activities as long as the BABY HUGinvestigators continue in their collaborative efforts.  14.6 PUBLICATION
The design and the main results manuscripts will list all Principal Investigators and all
members of the manuscript writing committees in the authorship.  The authors of other publicationsstemming from the study will be those who actually write the document (the writing committee), plusthe group as a whole (“Doe J, Roe K, and the Pediatric Hydroxyurea Phase III Clinical Trial (BABYHUG) investigators), with all investigators and coordinators listed in the appendix at the end of thepaper or reference made to a publication listing all investigators.  Study manuscripts may only besubmitted for publication for main endpoint studies and approved
 data bank and ancillary studies.
All manuscripts related to study patients mu st be reviewed and approved by the Publication
Committee.  The Publication Committee will implement day-to-day policy on publications andauthorship in accordance with the directions of the Steering Committee.14.7 CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST
BABY HUG investigators and their immediate family will not buy, sell, or hold stock options
in any of the companies
* providing medication (or making competing products) under study from
the time the recruitment of patients for the trial begins until funding for the study in the investigator’sunit ends and the results are made public; or from the time the recruitment of patients for the trial
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/ CHAP-14.wpd —  8/09 Page 14-6 of 14-6  begins until the investigator’s active and personal involvement in the study or the involvement of
the institution conducting the study (or both) ends.  
Each investigator will agree not to serve as a paid consultant to the companies during these
same periods.  The guidelines will also apply to the investigator’s spouse and dependents.  The
Medical Coordinating Center will hold and update annua lly conflict-of-interest statements from each
investigator.  
Certain other activities are not viewed as constituting prohibited conflicts-of-interest but must
be reported annually to the Medical Coordinating Center: the participation of investigators ineducation activities supported by the companies (permitted only if no honorarium is paid to theinvestigator); the participation of investigators in other research projects supported by thecompanies; and, occasional scientific consulting to the companies on issues not related to theproducts in the trial and for which there is no financial payment or other compensation.  The BABYHUG conflict-of-interest policy will incorporate the NHLBI and U.S.  Food and Drug Administration(FDA) policies on conflict-of-interest for investigators.
The BABY HUG investigators will not accept any restraint on freedom of publication.

Detailed Schedule of Visits and Total Amount of Blood

SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/A ppendix A.wpd —  8/09 Page A-1 of A-3  Introduction
Over the course of the two-year BABY HUG C linical Trial, patients will each have a total
volume of approximately 77.6 ml of blood collected for evaluations, including 17.1 ml forimmunology studies.  The largest volume will be obtained in the pre-randomization evaluation
period and the first 4 weeks on study treatment, during which time approximately 29.6 ml will be
collected.  Efforts are made to work with the sma llest volumes of specimens possible.  For example,
Schwartz
 GFR  specimens  will be aliquotted from specimens al ready prepared for other evaluations.
Using a conservative estimate of a 12 month old infant entering the study with an initial weight of8 kg, this amount will constitute approximately 3. 7 ml/kg over an 8-week period.  This amount is
within the guidelines for maximum volume of phl ebotomy (3-7 ml/kg per 8 week period), which have
been utilized by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Duke University Medical Center
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).  The maximum amount obtained at a single blood draw will beapproximately 8 ml; this will not exceed the guideli ne of 1 ml/kg (Duke University Medical Center
IRB) in an 8 kg infant and will not produce significant cardiovascular stress.  Older children withsickle cell disease have tolerated phlebotomy of 5-10 ml/kg every 2 to 4 weeks (Ware et al., 1999).During the other time periods in the course of the BABY HUG Clinical Trial, blood sampling volumeswill be considerably less.

ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES

SLC:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09-Word /Appendix E.wpd —  8/09 Page E-1 of E-9  Appendix E   
Anthropometric Measurement Procedures
BACKGROUND
Since BABY HUG is a longitudinal study and growth velocity data will be collected, it is
important that all measures be made as accura tely as possible.  Accuracy and standardized
procedures are also necessary in multicenter studies to make sure that data from one center arecomparable to data from other centers.  In BABY HUG data will be gathered on date of birth, birthweight, and gestational age.  Gestational age is estimated from of the number of weeks betweenthe mother’s record (recollection) of the onset of her last menstrual period and the child’s birth.  Inclinic anthropometric measures of weight, length, and head circumference will also be taken.Weight should be recorded in kilograms to the nearest 0.1 kg (100 grams).  Length and head
circumference should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.  GENERAL PROCEDURES
Anthropometric measurements should be taken by BABY HUG personnel specifically trained
and certified to perform these measurements.  If possible, the same examiner(s) should measure
participants throughout the study period. Whenever  possible, measurements should be taken by
a team of two observers.  One observer takes the measurements while the other observer records.The observer taking the measurements calls out the results to the recorder.  The recorder repeatsthe results and then calls out the name of the next measurement.  The observer keeps themeasuring instrument in plac e until the recorder repeats the number.  The recorder checks the
examinee’s position during the procedure.  All of the measurements – weight, length, and head
circumference – are made once before repeating them a second time in the same sequence by thesame observer.  A third measurement is made by the same observer only if the secondmeasurement differs from the first by the specified amounts.
___________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________
SLC:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09-Word /Appendix E.wpd —  8/09 Page E-2 of E-9  It is important that the measurements be made in pleasant, warm, and quiet surroundings.
If blood specimens are taken, they should be drawn after anthropometric data have been obtained.
Each center will use the same apparatus for all measurements.   Weight
The weight measurement is critical to assessing growth velocity.  Thus, weight must be
measured accurately.  Following is a description of instruments and methods used for weighinginfants.  
There is general agreement that weight should be measured using a beam scale with
movable weights or a well calibrated electr onic scale, and that a pan scale is needed for
measurements made during infancy.  
Weight is best measured with the subject nude, which is practical during infancy.  At older
ages, nude measurements may not be possible.  If nude measurements are not feasible,standardized light clothing, for example, a disposable paper gown, should be worn in preferenceto “light indoor clothing.”
There are diurnal variations in weight of about 1 kg in children and 2 kg in adults.  Therefore,
making a note of the time of day at which measur ements are made is desirable.  Usually it is not
practical to measure at a fixed time, but a narrow range may be achievable.  
Materials and MethodsPan Balance• A pan-type balance (scale) accurate to ± 10 grams (preferably to ±1 g) is needed
for children under 12 months old.  It may be a beam balance or a modern electronicrecording balance.  
• The balance should be checked for accuracy just prior to use by adjustment of zero
weight on the balance beam and weekly by verifying standard (National Bureau ofStandards - NBS) weights of 2 and 4 kg.  At least yearly, the balance should be
___________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________
SLC:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09-Word /Appendix E.wpd —  8/09 Page E-3 of E-9  inspected and adjusted if necessary by a qualified representative of the
manufacturer.  
• The child is weighed nude.  Because a pan balance may be uncomfortable, a pad
can be placed on the pan.  The pad is weighed, and this weight is recorded andsubtracted from the total weight (infant + pad).  Alternatively, the balance is adjustedto zero with the pad in place.  Whichever procedure is used, it should be practicedconsistently throughout the study.  
• The child must be relatively quiet and still during the weighing.• The child is weighed to at least the nearest 100 grams.  • The first weight is recorded on the BABY HUG Anthropometry Form.  The child is
then weighed again, and this measurement is also recorded.  If the twomeasurements (made to the nearest 0.1 kg) differ by more than 200 grams (0.2 kg),a third weighing is made and recorded.  Individuals making the weighings shouldsign the data form and record their certification numbers.  
Standing ScaleA subject able to stand without support is weighed using a leveled platform scale with a
beam and moveable weights (see Appendix E Figure 1).  The beam on the scale must begraduated so that it can be read from both sides and the scale positioned so that the measurer canstand behind the beam, facing the subject, and can move the beam weights without reachingaround the subject.  The movable tare is arranged so that a screwdriver is needed to shift it.  Thesubject stands still over the center of the platform with the body weight evenly distributed betweenboth feet.  At older ages, children object to bei ng weighed in the nude, and  light indoor clothing
such as a disposable paper gown can be worn but not shoes, long trousers, or a sweater.Standardized clothing, for example, a disposable paper gown should be the same at everyweighing.  The weight of this clothing is not subtracted from the observed weight when therecommended reference data are used.  Weight is recorded to the nearest 100 g.  Weight is

SLC:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09-Word /Appendix E.wpd —  8/09 Page E-4 of E-9  measured and recorded twice.  If the two measur ements disagree by more than 100 g, a third
measurement is made and recorded (see Appendix E Figure 1). Length
Linear growth of children is assessed by measuring length.  Recumbent length should be
used up to 18 months of age and standing height after 18 months of age. Of the anthropometricdata, recumbent length may be the most difficult to obtain accurately.  Examiners should practicemeasuring infants and verify their ability to measure recumbent length accurately. 
Materials and Methods• A recumbent length measuring board with fixed headboard and movable footboard
that are perpendicular to a table surface is required.  The measuring scale must bealong the length of the board.  The scale should be in centimeters with 0.1 cm
divisions. 
• The board should be regularly checked that the scale is in place and that the
footboard is functioning properly with minimum play around a horizontal or verticalaxis.  
• Two measurers are needed to obtain satisfactory measurements.  One measurer
holds the child’s head in a plane that allows the child to look upward in a line joiningthe left tragus and the lowest point of the inferior margin of the left orbit: line of sight(13).  Slight traction is applied to bring the top of the child’s head to the headboard.The other measurer holds the child’s feet with toes pointed upward and brings thefootboard gently against the child’s feet.  Press knees to straighten legs, i.e., theyshould be fully extended to avoid under
-estimating length.  Once the child is in
place, the measurer holding the head may observe that the head is no longertouching the headboard.  The footboard should not be brought forward.  Instead, thehead should be brought gently but firmly back to the headboard.  This is appropriate,

SLC:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09-Word /Appendix E.wpd —  8/09 Page E-5 of E-9  because the child should be stretched slightly to give an accurate measurement
(see Appendix E Figure 2).  
• The child’s recumbent length is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm.• The recumbent length measurement in cm and the data are recorded on the
appropriate data form.  
• The measurement should be repeated and value recorded.  If the two
measurements do not agree within 0.5 cm, the recumbent length should bemeasured a third time.  The two measurers may change positions for the thirdmeasurement. 
Head Circumference
Materials and Methods• Head circumference is measured with a flexible narrow non-stretchable tape.  Steel
and fiberglass tapes are satisfactory.  Disposable paper tapes can also be used. 
• If the same tape is used repeatedly, it should be checked periodically against a steel
centimeter reference tape.  
• Head circumferences are measured in young ch ildren while lying still.  In measuring
the older child, it is preferable for the child to be on the mother’s lap.  
• The tape is placed firmly around the head above the supraorbital ridges (right above
the brows).  While holding the tape in place with the index or middle finger of onehand, the tape is passed over the occipital prominence (bump) at the back of thehead with the other hand and the maximum circumference is noted.  
• The tape should be pulled snugly around  the head compressing the hair (see
Appendix E Figure 3).  The tape must be kept in the same plane on left and rightsides of the head.  The measurement should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.
• If the child has a hairstyle that may interfere with the tape’s proper position and
cannot be easily undone (e.g., “Corn rows”), the best circumference measures

the Anthropometry Form.  
TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION
Problems with different observers over time occur and thus it is important to keep the
number of observers to a minimum and ensure continued training and certification over time.  Inter-observer variability and errors related to lack of skills can introduce major errors in the data.  A goalwill be to have an individual certified as a trainer at each Clinical Center so that individualssubsequently joining the staff can be trained on site, certified, and recertified.  Training andcertification will be on site at all BABY HUG Clinical Centers and carried out by the master trainer.
The certification procedures trains the measurers at each site in the techniques and process
of taking the actual measurements covered in this manual.  During this procedure recordingmethods, equipment calibration and potential sources of error will be demonstrated.  
Recertification will be required every year after the original certification.  This will be carried
out by each center’s designated trainer or by the Study’s master trainer.  The designated trainerwill be certified as having demonstrable measur ement skills and knowledge of the methodology,
including recording, for avoidance of errors.

Clinical Event Definitions
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/A ppendix F.wpd —  8/09 Page F-1 of F-6  Appendix F: Clinical Event Definitions
Introduction
In BABY HUG, clinical event definitions will be applied for consistency with other important
NHLBI-sponsored clinical studies of sickle cell anemia such as the Clinical Study of Sickle CellDisease (CSSCD) and the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH).  
Definitions
Anemia:  A reduction of hemoglobin level by at least 30% from the steady-state level OR a
reduction by at least 20% accompanied by an acut e increase in spleen size.  Acute anemic events
should be classified into one of the following categories.  
 1. Splenic sequestration crisis: The event is characterized by an increase in spleen
size and firmness, reduction of hemoglobin level by at least 20% and may includedrop in platelet or white counts.  Splenic sequestration is defined in BABY HUG bythe findings of a palpable, large spleen with hemoglobin less than 5 gm/dL fornonfatal occurrences.
 2. Aplastic Crisis: This event is characterized by a substantial decrease in reticulocyte
count to below 1.5 % before or concurrent with a reduction in hemoglobin level toa level greater than 30% below the steady-state level. Characteristically results fromacute infection with parvovirus B19. Check the patient’s parvovirus IgM titer; usuallyit should be positive.  
 3. Other anemia:  Reduction of hemoglobin because of blood loss, transfusion reaction
or hyper-hemolysis will be classified as an other anemia.  A hyper-hemolytic episode
is characterized by normal or increased reticulocyte counts and nucleated red cellcount during an episode of falling hemoglobin associated with an increase in indirectbilirubin level over the usual value.  The latter finding is important to allowdiscrimination from a recovering aplastic crisis.  
SLC/F:/BABY-HUG/BHUG Protocol/August-09/A ppendix F.wpd —  8/09 Page F-2 of F-6  Aplastic Crisis :  See Anemia. 
Arthritis (septic) : See Infection (other).
Aseptic Necrosis : Presentation in the age range of patients in BABY HUG would be unusual.
Patients encounter pain in their hip or shoulder, often of a different character than their usual crisis
pain.  The pain persists indefinitely, long after the expected duration of crisis pain.  Earlyradiographic findings are subepiphyseal lucenc y and widening of the joint space.  Late changes
include flattening of the epiphysis and sclerosis with fragmentation.  
Bacteremia : Febrile illness with blood culture positive for bacteria.  Organism must be specified.
Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA):  Acute neurologic syndrome secondary to occlusion of an artery
or hemorrhage with resultant ischemic and neurologic symptoms and signs.
 1. Stroke, hemorrhagic: Injury to brain tissue resulting from disturbance of blood supply
to the brain due to hemorrhage.  The area of the hemorrhage should also bereported (e.g., subarachnoid, subdural, intracerebral, aneurysm).
 2. Stroke, infarctive:  Injury to brain tissue consistent with occlusion of vessel(s) by
thrombus or embolus which results in neurologic abnormalities on physicalexamination that persist beyond 24 hours.
 3. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Temporary interference with blood supply to the
brain.  The symptoms include neurologic signs that clear within 24 hours (48 hoursif basilar system is involved).  After the attack, no evidence of residual neurologicdamage remains on physical examination.
Chest Syndrome : Also known as acute chest syndrome (A CS).  A clinical syndrome that includes
at least 3 of the following symptoms:  chest pain, temperature elevation over 38.5
oC/101.5oF ,
tachypnea, wheezing or cough.  A new pulmonary infiltrate must be present on x-ray involving atleast one complete lung segment to be consistent with alveolar consolidation instead of atelectasis.

(TMF)  subjects with CD30 expression ≥1 % by IHC. A ll three  
cohorts will be analyzed independently as described below. 
Analysis S ets: 
The full analysis set (FAS) following the intent to treat principle 
will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of 
AFM13. The FAS will be the primary population for all efficacy 
related endpoints and the primary objective; an additional sensitivity analysis for all subjects who received at least one dose of AFM13 
and had at least one post- baseline efficacy assessment will be 
conducted to support the results of the primary analysis.  
The safety set will consist of all subjects who received at least one 
dose of AFM13 and had at least one post- baseline safety 
assessment, where the statement that a subject had no AE on the AE 
Case Report Form constitutes a safety assessment. The safety set 
will be the primary population for all safety related endpoints. 
Additional analysis sets  for sensitivity analyses may  be introduced 
in the statistical analysis plan due to the coronavirus disease-2019 
pandemic. 
Missing Data/D iscontinuation: 
As this is a non-randomized study design, no missing imputation of 
missing values will be done for any analysis except for 
partial/missing AE  dates and concomitant medication dates. 
Reasons for discontinuation of the study and the study drug will be listed and summarized.  
Efficacy Analyses: 
ORR (CR+PR) N will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
and 95% confidence limits. In addition, CR and PR will be 
presented separately.  
 
 
Safety Analyses: 
AEs, related AE s, serious AEs (SAE s) and related SAE s, AEs with 
NCI CTCAE Grades ≥3, related AE s of NCI CTCAE Grades ≥3, 
AEs leading to premature discontinuation, interruptions or

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  23 of 123 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Targeting Unique Cell Surface Proteins in Lymphoma  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies 
with multiple histological subtypes. It is estimated that approximately 65,540 new cases of NHL 
were diagnosed in 2010 and 20,210 patients died of their disease ( Jemal, 2010). Based on the 
World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematological and lymphoid tumors, NHL can be broadly classified  as B or T/ natural killer ( NK)- cell neoplasms ( Campo , 2011). In the 
United States  of America (US) , about 85% of cases are categorized as B -cell lymphomas and 
15% are categorized as T/NK -cell lymphomas ( Jemal, 2010).  
The expression of unique proteins on the cell surface allows for the identification and differential diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies. Several cell markers have been exploited as treatable 
targets by immunotherapeutics, such as rituximab, a genetically-engineered chimeric immunoglobulin G1  monoclonal antibody that targets cluster of differentiation ( CD)20, and 
brentuximab vedotin ([ BV] Adcetris
®), an antibody drug conjugate targeting CD30. CD30, a 
member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -receptor superfamily, has pleiotropic biologic 
functions, and antibodies targeting CD30 and other TNF family receptors can exhibit both agonistic and antagonistic signaling functions. CD30 was identified in the early 1980s as a 
protein recognized by m onoclonal antibody Ki -1 (Schwab , 1982) and abundantly and selectively 
expressed on the surface of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. Later, its expression in other neoplastic cells such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and other lymphoid 
malignancies as well as on several non -lymphoid malignancies including selected germ cell 
tumors was demonstrated. Expression of CD30 on normal cells is highly restricted, thereby allowing differential targeting of malignant cells. Brentuximab vedotin has shown striking efficacy in Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials, with manageable toxicity, and is approved for the treatment of 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), systemic ALCL and in primary cutaneous ALCL or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides ( MF). These results provide clinical validation for therapeutic 
targeting  of CD30 in the setting of HL, ALCL, and cutaneous T- cell lymphoma (CTCL).  
1.2 CD30 -p
 ositive Lymphoid Malignancies 
In hematologic malignancies, CD30 expression is strongly increased in HL and ALCL, but has 
also been noted in other lymphoid malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , 
including primary mediastinal (thymic) large B -cell lymphoma , peripheral T-c ell lymphoma 
(PTCL), lymphomatoid papulosis, MF, and Epstein- Barr v irus -driven clonal 
lymphoproliferative disease enteropathy- associated T -cell lymphoma type I, human T- cell 
lymphotropic virus type 1- associated adult T -cell leukemia/lymphoma, and primary effusion 
lymphoma harboring human herpes virus -8 (Bhatt , 2013; Sibon, 2016; Hu , 2013; Lunning, 2012; 
de Leval , 2010).  Additionally, primary CTCL represents a heterogeneous group of neopl asm s 
derived from skin-homing T-cells that also regularly expresses CD30.

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  24 of 123 1.2.1 Peripheral T -cell L ymphoma  
Peripheral T -cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphomas that make up 
~15% of all NHLs in adults. Some of the many known subtypes include PTCL, not otherwise 
specified, ALCL, and angioimmunoblastic T- cell lymphoma . 
While the identified subtype of the PTCL can lead to different survival rates and initial treatment options, in general without treatment the survival of PTCL patients is measured in months. With 
combination chemotherapy (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine sulfate (Oncovin
®), and prednisone [ CHOP ] or etoposide 
phosphate, prednisone, vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunorubicin) [ EPOCH]), 5- year overall survival ( OS) rates range from 
49 to 74% for those patients with low to intermediate scores (scores 0 to 2) on the International 
Prognostic Index (IPI); however, such low-intermediate risk patients are not common and the 
5-year OS after combination chemotherapy for the more common patients with the IPI scores 
of 3 or 4 to 5 are 21 and 6%, respectively ( Sonnen, 2005).  
The poor outcomes with chemotherapy have led to more aggressive approaches such as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) or radiation therapy as consolidation. 
The use of autologous HCT may depend on the subtype of PTCL and the IPI score. 
In general, most if not all patients undergoing treatment for PTCL will not achieve remission or 
will relapse with very poor long- term survival, especially in absence of HCT, with estimates as 
low as a median progression-free survival ( PFS) and OS of 3 and 6 months, respectively ( Mak, 
2013; Biasoli, 2015; Bellei , 2018).  
No optimal therapy is defined for relapsed or refractory ( R/R) PTCL with the exception of BV 
for the ALCL subtype and there is sparsity of data regarding long term outcomes for these patients. For those patients who are potential candidates for autologous or allogeneic HCT, 
achieving an objective response as a bridge to transplant is vitally important ( Laribi , 2018; 
Corradini, 2004; Le Gouill, 2008; Jacobsen , 2011; Goldberg, 2012).  
1.2.2 Transformed Mycosis F ungoides  
Mycosis fungoides is the most common subtype of primary CTCL  and is a mature T -cell 
lymphoma with cutaneous presentation but with potential systemic involvement. 
Advanced stage is considered to be a persistent disease with multiple relapses. Due to the chronic 
nature of the condition, the choice of therapy depends on the goals of therapy, including 
long-term disease control, symptom relief to increase quality of life and addressing more clinically aggressive disease.  
Once the disease is widespread, systemic therapies are needed as skin -directed therapies are 
insufficient for treatment ( Whittaker , 2003; Trautinger, 2006; Willemze and Dreyling, 2010; 
NCCN Clinical Pract ice Guidelines in Oncology V2. 2021; Sugaya, 2013; Olsen , 2011). Such 
systemic approaches include  single a gent or combination therapies ; with agents considered to be

being utilized first ( Jawed , 2014a ; Jawed , 2014b). Other systemic therapies include 
phototherapy, histone deacetylase inhibitors , BV, and alemtuzumab. 
Large cell transformation, which is the histopathological transformation of neoplastic 
lymphocyt
es to a clonally identical large cell phenotype ( Wolfe, 1995, Wood, 1993), occurs in 
20 to 50% of patients with advanced MF. Such transformation is often associated with poor prognosis and is associated with mean 5-year OS of less than 20% ( Salhany, 1988).  CD30 
expression is also associated with a reduced survival and often seen in diseases with large cell transformation leading to a more aggressive clinical course ( Benner, 2012). 
Currently the only known curative therapy for patients with transformed mycosis fungoides 
(TMF ) is allogeneic HCT  and the patients are in dire need for other therapeutic options.

A first -in-human Phase 1 study with AFM13 was conducted and completed in patients with R/R 
HL (AFM13 -101). Currently, there are three ongoing clinical studies with AFM13 in patients 
with CD30 -positive lymphoid malignancies, namely, AFM13-102 (R/R T-cell lymphoma), 
AFM13 -103 (R/R HL), and AFM13-201 (R/R HL). Data from the clinical  studies AFM13-101 
and AFM13-103 which informed this study design are provided below. 
1.3.3.1 Phase 1 F irst-in-Human Clinical Trial in Relapsed/ Refractory  Hodgkin 
Lymphoma  
The clinical first -in-human study, AFM13 -101, was conducted in patients with heavily pre-
treated R/R HL  (Rothe, 2015). Escalating doses of AFM13 were administered to determine the 
safety and tolerability of AFM13. Twenty-eight patients (16 males, 12 females) were enrolled 
and received treatmen t with AFM13 in 8 dose cohorts. Twenty -four patients received increasing 
doses of AFM13 ranging from 0.01 to 7.0 mg/kg on a weekly dosing schedule for 4 weeks. In addition, 4 patients were treated with 4.5  mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks.   
The median age was 38.5 years (range 19 to 72 years). Fourteen of the 28 patients (50%) had refract
ory disease and the remainder had relapsed disease; all were CD30 -positive. Patients had 
received a median of 6 (range 3 to 11) previous lines of therapy for HL. Twenty -four patients

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  29 of 123 (85.7%) had previously received radiotherapy and 22 patients (78.6%) had previously undergone 
stem cell transplantation. Nine patients had previously received BV. 
All 28 patients were included in the Safety population, 2 patients had to be excluded from the 
Efficacy population: 1 patient withdrew the informed consent; 1 patient discontinued due to 
adverse events ( AEs) of pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Twenty-three of the 28 patients 
experienced at least one AE which was evaluated as treatment -related by the Investigator. Most 
AEs were mild or moderate; only 18 of 196 (9.2%) of documented AEs were National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Grade ≥ 3. One 
dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was documented; Grade 4 hemolytic anemia considered possibly related to AFM13. The patient subsequently died due to aspergillus pneumonia and multi-organ 
failure which was assessed as not/unlikely to be related to study drug. The most frequent AE s 
were symptoms associated with infusion- related reactions including pyrexia, chills, headache and 
nausea. Treatment -associated infections were rare; nasopharyngitis and pneumonia was 
documented in 5 and 4 patients, respectively.  
After review of the safety data, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that the 
maximum feasible dose of 7 mg/kg following a weekly dose schedule was reached without 
toxicity concerns or reaching the maximum tolerated dose . Additionally, the 4 patients treated 
with 4.5 mg/kg twice weekly completed the treatment without toxicity concerns of the Independent D ata Monitoring C ommittee . Apart from the DLT event, administration of AFM13 
was not associated with clinically significant changes in any laboratory parameters, nor was it associated with clinically significant changes in any vital signs or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
parameters.  
Twenty -six of 28 patients were eligible for efficacy evaluation. No patients had a complete 
response ( CR) and 3 of 26 patients had a partial response ( PR) at the final study visit. The 
objective response rate ( ORR ) (CR + PR) was 11.5%. At the end of study assessment 13 patients 
(50%) had stable disease and 10 patients (38.5%) had disease progression. 
Overall, the effect of AFM13 treatment was more pronounced in patient cohorts with AFM13 
doses ≥1.5 mg/kg with an ORR of 23% (3/13).

The most commonly observed AE has been rigors, a symptom known to be associated with 
infusion- related reaction ( IRR), which occurred during AFM13 infusions and was considered 
related to AFM13. These AEs were all Grade 1 in severity.  
1.3.3.3 Phase 1b Clinical Trial of AFM13 in Combination with Pembrolizumab in 
Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 
AFM13 -103 was an open label Phase 1b dose escalation study to assess the safety of AFM13 in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients with R/R classical H L. The study consisted of Part 
1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (extension study). Part 1 was 3+3 dose escalation design and Part 2 was dose extension study with optional translational substudy. Treatment duration for AFM13 
was until Week 25 and treatment duration for pembrolizumab was  up to Week 52. In Part 1 (dose 
escalation), the AFM13 was escalated in s equential cohorts, while the dose of pembrolizumab 
was fixed at 200 mg once every 3 weeks ( Q3W ). 
A total of 30 patients (12 in Part 1 [dose escalation] and 18 in Part 2 [extension study]) were analyzed for safety and efficacy ; 10 patients completed all 52 weeks of study drug. 
The maximum tolerated dose was not exceeded and the minimal activation dose was determined 
to be 7 mg/kg. Overall, all 30 patients experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs). The most frequently reported events by preferred terms (PTs) were infusion related reaction (28 [93.3%] patients), nausea (12 [40.0%] patients), pyrexia (12 [40.0%] 
patients), diarrhea (10 [33.3%] patients), rash (10 [33.3%] patients), upper respiratory tract 
infection (9 [30.0%] patients), cough (8 [26.7%] pati ents), fatigue (8 [26.7%] patients), headache 
(7 [23.3%] patients), pruritus (7 [23.3%] patients), alanine aminotransferase increased (6 [20.0%]

For Cohorts A, B and C, subjects who meet all the following inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. 
Subjects who express CD30 (≥ 10% CD30 expression for PTCL subjects in Cohort A, ≥1% to 
<10% CD30 expression for PTCL subjects in Cohort B, and ≥1 % CD30 expression for TMF 
subjects in Cohort C) by centrally assessed  Ber-H2 targeted  immunohistochemistry ( IHC) 
(Section 5.4.1), and who have received at least one prior line of systemic therapy and have 
progressed on, or are not eligible for all standard approved therapy, will be enrolled in this study. 
Subjects with PTCL will be enrolled to Cohorts A or B and subjects with TMF will be enrolled 
to Cohort C. The specific subtypes for the PTCL cohorts are listed under the Inclusion Criteria  
(Section 3.1). After the planned I nter im Analyses, Cohorts A and B may be combined to include 
subjects with ≥1% CD30 expression. 
3.1 Incl usion Criteria  
1. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines. 
2. Age ≥18 years at time of provision of informed consent. 
3. Histologically confirmed CD30-positive (via centrally assessed Ber -H2 targeted IHC ; 
cut-offs listed below) PTCL (allowed subtypes listed below) or TMF per the revised WHO 
2016 classification ( Swerdlow, 2016) (Note: Subjects must wait for central results before 
first dose of study drug). 
The PTCL subtypes allowed for Cohorts A and B: 
• Ent
eropathy- associated T -cell lymphoma  
• Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T- cell lymphoma 
• Hepatosplenic T- cell lymphoma  
• Subcutaneous panniculitis- like T -cell lymphoma

Discontinuation 
Please refer to Section 6.8 for details of permitted AFM13 dose delays or interruptions. 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits 
and are unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a study 
subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject ’s 
medical record.  
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
All situations of non- compliance will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with the Sponsor and 
the site will be provided guidance on subject withdrawal from treatment and/or the study, where 
appropriate.  
Per Section 5.1.2, subjects who discontinue treatment due to achieving CR, are still considered to 
be on study and are required to undergo study assessments per the Schedule of Assessments 
 Such subjects may resume treatment where there is subsequent radiological 
evide
nce of disease progression, following a documented discussion with the Sponsor. 
Upon withdrawal from study drug, the reason for withdrawal should be sought and recorded in 
the subj
ect file a nd the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Every effort will be made to 
complete the Final Study Visit and for the subject to be followed up every 3 months thereafter to 
check for disease progression and survival status. Where a subject withdraws his/her consent to 
participate in the study, such follow-up assessments cannot be conducted. The management and 
holding of data around subject withdrawal w ill be described in the subject ICF .  
3.7 Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor or their representatives, Investigator, or Competent Authority discover conditions during the study that indicate that the study or site involvement should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation with the Sponsor and the Investigator. Conditions 
that may warrant termination of the study or a study site include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to subjects enrolled in the 
study. 
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the study drug. 

Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  44 of 123 • Failure of an  Investigator(s) to comply with pertinent clinical trial regulations.  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the study site  to the Sponsor, c linical 
research a ssociate ( CRA ), or Competent Authority. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

This is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study in subject s with R/R CD30 -positive PTCL or 
TMF to investigate the antitumor  activity and safety of AFM13 dosed weekly at 200 mg until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator discretion or withdrawal of consent.  
Subjects with PTCL or TMF who express CD30 ( ie, are confirmed to have ≥ 1% CD30 
expression) as determined by centrally assessed Ber -H2 targeted IHC  (Section 3.1), and who 
meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria , will be allowed for this study . 
Subjects with PTCL will be enrolled to Cohort A and Cohort B based on the centrally  
determined CD30 expression levels of ≥ 10% and ≥1%  to <10%, respectively, and subjects with  
TMF will be enrolled to Cohort C based on the centrally  determined CD30 expression of ≥1%. 
After the planned I nterim Analyses, Cohorts A and B may be combined to include subjects with 
≥1% CD30 expression. The specific subtypes of PTCL  allowed for Cohorts A and B ar e listed in 
the Inclusion Criteria ( Section 3.1).  A sum mary of the study design is provided in Figure 2. 
Subjects will receive AFM13  until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent. Reasons for withdrawing a subject from the study are described in Section 3.5.

The study consists of a Pre -screening Period, a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, an 
Efficacy and Safety Follow-up Period (Final Study Visit), plus Survival Follow-up. Informed 
consents (one for Pre -screening and a second one for the main study after the confirmation of 
CD30 -expression) must be obtained using the current, approved versions of the ICF prior to 
commencing Pre -screening and Screening, respectively . Subjects will undergo a P re-screening 
for CD30 expression up to 28 days before Screening and, if confirmed, will start Screening assessments up to 21 days before receiving the first dose of AFM13 . Due to the nature of the 
diseases being studied, S creening assessments may, in practice, be carried out over a shorter 
time-period. The Efficacy and Safety Follow-up Period (F inal Study Visit) assessments may be 
conducted between 30 to  37 days after the subject has permanently discontinued AFM13  study 
drug; however, a final AE and concomitant medication review must take place 30 days after the last dose of AFM13 . Where applicable, disease progression and survival status will be checked 
every 3 months by telephone interview, or during the subject’s routine clinic visits , following 
completion of the Final Study Visit assessme nts. 
5.1 Study Periods  
All subjects enrolled may participate in the following study periods: 
• Pre-screening Period   
• Screening Period  
• Treatment Period  
• Efficacy and Safety Follow-up Period (Final Study Visit) 
• Survival Follow-up (after completion of the study) 
Each study period is described below. Subjects will undergo study assessments from the 
Screening Period to the Efficacy and Safety Follow-up Period (Final Study Visit) at scheduled 
site visits as described in the Schedule of Assessments table  All subjects are 
considered “on-study” until they complete the Efficacy and Safety F ollow-
 up Period (Final 
Study Visit) , withdraw consent, are lost to follow up, or die . 
5.1.1 Pre-scr eening and Screening P eriod  
The study includes a Pre-Screening and a Screening Period. The maximum number of days from 
the time of informed consent for Pre-Screening to the Main study ICF is 28 days.  
During this P re-Screening Period the subject will be tested for CD30 expression. In addition, the 
ALK status for subjects with systemic  ALCL  will also be determined .  
The main screening period can last up to 21 days to assess the subject’s full eligibility to move to 
the treatment period of the trial (ie , the subject cannot start dosing until all screening assessment s 
confirm the subject’s eligibility ). 
Please refer to the guidance document ‘Enrollment process’ for specific details about the

Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  60 of 123 5.4.2 Med ical History 
There will be a baseline assessment of relevant medical history conducted at Screening to 
confirm eligibility and to record significant medical history and concurrent illnesses in the eCRF . 
Concurrent illnesses recorded at Screening (excluding the primary disease under evaluation), that worsen in severity or frequency from this baseline assessment during the study, should be 
reported as AEs (see Section 7).  
5.4.3 Pregnancy and Follicle  Stimulating Hormone  Tests 
Female subjects of reproductive potential will have a pregnancy test carried out at Screening. This test must be carried out within 3 days prior to first AFM13 administration. A urine test is 
acceptable; however, where a urine test is equivocal, a blood test must be performed to confirm 
the result. Subjects confirmed as pregnant will be excluded from participation in the clinical 
study.   
Female subjects of reproductive potential with a negative pregnancy test at Screening will 
continue to have pregnancy tests conducted at least every 4 weeks during the study and at the 
Final Study Visit  
Female subject s who 
 require documented confirmation of post -menopausal status will have their 
FSH levels assessed at Screening. A urine test is acceptable; however, where a urine test is 
equivocal, a blood test must be performed to confirm the result. Where post -menopausal status is 
not confirmed, subjects will be required to undergo pregnancy testing per protocol to confirm suitability to proceed.   
5.4.4 Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group P erformance S core 
ECOG Performance Score ( PS) will be assessed at the times given in  Schedule of Assessments 
 Details of the ECOG PS categories are presented in  Subject s must 
be conf 
irmed as ECOG PS 0 or 1 at Screening to be eligible for study participation. 
5.4.5 Vital Signs 
Vital sign parameters will be taken at the times given in Schedule of Assessments  
The date and time of collection will be recorded in the source data and in the e CRF.  
Vit
al sign parameters will consist of measurements of temperature, resting heart rate, seated 
blood pres
sure (systolic/diastolic) and respiratory rate.   
If any clinically significant findings are identified during the study, the Investigator will record 
these as an AE, where the finding represents a change from baseline.   
5.4.6 Physical Examinations 
A physical examination, including measurement of weight, will be taken at the times given in 
Schedule of Assessments  The subject’s height will be measured at Screening. The 
subj

A full physical examination will include assessment of the following categories: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurological, lymph 
nodes, and ‘other’. After the Screening assessment, the physical examination may be reduced to 
a symptom- directed assessment.   
If any clinically significant findings are identified during the study, the Investigator will record these as an AE, where the finding represents a change from baseline.   
5.4.7 Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, and U rinalysis  
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
parameters will be taken at the times given in Schedule of Assessments and 
recorded in the source data and in the 
 eCRF.  Coagulation will be assessed at Screening and Final 
Study Visit only and may be assessed from the hematology sample.   
The laboratory variables to be measured are described in  
Copies of laboratory accreditation certificates and reference ranges will be obtained from each 
study
 site prior to analysis of their first subject sample  and maintained over the course of the 
trial. 
If any clinically significant findings are identified during the study, the Investigator will record 
these as an AE, where the finding represents a change from baseline. 
5.4.8 Electrocardiogram  
A resting 12- lead ECG will be performed at the times given in Schedule of Assessments 
 For those occasions when both an ECG and peripheral blood sample collection 
are
 required at the EOI of AFM13, the blood draw must be completed first as close to the EOI as 
possibl
e, followed by the ECG. Both procedures should be completed within 10 minutes after the 
EOI (+10 min utes, note plus only).   
All 12 -lead ECGs should be recorded while the subject is in the supine position. ECGs will be 
rec
orded at 25 mm/sec. All efforts should be made to ensure that an identical ECG machine is 
used to collect traces for individual subjects. The Investigator or designated physician will 
review the ECG results. If any clinically significant findings are identified during the study, the

Annex 13 requirements, US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) requirements, and any other 
applicable local regulatory guidelines. 
6.3 Storage of AFM13  
AFM13  study drug will be shipped to the site and must be stored at the site in a secure location 
under controlled conditions and in the required temperature range ( Table 3). 
6.4 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator is obliged to keep sufficient documentation of the delivery, use and destruction 
or return of unused, used or partially used AFM13 study drug. The documentation must include 
dates, quantities, subject numbers, batch numbers or other identification number. The 
Investigator may assign some or all of the Investigator’s duties for drug accountability to an 
appropriate pharmacist. Roles and responsibilities of site staff will be recorded in the Investigator  
Site File.  
The Investigator should maintain records that document adequately that the subject s were 
administered the doses specified in the protocol and reconcile all AFM13 study drug received for 
the trial. The local CRA will be responsible for checking the drug accountability records maintained by the site during study monitoring visits.  
AFM13  provided for this study is for use only as directed in the protocol. It is the Investigator 
and their institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study drug so as to ensure 
that: 
• Deliveries of  AFM13 are correctly received by a responsible person; 
• Such deliveries are recorded;  
• Study drug is  handled and stored safely and properly as stated on the label; 
• Study drug is only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol; and 
• Any unused study drug is destroyed locally or returned for destruction in liaison with the 
CRA.  
Certificates of delivery and return must be signed by the responsible pharmacist, and copies 
retained in the Pharmacy File. Throughout the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery 
records with records of usage and any destroyed/returned stock of AFM13. To help with 
compliance checks, records of usage should include an appropriate form of identification of the 
subject to whom the study drug was dispensed ( using an indirect form to allow cross reference to 
the subject s’ identity) , plus the quantity and date of dispensing.  
The return or destruction of unused drug will be conducted after written approval by the Sponsor, 
with appropriate documentation and drug accountability procedures completed following 
destruction.

Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (Section 3.2) are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication specifically prohibited during 
the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy may be required. The final decision on any supportive 
therapy rests with the Investigator and/or the subject's primary physician. However, in such 
cases, the decision to continue the subject on AFM13 study drug requires the mutual agreement 
of the Investigator, Sponsor and the subject. 
6.9.1 Accept able Concomitant M edications  
All treatments and supportive care that the Investigator considers necessary for a subject ’s 
welfare may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator in keeping with the study site’s 
standards of medical care except for the prohibited concomitant medications listed in 
Section  6.9.2. All concomita nt me dication will be recorded in the eCRF  including all 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and iv medications and fluids. If changes 
occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also 
be included in the e CRF.  All concomitant medications received within 30 days before the first 
dose of study drug and 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be recorded. Concomitant medications administered >30 days after the last dose of study drug should be recorded for 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) that are cons idered related to study drug ( Section 7.10).  
6.9.1.1 Highly E ffective Contraception 
Both sexually active females of childbearing potential and non- vasectomized male subject s with 
female partners of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective methods of 
contraception, initiated prior to first dose of study drug, continued during study drug, and for at 
least 60 days after the last dose of study drug. Note that for non- vasectomized male subjects, 
some of these methods are applicable to their female partners.  
Highly effective methods of contraception, including abstinence, are defined as follows: 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation; may be oral, intravaginal or transdermal method; 
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation; 
may be oral, injectable, implantable method; 
• An intrauterine device; 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system;  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion; 
• Vasectomized partner of a female subject (provided that the vasectomized partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study subject and that the 
vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success); or  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study drug, starting prior to first dose of study drug, for the duration of study drug, and for at least 60 days after the last dose of study drug. Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line with a

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  74 of 123 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
7.1 Assessment of Safety  
All subject s who receive treatment with  AFM13  will be considered evaluable for safety. All AEs 
and SAEs will be collected from the time the subject gives informed consent up to and including 
 There will be a baseline medical conditio n review 
taken at S creening. AEs, other than the primary disease under evaluation, that worsen in severity 
or frequency from this baseline assessment during the study, should be recorded and reported as 
AEs.   
In addition, as part of the documentation of an AE in the electronic documentation system, sites 
will be asked to identify whether the event is related to an infusion- related reaction.  
If the Investigator detects an SAE in a study subject after the end of the period of observation 
and considers the event possibly related to prior study drug or procedures, they should contact the Sponsor to determine how this event should be documented and reported. 
7.2 Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to AFM13 . 
During clinical trials, AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. To prevent reporting bias, subjects should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. AEs include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the start of 
the study;  
• Intercurrent illness;  
• Drug interactions;  
• Experiences related or possibly related to concomitant medications;  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or shifts from baseline; and  
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, weight or ECG.  
Symptoms and signs of exacerbation or worsening of the subject ’s primary disease will not be 
captured as AEs. Progression of the disease under study will not be captured as an AE unless it is considered to be drug-related by the Investigator. 
Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition 
for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. 

Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  75 of 123 Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the 
condition(s) was (were) known before the period of observation and did not worsen during study. 
In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history. 
7.3 Importance of Adverse Event Reporting  
Timely and complete reporting of safety information is very important to assist in the 
identification of any untoward medical occurrence, thereby ensuring: 
• the safety of study subject s;  
• a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigational drug;  
• recognition of any dose- related investigational drug toxicity;  
• appropriate modification of study protocols;  
• improvements in study design or procedures as required; and  
• adherence to required ethical and regulatory requirements for clinical trial conduct. 
7.4 Evaluating Adverse Events 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all AEs should be collected. All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF , 
except for those events occurring prior to the first dose of study drug, which should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF  page. Where known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or 
disorder should be recorded, rather than listing individual symptoms.   
The following information should be captured for all AEs: date of onset and resolution, severity 
of the event (see definitions in Section 7.5) , assessment whether the event was serious or 
non-serious, Investigator's opinion of the relationship to AFM13  (see definitions in Section 7.8)  
treatment required for the AE, action taken with AFM13 study drug and information regarding 
resolution/outcome. 
7.5 Severit y 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the AE page of the subject ’s eCRF . 
Each event will be graded for severity using the classifications of NCI CTCAE v5.0 (or higher) 
 For events not addressed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 classifications , the fol lowing 
grading will apply: 
• Mild (Grade 1)  - M ild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
• Moderate (Grade 2)  - Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activity of daily living.  
• Severe (Grade 3)  - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life  -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
activity of daily living.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4)  - Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated. 
• Fatal (Grade 5)  - Related to AE . 

Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  76 of 123 7.6 Serious  Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose causes or qualifies as 
the following: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening: 
o “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: 
o This means that hospital in patient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were 
required for the treatment of the SAE or that they occurred as a consequence of the 
event. 
o Visits to a hospital by ambulance or to the emergency room without admission will not be regarded as hospitalization unless the event fulfills any other of the serious criteria.  
Note: Preventive hospitalization due to current COVID -19 pandemic (eg, to 
minimize exposure to COVID-19) will not be categorized as SAE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity: 
o “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant 
and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event: 
o Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in de ath or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered chronic, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent.  
7.7 Other Important Events for Immediate Reporting  
AEs meeting  the below criteria, although not categorized as ‘S erious’ per ICH definition, are 
reportable to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements and 
the study needs: 
• A new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
• A reported pregnancy or lactation after receipt of study drug and for ≤6 0 days from last 
dose; 
Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  77 of 123 • An overdose (defined as any dose of AFM13  which more than the assigned dose for that 
subject is ). 
• Any confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection (eg, in case the subject cannot be tested 
due to lock- down) should be reported as Important Medical Event, regardless of the 
hospitalization status or severity of the event; as this is an adverse event that may 
jeopardize the subject safety or may require intervention to prevent a severe, life 
threatening or fatal outcome. Note: Continuation in the study should be assessed by the Investigator and according to the protocol criteria for study termination. Dose delay vs. study termination should be driven by the overall health status  of the subject, and the 
safety of the subject shall prevail at all times . 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor by means of an SAE form either by 
electronic report or paper.  
7.7.1 Exposure D uring Pregnancy or Lactation 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered AEs, it is the responsibility of Investigators 
or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to 
them) or pregnancy in a subject’s partner that occurs during the trial. 
Pregnancies and lactations that occur in subjects after the ICF is signed but before starting study 
drug must be reported by the Investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial. 
Pregnancies and lactations that occur in a study subject or a pregnancy in a subject ’s partner 
from the time of first study drug through to 60 days following cessation of AFM13  study drug, 
must be reported by the Investigator. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion or termination of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome ie , 
the health of the infant, will be requested by the Sponsor. 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor via email, fax, or telephone. The 
reporting procedures can be found in the SAE completion guidelines located in the Study 
Operations Manual (or equivalent). 
7.7.2 Misuse and Overdose 
Study drug misuse or overdose should be reported in the same format and within the same 
timelines as an SAE, even if they may not result in an adverse outcome. In the event of overdose, 
the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment 
should be provided if clinically indicated. 
For the purpose of this protocol, an overdose is any dose of AFM13  which is more than the 
assigned dose level for that subject. If the pharmacy discovers that an overdose has or may have been administered, they should 
contact the Investigator and Sponsor (or their delegate) immediately.

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  78 of 123 7.7.3 Investigational P roduct C omplaints  
Pharmaceutical technical complaints associated with the investigational product must be reported 
to the Sponsor immediately , following the guidance specified in the Pharmacy Manual. The 
same reporting timelines as for SAEs will apply.  
7.8 Relationship  
All AEs (including SAEs) will be assessed for the relationship of the AE to the study drug using 
the following definitions: 
• Not/unlikely related  - The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product 
has not occurred, OR  the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, OR the 
AE is considered unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product because there 
are no facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship AND  there is a 
possible alternative explanation.  
• Possibly related  - The administration of the investigational product and AE are 
considered reasonably related in time AND  the AE could be explained by causes other 
than exposure to the investigational product. 
• Probably related  - Exposure to the investigational product and AE are reasonably related 
in time AND  the investigational product is more likely than other causes to be responsible 
for the AE OR  is the most likely cause of the AE.  
• Definitely related  - There is a reasonable temporal sequence between exposure to the 
investigational product and the AE, OR the event follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the investigational product AND  is confirmed by improvement on stopping the 
dosage of the investigational product. It may also be confirmed by reappearance upon repeated exposure where this is medically and ethically acceptable.  
Please also refer to supporting information provided in  The relationship of the study 
drug to an AE will be determined by the Investigator and subsequently reviewed by the Sponsor. 
For reporting and data analysis purposes, AEs reported with a causality assessment of 
“Def
initely”, “Probably”, and “Possibly” are to be considered as “having a reasonable causal 
relationship” to study drug. In case of disagreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor, 
the more conservative assessment will determine the reportability of the case.  
7.9 Unexpected A dverse E vents  
The Sponsor will assess all SAEs whether they are expected or unexpected. An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the outcome, specificity, or severity of which is not consistent with those 
noted in the current IB section Reference Safety Information . 
7.10 Reporting S erious A dverse E vents  
Adverse Events classified as serious require expeditious handling and reporting to the assigned Drug Safety contact to comply with regulatory requirements.  
Any SAE that occurs while a subject is on study ie , occurs within 30 days of the last study drug 
administration , regardless of any opinion as to the relationship of the SAE to the study drug,

Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  80 of 123 7.12 Follow Up I nformation on an SAE  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Thus, follow-up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (eg, 
hospital discharge summaries and autopsy reports), should be collected subsequently, if not 
available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same procedure as the 
initial SAE report. The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study site. The Sponsor (or 
their delegate) will also review SAE reports for missing information and send queries to the site 
for resolution as appropriate. 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, if indicated, should 
be instituted. Appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluations should be carried out by the 
Investigator (or designee). An SAE is followed until it is considered resolved, returns to baseline, is chronically ongoing, stabilized or is otherwise explained by the Investigator.

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  81 of 123 8 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
Detailed statistical analysis information will be provided separately in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) which will be finalized and signed before the database is locked. The SAP will detail 
all data handling rules, including the management of missing values and the handling of data for 
withdrawn subjects. The SAP will also outline protocol deviation criteria. Any deviations to the planned analyses specified or populations defined within the SAP will be justified in writing and 
presented within the fina l clinical study report (CSR) . 
The clinical database lock will occur after all data are reconciled (ie, “cleaned”) for all subject s 
who receive at least one dose of AFM13. A single CSR will be generated for this study.  
An addendum (or addenda) to the CSR will be generated as required to report any data obtained 
during the Follow- up Assessments.  
Where appropriate, tables, listings and figures will be reported by Cohort. Data may be 
combined and/or summarized by cohort, dose (if different from cohort) and time point.  
8.1 Analysis Sets  
The study will have three separate cohorts: first cohort (Cohort A) with R/R PTCL subject s with  
CD30 ≥ 10%, second cohort (Cohort B) with R/R PTCL subjects with CD30 ≥1%  to <10%, and 
the third  cohort (Cohort C) with R/R TMF subject s with CD30  ≥1%. A ll three cohorts will be 
analyzed independently as described below. The full analysis  set (FAS) following the intent to treat (ITT) principle will consist of all 
subjects who received at least one dose of AFM13. The FAS will be the primary population for 
all efficacy related endpoints and the primary objective; a sensitivity analysis for all subject s who 
received at least one dose of AFM13 and had at least one post- baseline efficacy assessment will 
be conducted to support the results of the primary analysis. 
The safety set  will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of AFM13 and had at 
least one post- baseline safety assessment (where the statement that a subject had no AE on the 
AE eCRF  constitutes a safety assessment). The safety set will be the primary population for all 
safety related endpoints. The per protocol set  (PPS) will consist of all subjects in FAS who did not have any major 
protocol deviations. The primary analysis will be repeated to support the results of the primary 
analysis on the FAS. 
The pharmacokinetic set  (PK) set consists of all subjects who have at least received one dose of 
study drug and have at least one post dose PK measurement. 
Additional sensitivity analyses might be needed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and those will 
be defined in the SAP, if deemed necessary. 
Subjects who were screened and have signed the ICF  but did not receive any treatment will be 
listed including reason for screen failure and any SAE  (this will be recorded in the medical 
Affimed GmbH

AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  82 of 123 history). These subjects will not be part of any summary table except for summarizing 
disposition. 
8.1.1 Missing Data and D iscontinuation 
As this is a non-randomized study design, no imputation of missing values will be done for any 
analysis except for partial/missing AE  dates and concomitant medication dates. Reasons for 
discontinuation of the study and the study drug will be listed and summarized.  
Subject s with missing post -baseline response will be classified as non -responders; however, due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic additional analyses might be need ed and will be specified in the 
SAP (see Section 2.1). 
8.2 Demographic, Medical History, Prior Medication and Other Baseline 
Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics,  prior anti-cancer therapies and surgeries, medical history, prior 
medication and other baseline data will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuation data and contingency tables for categorical data. Prior medication/Prior anti- cancer 
therapies will be coded by WHO Anatomical, Therapeutic, and Chemical (ATC)  terms. Medical 
history will be coded utilizing corresponding Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) System Organ Classes (SOCs)  and PTs . 
8.3 Study Drug  
The number of doses of AFM13 administered over the entire study period will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics. The time on study drug until last treatment received will 
be listed and presented by descriptive statistics.   
8.4 Concomitant Medication  
Concomitant medication and significant non-drug therapies after the start of study drug will be 
listed and summarized by WHO ATC  term s in contingency tables. 
8.5 Primary  Analysis 
8.5.1 Overall R esponse Rate 
Overall response by PET- CT as defined by achieving CR and/or PR assessed by an Independent 
Review Committee ( IRC) utilizing the modified Lugano Classification Revised Staging System 
for malignant lymphoma ( Cheson, 2014) for Cohorts A and B (PTCL) and the Olsen Criteria 
(Olsen, 2011) for Cohort C (TMF). Subjects with missing post-baseline response will be

9.1 Data R ecording , Monitoring of the Study and Regulatory Compliance 
The project manager, or their designee, will make an initiation site visit to each institution to 
review the protocol and its requirements with the Investigator(s), inspect the drug storage area, 
and fully inform the Investigator of his/her responsibilities and the procedures for assuring 
adequate and correct documentation. During the initiation site visit, the eCRF  and other pertinent 
study materials will be reviewed with the Investigator’s research staff. During the course of the study, the CRA  will make regular site visits in order to review protocol compliance, examine 
CRFs and individual subject’s medical records and assure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. Sites should ensure that source documentation is 
available to enable verification of all eCRF  data entries. The review of medical records will be 
done in a manner to assure that subject confidentiality is maintained.  
All eCRF  data will be collected using an eCRF  within a fully validated and CFR 21 Part 11-
compliant electronic data capture system. All data will be entered into the eCRF  by the site staff. 
These data will then be source-data verified and reviewed by the CRAs before data cleaning by 
Data Management is performed. All queries will be raised and resolved within the electronic data 
capture system. During entry, programmatic checking of the data will be performed and once 
saved into the database, more complex programmatic checks will also be performed. During the 
conduct of the study, all system users will have real- time access to the data. The level of access 
to the data and study privileges will be determined by their user role.  
After all queries have been resolved, the SAP approved and signed, and any summary/analysis 
populations approved, the database will be locked, and the data released for summary and 
analysis. All summary and analysis of the data will be performed using appropriate version of SAS
® and WinNonLin Pro, or equivalent. 
9.2 Study M onitoring  
CRAs  will be responsible for the monitoring of the study. The CRA  will review the progress of 
the study on a regular basis to ensure adequate and accurate data collections. Monitoring site 
visits to review the e CRF, subject case notes, administrative documentation, including the 
Investigator Site File, and frequent telephone/e -mail communications with site will be performed 
throughout the study. 
At each study monitoring visit, the Investigator will make available all records pertaining to the 
study. To allow sufficient time to assemble documentation for the CRA , monitoring visits will be 
confirmed in advance of planned visits. 
The process for study monitoring and source data verification requirements for the study will be 
specified in the Monitoring Plan (or equivalent).

The Sponsor, Sponsor representative, or external regulatory agency may at any time during or 
after completion of the study conduct a Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) audit. Prior notice will be 
given to each site selected for audit in advance of a planned audit. 
9.4 Clinical S tudy R eport  
The results of the study will be presented in an integrated C SR according to ICH guidelines. 
9.5 Data A vailability  
The Investigator is required to maintain copies of all essential study documentation, including 
the Site Study File, all eCRF  data (including the full audit trail and all data queries), signed ICF s 
and records for the receipt and disposition of study drug. 
During the study, the Investigator must make study data accessible to the CRA , the Sponsor (or a 
third -party auditor assigned by the Sponsor), and relevant IRB /EC and regulatory agencies. A 
file (or appropriate records) for each subject must be maintained that includes the signed ICF  and 
all source document ation related to that subject. The Investigator must ensure the availability of 
source documents from which the information in the eCRF  was derived. 
Please refer to Section 12.2 for details of required record retention for the study. 
9.6 Curricula Vitae and Financial Disclosure of Investigators  
All Principal Investigators will be required to provide a current signed and dated curriculum 
vitae, a completed FDA Form 1572 (or accepted equivalent)  and a financial disclosure statement . 
All Sub -investigators will be required to provide a current curriculum vitae and a financial 
disclosure statement . 
9.7 Protocol Modifications 
No modification of the protocol should be implemented without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. Any such changes which may affect a subject’s treatment or informed consent, especially those increasing potential risks, must receive prior approval by the IRB/ EC. The 
exception to this is where modifications are necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (eg, 
change in monitor, change in telephone number). Other administrative revisions which may 
impact the clinical portion of a study will be duly reported to the IRB/ EC by the Principal 
Investigator.  
Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  89 of 123 10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each subject, or their authorized 
representative, participating in the study. The form must be signed, witnessed and dated. The ICF 
will contain all the Essential Elements of Informed Consent set forth in 21  CFR, Part 50, the ICH 
Guideline for GCP , and the terms of the Declaration of Helsinki. Copies of the signed document 
should be given to the subject and filed in the Investigator’s Study File , as well as the subject ’s 
medical record if in conformance with the institution’s  Standard Operating Procedures. 
The final study protocol and subject ICF  will be approved by the appropriate IRB /EC for each 
investigational site. Approval will be received in writing before initiation of the study. 
Changes to the protocol during the trial will be documented as amendments. Depending on the 
contents of the amendment and local legal requirements, the amendment will be submitted for approval to the relevant IRB /EC and to the relevant competent authorities prior to 
implementation. Exceptions are cases of changes made to protect subject safety, which will be implemented immediately.  
If an amendment substantially alters the trial design, increases the potential risk to the subjects, affects the treatment of the subject, or might otherwise influence the willingness of the subject to 
participate in the trial, then the ICF must be revised and submitted to the relevant IRB /EC and, 
where necessary, to the relevant competent authorities, for review and approval. When a subject 
is currently undergoing trial procedures and is affected by the amendment, then the subject must 
be asked to consent again using the new ICF . 
10.1 Ethical C onduct of the S tudy  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, the European Union  Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC, the requirements of local IRB /EC, and the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 50.  
10.2 Informed C onsent  
The principles of informed consent in the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines will be implemented before any protocol-specific procedures or interventions are carried out.  
All subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they can cease participation 
at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any penalty or loss of benefits to 
which they are entitled.  
With the help of the ICF,  the subject will be informed about the AFM13 study drug and 
anticipated effects  and the reason, design and implication of the trial. The subject must give 
consent to participate prior to enrolment in the trial. This consent must be given in writing. The 
Investigator who conducts the informed consent discussion must also sign. The Investigator may 
delegate this responsibility to a suitably qualified member of the study team (eg , 
Sub-Investigator) if permitted by local regulations. This delegation of responsibility must be 
recorded in the Study File. By giving signed consent, the subject will confirm that his or her 
Affimed GmbH    
Protocol  Confidential 
AFM13 -202 V7.0 31May 2023  90 of 123 participation is voluntary and that he or she will follow the instructions of the Investigator and 
answer the questions asked. Signatures must be personally dated. 
The signed and dated consent form will be kept by the Investigator. Prior to participation in the 
trial, the subject should receive a copy of the signed and dated written ICF .  
The ICF  must include all elements required by law, local regulations, GCP and ICH guidelines 
including consent to allow the Sponsor, Sponsor representative, or external regulatory auditor to 
review the subject’s medical records. This gives permission to examine, analyze, verify and 
reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.  
Any party with direct access must take all reasonable precautions within the constraints of the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s) to maintain the confidentiality of the subject s’ identities and 
Sponsor’s proprietary information. It is the CRA’s responsibility to verify that each subject has 
consented, in writing, to direct access. 
10.3 Patient Participation Card 
A study participation card will be provided to subjects where required by local regulations or 
IRB/EC. The card will indicate that he or she is participating in a clinical trial and give the name 
and contact details of the Sponsor and the Investigator/study site. The subject will be asked to retain this card while participating in the trial and show it to any other medical practitioners 
consulted during this time. Subjects will be advised to contact the Investigator/study si te if there 
are any questions. A sample patient participation card is shown below.

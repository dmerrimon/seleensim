Label Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess 
Preoperative Acupuncture for Patients Undergoing Total 
Knee or Hip Arthroplasty
 
 
OVERVIEW
 
Acupuncture has been extensively practiced and studied worldwide, particularly as a 
part of Eastern medicine, but it 
is a relatively uncommon therapy offered in Western 
medical institutions, such as those in the United States. Considering the commonly cited 
benefits of acupuncture, such as reduced anxiety and pain, hospitals throughout the 
United States have the opportun
ity to implement acupuncture as a cost
-
effective and 
safe technique for improving surgical outcomes.
 
 
Acupuncture administered in the preoperative period can be particularly effective for 
reducing preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, postoperative opi
oid consumption, 
and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Consequently, preoperative acupuncture can 
improve patient satisfaction and decrease hospital costs. However, due to lack of 
implementation and experience, further research is needed to establish the 
safety and 
efficacy of preoperative acupuncture in the United States medical practices.
 
 
At the Bone
-
and
-
Joint Institute at Hartford Hospital, where this study is proposed, a 
quality study on total knee or hip arthroplasty patients found that 21% of its mo
nthly 
patients were “high
-
anxiety” according to the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and 
Information Scale (APAIS). Thus, there is a significant population of patients that would 
benefit from a procedure to reduce preoperative anxiety at our facility.
 
 
This proposal is for a prospective, open
-
label, randomized controlled trial to determine 
the effect of preoperative acupuncture on preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain 
for high
-
anxiety patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthrop
lasty. We 
hypothesize that preoperative acupuncture will reduce preoperative anxiety and 
postoperative pain as well as reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting and opioid 
consumption and improve patient satisfaction. The study population is to include adul
t 
patients undergoing lower extremity total joint arthroplasty, including of the hip and knee 
joints, at the Bone
-
and
-
Joint Institute at Hartford Hospital.

OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC
 
AIMS
 
Primary Objectives: 
In patients with high anxiety undergoing THA or TKA:
 
1)
 
Determine
 
if
 
preoperative
 
acupuncture
 
reduces
 
preoperative
 
anxiety
 
in
 
the 
acupuncture
 
group.
 
2)
 
Examine 
postoperative pain 
following 
acupuncture 
compared t
o
 
control.
 
 
Secondary Objective: 
To determine the safety of preoperative acupuncture by 
recording complications throughout hospital length of stay; to determine whether 
preoperative acupuncture reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting, reduces 
postoperative opioid consumption, reduces an
xiolytics need during hospitalization 
and improves satisfaction compared to control in high
-
anxiety patients undergoing 
THA or TKA.
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
 
Acupuncture has been a practice of Chinese medicine for over 2,500 years for treating 
diseases, relieving pain, and more recently for improving the outcomes of surgery.
[1] 
In 
the United States, however, acupuncture was relatively unheard of as a medical 
pr
actice until the 1970s, and the nation has since remained hesitant to implement it in 
the hospital.
[2] 
As a result, while the research on acupuncture shows potential benefits 
for both patients and providers, most of these studies have been conducted outsid
e of 
the United States, which likely has contributed to the nation’s cautious stance.
 
Practitioners and researchers, therefore, need to demonstrate and determine whether 
the touted benefits of acupuncture can be extended to practices in the United States.
 
 
Postoperative pain is commonly studied as a primary outcome of acupuncture 
treatment, and improvements in pain are often cited as a benefit.
[3
-
11] 
For example, in a 
large study that aimed to evaluate an acupuncture rehabilitation program on 2,282 
patients
 
who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA), 
patients on average reported a 45% reduction in pain following acupuncture treatment.
[3] 
Another study randomized 80 patients who received TKA to receive either postoperative 
acu
puncture treatment or standard rehabilitation care, and results showed that patients 
in the acupuncture group experienced significantly reduced postoperative pain, 
increased knee range
-
of
-
motion, and faster rehabilitation time.
[7] 
Heightened 
postoperative 
pain is, understandably, a strong predictor of worsened surgical outcomes 
and patient dissatisfaction, and, according to a systematic review of nearly 30,000 TKA 
patients, the most consistent predictor of postoperative pain is preoperative pain.
[12] 
Theref
ore, perhaps the best method for improving surgical outcomes and patient 
satisfaction is to target both postoperative and preoperative pain. Since few studies 
have explored the analgesic effects of acupuncture in the preoperative period, there is 
an opport
unity for future research to determine whether the pain
-
reducing effects of 
acupuncture can be used in the preoperative period to improve surgical outcomes and 
patient
 
satisfaction.
 
 
Intra
-
 
and postoperative opioid consumption is another commonly studied o
utcome of 
acupuncture.
[13] 
In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 54 patients receiving THA, 
researchers randomized patients to receive either auricular (of the ear) or sham 
acupuncture treatment and compared the amount of piritramide (a synthetic opioi

intraoperatively.
[9] 
The results showed that patients in the acupuncture group required 
significantly less piritramide intraoperatively compared with sham (37 ± 18 mg vs. 54
 
± 21 mg). A similarly constructed RCT also studied the effects of preoperative 
auricular acupuncture on
 
intraoperative opioid use, but researchers instead studied 
fentanyl use and included patients undergoing TKA.
[14] 
These researchers, too, found 
that patients in the acupuncture group required significantly less opioid during 
surgery than patients in the s
ham acupuncture group (620.7 ± 258.2 µg vs. 868.6 ±
 
319.3 µg). Further, these patients on average lasted longer before requesting 
analgesia and exhibited lower visual pain scores. Several other studies have also 
demon
strated that preoperative acupuncture lessens the need for opioids during and 
after surgery.
[4,10,15,16] 
Reducing opioid consumption through the introduction of safely 
administered acupuncture poses a potential net improvement for patient safety and 
hospit
al costs.
 
 
Perhaps the most commonly cited benefit of acupuncture is increased relaxation and 
decreased anxiety, and several systematic reviews have reported that these benefits 
persist in the clinic.
[1,3,17] 
For patients with anxiety, depression, or other
 
mental ailments, 
this is an important finding considering the substantial evidence linking poor mental 
health with significantly worse surgical outcomes.
[18
-
27] 
For example, one systematic 
review that accounted for 53,562 patients undergoing THA concluded
 
that depression 
and anxiety were associated with increased postoperative pain, and another that 
accounted for 95,560 patients undergoing TKA found that the most consistent and 
significant indicator of dissatisfaction related to surgery was preoperative an
xiety.
[27,28] 
Despite this evidence that poor preoperative mental health is detrimental to both 
practitioners and patients of surgery, there are currently no guidelines for improving 
preoperative mental health conditions.
[25]
 
 
Preoperative acupuncture can 
serve as an ideal therapy to safely reduce preoperative 
anxiety and improve surgical outcomes. It has been repeatedly demonstrated as a safe, 
cost
-
effective, and time
-
effective procedure for reducing preoperative anxiety, 
postoperative pain, total opioid c
onsumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
while increasing patient satisfaction.
[4,13,29] 
However, medical practices in the United 
States have largely forgone the potential upsides of acupuncture due to minimal existing 
research undertaken within t
he country. Therefore, there is an opportunity for United 
States medical researchers and practitioners to demonstrate the potential for 
preoperative acupuncture as a safe and effective therapy to improve surgical outcomes 
for both patients and providers.
 
 
This proposal suggests a robust study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
preoperative acupuncture performed on high
-
anxiety patients undergoing THA or TKA 
at the Bone
-
and
-
Joint Institute (BJI) at Hartford Hospital. Evidence suggests that the 
outcomes o
f THA and TKA in particular are associated with preoperative anxiety and 
postoperative pain.
[30] 
Patients will be classified as high
-
anxiety based on having an 
APAIS

A
-
T (Appendix I) score greater than 10, a threshold used in previous studies.

OVERVIEW OF STUDY
 
DESIGN/INTERVENTION
 
 
3.1
 
Design
 
This is a prospective, open
-
label, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy 
and safety of preoperative acupuncture on high
-
anxiety patients undergoing TKA or 
THA. Patients scheduled for THA or TKA to be performed by one of the IRB approved 
ort
hopedic surgeons at the BJI will be screened for high preoperative anxiety one week 
prior to procedure in the PREPARE Center, the BJI’s preoperative services clinic, using 
printed copies of the APAIS questionnaire. The APAIS will be used as a screening too
l 
and is considered optional for the patient to complete and not a standard of care 
measure. High
-
anxiety patients consenting to the study will be randomized to receive 
either 1) preoperative acupuncture (Acupuncture) or 2) no intervention (Control).
 
Resul
ts from a quality study at the PREPARE clinic demonstrates that number of 
patients with high
-
anxiety entering the clinic is 30 per month. Accounting for the 
availability of investigators and surgeons, the study period is estimated to last 
approximately two
 
years to obtain the 50 patients, 25 per group that we aim to enroll in 
this study. There will be an interim analysis after enrolling 14
-
15 patients in each group 
(60%) to re
-
estimate the sample size using more appropriate data (see sample size 
estimate se
ction). Each patient will be enrolled in the study from the time of consent and 
will be followed up to 30 days postoperatively. Investigators performing the acupuncture 
will be licensed and certified throughout the study duration.
 
 
3.2
 
Randomization
 
Patients will be randomized immediately following the consenting process. 
Randomization will be achieved using a random number generator, which will randomly 
produce a 0, representing the Acupuncture group, or a 1, representing the Control 
group, for each 
patient. Patients will immediately be informed, for their convenience, of 
their group assignment given the non
-
blinded nature of the trial.
 
 
3.3
 
Acupuncture
 
Intervention
 
Prior to acupuncture treatment, all patients in the acupuncture group will receive a 
medic
al assessment including a review of the patient’s medical chart. The acupuncture 
intervention will include a combination of auricular and body acupuncture. The auricular 
points used will include: Shen men, Zero point, Tranquilizer point and Master cerebral
. 
The body point will be the wrist acupuncture point PC6. All points will be bilateral. With 
the patient seated, body and auricular points will be wiped with 70% isopropyl alcohol 
wipes. After about 1 minute of drying, the acupuncture needles will be inser
ted. The 
needles used on both ear and wrist points will be the DBC Detox
-
5 needles. They will 
be retained for approximately 20 minutes, removed and placed into a sharps container.

DATA
 
MANAGEMENT
 
A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will be assigned to the study. The 
responsibilities 
of the CRC will include project compliance, data collection, abstraction 
and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, 
and coordination of the activities of the protocol study team.
 
 
The data collected for this st
udy will be entered into a database in an HHC
-
licensed 
version of REDCap. Source documentation will be available to support the 
computerized patient record and will be stored at the clinical anesthesia research office 
in a double
-
locked environment. All ef
forts will be made to ensure maintenance of 
patient confidentiality and HIPAA compliance. All data will be maintained on the 
REDCap database which will be stored on a secure HHC server and access will be 
protected by password. This database will only be ac
cessible to the trained study 
personnel.

Data and Safety
 
Monitoring
 
The study inves
tigators will be responsible for the safety of the study participants, and 
they will stress the importance of reporting adverse events to the participants.
 
Investigators will also consistently monitor each participant for adverse events. Adverse 
events, re
lated or unrelated to the acupuncture procedure, will be reported, attributed, 
and graded for severity by the clinician and documented in EPIC. Serious adverse 
events or unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB.

PROTECTION OF HUMAN
 
SUBJECTS
 
Every effort will be made to ensure the safety of our patients and the confidentiality of 
their medical information. During the enrollment and consent process, all risks, benefits, 
side effects, and alternatives will be discussed. Also, it will be stressed
 
that this is a 
voluntary study and that the patient can withdraw without prejudice at any time.
 
 
Benefits
 
The potential benefit of this study is that preoperative acupuncture is effective in 
reducing preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain in patients
 
undergoing lower 
extremity total joint arthroplasty. Such a reduction in postoperative pain and anxiety 
could potentially increase overall patient satisfaction. Further, patients will not be 
compensated for participating in this study, but they will recei
ve the acupuncture service 
at no cost.
 
Risks
 
The risks of participation include the risks associated with performing acupuncture 
include, but are not limited to, the following: minor bleeding, pain, pneumothorax, 
abdominal injuries, heart injuries, CNS inj
uries, neck injuries, eye injuries, peripheral 
nerve injuries, and infection.
 
 
Alternatives
 
The alternative to acupuncture for addressing high
-
anxiety patients is the standard of 
care. For pain, this includes the use of standard pain medications, including
 
opioid and 
non
-
opioid analgesics, in addition to regional blocks. For anxiety, this includes the 
regular use of anxiolytic medications and psychological consultation referrals. These 
standard
-
of
-
care procedures will not be replaced by acupuncture and rath
er performed 
in adjunct. A patient’s decision on whether or not to participate in this study will not 
affect the availability of standard and supportive measures.

Voluntary Nature of Study
 
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Patients wil
l be informed of the extent of 
the risks, benefits, adverse events, alternatives/options for treatment, financial 
costs/burdens, and the voluntary nature of the study. The responsible investigator will 
ensure that this study is conducted in agreement with 
the Declaration of Helsinki 
(Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, Somerset West, and Edinburgh amendments). The study 
will

Adverse
 
Events
 
The incidence and severity of adverse events is highly dependent on the experience 
and skill of the practitioner, and when provided by a physician, acupuncture is accepted
 
as a safe treatment.
[29,36,37] 
Acupuncture
-
related adverse events occur in about 6% of 
cases; the vast majority of these are usually minor and most commonly include 
bleeding, discomfort, and residual pain at the insertion points.
[36] 
Serious acupuncture
-
 
r
elated adverse events occur in just 0.024% of cases.
[37] 
Of these, the most frequently 
cited include: pneumothorax, abdominal injuries, heart injuries, CNS injuries, neck 
injuries, eye injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, and infection.
[37] 
Though acupunct
ure
-
 
related deaths have been reported, the incidence is statistically negligible, and even 
surveys covering more than 3 million acupuncture treatments report no cases of 
death.
[38]
 
 
Adverse events will be monitored during and after acupuncture and through
out 
admission. Events will be recorded as safety measures. Emergency visits and hospital 
readmissions stated in EPIC will be recorded up to thirty days postoperatively.
 
 
10.3
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
 
Reporting
 
The risks associated with acupuncture are viewed
 
as minimal risk. Although we have 
assessed the proposed study as one of minimal risk, the potential exists for anticipated 
and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute 
risk of this procedure in this context.

11.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
Sample Size
 
There was only one study
[14] 
that provided appropriate data for a power analysis for the 
primary outcome, pai
n, and one study that provided appropriate data for the primary 
outcome, anxiety
[39]
. The sample size requirements based on the results from each of 
the studies are displayed in the following tables. Since our time points differ from these 
two studies, we 
have chosen to perform an interim analysis after approximately 55
-
60% 
(14
-
15 per group depending on enrollment pace) of patients have been enrolled in order 
to re
-
estimate the required sample size. Our current sample size enrollment (50 
patients) is simply
 
based on what the study team considers the maximum number of 
patients that can be feasibly enrolled within the anticipated study enrollment time
-
frame. 
As shown, this number of patients (50) are more than double that of the estimated 
sample size needed (2
2) at 90% power, while accounting for 10% attrition.

An interim analysis was performed using data for the primary outcomes, 
pain 
and 
anxiety
. Of note, this interim analysis was performed to re
-
estimate the sample size 
since the initial sample size estimate was based on a study with different time points 
than
 
this study. Therefore, the sole purpose of this interim analysis was to re
-
estimate 
the sample size, and was not to test the
 
hypothesis.
 
 
 
For the primary aim 
pain
, based on data from the first 31 patients enrolled, our sample size 
calculation indicates t
hat a minimum of 26 subjects per group are needed using a repeated 
measures design (each subject is measured 4 times) with 2 groups for a total of 52 
subjects. This design achieves 81% power to test factor B1 if a Geisser

d with a 5% significance level and the actual effect standard 
deviation is 0.255 (an effect size of 0.40319). We estimate an attrition rate of 10%, which 
will require 58 subjects; however we will aim to enroll 60 subjects (30 per group).
 
For the second pri
mary aim 
anxiety
, we performed two sample size calculations. One 
based on the data of all 17 patients in the acupuncture group, and another excluding the 3 
patients for which protocol deviations were reported due to methods collecting the anxiety 
measure. 
With all 17 patients, the difference in the response of anxiety from pre to post 
acupuncture was normally distributed with a standard deviation 26.27. If the true difference 
in the mean response of matched pairs is 35.64, we will need to study 6 pairs of s
ubjects to 
be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability 
(power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis
 
is
 
0.05. With the 3 patients removed, the difference in the 
response of anxiety from pre to 
post acupuncture was normally distributed with standard deviation 26.588. If the true 
difference in the mean response of matched pairs is 39.14, we will need to study 6 pairs
 
of 
subjects to be able to reject the null hypothe
sis that this response difference is zero with 
probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null 
hypothesis
 
is
 
0.05.

Pain is the more appropriate primary outcome of the two primary outcomes to base 
the sample size on because there are 4 time points of data for each group for this 
variable. The other primary outcome, 
anxiety 
does not have a post measure for the 
co
ntrol group (per the study design), and therefore a within
-
group pre to post change 
in the acupuncture group is being performed to examine this outcome. We 
acknowledge that this within group design is weaker than the design to assess the 
pain outcome measu
re.
 
 
 
Statistical Methods
 
Patient demographic and clinical (including operative) characteristics will be compared 
between groups using an independent samples t
-
test if continuous data are normally 
distributed), or Mann Whitney U if continuous data are not 
normally distributed. A chi
-
 
square or Fisher’s exact test (if cell counts are <5) will be used to compare these 
characteristics between groups for categorical variables. All continuous variables will be 
expressed as mean±SD or median, IQR as appropriate. 
Categorical variables will be 
expressed as frequency (%).
 
 
The primary and secondary study outcomes will be compared between groups two 
ways. First, an independent samples t
-
test or Mann Whitney U test if deemed more 
appropriate for the scale data (which m
ay be considered ordinal) will be used to 
compare outcomes at each time point between the two groups. Second, a mixed model 
for repeated measures will be used to compare the study outcomes that are repeated 
over time (e.g., Pain). This model was chosen ins
tead of a repeated measures ANOVA 
due to the ordinal nature of the repeated outcome measures in addition to this test 
being more appropriate for non
-
normal residuals, missing data, as well as the ability to 
treat the time points as discrete categories or a
s true numbers, which accounts for any 
variability in when the measures are administered to patients.
 
We anticipate that the timing of the measures being administered may fluctuate slightly 
due to measures being taken PostOP.
 
 
All analyses will be conducted using SPSS version 26.0. P (2
-
sided) < .05 will be 
deemed the level of statistical significance.

You have been asked to participate in the research study, Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial to 
Assess Preoperative Acupuncture for Patients Undergoing Total Knee or Hip Arthroplasty. 
This research study is expected to last two years. The number of patients expected to be enrolled is 60.
The Hartford HealthCare Institutional Review Board (IRB) has reviewed the information in this consent 
document and has given approval for the study doctor to do the study.  An IRB is an independent committee 
established to help protect the rights of research subjects.  This does not mean the IRB has approved your 
participation in the study.  You must think about the information in this consent document for yourself.  You 
must then decide if you want to be in the study.
KEY INFORMATION FOR Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess Preoperative 
Acupuncture for Patients Undergoing Total Knee or Hip Arthroplasty:
We are asking you to choose whether or not to volunteer for a research study about acupuncture given before 
total knee or total hip replacement surgery, also known as total knee or hip arthroplasty. This page is to give you 
key information to help you decide whether to participate. We have included detailed information after this 
page. Ask the research team questions. If you have questions later, the contact information for the research 
investigator in charge of the study is below.
WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?
The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture given before total knee or hip replacement 
surgery reduces anxiety before surgery and pain after surgery in high-anxiety patients. High-anxiety participants 
in the study, whose anxiety will be determined a week prior to surgery using a validated questionnaire (the 
Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale [APAIS]), will be randomized to receive either a short, 
30-minute acupuncture procedure before surgery or to receive normal care procedures, also known as the 
standard of care procedures. These two groups will be compared by several outcomes: the patients’ anxiety and 
pain as well as by their opioid use, nausea and vomiting, and overall satisfaction after surgery. 
By doing this study, we hope to learn whether an acupuncture procedure given before total knee or hip 
arthroplasty is feasible as well as effective for reducing patient anxiety and pain. Your participation in this 
research will last about 7 to 10 days, beginning at the time of consent and ending when all outcomes are 
measured (satisfaction questionnaires may occur post-discharge over the phone).

WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?
The most important reasons you might choose to volunteer for this study are to benefit from the potential 
anxiety- and pain-reducing effects of the acupuncture treatment. In addition, you may experience a decreased 
need for pain medication as well as decreased nausea and vomiting after surgery. Overall, you may also 
experience greater satisfaction with your surgery due to these improvements. Your participation in this study 
will serve to aid the medical community by allowing further research of a medical intervention. 
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?
You may not benefit from the procedure, or you may not receive the procedure if you are randomized to the 
group that will not receive acupuncture.  Additionally, there may be risks involved. (see section B on page 4 for 
risks involved).
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer. You will not lose any 
services, benefits, or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunteer.
WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS OR CONCERNS?
The person in charge of this study is Pranjali Kainkaryam (Principal Investigator, PI) from the Hartford 
HealthCare Department of Anesthesiology. If you have questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding this study 
or you want to withdraw from the study his/her contact information is: Pranjali.Kainkaryam@hhchealth.org 
(email); (860) 972-2117 (phone). 
If you have any questions, suggestions or concerns about your rights as a volunteer in this research, contact 
representatives from the Hartford HealthCare Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) between the 
business hours of 8am and 5pm EST, Monday-Friday at 860-972-2893.

A.  The Purpose and procedures of this research
A.1.  What is the purpose of this research?
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether acupuncture given before surgery, or preoperative acupuncture, 
can reduce preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain in high-anxiety patients undergoing total knee or hip 
arthroplasty surgery. 
A.2.  What procedures are involved with participation in this research study?
Should you decide to participate in this study, you will finish reading this consent form, ask any questions that 
you have, and sign the last page. At that point, you will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive either 
acupuncture or standard of care (meaning the care that would be provided to you regardless of your 
participation in this study) prior to your surgery. You will have a 50% chance of receiving acupuncture before 
your procedure, or standard of care.  
Participants in the acupuncture group will undergo a preoperative acupuncture procedure, which will take place 
in your preoperative holding bay. First, an acupuncturist will explain the details of the procedure to you. After 
all questions/concerns are addressed, the acupuncturist will then begin the procedure. The procedure involves 
the placement of 10 small needles at 5 specific points on each side of your body, including on your ear and 
wrist, which will be cleaned with alcohol pads beforehand. The needles are inserted roughly 1 millimeter (about 
1/25 of an inch) into the skin. It will only last approximately 5 minutes to insert the needles. The needles will 
then remain inserted for approximately 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes, the needles will be removed by an 
acupuncturist of the study team, which, in addition to any questions and comments from the patient, will take 5 
minutes. The total procedure will last 30 minutes. 
Participants in both groups will be required to complete questionnaires and datasheets to measure their anxiety, 
pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and satisfaction. These will occur both in the preoperative area as well 
as in the postoperative area and over-the-phone if needed.
A.3.  Which of these procedures is experimental?  
The acupuncture procedure is experimental. Though acupuncture is routinely provided in our facility and others, 
it has not been provided in our facility immediately before surgery. 
A.4.  Where will participation take place?
Your study participation will take place at the Bone-and-Joint Institute (BJI) at Hartford Hospital, located at 32 
Seymour Street, Hartford, CT 06106. 
A.5.  How long will participation last? 
Your participation is expected to last between 7 to 10 days.

B. The possible risks, discomforts and side effects of the procedures are 
described below, including safeguards to be used for your protection.
The percentage of patients who experience complications related to acupuncture has been shown to be as high 
as 6%. The vast majority of complications related to acupuncture are minor and include local bleeding, 
discomfort, and residual pain at the insertion points. Serious adverse events have been shown to occur in 
0.024% of cases (about 2 out of 1,000) and include pneumothorax, abdominal injury, heart injury, central 
nervous system (CNS) injury, eye injury, neck injury, peripheral nerve injury, and infection. Death related to 
acupuncture has been reported; though, the frequency of this is so rare that the prevalence is unknown; there 
have been studies covering more than 3 million acupuncture treatment cases that reported no cases of death 
related to acupuncture. 
All measures will be taken to prevent potential adverse events related to acupuncture. Primarily, this will 
include having only highly skilled acupuncturists administering the acupuncture treatments. This will also 
include constant monitoring by the study team. 
C. There are possible benefits to you or others to be expected from your 
participation in this research.
There may be no direct benefit to you for participating in this study.   
Participants in this study randomized to receive the acupuncture treatment may experience one or more benefits 
due to the acupuncture treatment. While this study aims to measure acupuncture’s effect on anxiety before and 
after surgery, acupuncture has already been shown to promote feelings of relaxation and to reduce short-term 
anxiety immediately after the procedure’s completion. 
If you receive acupuncture, you may also experience a reduction in anxiety leading to your surgery as well as 
pain after your surgery, which we expect to find in this study. You may also experience reduced postoperative 
nausea and vomiting as well as a reduced need for opioids after surgery. Finally, you may also experience 
greater satisfaction with your overall surgical experience. 
If you are randomized to receive standard of care, you will not receive any potential benefits from the 
acupuncture treatment; however, you will receive the normal standard of care procedures. 
D. There are alternatives to participation in this study that you should 
consider.
Should you decide not to participate in this study, you will receive the standard of care preoperative treatment 
for your procedure. This may include, should your provider(s) deem it appropriate, the administration of anti-
anxiety or relaxation medications prior to procedure.

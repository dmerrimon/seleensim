 2 PRÉCIS  
 
Aggression refers to causing harm to some one who is motivated to avoid that harm 
(Anderson & Bushman, 2002). One key predictor of aggression is  the extent to which the victim 
believes that the provocateur acted in an intentionally hostile manner (e.g., being shoved on 
purpose) versus not intendin g to be hostile (e.g., being shoved by mistake; De Castro, Veerman, 
Koops, Bosch, & Monshouwer, 2002). Hostile attributional bias (HAB) refers to the tendency to 
attribute hostile intentions to the actions of others when contextual cues are ambiguous (Mili ch 
& Dodge, 1984). Hostile interpretations of provoking events are automatic and require slow and 
effortful mental processing to replace (Gilbert & Malone, 1995; Carlston & Skowronski, 1994, 
1995; Winter & Uleman, 1984; Wilkowski, Robinson, & Troop -Gordon 2010). Differences 
between the cognitive accessibility of hostile vs. non -hostile concepts is an important predictor 
of HAB and aggression (e.g., Bartlett et al., 2009; Meier and Robinson, 2004; Graham and 
Hudley, 1994). Training programs that emphasize in creasing the accessibility of non -hostile 
concepts in the face of ambiguous information and reinforce inhibiting rapid hostile attributions 
may reduce HAB (Hawkins and Cougle, 2013).  In a previous study (WRAIR #2574), a training 
task called Hostile Bias Mo dification Training (HBMT), developed jointly by WRAIR and ARL 
significantly reduced HAB on a validated measure . The present study would extend these 
findings to determine if HBMT can reduce actual expressions of low -intensity, normal 
aggressive beha vior ( e.g., angry driving ) assessed via anonymous surveys.  
The study would utilize up to 400 volunteers (200 completers)  recruited via an online 
commercial recruitment platform to participate in an online study.  Volunteers will be asked to 
participate at two time-points. At time -point one, volunteers would  be randomly assigned to  
complete one of two versions of HBMT . One version is designed to train the brain  (rehears e and 
reinforce)  to seek positive interpret ations of  ambiguous social cues and to inhibit thou ghts and 
behaviors related to hostility. The second is  a placebo version that is not expected to affect 
attitudes, cognitions, or behaviors . These versions were validated in a prior study (WRAIR 
#2574).  Volunteers will also complete some brief surveys to a ssess state emotion , trait anger , and 
HAB. Volunteers will be asked to return between 24 and 96 hours later to complete another brief 
measure of HAB , state emotion , and a brief self -report survey about their online  (public behavior 
only) , driving, and other behaviors over the preceding 24 hours. We hypothesize  that volunteers 
who receive the genuine training will display the less hostile bias and report lower anger and 
aggression  in their daily behaviors when assessed at the second time -point.  
If successful, these findings would provide evidence that HBMT is effective in affecting 
real-life behaviors and help convince potential stakeholders of the value of HBMT.  Future 
research could validate effectiveness in operati onal units as well as with un healthy populations 
(e.g., anger management groups).  Future research could also test the effectiveness of HBMT on 
behavioral health outcomes for usage by clinicians and portable use by individuals with 
unhealthy hostile bias and problems with social  aggression when isolated from traditional 
behavioral health care  (e.g., far forward deployed units) .

 3 STUDY SUMMARY  
3.1 Objective s 
 
Primary  objective of the present protocol is: 
 
a. Evaluate the effect  of hostile bias modification training ( HBMT ) on real-life behaviors  
(reducing typical public displays of aggression) and emotions (reducing anger) . 
 
Secondary  objective of the present protocol is: 
 
b. Identify shifts in HAB as an  underlying  cognitive  mechanism linking HBMT to behavior  
change . 
 
3.2 Target Popul ation and Number of Volunteers  
 
The target population for this study is adult male and female volunteers. The study requires up to 
400 volunteers  (200 completers) successfully  complete the study to run statistical analyses. We 
anticipate up to 50% drop -out between study session 1 and 2 as attrition is high in MTurk 
populations (Mason and Suri, 2012).  A “completer” is defined as completing the HBMT with at 
least 60% of the stems completed correctly and participating at both T1 and T2.  
 
3.3 Study Design, Methodology, and Experimental Manipulations  
 
The study consists of  a two group  design . Assignment to each of the two experimental conditions 
is determined randomly upon  the volunteers’ arrival  to the study webpage . However, the website 
will be programmed to achieve equal sample size across the two groups.  The duration of 
participation for each volunteer is estimated to be about 60 minutes  (total, including both time -
points) . Volunteers will complete the following as  part of the study:  
 
a. HBMT: Volunteers will complete a computer -based hostile bias modification training 
where they are instructed to complete  word fragments (words with missing letters) to 
form non -aggressive words . The word fragments are based on similar stimuli used in 
prior research on hostile bias (Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks, 2003 ; DeWall & 
Bushman, 2009 ). This task was validated in a previous study (WRAIR # 2574).  
b. Angry Cognitions Scale /HAB measure : This measure asks respondents to read 
hypothetical scenarios and indicate how they would interpret and respond to them. It was 
developed by Martin and Dahlen (2007) and will be used as a measure of HAB.  
c. Trait anger  Scale : Brief measure of tr ait anger val idated by Wilk et al., (20 15). 
d. State Aggression Survey: This survey is adapted from several others in the literature to 
measure variance along the normal spectrum of aggressive behaviors in daily life that the 
average person might display (Álvarez -García, et al., 2016; Deffenbacher, et al., 2001; 
Deffenbacher, J. et al., 2002). The survey specifically asks about driving behaviors (e.g., 
yelling at other drivers), and public online behaviors (e.g., posting mean comments on 
social media), as well as generic public displays of aggression items (e.g., Gotten angry 
and slammed a door).   
WRAIR 2628 -HBMT Online Study II -V4-10-SEP-19

 e. State Emotion  Survey:  A short measure of state  (current or recent)  emotions  over the 
preceding 24 hour period adapted from Goldberg et al., (2006)  and Quartana and Burns 
(2007) . 
f. Demographic questions: Volunteers will be asked to provide their age (whole number,  
not birth date) , highest level of education,  and gender.  These will be used as statistical 
controls in analyses.  
 
Volunteer recruitment and data collection will be done onli ne by ARL AI’s and/or staff with 
assistance from volunteerscience.com  (the online experimental platform). Volunteers will be 
recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)  to the experimental webpage  and complete 
informed consent  electronically . A description of this clinical trial will be available on 
http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Additionally a copy of the informed consent may be posted to a 
public website no later than 60 days after enrollment is completed.  
 
Time -point 1: Volunteers will be rand omly assigned to complete either the  real or fake HBMT. 
Volunteers will also complete a brief vignette r eading HAB activity, a brief measure of trait 
(what is typical for them) aggression, and state (how they have felt recently) anger.   
Time -point 2: Volun teers will be asked to return no sooner than 24 hours and no later than 96 
hours from when they completed time -point 1 to complete a following up HAB assessment 
(second vignette interpretation task)  and brief surveys asking about  aggressive behaviors  and 
state anger  during the preceding 24 hour period.  
 
Mechanism for inviting volunteers back to complete time -point 2: The two -time point nature of 
this study will be explained to volunteers in both the study advertisement and in the ICD. 
Additionally, a featur e on MTurk will allow the volunteerscience.com  to send a daily  e-mail to 
time-one volunteers inviting them back to time -point two. This can be done without MTurk 
revealing the e -mail addresses of the volunteers.  The e -mail will remind volunteers to please 
return at any point between 24 hours and 96 hours from when they completed the first time -
point.  
 
Upon completion  of each time -point , the webpage will thank volunteers for their participation. 
Volunteers will be paid  part of the payment at the end of time -point one and the remaining 
payment after completing time -point two  (see section  10.6). 
 
3.4 Efficacy Data Collected  
 
Main endpoints for the  study include: self -report measures of HAB  and self -report measures of 
daily aggressive behaviors .  
 
3.5 Statistical Procedures  
 
SPSS will be used for statistical analyses. Specific tests to be used are described in Section 9.

 4 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
4.1 Primary Objectives  
 
a. To determine the efficacy of  HBMT in reducing  anger and  aggressive behavior in daily 
life. 
b. To deter mine the longevity and depreciation of HBMT effects on real life anger and 
aggression over time (between 24 -96 hours post HBMT).  
 
4.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
a. Test the underlying role of HAB as a mechanism linking HBMT to changes in anger and 
aggressive behavior.  
5 HYPOTHESES  
 
5.1 Primary Hypotheses  
 
a. Hypothesis 1: Relative to volunteers in the fake-training condition , those volunteers who 
receive the rea l HBMT at time -point one will report less state anger and aggression at 
time-point two . 
b. Hypothesis 2 : Effects  of HBMT on state anger and aggression in daily life will be 
mediated by between group differences in HAB.  
 
5.2 Secondary Hypothes is 
 
a. The effects of HBMT on anger and aggression will diminish over time. In other words, 
larger effects of HBMT will be observed f or volunteers returning sooner (vs later)  after 
time-point one . 
b. We anticipate the most robust impact of HBMT on anger and aggression on high versus 
low stress days (per self -report).  
 
6 BACKGROUND AND MILITARY RELEVANCE  
 
6.1 General Background  
 
 Aggression refers to causing harm to someone who is motivated to avoid that harm 
(Anderson & Bushman, 2002). Reactive or counter -aggression refers to aggression that results 
from being provoked or threatened as opposed to unprovoked aggression perpetrated for 
utilitarian goals (Dodge & Coie, 1987). However, provocations do not always result in reactive 
aggression. Indeed, the psychological literature is replete with examples of variables that 
moderate reactive aggression (See Anderson & Bushman, 2002). One key moderator is the 
extent to which the victim believes that the provocateur acted in an intentionally hostile manner 
(e.g., being shoved on purpose) versus not intend ing to be hostile (e.g., being shoved by mistake; 
De Castro, Veerman, Koops, Bosch, & Monshouwer, 2002). Hostile attributional bias (HAB) is 
the tendency to attribute hostile intentions to the actions of others  when contextual cues are 
ambiguous (Milich & Dodge, 1984). Elevated HAB is observed in both reactive aggress ors and 
premeditated ag gressors.  Indivi dual differences  such as trait hostility (e.g ., Wingrove and Bond, 
WRAIR 2628 -HBMT Online Study II -V4-10-SEP-19 
 
Page 13 of 54 
 
13 
 2005; Wilkowski et al., 2007) and gender (e.g., Matheson et al., 2011) are also correlated with  
HAB.   
 
 There are many reasons why people may attribute hostile intentions to  the ambiguous 
actions of others.  For instance, HAB is predicted  by situational factors. These include exposure 
to real or imagine violence , such as violent video games  or music  (Anderson et al., 200 3; Bartlett 
et al., 2009), social exclusion (DeWall et al ., 2009), intoxication (See Osgood and Muraven, 
2018), or even exposure to alcohol related information (Subra et al., 2010).  Furthermore, 
developmental factors such as rejection from peers in childhood (Coie and Dodge, 1988) and 
harsh parenting (Weiss, Dod ge, Bates, and Pettit, 1992), can predispose strong HAB.  
 
 In general, HAB is more likely to occur in individuals and  situations where non -hostile 
interpretations are less salient  than hostile  interpretations . Indeed, differences in  the cognitive 
accessibility of hostile vs. non -hostile concepts is an important predictor of HAB and aggression. 
For example, research participants who complete ambiguous word fragments to form hostile -
themed words, tend to attribute more blame and react more aggressively to provocations from 
confederates (e.g., Bartlett et al., 2009). Further, cognitive priming tasks have successfully 
moderated blame attributions of negative events (Meier and Robinson, 2004; Graham and 
Hudley, 1994).  Indeed, even priming conceptually related ideas such as hot vs . cold temperature 
can moderate the likelihood of HAB (DeWall and Bushman, 2009).  In a similar vein, 
manipulations that disrupt higher -order cognitive functions (e.g., cognitive load) can lead to 
heightened aggressi on in response to provocations (Osgood and Muraven, 2016).  
 
 The psychological literature  provides several reasons hostile attributions are often more 
salient than non -hostile attributions.  First, contextual cues related to the harm incurred as a result 
of a provocation are often  more salient than cues related to mitigating factors (Finkel et al., 2012; 
Giancola et al., 2009). For example, suppose an individual cuts others in line at a checkout 
counter. The offense and the resultant inconvenience to others is obvious , whereas possible 
mitigating factors (e.g., a store employee  may have told the person to cut the line) are often less 
noticeable.  This perception bias is more likely when attention is restricted (Osgood & Muraven, 
2017). Second, general attribut ional biases, such as the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 
1977) often operate by overemphasizing the role that an individual’s intentions played in their 
behavior and underestimating the influence of situational factors. This issue is compounded 
when an individual  makes attributions quickly as the less accessible non -hostile concepts may 
take more time to surface and affect cognition.   
 
 HAB is  an automatic process that requires slow and effortful controlled processing to 
override (Gilbert & Malone, 19 95; Carlston & Skowronski, 1994, 1995; Winter & Uleman, 
1984 ; Wilkowski, Robinson, & Troop -Gordon 2010). In other words, following provocation, a 
person’s immediate appraisal of the situation is typically hostile, with less hostile considerations 
taking mo re time to surface.  
 
 To increase the likelihood that ambiguous provocations will be interpreted as non -hostile, 
people must inhibit making attributions  or responding with aggressive behaviors until enough 
time has passed to consider non -hostile explanati ons for the provocation. For example, Finkel, 
DeWall, Slotter, Oaten, and Foshee (2009) found that participants responded more aggressively 
to their partner’s hypothetical infidelity if forced to respond immediately than if made to wait 10

 seconds . Similar ly, Osgood and Muraven (2016) reduced aggression in provoked research 
volunteers by imposing extra time to think about reasons to inhibit aggression. Training 
programs that emphasize increasing the accessibility of non -hostile concepts in the face of 
ambig uously hostile information and reinforce inhibiting rapid hostile attributions may reduce 
HAB. Indeed, Hawkins and Cougle (2013) demonstrated a computer -based HAB training that 
involved repeated exposure to either hostile or non -hostile explanations for a series of 
hypothetical provocations reduced HAB and aggressive behavior.   
 
 Hostile Bias Modification Training  (HBMT) is a new computer task training for reducing 
HAB developed by scientists  at WRAIR and ARL . The training is based on the Go/No -Go task 
(Fillmore et al., 2006 ) and L exical D ecision Task (Lepore and Brown, 2002 ). The training is 
theorized to  reduce bias by affecting two key factors that drive HAB: relative cognitive 
accessibility of hostile concepts and rapid attribution -making/aggressive re sponding  in response 
to ambiguously hostile cues . The training is  designed to prime trainees  to interpret ambiguous 
information as non -hostile  (by increasing the saliency of non -hostile concepts)  and to 
behaviorally commit to that interpretation quickly. F urther,  the training is designed to condition  
the individual to inhibit responding to hostile  interpretation s before reconsidering the possibility 
the information may be non -hostile.  Relatedly, the training  conditions the individual to inhibit 
responding  (behaviorally)  to hostile cues. Thus, the training is thought  to induce a non -hostile 
attribution bias while simultaneously training the inhibition behavior  in response to provoking 
cues. In a recent study (WRAIR #2574 ), online volunteers who completed one session of real 
HBMT displayed significantly less HAB when asked to interpret the motives of characters in 
hypothetical vignettes than volunteers who completed a fake version of the training. Although 
WRAIR #2574 demo nstrated HBMT can affect HAB  and anticipated behaviors in hypothetical 
situations , it did not assess real behaviors. Therefore, i t is still unclear if and how HBMT is able 
to affect actual behaviors and anger in real life. The present study would answer th is question . 
 
6.2 Military Relevance  
 
Hypersensitivity to ambiguous threats , hostile bias , and the resultant inappropriate application of 
aggression  are documented problems  that reduce force readiness ( Wilk et al., 2015 ), particularly 
following combat deployme nts. This research will continue to test  a platfor m that could be 
developed into a tool for Soldiers  to alleviate hypersensitivity to perceived threats following 
combat deployments. Further, if this experiment is successful, it would justify future efforts  to 
test this training in a mobile platform that could be used by operational forces in far forward 
environments where traditional behavioral health care is inaccessible. Under the Military 
Operational Medicine Research Program (MOMRP) Task Area W1A (Real -time Assessment and 
Intervention Development), the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command 
(USAMRMC) is conducting research addressing the potential utility of computerized cognitive 
processing optimization tools designed to enhance resilience and mitigate psychological injury. 
The results of this protocol will produce  empirical evidence concerning the efficacy  of HBMT  
for reducing anger  and aggression  in life . Approval of MOMRP (RAD III) core funding for this 
project was the result of a vetting pro cess that requires explicit consideration of military 
relevance.

 7 STUDY DESIGN  
 
7.1 Overview and Duration of Volunteer Participation  
 
In the present study, we propose to examine the effectiveness of HBMT on reducing anger and 
aggression  in up to 400 volunteers (200 completers) divided into two experimental conditions (n 
= 100 completers  in each group). The duration of participation for each volunteer is 
approximately 60 minutes  total across both time -points  (see Section 7.8 for procedure 
breakdown wi th estimated times).  
 
7.2 Determination of Sample Size  
 
200 volunteers  (100 completers  per condition)  are needed to achieve statistical power of 80% 
and equal groups . The previous (and only other) study to test HBMT found a large effect of the 
real (vs. placebo) training on HAB ( d = .78), when HAB was assessed immediately after HBMT. 
However effect sizes are expected to be smaller in the present study as actual behavior is being 
assessed and there is a greater time delay (24 -96 hours) between HBMT and the  behavioral 
assessment.  We will divide this effect size approximately in half ( d =.4) in our prediction for the 
second study. Given this effect size, a minimum of 200 completers who follow all task 
instructions will be needed to achieve 80% power.  
 
7.3 Populat ion to be Studied  
 
The target population for this study is adult male and female volunteers from the general 
population . 
 
8 METHODS  
 
8.1 Pre-Study Procedures: Advertisements and Recruitment of Volunteers  
 
Adult volunteers meeting eligibility ( see Section 8 .4) will be recruited by non -coercive means 
according to applicable US Army Regulations (ARs) . Volunteers will be recruited via postings 
listed on Amazon.com  Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ). MTurk  allows researchers to use 
Amazon.com to recruit participants for onli ne experiments in exchange for a small fee and 
payment to each participant for their time . This form of recruitment offers several advantages. 
Namely, it allows for a sample that is relati vely more representative of the general  (internet 
using) population than local convenience samples, substantially faster data collection, and larger 
sample sizes. Several recent empirical analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of MTurk 
sampl es have concluded that MTurk  samples are of comparable or better quality than 
undergraduate subject pools ( the most common source of vo lunteers in psychology research; 
Paolacci & Chandler, 2014) . Researchers have determined that MTurk samples are also  more 
representative of the national -population than local convenience samples (Berins ky, Huber, & 
Lenz, 2012). Furthermore, research testing classic psy chological effects using MTurk  versus 
undergraduate students on the same experiments report equivalent results (Goodman, Cr yder, & 
Cheema, 2013). T hese reports recommend using MTurk  for com puter experiments where 
minimal experimenter involvement is  needed. Consequently, MTurk  has become a popular 
methodology for collecting data in social -science studies, with over 700  recent articles using 
WRAIR 2628 -HBMT Online Study II -V4-10-SEP-19 
 
Page 16 of 54 
 
16 
 MTurk  for participant recruitment (Berinsky , Huber, & Lenz, 2012). Of special relevance to the 
present research, MTurk volunteers have been used in recent research by US Army research 
laboratories and US Army research scientists (e.g., Asher et al., 2017; Onal et al., 2014; Rajivan  
et al., 2016;  Roy et al., 2017).  HBMT was specifically tested using an MTurk sample previously 
(WRAIR  #2574) with large effect sizes observed.   
 
8.2 Study Location  
 
Volunteers will complete the study via their own internet -connected personal computers. All data 
will be collected by AI’s at ARL ut ilizing the Volunteerscience.com  platform, which is fully 
integrate -able with MTurk.  Volunteerscience.com  staff may provide technical assistance with 
programming the computer tasks designed by the study PI and AI ’s. Prospective participants will 
click a link on MTurk, which will redirect them to the experiment web -page hosted by 
volunteerscience.com . Data is collected and stored by volunteerscience.com . 
Volunteerscience.com  will transfer data files to AI’s/study staff who will transfer data to the PI . 
Volunteerscience.com  will maintain copies of data until the PI confirms receipt of data from 
Volunteerscience.com . MTurk will not receive any experimental data. The study files and data 
will be on Federal Risk and Au thorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA) authorized server s managed by Amazon Web Services . See 
section 11.2 for details on information assurance (IA) and operational security (OPSEC).  
 
8.3 Study Briefing and Infor med Consent  
 
Volunteers will be presented with an electronic version of the Informed Consent Document 
(ICD; Appendix C) on th e study webpage at the start of each time -point of the study. The ICD 
provides potential volunteers with information pertaining to study procedures, risks, and benefits 
related to participation in the study.  Volunteers will not be asked to add a signature or any 
personally identifiable information ( PII) to the ICD. However, volunteers will be asked to click a 
box indicating that they have read and understood the ICD, and agree to participate. If a 
volunteer clicks that they “do not agree” to participate, they will be redirected to a scree n that 
thanks them for their time and ends the study session.   
 
8.4 Volunteer Eligibility  
 
8.4.1 Determinatio n of Eligibility  
 
MTurk requires that all users  are at least 18 years old  to create an MTurk account . Prerequisites 
will be set to restrict participation to MTurk users who are located in the United States and/or 
other primarily English speaking countries.  
 
8.4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
 
All volunteers must meet the following criteria to be included in the study:  
a. Adult age d 18 and older  
b. Located in the United States or other primarily English speaking country.  MTurk  allows 
requestors to limit the ability to view a posting to only those within certain geographical 
regions.

8.5 Randomization and  Volunteer Assignment  
 
Volunteer assignment to each of the two experimental conditions is semi -randomized  (i.e. 
random except that computer ensure equal sample sizes across experimental conditions) . The 
randomized assigning of participants  is done by the study web-page/program at 
volunteerscience.com . The computer program randomly assigned volunteers to one o f the two 
conditions when they begin the study .  
 
8.6 Volunteer Identification  
 
Personally identifiable information ( PII) will not be collected. The only identifiers linking an 
individual to the study would be their MTurk ID. However, the MTurk ID does not contain PII 
and is a randomly generated alpha -numeric code  (e.g., A2IGSXYYGW2BHT). The platform 
being used to collect data ( volunteerscience.com ) will not transmit these MTurk ID’s to either 
the ARL or WRAIR research staff. Volunteersceince.com staff will replace the MTurk IDs with 
new random identifiers containing no PII. Thus, there are two levels of anonymity protecting 
volunteers.  
 
8.7 Study Materials  and Manipulations  
 
8.7.1 HBMT   
 
This is a training developed by the PI  (see Appen dix E), but based on the existing fragment 
lexical  decision task (Neely et al., 1989 ) and Go/No -Go task (Fillmore et al., 2006) . It was used 
and validated in a previous recent study (WRAIR #2574). This task is completed entirely on the 
computer. For this t ask, volunteers see incomplete word fragments  (one at a time) that appear at 
the cen ter of the computer screen. Most  of the word fragments  could be completed to form either 
aggressive or  non-aggressive words (e.g., “K I _ _” could be completed as either  an aggressive 
word,  “KILL” , or a non -aggressive word  “KISS” , “KILT”, etc. ). Some of the fragments  could 
only be completed to form  non-aggressive  words (e.g., HA _ PY), and the remaining fragments  
could only form aggressive words  (e.g., A _ _ ACK) . Volunte ers are instructed to respond to 
these cues  as quickly and accurately as possible by typing a complete word that can be formed 
from the fragment. Volunteers are randomly  assigned to either a  real-training  or a fake -training . 
Those in the real -training cond ition are told to try and complete each fragment  to form a 
positive /non-aggressive  word and to refrain  from typing altogether  if the fragment  could only be 
completed as a negative /aggressive  word. Participants are given 12 seconds  to respond to each 
cue. Volunteers randomly assigned to the fake training will be told to complete the fragments 
with the first word that comes to mind. This fake training  still exposes volunteers to the training 
stimuli and a computer task, but does not train inhibition or selectively prime non -hostility , 
which are the hypothesized mechanisms of the training.  We do not believe there is a meaningful 
risk this task could unintentionally prime increased hostility given that prior research found no 
evidence of this, despite prio r research including experimental conditions that were designed to 
use this this training to increase hostility (WRAIR # 2574). Actual responses in this task are not 
the primary outcome being measured.  Rather, the HBMT is used to prime either hostile 
attribution bias or a reduct ion in hostile attribution bias and the key outcome measures are 
reported HAB, anger, and aggression.

8.10 Unanticipated Problems  
 
8.10.1  Definition of Unanticipated Problem (U AP) 
 
As per SOP no: UWI -B-004, unanticipated problems include any unforeseen or unexpected 
incident or experience (including an unanticipated adverse event) that occurs during the conduct 
of the research and that was not described in the information reviewed by the IRB (i.e. research 
protocol or informed consent document). Unanticipated problems can include subject complaints 
or protocol violations . 
 
8.10.2  Definition of Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Volunteers or Others 
(UPIRTSO)  
 
As per SOP no: UWI -B-004, UPIRTSO include any incid ent, experience or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (meaning that there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or 
outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research) given (a) the 
researc h procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation i n the research (in this guidance document, 
possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects o r others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
8.10.3  Reporting of UAPs and UPIRTSOs  
 
1. UAPs & UPIRTSOs will be reported to HSPB, as applicable.  
 
2. All UPIRTSOs will be reported promptly to HSPB upon their identification (within 48 
hours), and a report will be provided to HSPB within 10 working days.

 8.11 Data Disposition  
 
Volunteerscience.com  uses servers located in the geographic US that are owned and o perated by 
Amazon Web Services (AWS). Volunteerscience.com  will also assist with the technical aspects 
of collecting the data and recruiting participants (e.g., posting the advertisement to MTurk; 
managing the webpage). During the course of the study, data will be stored on secure servers  
with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) and Defense 
Information System s Agency (DISA) authorization s at the moderate impact level or higher  (all 
US-based A WS servers meet these criteria) . Data from participants are always uploaded from 
participant’s computer to the volunteerscience.com  server using secure, encrypted SSL 
connections. Login to access the data on the server will be retained by only the PI /AI’s  and 
authorized research staff. P asswords are always sent to the server over secure, encrypted SSL 
connections.  See Section 11.2 for details on Information Assurance and Operational Security.  
Upon the completion of data collection, all data will be downloaded via .csv files (or equivalent ) 
and deleted from AWS servers . All electronic data and files  will be encrypted and kept in a 
password -protected folder on the MPB network drives (CMPN, WRAIR) with access restricted 
to study staff members on CAC -protected computers at WRAIR.  Duplicates of  data will also  be 
stored on secure drives at ARL. All records (paper and electronic) will be retained for at least 
three years following completion of the research (submission of the study closeout report).  No 
personally identifying information will be collected as part of this research. The only identifiers 
are the public MTURK user -names, which are random alpha -numeric monikers that do not 
contain PII. Further, even these MTURK u ser-names will not be retained. Volunteerscience.com  
replaces the MTurk user names with new random alpha -numeric codes prior to providing data to 
AIs. We do not believe there is a chance these data could be re -identified later. There are no 
current plans to share data with any third parties ; any future sharing of data will be addre ssed 
under an amendment to the protocol, with appropriate agreements in place, as applicable.  
 
8.12 Volunteer Termination and Withdrawal  
 
Situations that may cause an early termination or withdrawal of a volunteer from the study are 
described below.  
 
8.12.1  Reasons for Termination  
 
8.12.1.1  Self-Withdrawal Criteria  
 
Volunteers are always free to withdraw themselves from the study at any time without prejudice 
or penalty . They are not required to disclose a reason for their decision. Volunteers who 
withdraw themselves from the  study are compensated as indicated in section 10 .6 “Financial 
Incentives to Volunteers.”  
 
8.12.1.2  Other Termination Criteria  
 
In rare circumstances, a volunteer’s participation may be terminated without his/her consent if 
unplanned conditions occur ( e.g., website  failure ). In these cases, volunteers will be compensated 
as indicated in Section 10 .6, “Financial Incentives to Volunteers.”

21 
 8.12.2  Termination and Withdrawal Procedures  
Individuals may withdraw by  simply navigat ing away from the study webpage without 
completion or not return ing for the second time point. These withdrawals will not be considered 
to be associated with a UPIRTSO and/or significant and adverse reaction and therefore not 
reported to HSPB. Volunteers are not required to contact a research team member before they 
withdraw. However,  if the research team discovers evidence of a withdrawal associated with a 
UPIRTSO or significant and adverse reaction to the study,  (e.g., if a volunteers chooses to 
contact the PI or other team member about their withdrawal and it appears to be associated with 
a UPIRTSO and/or significant and adverse reaction  to the study)  this will be promptly reported 
to the WRAIR IRB within 48 hours  [via e -mail to the HSPB electronic mailbox 
(usarmy.detrick.medcom -wrair.mbx.hspb@mail.mil ) and the HSPB Point of Contact (POC)] . 
 
8.13 Quality Control and Assurance  
 
All applicable MPB and ARL standard operating procedures will be foll owed.  
 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
9.1 Analyses for Main Study Hypotheses  
 
Between group differences (comparing real vs.  fake HBMT) in the change in state anger and 
state HAB  across time points (change from time -point on to time -point two) will be primarily 
assessed with a mixed -designs ANOVA.  Between group differences in state aggression 
measured at time -point two will be assessed with a General Linear Models (GLM) analysis 
controlling for trait anger  and demographics (age and gender).  
 
We will also plot effect of group comparing real vs. fake HBMT and time between time -points 
(24-96 hours) on change scores (time 2 anger/aggression minus time 1 anger aggression) and 
analyze th is using a linear regression with an interaction term.  
 
Lower order effects will be tested using corrected Fishers LSD, Tukey, Scheffe, or other 
pairwise test as appropriate. Appropriate data -transformations may be used as necessary to 
satisfy significance  test requirements.  Lower order effects will also be assessed with pairwise 
dependent means t -tests. Age and gender will be controlled as covariates. Mediation analyses (if 
used) will be performed using non -parametric Monte -Carlo bootstrapping procedures u sing 
PROCESS (see Hayes, 2017).  
 
We may use age , gender,  and trait measures as control variables in analyses.  
 
9.2 Level of Significance to be used  
 
Determination of statistical significance for all analyses will be α = 0.05 . In the case of 
directional significance tests (e.g., tests using t -distributions), one-tailed tests will be used for a-
priori directional hypotheses  (Section 5.1) and two -tailed for non -directional hypotheses and 
post-hoc hypotheses).  
 
WRAIR 2628 -HBMT Online Study II -V4-10-SEP-19

22 
 9.3 Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analyses are planned.  
 
9.4 Accounting for Mi ssing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
 
Missing data will be identified as such in the database and will not be imputed or replaced for 
analytic purposes. Little’s Missing Completely at Random ( MCAR ) test (Little, 1988) will be 
used to confirm that all missing data were missing “completely at random”. Participants with 
small amounts of missing data (≤ 15%) will be excluded from analyses pairwise, whereas 
volunteers with large amounts of missing data ( >15%) will be excluded listwise. Outliers are 
defined as individual scores that fall beyond an acceptable range  (1.5 inter -quartile ranges above 
the third quartile or below the first quartile) . Outliers will be identified as such in the database, 
and will not be included in data analyses, or will be transformed as appropriate for use in the data 
analytic strategy.  
  
9.5 Procedures for Reporting Deviations fr om the Original Statistical Plan  
 
Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan will be described a nd justified in a protocol 
amendment and/or in the final report, as appropriate.  
 
9.6 Selection of Volunteers to be Included in Analyses  
 
See section 9 .4 for situations where volunteer data will be excluded listwise versus pairwise.  
 
10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Volunteer Identification and Confidentiality  
 
All data are considered private and confidential, and observations, responses, and other personal 
data are coded so that personal identification is not possible from data entered into information 
systems. No PI I is collected by research staff as part of the study. PI, AI, and/or other research 
team members will not solicit PII from volunteers. If volunteers contact the PI, AI, or other 
research team member in a way that reveals PII (e.g., revealing identity in an e-mail to the PI 
asking a question about the study), the team member will keep these communications 
confidential and stored in secure drives at WRAIR and/or ARL.  
 
10.2 Risks to Volunteer for Participating  
 
The primary risk s to the volunteer includes breach o f confidentiality. However, breach of 
confidentiality is minimized due to only the MTurk handle being used.  There is no perceived risk 
of the information lost, stolen, or compromised.  
 
10.3 Benefits to Volunteers for Participating  
 
There are no direct benefits to the participants in this study.  Participants may find some aspects 
of the study interesting, entertaining, and/or thought provoking. Participants may also enjoy the

 good feeling that comes with knowing they contributed to science. For science, we expect  that 
the information we learn from this research will help guide the development of tools to help 
improve people’s lives.  
 
10.4 Precautions to Minimize Risks to Volunteers  
 
Volunteers will be told during the informed consent process that they may withdraw or r efuse to 
complete portions of the study for any reason without penalty. Participants will be given the 
contact information for the Prin cipal Investigator and WRAIR HSPB to contact should they have 
any questions related  to the experiment.  
 
10.5 Risks to Study Personnel  
 
There are no anticipated risks to study personnel.  
 
10.6 Financial Incentives to Volunteers  
 
Volunteers will be paid up to $5 for their participation in this study. All volunteers who complete 
time-point  one of the study will receive $3 and volunteers will receive an ad ditional $2 if they 
complete time -point  two of the study . This rate is standard pay for MTurk work (See Hitlin, 
2016). Most MTurk tasks pay 10 cents or less and result in less than an equivalent hourly wage 
of $5.  Volunteers wi ll not be paid for participation in a time point if they do not complete an 
entire time point  (i.e., progress through each activity/survey and reach the end screen; volunteers 
may skip any question they do not wish to answer on surveys without affecting pa yment) . If a 
volunteer is terminated from the study as a result of website, server, or study program related 
failures (e.g., server goes down during study), they may request payment by contacting the PI 
directly. The PI will ask Volunteersceince.org to ver ify that the server/website failure had 
occurred and if so to pay the volunteer. The approval authority of such requests is the PI.  
Volunteerscience.com  will track the performance of each volunteer  using their MTurk handle  
and calculate compensation appropriately without sharing any PII (including MTurk handle) 
with ARL or WRAIR staff.  
 
10.7 Distribution of Volunteer Payments  
 
Payment is made to partic ipants via their MTurk account.   
 
11 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
 
11.1 Access to Source Data / Documents   
 
The investigators and study staff (e.g., research assistants ), members of the WRAIR HSPB , 
representatives of the U.S. Army, USAMRMC, DoD, and other government agencies are 
authorized access to the study data as part of their duties and part o f their responsibility to protect 
human volunteers in research.

 11.2 Information Assurance and Operational Security   
 
11.2.1  Information Assurance  
Data collection will utilize the platform volunteerscience.com; d uring data collection perio d, the 
data will be stored on Amazon Web Services  servers . Data /responses  from participants are 
always uploaded to the experimental web page using secure, encrypted Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) technology, which protects data using both server authentication and data encryption, 
ensuring that data are safe, secure, and available only to ARL AI’s using valid login credentials 
for the account.  ARL staff will download data and provide to WRAIR staff.  The PI will maintain 
the data on secure MPB network drives.   
All AWS servers located within the USA are authorized by the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management Program ( FedRAMP) and the Defense Information Systems 
Agency (DISA)  for storage of federal government (including DoD) data at the moderate impact 
level (so me sites are also authorized for high impact level data). Moderate impact level 
authorization allows storage of data where  the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
would result in serious adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals.  
Physical access to buildings containing AWS servers is strictly controlled both at the perimeter 
and at bui lding ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion 
detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two -factor 
authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitor s and contractors 
are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized 
staff.  
Amazon facilities are equipped with fire detection and suppression equipment, multiple backup 
power systems, and climate and temperatur e control. Servers are decommissioned  and disposed 
using processes that prevent unauthorized access to data.  
The servers reside behind high -availability firewalls and are monitored using Amazon's 
proprietary systems for detection and prevention of various  threats including denial of service, 
man in the middle, IP spoofing, port scanning, and packet sniffing. Automated network security 
audits are conducted to the standards and requirements of the SANS/FBI security test, the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Secur ity's published recommendations and the Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standard.  
The PI will monitor volunteerscience.com  for any notifications regarding security breaches 
and/or potential security breaches. In the event of a security breac h, this wil l be considered a 
major deviation (see Section 1 1.4.1).  
Upon the completion of data collection, all data will be downloaded via .csv files (or equivalent) 
and deleted from AWS  servers . At the completion of the study, ARL staff will download data 
from Volun teerscience.com  without any PII (or MTurk handles -Volunteerscience.com  replaces 
these with new random alphanumeric ) and provide the data to WRAIR staff. The PI will 
maintain the data on secure MPB network drives. This study meets ARL’s IMD standards and 
requirements.

 11.2.2  Operational Security  
 
All study materials, presentations, and publications, will receive approval from the WRAIR 
public affairs officer and operational security office prior to release.  
11.3 Protocol Amendments  
 
All amendments to the protocol and supporting documents must be reviewed and approved prior 
to implementation. Any amendments increasing the risks to the volunteers will require prior 
submission to HSPB for review and approval prior to implementation.  The informed consent 
document will be revised to concur with any significant amendment that directly affects 
volunteers, and will also be reviewed and approved with the amendment. New volunteers 
enrolled in the study will be consented with the most recent appr oved consent documents.  
 
11.4 Deviations from Protocol  
 
A log of a ll deviations from the protocol  will be maintained by the study staff, and reported to 
WRAIR HSPB , as applicable . Actions taken in response to the deviation, and the impact of the 
deviation will  be assessed by the PI (or AI assigned this duty) and recorded as significant or 
insignificant.  As it is common for MTurk volunteers to quit an MTurk task prior to completion, 
self-withdrawals will not, on their own, be considered a deviation (unless assoc iated with another 
deviation).   
 
11.4.1  Major Deviations  
All major deviations to the protocol that may have an effect on the safety or rights of the 
volunteer or the integrity of the study will be promptly (within 48 hours of identification  and a 
written r eport provided to HSPB within 10 working days) reported to the WRAIR HSPB and 
recorded in the study deviation log. The PI is responsible for making the initial determination; 
however, guidance may be obtained from the HSPB office.  Major deviations may incl ude, but 
are not limited to:  
a. Consent not obtained, or consent missing;  
b. Protocol procedures initiated prior to consent;  
c. Inclusion or exclusion criteria deviation without IRB approval;  
d. Delayed reporting of unexpected adverse events or unanticipated problems;   
 
11.4.2  Minor Deviations  
 
All minor deviations (i.e., deviations not considered to be major deviations) will be recorded in the 
study deviation log and reported WRAIR HSPB , as applicable . Minor deviations may include but are 
not limited to:  
a. Study procedure cond ucted out of sequence;  
b. Technical issues with website  
 
Note: Any of the above listed minor deviations may be assessed as major deviations depending on 
the severity and  frequency.

to the WRAIR HSPB.  
 
11.7 Publication Policy  
 
All data collected during this study may be presented in scientific forums orally and in written 
publications in scientific journals.  No identifying information for any of the volunteers in the study 
will be included in any presentation of data. All proposed publications or presentations will first be 
agreed to by any of the involved authors and then forwarded to the relevant authorities for review 
and clearance prior to submission, as per WRAIR policy .

Directions: Below are several scenarios followed by types of thoughts people often have 
in similar situations. For each scenario, imagine that what is being described has just 
happened to you. Then, read each thought and fill in the circle indicating how likely you 
would be to have that thought or one similar to it in that situation. There are no right or 
wrong answers and you are not being asked whether these thoughts are appropriate - 
only how likely you would be to have similar thoughts. Please respond to all of the  
thoughts for each scenario.

WRAIR 2628 -HBMT Online Study II -V3-10-JUL-19 
  Purpose . We are doing this research to see if how people respond on a word 
completion task relates to how they behave and respond to situations in the real 
world.  
 Duration.  Your part of the study will last about one hour total over two time -
points (24 -96 hou rs apart).  You will be asked to re -review this document and re -
consent to the study when you return for the second time point.  
 Procedures and Activities.  This is a two part research study. At time -point one, 
you will fill out some brief personality surveys . You will also read several short 
scenarios and imagine how you would react and/or interpret these situations in 
real life. You will also complete a vocabulary task where you will sort word 
fragments based on type as quickly as you can. This will take app roximately 35 
minutes. You will be asked to return in 24 -96 hours for part two where you will 
repeat a similar scenario reading activity as during time one and fill out a brief 
questionnaire about your recent behaviors. This second time -point will take abo ut 
25 minutes.   
 Risks.  Most studies have some possible harms that could happen to you if you 
join. Although efforts are made to protect your research study records, there is 
always a risk that someone outside the research team could get access to the raw 
data you provide. However, will not ask you for any personally identifiable 
information beyond your public MTurk ID and will securely transfer and store all 
data in order to protect your confidentiality.  
 Benefits . There are no direct benefits to participati ng in this study, but we do 
expect that you may find some aspects of the study interesting, entertaining, 
and/or thought provoking. You may also enjoy the good feeling that comes with 
knowing you contributed to science. For science, we expect that the info rmation 
we learn from this research will help guide the development of tools to help 
improve people’s lives.  
 Alternatives.  Participation is voluntary and the only alternative is to not 
participate.  
 
 
Why are we doing this research?  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are in the population of 
interest (English speaking adults). The purpose of this research study is to learn about how 
completing a vocabulary task where you are asked to create words from word stems with missing  
letters affects the way people interpret social situations and behave in real life based on the 
different types of instructions given during the task.  
 
This study is looking at a word completion task. This word completion task has not been well -
studied. T his means that this word completion task is considered experimental for influencing or 
predicting real life behaviors.  
 
There will be no more than 400 people taking part in the study at volunteerscience.com , over a 
period of five years.

HBMT Stimuli and Instructions  
Real Training:  
You will be presented with words with some letters missing (e.g., AP_ LE). These can be 
completed to form either negative, or non -negative (i.e. positive or neutral) themed words. Some 
fragments could be completed to form more than one type o f word.  
Your job is to complete the word fragments to make positive and/or neutral themed words. When 
a word fragment appears on your screen (e.g., KI _ _), try to think of either a positive (e.g., 
KISS) or neutral (e.g., KITE) word that can be made by co mpleting the fragment. As soon as you 
think of one, type the complete word into the text box and press enter. If the fragment can ONLY 
be completed to form a negative word (e.g., "KI_L" can only form "KILL"), then do not press 
anything and let the clock ex pire. You will have 12 seconds to respond. Please try to respond as 
quickly and as accurately as possible. The first five trials are for practice only and will not be 
recorded for data.

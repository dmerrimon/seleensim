 Significance    
Congenital heart disease occurs in approximately 32,000 infants per year. The American Heart Association 
estimates that 300,000 children under age 21 have a congenital heart defect, and approximately thirty -eight 
percent of these will have one or more surgical procedures.  This cohort of infants undergoing cardiac surgery 
represents an orphan disease population by NIH and FDA definitions.  Over the past 20 years increasing 
numbers of patients have undergone cardi opulmonary bypass for correction of congenital heart defects and or 
palliation of single ventricle type anatomy.  Technical advances have been made in these surgical procedures.  
However, progress has been limited with regard to pharmacological management of infants during the 
postoperative period.  Rapid extubation strategies have been applied at many centers in older infants 
and children2, 3 in attempts to reduce morbidity associated with prolonged intubation.  However  cardiac 
surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass in neonates and young infants still results in long periods in the 
cardiac intensive care units.  Long CICU stay is often due to prolonged time on mechanical ventilation 
with associated acute and long term morbidities.   Relatively few randomized clinical trials have evaluated 
agents provided to these infants af ter cardiopulmonary bypass.  The recent Triiodothyronine Supplementation 
in Infants and Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary B ypass (TRICC) clinical trial performed under IND # 
55367 demons trated a fairly straightforward and safe pharmacological approach to reducing mechanical 
ventilation time5.  However, further data is required in order to apply for the labeling change for triiodothyronine 
(liothyronine), which would impact current standard of care.   
 
Cardiopulmonary Bypass disturbs thyroid hormone homeostasis  in adults and children6, 7.  Initially, these 
disturbances were considered physiological  adaptations to surgical stress, which would modify oxygen 
consumption.   However, emerging evidence shows that inflammation initiated by CPB circuits inhibits the 
thyroid hormone axis at multiple levels  8 9 10.  Thus, marked and persistent depress ion of circulating hormones 
after CPB is directly caused by this  procedure which stimulates cytokine storm.   Circulating triiodothyronine 
levels related directly to clinical outcome in many studies in both adult and pediatric populations6, 7.  Several 
manipulations in the CPB circuitry such as addition of ultrafiltration as well as steroids have been used to reduce the impact of this inf lammatory response  with variable overall effects
11, 12.   Accordingly, specific 
therapy target ed at correcting disturbances in thyroid hormone homeostasis is  warranted.  Preclinical trials in 
animal models show that triiodothyronine supplementation improves cardiac function after reperfusion13.  The 
mechanisms of action still require elucidation.  R ecent studies in our laboratory indicate that thyroid hormone 
modulates substrate utilization to provide increased energy for contractile function13.  Controlled clinical trials 
performed in adults undergoing CPB have shown that T3 supplementation produces remarkably positive effects on clinical outcome parameters
7, 14, 15.  In particular, T3 supplement ation reduces atrial excitability in the 
postoperative period, manifested by reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation in the treated study population14.  
Despite these positive clinical outcome parameters triiodothyronine supplementation has not gained standard 
of care status in the adult population undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.  The reasons for this lack of gener al 
acceptance  are unclear but may relate to the generic status of triiodothyronine (marketed as liothyronine)  and 
absence of a particular champion pharmaceutical company.

Infants ex hibit particularly profound abnormalities in 
thyroid hormone homeostasis, which will be detailed in 
preliminary data.  Unexplained myocardial stunning 
occurs after CPB which relates directly to thyroid 
hormone levels, and prolongs time on mechanical 
ventil ation after surgery.  Data from several small clinical 
trials of T3 supplementation in general populations of 
children undergoing surgery for congenital heart defects 
(age:  0 – 18 years) suggested that T3 supplementation 
might be helpful in postoperative period1, 16, 17.   These 
results should be considered in the context of the state of 
clinical trials and the use of drugs for children undergoing 
cardiopulmonary bypass.  Approximately 80% of drugs  
used in children are not approved for pediatric indications.  
Most of the drugs used routinely in the intensive care unit 
have not been evaluated via randomized clinical trials in a 
pediatric population.   In fact, careful review of the literature 
shows evidence that some of these agents, for example 
dopamine and dobutamine,  have  poor benefit to safety 
ratios.  Dobutamine and dopamine are highly 
arrhythmogenic18.  Only milrinone has been evaluated in a  
controlled clinical trial in children19.   Although this drug 
has received labeling status by FDA and appears safe, the 
data supporting its use are  weakened  by a composite 
outcome parameter  that has never been validated.  
 
The Triiodothyronine during Cardiopulmonary bypass 
in Infants and Children (TRICC ) clinical trial 
tested the hypothesis that triiodothyronine supplementation reduces time on mechanical 
ventilation after cardiopulmonary bypass.   The FDA Office of Orphan Product Development 
funded the trial. The double blind,  placebo 
controlled,  multi- center study randomized 
almost 200 children under the age of 2 years, 
making it the largest drug trial performed in this 
population
5.   Triiodothy ronine supplementation 
did not significantly influence the primary 
clinical endpoint, the time to extubation, in  the 
entire study cohort.   However, we, the 
investigators , planned a priori analyses by age.  
We determined that  the T3 effect  is not 
heterogeneous  over all ages from birth to 2 
years, as evidenced by a significant treatment 
by age interaction when the study population was divided at the median age of 5 months.     Post -hoc  
analyses (Figure 1 and 2 ) revealed that T3 Figure   2.  TRICC trial data.  Kaplan -Meier curves for subjects < 5 
months age and subjects age > 5 months. (Statistics by Cox 
Proportional Hazards):   Hazard Ratio for the Triostat group among 
patients < 5 months was 1.72  (p=0.0216), and for > 5 months

substantially  benefited patients less than 5 months  of age by reducing the median time to extubation by 43 
hours when compar ed to placebo (T3-treated median- 55 hours; 95% CI, 44 –92;  Placebo 98 hours; 95% CI, 
71–142).  The study linked the positive clinical outcome to t wo potential mechanisms.  First , T3 treatment 
improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiographic parameters.  Second, T3 supplementation 
promoted a decrease in inotropic agent use  even though cardiac function improved  (Figure 3) .  In addition to 
these results , the trial demonstrated  the overall safety of T3 supplementation.  TRICC  provided data which can 
and likely has impacted care in these very young patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart diseases.  
However, the FDA denied application fo r a labeling change to include this indication as we did not demonstrate 
efficacy in the entire trial cohort , and the analysis by age was not a pre- specified primary endpoint  (0 – 2 years 
of age  was the prespecified primary endpoint ).  The FDA  would not consider a Triostat label change for cardiac 
surgery based on post -hoc analyses of a specific subgroup. Nor would they consider change in labeling 
regarding safety without demonstrating efficacy in the entire cohort.  Accordingly, the FDA sugges ted that 
another prospective trial in the specific age group with potential to benefit from treatment was necessary to 
apply for a labeling change.  Thus , we propose performing a second trial in infants less than 5 months of age. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the affect of T3 supplementation on all patients less than 5 months of 
age. Randomization will be stratified based on age (< or ≥ 4 weeks).    The age strata will be considered 
separately as secondary analyses.    
   
Study Design  and Innovation  
We will determine if triiodothyronine supplementation after 
cardiopulmonary bypass reduces time on mechanical ventilation 
in infants less than age 5 months .  
Innovation resides in the clinic al study design, which will 
capture time to extubation, cardiac in tensive care unit (CICU)  
days, discharge feeding tube use, and other endpoints so that 
the results can be evaluated in terms of clinical benefit, resource use, and quality of life components. Consideration of this 
treatment strategy from a clini cal, cost/value and Quality of Life  
stand- point  will show the entire picture .  Based on our TRICC 
results, we expect to find a meaningful effect on TTE, a slight 
decrease in resource use (CICU days) , an increase in QoL 
(more discharges on full oral feeds) associated  with T3  
supplementation; all for a therapy which has a minimal cost.

 Study Population  
The TRICC study identified patients < 5 months as those with the most potential benefit from triiodothyronine 
supplementation.   In TRICC we used Aristotle score to quantify the c omplexity and risk of the surgical 
procedure.20-22.  High risk was defined as an adjusted Aristotle score greater than 10.  The profile for study 
patients according to this  diagnosis stratification is shown in Figure 3.    This figure shows that  with increasing 
age, the population shifts towards lower risk categories. From these profiles it is clear that patients less than 5 
months  of age have increased risk not only due to y ounger age but also due to greater surgical complexity.   
The age related findings from the TRICC trial were presented at the Annual Sessions of the American Heart 
Association in 2010.   Physicians in attendance, who care for these children,  questioned whet her the response 
in neonates differed from older infants. TRICC was not designed to answer this question.  
STRATIFICATION  DESIGN  
Accordingly, we have designed TRICC 2 with age strata: less than 4 weeks and greater than or equal to 4 weeks in 
order to have sufficient numbers of younger and older patients to address whether the affect is different in neonates. The logic behind 
the stratification is a 
combination of published 
and preliminary data.   
 
Justification for Age 
Strata  
Recent ly published data 
obtained by the PI in 
collaboration with M. 
Cant inotti et al show  that 
infants less than 4 weeks  
old demonstrate 
differences in thyroid 
hormone profile both 
before and after 
cardiopulmonary bypass  
compared to older 
children (Figure 5) .  
Although declinations in TSH, T3, 
and T4 are not as profound as 
those in older children, they persist 
longer after CPB, suggesting that response to T3 supplementation migh t be different  in neonates < 4 weeks old.   The TRICC trial was not 
powered to perform more detailed age stratification and separate out the neonatal group. However, the 
Kaplan- Meier curves for patients intubated versus time show the logic of the stratification design. This figure 
shows the cumulative percent of patients still requiring intubation versus time in the TRICC study. While the 
patients older than 4 weeks show a substantial benefit, the benefit is reduced in patients less than 4 weeks. It is unknown due to the small sample size whether these graphs demons trate a true difference in the magnitude 
in the effect, or simply show the variability in outcomes in this youngest and sickest population. The 
stratification of TRICC - 2 was designed to enable us to distinguish between the two possibilities.   
Figure 4 .  TSH, free T3 and free T4 values for neonates (< 4 weeks, n = 57) in top 
panels and older infants and toddlers (n =  105) in bottom panels.  Neonates show 
lower preoperative values, though postoperative decline in T3 is less severe 4.

The target sample size (total 22 0 enrolled) was calculated to provide statistical power of >80% to 
identify a treatment effect corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.55 with an overall type I error level of 0.05 (2-
sided).  Patients will be bloc k-randomized by risk and age, with a minimum  of 100 patients who are > 4 weeks 
of age.  Based on the age distribution in TRI CC, we expect about 60% of patients will be greater than or equal 
to 4 weeks, which will provide adequate numbers in each of the age groups. If for some reason high numbers 
of neonates are enrolled, we may cap enrollment of neonates so that at least 100 patients are ≥ 4 weeks. Patients will be randomized to T3 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.   
 
Primary Clinical Endpoint  
Time to extubation (TTE) will be the primary c linical endpoint in this study.  FDA regulators agree that this 
endpoint is appropriate  to apply fo r a labeling change for Triostat.  Studies of children undergoing surgery for 
congenital heart disease conducted at single centers with uniform hospital utilization have shown that 
decreasing TTE results in overall reduced hospital stay and cost  3.   Time to extubation in infants also relates 
to longer term quality of life indicators.  For instance, most congenital heart centers report that the majority of 
these infants demonst rate continuing oral feeding difficulties at discharge.   Between 50 and 60% are 
discharged from the hospital with either full or supplemental feeds through nasogastric tubes or gastrostomy23, 
24  After discharge,  nasogastric feeding continues  at home with substantial increased cost, and detriment to the 
quality of life of the infants and their parents.   Several studies have reported that prolonged time to extubation 
is the single most important predictor for discharge on nasogastric feeds.  23, 24  This specific qual ity of life 
indicator, discharge of full oral feeds will be used as secondary endpoint indicator.  
 
Composite endpoints have been used  in pediatric intensive care studies with variable and limited success19 1.  
Validity of these composite endpoints is of ten questioned.  Frequently used endpoints such as time in intensive 
care unit and hospital stay are burdened by variable practice in a multi -center study . Additionally transfers 
require staff availability, which is not always feasible.   For instance, some of the participating centers in the 
TRICC trial discharged patients to home directly from the intensive care unit.   TTE is considered an important clinical endpoint and benchmark in pediatric cardiac surgical series.  Mechanical ventilation is an important 
source of anxiety  for parents with  children in the intensive care unit
25 . Furthermore, w e successfully detected 
differences in TTE in TRICC , establishing that T3 suppl ementation affects this endpoint.  Therefore TTE was 
select ed as an objective outcome measure for this study.  We recognize this endpoint has limitations, due to 
Figure 5.   TRICC trial data for 2 age groups 
under 5 months old.  For patients <=4 weeks:  
N = 25, Placebo; 25 Triostat.  For patients > 4 
weeks: N = Placebo 25, and Triostat 23.   Though not adequately powered, data suggest more potent treatment impact in the older patient group.  These data support age 
stratification design in our study .  Data below 
figures reflect median (25,75%tile)  
Page 11 of 25  
 ambiguity of start and stop time. First, time 0, the start  of the intubation period, has been poorly defined in 
multiple analyses evaluating pediatric cardi ac surgery.  Start  time has been defined as initial time to intubation 
prior to surgery, entrance into the operating room, or surgical completion.  None of t hese time- points have 
relevance to surgical outcome, and are influenced by factors such as the complexity of the procedure and skill 
of the surgeon.  Therefore, time from aortic cross -clamp removal will be defined as time 0 (start time)  because 
under this definition it can be objectively measured.  
 
In TRICC- 2, all participating investigators will commit  to reducing non -patient related delays in extubation and 
document  the time of readiness  to extubate along with any reason for delay , if a delay cannot be avoided.  For 
the calculation of the primary endpoint, the actual extubation time will be used.  It is essential that treating 
physicians are blinded to treatment assignment to prevent bias in deciding appropriate extubation time.   
 
Delayed sternal closure (DSC) is an effective approach to the management of neonates and infants at risk for 
hemodynamic, respiratory, or hemostatic instability early after cardiac surgery  26.  However, DS C is an 
important confounding influence on time to extubation, and must be considered in this study design.   Use of 
DSC varies among institutions but a multi -center retrospective study showed that it contributes to longer length 
of hospital stay  and higher postoperative infection rates in patients undergoing stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic 
left heart sy ndrome  (HLHS)27.  At centers involved in the study, surgeons often make the decision for DS C 
prior to operative repair or palliation.   In our own series (SCH) D SC prolongs time to extubation by  a median of  
2.5 days in HLHS  patients  compared to patients with standard chest closure, yielding a bimodal distribution for  
time to extubation.   We will adjust for whether DS C actually occurs in the primary analysis Cox Pro portional 
Hazards Model.  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
FDA regulators suggested that mortality and / or additional morbidity parameters would provide important  
supportive data. However, mortality in this population is extremely low,  and generally caused by  factors which 
would not be improved by pharmacological therapy, such as surgical mishaps, and extremely high risk surgery.   
Furthermore, with mortality rate at 5.3% in placebo group from TRICC and 3% in treatment group, our study would require a several fold incr ease in sample size to be adequately powered. T he consensus of ICU 
physicians  at the 3 centers  participating in this trial is that extubation and removal from the ventilator is the 
primary acute goal for these patients.     Parent groups also report  that extubation is the most important 
parameter.  We have evaluated adverse events as potential morbidity endpoints, but these are numerous, diverse, subjective,  and therefore are not suitable for a composite endpoint.    Hospital length- of-stay was 
considered as a potential  outcome parameter;    however this is  influenced by center -specific protocols, 
readiness of family to have the child come home, and other variables which are clearly beyond the effect of T3.   
ICU length -of-stay (ICU -LOS) is used universally as an outcome parameter in adult and pediatric studies.  
Studies employing this outcome parameter are generally based on a large population, which is necessary due to the non-patient related issues and events .  We have evaluated ICU -LOS as a potential secondary endpoint.  
The median ICU- LOS in TRICC patients < 4 weeks old was 7.5days (IQR 6-14) with Triostat, and 8.5 days  
(IQR 7-13.5) with Placebo.   The values for patients >4 weeks were 4.5 days  (IQR 4.0-9.0) with Triostat and 7  
days  (IQR 4.0- 16.5) Pl acebo. T3 supplementation may influence ICU -LOS among the older patients, although 
less likely to influence this parameter in the younger neonatal  group.   
 We will use ICU -LOS as a secondary endpoint .  This will not eliminate problems related to step- down unit 
availability etc.   We therefore introduce another secondary endpoint, which is a composite value similar to that used by Mackie et al.   This endpoint will be termed “ready for ICU discharge”,  and defined as the number of  
Page 12 of 25  
 hours from termination of cardiopulmonary bypass  to readiness for ICU discharge.   The intensivists and 
investigators agreed to record this endpoint (R -ICU) when  both of  the following parameters are reached: 1) all 
inotropic dr ugs terminated; 2) patient extubated and in no respiratory distress, only oxygen supplied by nasal 
cannula or mask ; 3) If on high flow nasal cannula Max O 2 4L (0- 90d old) or 6L (91d- 2y), FiO2 ≤ 50%:    
 
As noted previously, delayed TTE is a direct predictor  of “oral feeding difficulty” resulting in hospital discharge 
on alternate feeding modes such as nasogastric tube23, 24.  Discharge with nasogastric tube reduces quality of 
life for infants and families.  Therefore we will use discharge on full oral feeds as a secondary quality of life 
end point.   
 
In order to assess cardiac endpoint parameters we will use Low Cardiac Output Syndrome (LCOS) as 
another secondary endpoint.   This assessment  will be competed on a separate CRF for LCOS for the  first 36 
hours after ICU admission and will include 1) identifying clinical signs/symptoms present in LCOS; 2) 
identifying all interventions involved in the trea tment of LCOS; 3) Pharmacologic Assessment of 
inotropes/vasopressures

7) Time to sternal closure for patients with delayed surgical closure  
 
Echocardiography was performed as  part of the protocol in the TRICC trial.  Echocardiography, as noted 
previously, established a treatment effect on cardiac contractile function.   However, echocardiography parameters were secondary endpoints.  Performance of echocardiography burdened the  study with regards to 
enrollment due to staffing issues (sonographer unavailability at protocol time points) and is prohibitively 
expensive at U.S. centers.   We considered the benefit of echocardiography as part of the protocol versus the 
cost.  Accordingly, echocardiography will not be performed as part of protocol, although performance of the 
study will not impact standard of care studies
. A previous review observed this point, and suggested that we 
use data obtained for clinical purposes  outside of the  protocol .  However, these evaluations  are ordered based 
on clinical necessity.  As such the sickest patients might have echo data a nd the other s would not , creating a 
biased sample.

Triostat  Dosing  
Triostat ® (liothyronine sodium injection), 10µg/mL, 1mL vial is 
currently distributed by JHP Pharmaceuticals . Supplementation 
elevated total triiodothyronine levels in the TRICC trial as noted 
in Figure 6.  For TRICC the dosing strategy was 0.4µg/kg prior 
to CPB and immediately after cross -clamp release and 0.2µg/kg 
every 3 hours thereafter for 3 doses, thereby supplying a total 
1.4µg/kg over  an approximate 10 hour period.   This strategy 
was effective in  patients  less than 5- month s oldbut did no t provide 
steady -state levels, and maintained levels above the placebo 
group for only 24 hours , by 24 hours levels in both placebo and 
treatment groups were well below baseline. Additionally, the 
strategy produced substantial peaks in serum T3 levels, although 
these were not associated with adverse events.  The primary 
reason for bolus was concern regarding liothyronine incompatibility with other drugs, and the limited number of 
infusions available in these small patients.  These have been 
obviated with new er types of lines and infusion pumps.   
Liothyronine is compatible with drugs given  in the ICU.   Prior 
studies have used liothyronine (Triostat) infusion in this vulnerable population with no drug incompatibility reported.  
Data from the TRICC trial and a smaller trial performed by our 
Lucille -Packard co- investigator support bolus dosing followed 
by infusion. Dr. Stephen Roth published pharmacokinetic data from a series of neonates undergoing surgical procedures 
requiring CBP.   In his study, T riosta t infusion (0.06 µg/kg/hour) 
initiated immediately after terminating CPB prevented total T3 decline to below normal levels in many but not all patients.  The infusion produced optimum levels within the 
normal range by 24 to 48 hours (n = 23).   These data strongly support a composite protocol using initial bolus 
to prevent early decline in T3, and then followed by the established maintenance infusion.  
 Accordingly, we will use a strategy with an initial loading dose 0.4µg/kg validated in TRICC after cross clamp 
removal or similar time point surrogate followed by an infusion totaling approximately 3 µg/kg infused as 0.06 
µg/kg/hr for 48 hours or until extubation in the CICU, whichever time is shorter  (validated by Mackie et al, 
(Stephen Roth)
1.  This dose is intended to prevent the initial decline and maintain relatively steady -state levels 
well within the normative range for the 48 -hour time period; data from TRICC as well as our preliminary data in 
infants younger than 4 weeks show persistence of the hypothyroid period extending through 48 hours .

Study Conduct and Procedures  
 
Study Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited from admissions at participating centers scheduled to undergo a cardiac procedure 
requiring CPB.  Potential subjects will be screened for study suitability by the research staff in cooperation with 
the clinical care team.   A screening log will be kept at each site.   If the family shows interest in the study, they 
will undergo informed consent procedures which will be conducted by the research team.  The study will be 
described verbally to the patient and family .  After the introduction and description of the study, the family will 
be given adequate time to read and review the written consent forms.  Time will be allotted for questions and 
additional discussion, if necessary.  Family friends, relatives or additional support persons (at the request of 
the parent/guardian) may also be present to hear and read what is being asked of the family.  
Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
When and how to withdraw subjects:  Subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected 
completion of that subject for health, logistical, or personal reasons (i.e. serious adverse events, subject 
consent withdrawal, disease progression, etc.).  No safety consequences are anticipated with early withdrawal 
from the study since Triostat is adjunctive therapy.  
Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects:  Subjects who receive study medication and are 
withdrawn will be followed through the duration of the study for that subject.  Subjects who withdraw consent 
will be asked if study data can be collected for the duration of the study.  Subjects who completely withdraw 
consent and do not wish to have further data collected will not be followed past the point of withdrawal of 
consent.  
Emergency B lind Breaking: At the beginning of the study, each site will be instructed on the method for 
emergency blind- breaking.  Blinding codes may be broken in emergency situations if this is required for clinical 
management .  The Principal Investigator at the sit e will contact Dr. Portman to assess the necessity for un -
blinding.  In the unlikely event that Dr. Portman is unreachable, the site Principal Investigator will be 
responsible for making the decision to unblind the patient.  The study investigator will ins truct the participating 
site pharmacy to break the blind to the treating physician only.  The study investigators at the site as well as 
Dr. Portman are to remain blinded to protect the integrity of the data.

• The aortic cross clamp removal  time used should be the first instance of cross clamp removal.  The 
cross clamp may be removed and reclamped, however the schedule of events is timed off of the first 
cross clamp removal time.  
• Blood draw windows apply only if there are vascular lines in place that can be drawn from.  In the event 
that lines have been discontinued, it is acceptable to have study samples drawn at the time of the closest clinical draw  (non study -driven blood draw)  to a timepoint.  Missing or late blood draws due to a 
lack of a vascular line or no timely clinical blood draws  will not be considered a deviation.  This most 
likely applies to the 72 hour blood draw timepoint.  
• The medication bolus and infusion will be given in the 1 hour window after cross clamp removal.  
• The medicat ion infusion will be stopped in a ± 2 hour window after either extubation or 48 hours after 
cross clamp removal, which ever comes first.  
• Concomitant medications include medications taken in the 4 weeks prior to hospitalization and continue 
through  30 day f ollow- up discharge of the index hospitalization.  
• Capture of hemodynamic parameters  & lactate levels will be captured as part of standard of care 
measurements and will not be driven by the protocol.  Hemodynamic parameters will be captured for 
the duration of the study  
• Echoes are done per Standard of care and are not driven by the study.  While the schedule of events 
specifies an echo at 6, 24, and 72 hours, it is not a deviation if one of these is missed or late.  The echo 
most closely correlating to this timing will be used at each timepoint.  
• All PK /thyroid hormone  samples t aken require 2 ml of blood in a red top tube at each timepoint.

Data to Capture from Subject Medical Record  
Various data points are recorded on each subject as a part of routine clinical care.  Some of those data points 
are desired to be captured in the TRICC2 study .  Accompanying CRFs guide the capture of additional desired 
data from the subject’s medical record.  
Participating Center s and Eligible Population  
 
Three centers will participate in this  study. Investigators at Seattle Children’s Hospital  (SCH) , Stanford 
University Lucille Packard Children’s Hospital (LPCH) and Los Angeles Children’s Hospital (LACH) will 
participate.    Seattle Children’s has recently had a personnel change with exit of a surgeon.  Surgical volume 
has increased and complexity remains at high level since that surgeon’s departure.    All three principal 
investigators (M Portman, R. Mainwaring, L. Hastings ), at the  individual sites participated as site PI for  the 
original TRICC trial, although Stanford will be a new site for this study .  Dr. Steve Roth, Co -PI performed a 
single center clinical trial using Triostat at Boston Children’s, and has relocated to Stanford.  Therefore, all the investigators are extremely experienced in conducting clinical trials in this population, and all have previously 
used this drug in clinical trials. The three centers are the major tertiary centers for Pediatric Cardiac surgery for 
the entire U.S. West coast .  Together these centers provide a potential surgical volume of near 400 patients 
per year within t he age group for recruitment.  Enrollment rate for the TRICC trial was near 70% of patients 
approached.  Therefore, we are optimistic that we can complete enrollment within the time frame of the grant  
(4 years) .    
                  
Table 2. Summary of Potential Eligible Patients  per Year  
 
 
Blinding and Randomization  
All treating physicians will be blinded to study treatment. All intensive care treating physicians will agree to 
terminate mechanical ventilation based on patient related parameters and to minimize non- patient related 
delays. Clinical practice regarding use of inotropic agents will not be specified in the protocol and will be left to standard of care at each participating institut ion.   Randomization will be performed by site pharmacy staff, who 
will be unblinded. Randomization will be blocked to maintain equal numbers divided between Triostat and 
placebo groups at individual centers, and equal numbers of patients between treatment and placebo for the 
following strata:  
 
1. Less than or equal to 30 days of age  
2. Greater than 30 days of  age, less than 152 days of age

 Blood samples for Total T3, free T3, and TSH levels (in that order of priority if there are timepoints with 
insufficient volume) will be drawn prior to surgery,  just prior to the first infusion and 6  ± 1, 12 ± 1, 24 ± 
1, and 72 ± 1 hours after cross clamp removal  or surrogate time point if patient does not undergo 
cross- clamping    Samples for free T3, total T3,  and TSH levels will be forwarded to a central laboratory 
(SCH) for processing and analyses.  
 
Data Recording  
All data will be recorded on clinical research forms continuously until the patient is discharged or 30 days, 
whichever is shorter.   Echocardiograms are not required by protocol, but data will be extracted from clinically 
indicated and performed echocardiograms.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Time to extubation (TTE) for the entire population is the primary clinical endpoint. The target sampl e size (total 
220 enrolled) was calculated to provide statistical power of >80% to identify a treatment effect on TTE 
corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.55 with an overall type I error level of 0.05 (2- sided).  Patients will be 
block -randomized into age groups < 4 weeks and >  or equal to  4 weeks, with a minimum of 100 patients who 
are ≥ 4 weeks of age. These requirements will provide sufficient numbers  for subgroup analyses (see below).   
 The primary analysis will be performed using Cox Proportional Hazar ds, including terms for stratification 
factors, and delayed sternal closure.  Patients will be included in analyses if they were randomized and 
received at least one dose of study drug according to the principal of Intention- to-Treat ( ITT). Occasionally 
patients are randomized and then surgery is cancelled or rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts, and not due 
to patient related issues.  This can rarely result in the patient missing the study medication when the operation 
is rescheduled at the last minute.   However, since this study is double- blind, the ITT principal is preserved 
because the treatment assignment is blinded and so unknown to persons responsible for these decisions.   
As stated in ICH -E9, Statistical Principles for Clinic al Trials  posted on the FDA website : “Subjects who fail to 
satisfy an entry criterion may be excluded from the analysis without the possibility of introducing bias only 
under the following circumstances: In some situations, it may be reasonable to eliminate from the set of all randomized subjects any subject who took no trial medication. The intention- to-treat principle would be 
preserved despite the exclusion of these patients provided, for example, that the decision of whether or not to begin treatment could not be influenced by knowledge of the assigned treatment.”  
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073137.pdf  
 
 Thus, patients randomized but not receiving study medication will not be included in the analysis.  
Counting patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug will improve the scientific validity of the study, and 
reduce the overall cost and duration of this trial. Patients who receive at least 1 dose will be analyzed  
according to randomization assignmen t regardless of the treatment actually received. The TTE distributions will 
be compared across treatment groups using the Log- Rank test. Time zero will be defined as the time of cross -
clamp removal, and span until to the first of death, extubation or 21 days. Patients who die will be censored at 
the earliest of 21 days or death, and patients who are still intubated at 21 days post -cross clamp removal will 
be censored at 21  days. Medians and 95% confidence intervals for TTE will be based on the Kaplan- Meier 
estimate to account for censoring. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for non- patient -related delays will also 
be performed to determine the impact of these delays, which we expect to be few, on the primary 
efficacy analysis . Differences i n death will be compared using Fisher’s Exact Test.   
Secondary endpoints as previously described  will be analyzed using similar  methodology. Endpoints 
with censored observations will be addressed using survival analysis techniques to account for censoring.  
 
Page 19 of 25  
 This study is powered to detect a hazard ratio of 1.8 with respect to TTE in patients less than 4 weeks 
of age (assuming half of the total sample is in this age range). The effect in patients < 4  weeks of age is an 
important clinical outcome as these ar e the sickest patients in the population, and reduction in their relatively 
long intubation times provides more opportunity for benefit.  There will be no Type I error adjustment for this 
subgroup analysis in order to maximize power for the primary outcome, but the sample size was determined 
considering the need to report the effect in the youngest patients.  Thus, this analysis will be considered 
supportive and will be described as such in subsequent publications.  
Patient characteristics and adverse events will be compared using the chi -square test or Fisher’s Exact 
test as appropriate. Continuous characteristics and outcomes will be compared using the T- test or ANOVA for 
repeated measures. Point estimates for hazard ratios and 95% (2- sided) confidence inter vals will be reported.  
Safety endpoints include arrhythmias, infection rate, serious , and non- serious adverse events. Only 
treatment -emergent events with signs or symptoms that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug will 
be reported.    
 Total  T3 levels will be  analyzed to determine half -time using a single compartmental pharmacokinetic 
model similar to previously published methodology by the PI 29.  
 
Safety  
Adverse Event (AE) Reporting  
Reporting of adverse events in cardiac surgical trials in infants is complicated as there is no regulatory 
guidance specific to conducting clinical research in critically ill children.  The Pediatric Heart Network reported a new method of reporting using predefined “sentinel events” in place of serious adverse events (SAEs).  All 
other adverse events were reported as “complications”.  The standard definitions using “Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Eve nts” (CTCAE), developed by the N ational Cancer Institute does not carry enough 
appropriate pediatric codes to cover the complexity of the post surgical population.  The Pediatric Heart 
Network (PHN) launched the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial and midway switched from standard 
reporting to their new system identifying “sentinel events ”
30, 31.   This sy stem reduced administrative burden 
and improved quality of safety reporting.  However, their study which evaluated surgical techniques against 
one another was not performed under IND and according to PHN investigators their system has not been 
reviewed by the FDA.    On query regarding the appropriateness for using the PHN published method for 
reporting adverse events in a drug trial the FDA responded: “Our goal is to understand the effect of said study 
treatment on adverse events, i.e., "adverse reactions"  (to study drug), not to catalog all bad things that happen 
to subjects. In this respect, the process PHN followed may or may not be reasonable. One would need to think 
through whether the experimental treatment had any likelihood of affecting the common adverse events 
associated with surgery and whether the investigators were likely to be able to distinguish study treatment -
related events from "normal" (clinically expected) ones.  “   
 
As TRICC- 2 will be performed with IND requirements, we will need to report adverse events (AEs) using FDA 
standards revised by the common rule amendments of 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320 (April 2011).   The common 
rule does reduce reporting requirements somewhat as long as expected AEs and SAEs are predefined in the study protocol  (see Appendix 1) .   A summary of adverse events reported for the TRICC trial appears in Table 
3.   This shows that the majority of patients show AEs, though relatively few have SAEs using standard 
reporting methodology.  Thus, the greatest burden for repor ting may not be related to SAEs but to reporting of 
common procedural complications as AEs regardless of severity.  Using literature review and expert consensus, the PHN developed lists defining common and specific AEs which occur in this infant population 
undergoing cardiac surgery.  Protection of Human Subjects  (section 6)  contains a list adapted from the PHN, 
Page 20 of 25  
 which defines expected surgical complications or AEs.   For instance pleural effusion is defined as an adverse 
event when drainage exceeds 7 days after surgery.   This definition will reduce reporting of pleural effusions.   
In an effort to address the issue raised by the FDA with regard to affect on common adverse events in this 
population, we have numerically coded the complication table generated by the PHN (section 6) .

Compliance and Monitoring  
IND # 55 367 has been a ssigned by the FDA, which has instructed the PI that amendment and modification 
only is needed for performance of TRICC -2, rather than new IND.  IND amendment was submitted on 
December 8.  We will subcontract with an independent clinical research organizat ion (CRO) to perform 
monitoring for our study.   The CRO, Clinical Research Staff Support Core (CRSSC) , has considerable 
experience in monitoring the conduct of clinical trials in children.  The TRICC -2 study will be performed under 
the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices as outlined in FDA document “Guidance for Industry E6 Good 
Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guidance”.    
 
We will list the study on ClinicalTrials.gov .  Dr. Portman as PI and holder of the IND will serve as sponsor.  
Division of responsibilities between the PI and the CRO are included in the table below.  The PI will be 
supported by experienced study personnel at the Seattle Site.  X = responsible; NR –not responsible, SIV –  
site initiation visit, IMV, interim monitoring visit, COV - close out visit.

Data Management  
Seattle Children’s H ospital and Researc h Institute will serve as the central site and data repository.  The CRO 
will oversee completion of clinical research forms (CRFs) and transfer original CRFs to SCH for input into the 
central data base.  Dr. Portman’s staff will generate final queries to each site.   The Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) database created at Vanderbilt Univer sity will be used as the study  database.    We will use 
a double entry to avoid input errors.   Data will be stripped of identifiers (according to HIPAA) prior to transfer. 
Each patient will be assigned a study number with code to identifiers kept securely at each individual site.   The 
database will undergo intermittent internal audit to ascertain that CRF data are correctly inputted.  The auditor, 
not yet assigned, will be a different individual than Database manager.  
 
Data Monitoring Committee  
The DMC will be an independent multidisciplinary group consisting of clinicians with collective experience in 
the management of infants after cardiopulmonary bypass and in the conduct and monitoring of clinical trials.  
DMC members will be pediatric cardiologists, pediatric cardiac surgeons and/or pediatric cardiac intensivists, and a bioethicist. A biostatistician will also serve on the DMC to advise the committee on the i nterpretation of 
statistical data provided by the independent statistician
.  Members will be appointed by the DMC Chair in 
consultation with Dr. Portman. Blinded and unblinded data reports will be produced by an independent 
statistician at Axio  Research. This statistician will be available to present unblinded analyses in the closed 
sessions of the DMC meeting. The DMC will ratify a charter at their first meeting.

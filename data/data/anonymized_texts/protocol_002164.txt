 1. TITLE:  
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel  group pilot study of the 
safety and efficacy of Hydrocortisone Acetate Suppositories , 25 mg compared to placebo 
suppositories in the treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids.  
 
2. INTRODUCTION:  
Hemorrhoidal disease is common in the United States with at  least 15 million people comprising 
nearly 5% of the population suffering from this condition. Hemorrhoids begin with the 
enlargement of normal vascular cushions which are present in the anal canal at birth and are 
themselves a normal part of the human ana tomy. However, hemorrhoids may be diagnosed only 
if symptoms of bleeding, prolapse or thrombosis exist in addition to the presence of enlarged 
vascular cushions. Hemorrhoids may be internal and/or external. Internal hemorrhoids occur 
above the dentate line  and are covered with colonic mucosa whereas external hemorrhoids occur 
below the dentate line and are covered with squamous epithelium. The incidence of hemorrhoids 
peaks in the 65-74-year-old age group with lesser rates for both younger and older age groups.  
 
Current  theory attributes the development of hemorrhoids to the dilation of the vascular cushions 
due to increased anal sphincter pressure which interferes with the drainage of blood fro m the rich 
plexus of arterial and venous vessels in these cushions but does not interfere with the in -flow of 
blood through the arteries. This results in dilation and progressive development of hemorrhoids. 
A major factor contributing to hemorrhoidal devel opment is the gradual degeneration of the 
connective tissue in the vascular cushions which leads to further enlargement of the vessels and 
to their eventual prolapse. This combination of decreased outflow and gradual connective tissue 
degeneration results in the progressive development of the condition.  
 
Early hemorrhoids are frequently treated with a fiber diet and with lifestyle modifications such as 
increased exercise and the avoidance of obesity and sedentary occupation which appear to be 
significant ri sk factors for the disease. Also, control of diarrhea appears to be a useful option in 
the prevention of the development of hemorrhoids. However, in more advanced cases acute 
hemorrhoidal attacks are present with bleeding, inflammation and often thrombosis  of the 
hemorrhoidal veins. Conservative therapy consists of local treatment. Several types of drugs 
have been used for this purpose. These include local anesthetics, chiefly pramoxine. This is a 
rapidly acting, local anesthetic which is applied topically as needed up to five times a day. It 
provides local relief particularly of itching through its anesthetic action. Local application of 
phenylephrine is also used in the treatment of hemorrhoids to reduce blood flow through the 
hemorrhoids by utilizing the drug’s vasoconstricting action. This produces temporary relief of 
burning and itching. 5 -amino salicylic acid (Mesalamine) is also used off -label as a local anti -
inflammatory agent to treat hemorrhoids. It appears to reduce  the pain and bleeding of 
hemorrh oids during acute attacks. Hydrocortisone in various types of vehicles is also a 
prominent modality of treatment for hemorrhoids as well as other anorectal conditions. Foams, 
suppositories and locally applied creams have been used as vehicles for the appli cation of 
hydrocortisone, although none are FDA -approved products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. 
Hydrocortisone’s potent anti -inflammatory action is thought to reduce the inflammation 
associated with the hemorrhoids and thus improve bleeding, itching an d other symptoms of 
hemorrhoids. Products using these ingredients have a long history of use in the United States and 
are commonly relied upon for the non -surgical, conservative treatment of hemorrhoids.

 the suppository too long is to be avoided or it will melt in their hands.   To insert the suppository, 
the subject is to l ie on their side with their lower leg straight out and their upper leg bent forward 
toward their stomach  and then l ift their upper buttock to expose their rectal area.  No more than 
the specified amount of suppository is to be used and is not to be applied more than twice daily 
as this will not produce faster results  and may increase irritation.  To in sert one suppository, 
pointed end first, subject is to use their  finger until it passes the muscular sphincter of the rectum, 
about 1 inch in adults. (If not inserted past the sphincter, the suppository may pop out.).   Subject 
is to h old their buttocks together for five seconds  and for  best results , to remain lying dow n for 
five minutes to avoid having the suppository come out.   The suppository will melt quickly once 
inserted and there  should be little or no discomfort while holding it in.   Subject is to av oid having 
a bowel movement for one to three hours after inserti ng the suppository.  
 
Note that the medication from the suppository may stain fabric.  Subjects may experience  
irritation such as burning, itching, dryness, skin/hair follicle irritation, or changes in skin color 
around the rectal area. Subjects are to r eport to the study staff any reactions that make continued 
application of the study medication difficult. The PI may recommend that the study medication  
be used  less frequently on the irritated areas until the irritation goes away.   If subject sees  a 
doctor fo r any medical problems, they are to be advised to inform the study staff at their next 
visit.   Subject is to record any illness or unwell feelings such as headaches, cold, cramps, etc., on 
the last page of th eir diary.   Subjects are to r ecord any change in  medications since the previous 
visit (other than study medication) on the last page of th e diary.  All unused study medication 
must be returned to the study site at the end of treatment.  
 
15. LABORATORY STUDIES:

17. RETENTION SAMPLES:  
Retention samples will be randomly selected at the study sites from the clinical drug supplies 
received prior to dispensing  to subjects  and sent to BRR for long -term storage . Retention 
samples will  not be returned to the sponsor at any time.   
 
18. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS:   
In addition to recording the time and date of each medication application, the Daily Personal 
Diaries will be used to record concomitant medication taken and all adverse events experienced.   
Paper copies of the IHSSA daily electronic diaries will be provided to subjects for use as a 
backup for missed ePRO questionnaires.  
 
19. STUDY DISCONTINUATION :  
Subjects could be discontinued from the study for the following reasons:  
a. Pregnancy.  
b. Acute illness or clinically significant laboratory result.  
c. Significant protocol deviation.  
d. Serious adverse experience.  
e. Decision by the Subject to leave for an y reason.  
f. If the Subject’s condition has worsened to the degree that the Principal Investigator feels it is 
unsafe for the Subject to continue in the study . 
g. If the Subject’s drug code is unblinded . 
i. If the Subject is lost to follow -up. 
j. If the Subject becomes pre gnant.  
k. If the Subject becomes a prisoner or bec ome involuntarily incarcerated.  
l. Any other reason that may affect the outcome of the stu dy or the safety of Subjects.  
m. Termination of the study by the Sponsor .

26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 13 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 The reasons for a Subject discontinuation will be docum ented. If a Subject is discontinued from 
the study for any reason, the procedures scheduled for Visit 5 will be completed and any 
outstanding data and study drug should be collected if possible. Data, in addition to the reason 
for discontinuation and the d ate of removal, will be documented on the End of Study eCRF.  
 
Before a Subject is considered lost to follow -up, the Principal Investigator will document all 
attempts to reach the Subject twice by telephone and will send a certified follow -up letter.  
 
If a Subject discontinues from the study at any time due to an adverse event, the reason for 
discontinuation, the nature of the event and its clinical course must be fully documented. For 
such a Subject, the Principal Investigator must strive to follow the Subj ect until the adverse event 
has resolved, becomes clinically insignificant, is stabilized or the Subject is lost to follow -up. 
Should a serious adverse event (SAE) be noted, procedures stated in Section 2 4.d. must be 
followed.   
 
20. SUBJECT POPULATIONS :  
a. The p er-protocol (PP) population includes all subjects who meet all inclusion  and no 
exclusion criteria, completed the evaluations for Visit  4 within the designated visit window  
(+/- 2 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation . Subjects  
must take at least 80% but no more than 120% of the required doses . Compliance will be 
verified using  subject diaries.  
b. The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population includes all subjects who meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, apply at leas t one (1) dose and return for at least one (1) post -
baseline evaluation visit.  
c. The safety population (intent -to-treat (ITT)) includes all subjects who meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and apply at least one (1) dose .  
 
21. ENDPOINTS :  
a. Clinician Reported Outcome (ClinRO) - Anoscop y (Visits  2, 4).  
 
Anoscopy – Visual assessment of hemorrhoid s (Fukuda et al. 2005; Lunniss and Mann 2004) . 
Video of the procedure will be recorded for blinded central reading and assessment according to 
the following scale:  
 
Swelling  % Lumen  Score  
0 None  0 
≤25 Mild 1 
≤50 Moderate  2 
≤75 Severe  3

26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 14 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 The IHSSA is completed by patients immediately following each bowel movement each day and 
at the end of each day. The IHSSA post -bowel movement items address  signs and symptoms 
during bowel movements . The end of day items assess  signs, symptoms, functional limitations, 
and emotional impacts over the course of a day. Patients are asked to rate their most severe signs 
and symptoms using 5 -point verbal rating scales that have verbal anchors for each response. 
Frequency of hemorrhoid -related pruritus is also addressed through a 5 -point verbal response 
scale. The Bristol Stool Scale, a measure of stool consistency, is administered during episodic, 
post-bowel movement assessments.  The IHSSA is administered via a web browser -based portal  
system o n the patient’s own smartphone or personal computer . The IHSSA training materials, 
post-bowel movement assessment, and end of day assessment are included in Appendix 1. 
 
c. Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) – Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Informa tion 
System (PROMIS) Global Health Questionnaire Version 1.2 (Visits  2 and 4).  
 
The PROMIS Global Health Questionnaire  is completed by patients during Visits 2 and 4.   It 
will be completed before any clinical or laboratory tests are administered.  The PROMIS Global 
Health Questionnaire assesses an individual’s physical, mental, and social health  using 10 items . 
The measure is generic, rather than disease -specific, and often uses an “In General” item context 
as it is  intended to globally reflect individu als’ assessment of their health. The questionnaire 
produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. Raw scores for both scales are 
converted to T -scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. The items of the PROMIS 
Global Health Questionna ire are included in Appendix 2 . 
 
d. Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) – Patient Global Impression of Severity (Visits 2 and 4) 
and Patient Global Impression of Change  (Visit 4) Items  
 
The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) and Patient Global Impression  of Change 
(PGIC) items are designed to capture the patient’s overall perspective on sign and symptom 
severity. The 8 -item PGIS asks patients to rate the severity of their hemorrhoid -related signs and 
symptoms over the past week. The 9 -item PGIC asks patie nts to rate the direction and magnitude 
of the change in their signs and symptoms since starting the study medication. The PGIS and 
PGIC are included in the study to help establish the threshold for clinically relevant change on 
the IHSSA. Although they ad dress signs and symptoms of internal hemorrhoids, the IHSSA is 
considered the primary measure of these constructs.  The PGIS and PGIC items are included in 
Appendix 3 . 
 
Based on the results of the pilot study , primary and secondary endpoints will be selecte d for 
future studies.  
 
22. SUBJECT SAFETY : 
a. Safety assessment will be conducted on all subjects administered at least one suppository . 
Adverse drug reactions may include burning  and local irritation  upon application . Systemic 
absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible suppression of the HPA axis. 
Adverse medical events experienced by the subjects will be tabulated. The relationship of 
adverse events , if any, to the study drug will be assessed by th e Investigator  (see Section 
24).  Corporate Information

b. Physical Examination  
The investigator, sub -investigator or appropriately delegated designee, (Physician’s 
Assistant, Advanced  Registered Nurse Practitioner, and Registered Nurse as per local 
regulations) will perform a brief physical examination, prior to the Subject starting study 
drug.   
The physical examination will include, at a minimum, examination of the Subject’s general 
appearance, skin, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), heart, lungs, musculoskeletal 
system, neurological system, lymph nodes, abdomen and extremities.  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral body temperature 
will be documented at Visit 1. Vital signs will be measured after the Subject has rested in a 
seated position for at least 5 minutes.  
The Subject’s body weight will also be measured while the Subject is lightly clothed (e.g., no 
coat or shoes). Height will be  measured without shoes.  
c. Concomitant medications  
Concomitant medications, including the use of non -drug treatments/therapies, in addition to 
the reason for the medication use, will be assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study 
visit. The start and s top date of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use.  
d. A record of concomitant medications taken by the Subject is to be obtained using generic 
name, if known, with the c orresponding indication. The medications to be recorded will 
include prescription and over -the-counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements.  All 
medications taken on a regular basis, including acetaminophen, should be recorded.  
e. Individual subject st opping criteria  
Subject s will be withdrawn if they are hypersensitive to the drug product or develop a 
CTCAE  v4.0 (NCI 2009)  Grade  3 or higher  adverse event  (Appendix 4). Subjects will be 
monitored for dr ug-induced liver injury (DILI) (FDA 2009) . Subjects  will be withdrawn if:   
i. Alanine or aspartate aminotransferase (ALT or AST) >8x upper limit of normal 
(ULN).  
ii. ALT or AST > 3x ULN and (total bilirubin (TBL)  >2x ULN ).  
iii. ALT or AST >3x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, an d/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
Subjects will be re -tested (CMP) within 48 -72 hours if ALT or AST >3x ULN and/or 
TBL  >2x ULN . If repeat testing shows ALT or  AST > 3x ULN, close observation will 
be initiated to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening.   
Close observation includes:  
iv. Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. 
Frequency of retesting can decrease to  once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or 
the trial drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic.  
v. Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
vi. Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, 
and special diets.  
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 16 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 vii. Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopa thy; and biliary tract disease.  
viii. Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
ix. Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin).  
x. Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
 
f. Pilot s tudy stopping criteria  
The pilot study may be stopped if ≥ 2 patients on drug develop the same CTCAE  v4.0 
Grade  3 adverse event or if 1  patient develops a CTCAE  v4.0 Grade  4 or higher  adverse 
event  (Appendix 4).  
 
23. STATISTICAL METHODS:  
a. Endpoint s 
Anoscopy results  at Day 15 will be compared to responses at baseline  (Day 1) . IHSSA 
scores from Days 1 -15 (treatment period) and 16 -29 (follow -up period) will be compared to 
responses from Days -14 to -1 (baseline period). The 95% confidence intervals for the 
differences between the change from baseline for the hydrocortisone acetate suppository and 
that for the placebo will be calculated.  
 
b. Safety  
The incidence of all AEs reported during the study will be classified based on  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 21.0 terminology (system organ 
classes and preferred terms) and summar ized for each treatment group. Incidence of adverse 
events will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and sev erity, and by system 
organ class, preferred term, and relationship to study drug.  
 
24. ADVERSE EVENTS:  
a. Definitions  
i. Any untoward events occurring during the study will be documented and summarized upon 
completion of the study.  
ii. The term Adverse Event (AE) will cover any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation where a volunteer was administered an investigational product, which does 
not necessarily have to have causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse ev ent can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
use of a medicinal product, whether  considered related to the medicinal pro duct. This 
includes all events both expected and unexpected (the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with information in the relevant source document(s)).  
iii. In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, an Adverse Drug Reaction 
(ADR) is defined as follows: all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose. The phrase "responses to a medicinal product" means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Regarding marketed medicinal 
products, an adverse drug reaction is defined as a response to a drug which is noxious and 
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 17 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 unintended,  and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or 
therapy of disease or for modification of physiological function.  
iv. A medical event is defined as any unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs 
between the pre -trial evaluation and the first investigational product administration of the 
clinical study. As no investigational product has been administered yet, those events are 
not to be considered as adverse events.  
v. Worsening of a sign or symptom of  the condition under treatment will normally be 
measured by efficacy parameters. However, if the outcome fulfills the definition of 
“serious adverse event”, it must be recorded as such (see below).  
b. An adverse event may be:  
i. A new illness .  
ii. Worsening of a concomitant illness .  
iii. An effect of the study medication including comparator; it could be an abnormal laboratory 
value as well as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the qualified 
investigator or medical qualified designate consider s to be clinically important .  
iv. A combination of two or more of these factors .  
v. Abnormalities in laboratory tests, in the measurements of vital signs, or in other 
measurements performed after the drug administration or at the end of the study are to be 
recorded as adverse events only if they are medically relevant: symptomatic, requir ing 
corrective treatment, leading to study discontinuation and/or fulfilling a seriousness 
criterion. If asymptomatic, but with a suspected underlying process, the qualified 
investigator or the qualified medical designate may consider the abnormalities to be 
medically relevant.  
c. Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events. They are therapeutic measures for 
conditions that required surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an 
adverse event, if it occurs or is detected during the s tudy period. Planned surgical measures 
permitted by the clinical study protocol and the conditions(s) leading to these measures are 
not adverse events, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. 
In the latter case, the condit ion should be reported as medical history.  
d. A serious adverse event is one that occurs at any dose (including overdose) and that:  
i. Results in death.  
ii. Is life -threatening .  
iii. Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
iv. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) .  
v. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect .  
vi. Is an important medical event (including development of drug  dependence or drug abuse) 
that may jeopardize the volunteer or may require intervention to prevent one or the other 
outcomes listed above (according to medical judgment of the qualified investigator) .  
e. Classification of Adverse Events  
All adverse events w ill be recorded on an adverse event information sheet and graded as 
mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions:  
i. Mild: Causing no limitation of usual activities; the volunteer may experience slight 
discomfort.  
ii. Moderate: Causing some limitation of usual activities; the volunteer may experience 
annoying discomfort.  
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 18 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 iii. Severe: Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the volunteer may experience 
intolerable discomfort or pain.  
f. Relationship to Study Medication  
The relationship is c haracterized as:  
i. Not Related : This applies to any AE that is clearly not related to use of the study 
drug.  
ii. Possible : This means the association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; 
however, a relationship between drug and event cannot be ruled out.  
iii. Probable : There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the use of the study 
drug and the AE. Based upon the Principal Investigator’s clinical experience, the 
association of the event with the study drug seems likely.  
iv. Definite : The AE occurs follow ing the application of the study drug and it cannot be 
reasonably explained by any known characteristics of the Subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the Subject. 
It disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study drug and reappears on a 
re-challenge of the investigational product.  
g. Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events  
i. For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of adverse events extends from the 
start of treatment with the investigational product until the final study visit. During this 
period, all adverse events spontaneously reported by the volunteer, ob served by the 
Qualified Investigator (or delegates) or elicited by general questioning will be documented 
in the CRF and will be reported in the final report.  
ii. If necessary, every effort will be made to obtain an adequate follow -up of the volunteers. 
Shoul d any volunteers choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of the 
safety precautions to be taken.  
iii. The volunteers will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of the study and 
before their departure from the clinical site.  An open -ended question will be asked.  
iv. It is the qualified investigator’s responsibility to record and report all adverse events that 
occur during the study regardless of their relationship to the study medication. If judged 
necessary by the qualified inv estigator, an adverse event will be reported in accordance 
with the applicable regulatory requirements.  
h. Pregnancy in a female volunteer on the study shall be reported to the sponsor or their 
authorized representative within 24 hours of the knowledge of it s occurrence by the 
qualified investigator that such pregnancy occurs during the Study or right after. Because of 
the possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been exposed to the study drug through the 
parent and for the volunteer’s safety, the pregnan cy will be followed up to determine 
outcome as, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications.  
i. As for an adverse event, the pregna ncy will be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form 
and reported by the qualified investigator to the sponsor. Pregnancy follow -up will also be 
properly recorded to ensure quality and completeness of the data belonging to the study drug 
and will includ e an assessment of the possible causal relation between the study drug and 
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 19 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy will be reported on a SAE 
Report Form.  
j. Any adverse event that is considered serious will be reported to the Institutiona l Review 
Board (IRB) and to the Sponsor representative promptly by telephone and in writing within 
three working days. Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening serious event will be reported 
to the IRB and to the Sponsor representative promptly by telephon e and in writing within 
one working day. This report will contain a detailed description of the observed symptoms 
and the contra -active therapy. The qualified investigator will judge the possible causal 
relationship between the event and the study drug.  
25.  ETHICS  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the current Declaration of Helsinki and will be consistent with International 
Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol.  
The rights, safety and well -being of the study Subjects are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of society and science.   
i. Infor med Consent  
The Principal Investigator must ensure that Subjects are clearly and fully informed about 
the purpose, potential risks and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which 
they volunteer to participate. The principles of Informed Conse nt, according to FDA 
Regulations and ICH GCP will be followed.  A copy of the proposed consent/assent form 
must be submitted to the IRB, together with the protocol, for approval. Prior to beginning 
of the study, the Principal Investigator must have the IRB ’s written approval of the 
written informed consent/assent form and any other information to be provided to 
Subjects.  
Subjects 18 years of age or older must provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approved written informed consent. Subjects under the age of 18 years must have parent 
or legal guardian provide IRB approved written informed consent. In addition, an assent 
form for minors must be completed for subjects under the legal age of consent, if 
applicable, depending on the age range required by state laws.  
Each Subject’s signed informed consent/assent must be kept on file by the Principal 
Investigator. A copy of the signed consent/assent form will be given to the Subject or legal 
guardian. A notation will be made in the Subject ’s medical record ind icating the date the 
informed consent/assent was obtained. In addition, the Principal Investigator or the Principal 
Investigator’s Designee will provide a HIPAA authorization form (if applicable) for the 
Subject to review and sign. Both the consent/assent form  and the HIPAA authorization form 
(if applicable) must be signed by the Subject or legal guardian before any protocol 
assessments can be undertaken.  
ii. Institutional Review Board  
Before study initiation, the Principal Investigator must have written and dated  approval 
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 20 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 from the IRB for the protocol, consent form, Subject recruitment materials and any other 
written information to be provided to Subjects.  
Any changes to the protocol as well as a change of the Principal Investigator, which is 
approved by the Spon sor, must also be approved by the site’s IRB and documentation of 
this approval provided to the Sponsor/designee. Records of the IRB review and approval 
of all documents pertaining to this study must be kept on file by the Principal Investigator 
and are su bject to inspection during or after completion of the study.  All SAEs must also 
be reported to the IRB.  
Periodic status reports must be submitted to the IRB at least annually, as well as 
notification of completion of the study and a final report within one (1) month of study 
completion or discontinuation. A copy of all reports submitted to the IRB must be sent to 
the Sponsor/designee.  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that an IRB that complies with the regulatory 
requirements will be responsible for  the initial and continuing review and approval of the 
proposed clinical study.  
iii. Subject Confidentiality  
The monitor(s), the auditor(s), IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authority(ies), will be granted 
direct access to the Subject’s original medical records for  verification of the clinical trial 
procedures and/or data, without violating the confidentiality, to the extent permitted by 
the applicable laws and regulations and that by signing a written informed consent form, 
the Subject or the Subject’s legally acce ptable representative is authorizing such access.  
The identity of the Subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the 
applicable laws and regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the 
trial are published, the  Subject’s identity will remain confidential.

Version 4.0  
 b. Maintenance and Retention of Record s 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to maintain a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all relevant documentation.  
Copies of all pertinent  records will be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least two 
years following final approval of the drug and/or notification from the Sponsor. These 
regulatory documents should be retained for a longer period if required by local regulatory 
authorit ies. These records include documents pertaining to the receipt and return of drug 
supplies, IRB, informed consent/assent, source documents, as well as eCRFs (paper or 
electronic files). No documents shall be transferred from the site or destroyed without f irst 
notifying the Sponsor. If the Principal Investigator withdraws from the study, the records 
shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee. Notice of such transfer will be given 
in writing to the Sponsor.  
The Principal Investigator is required  to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories designed to document all observations and other data pertinent to the 
investigation on each individual treated with the Investigational Product or entered as a 
control in the investigation. Data  reported on the CRF, which are derived from source 
documents, must be consistent with the source documents.  
 
c. Data Collection and Reporting  
Data for individual Subjects will be collected on eCRF designed by the Contract Research 
Organization. The data management  system will be Electronic Data Capture (EDC). The 
Investigator and his/her study site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. 
The Investigator is required to verify that all of the requested information is accurately 
recorded in the eCRFs. All information requested in the eCRFs needs to be supplied, 
including subject identification, date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or 
discrepancy will require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source 
docum ents.  
Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be maintained separately from the eCRF 
in order to allow data verification. Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies and 
illegibility in transcribing data into eCRFs, originals of laboratory and other test results 
must be kept on file. Source documents and copies of test results must be available at all 
times for inspection by the study monitor. The following should also be available for 
review:   
1. Subject Screening Log – reflecting the reason any Subject screened for the study was

for proper documentation  
The study monitor will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded in 
the eCRFs, utilizing the original source documentation and will query discrepant 
findings. The Investigator and study site personnel will be responsible for answering all 
queries. All queries issued by the CRO’s data management personnel will be answered 
by site personnel and verified by the monitor.  
 
d. Primary Source Documents  
The Principal Investigator must main tain primary source documents supporting significant 
data for each Subject’s medical notes. These documents, which are considered “source data”, 
should include documentation of:  
 Demographic information  
 Evidence supporting the diagnosis/condition for whic h the Subject is being studied  
 General information supporting the Subject’s participation in the study  
 General history and physical findings  
 Hospitalization or Emergency Room records (if applicable)  
 Each study visit by date, including any evaluations, relevant findings/notes by the 
Principal Investigator(s), occurrence (or lack) of adverse events and changes in 
medication usage, including the date the study drug commenced and completed.  
 Any additional visits during the study  
 Any relevant telephone conversations with the Subject regarding the study or possible 
adverse events  
 An original, signed informed consent form for study participation  
The Principal Investigator must also retain all Subject specific printouts/reports of 
tests/procedures performed as a requirement of the study. During monitoring visits, the 
monitor will need to validate data in the CRFs against these sources of data.  
 
e. Quality Assurance  
Designated personnel from Nivagen Pharmaceuticals Inc.  will be responsible to ensure that 
the trial is conducted,  and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with 
the protocol, GCP, GLP, and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
f. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by a representa tive of the Contract Research Organization to 
assess compliance with the protocol, ICH -GCP and applicable regulations. The Principal 
Investigator will be visited by a monitor prior to the study and at regular intervals during 
the course of the study. These  visits are for the purposes of verifying adherence to the 
protocol.  
 
 
 
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
26Apr2019  Protocol:  HDCS  1701   Page 23 of 67 
Version 4.0  
 The study monitor will review the informed consent forms and verify eCRF entries by 
comparing them with the source documents (hospital/clinic/office records) that will be 
made available f or this purpose. The monitor will review the maintenance of regulatory 
documentation and drug accountability. The monitor will review on a regular basis the 
progress of the study with the Principal Investigator and other site personnel.  
eCRF sections may be monitored during these visits. At the end of the study, a closeout 
monitoring visit will be performed. Monitoring visits will be arranged in advance at a 
mutually acceptable time with site personnel. Sufficient time must be allowed by the site 
personnel  for the monitoring of eCRFs and relevant source documents. The Study 
Coordinator and/or Principal Investigator should be available to answer questions or 
resolve data clarifications. Adequate time and space for these visits should be made 
available by the  Principal Investigator.  
g. Audits and Inspections  
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, one or more site visits 
may be undertaken by auditors as authorized representatives of the Sponsor. The purpose 
of the audit is to determine whether or not the study is being conducted and monitored in 
compliance with the protocol, recognized GCP guidelines and all applicable regulations.  
Additionally, the study may be inspected by regulatory agencies. These inspections may 
take place at any ti me during the course of the study and/or after it has been completed.  
THE INVESTIGATOR MUST NOTIFY THE CONTRACT RESEARCH 
ORGANIZATION and SPONSOR PROMPTLY OF ANY INSPECTIONS 
SCHEDULED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, AND PROMPTLY FORWARD 
COPIES OF INSPECTION RE PORTS TO THE SPONSOR.  
h. Modifications to the Protocol  
The procedures defined in the protocol and in the eCRF will be carefully reviewed to 
ensure that all parties involved with the study fully understand the protocol. In order to 
ensure the validity of the d ata, no violations from the protocol, with minimal exceptions, 
may be made unless the issue is broad enough to warrant revision of the protocol. Such 
revisions must be submitted to and have documented approval from the Sponsor and the 
IRB prior to implemen tation. All amendments to the protocol, which involve substantial 
changes in study design, procedure or analyses, may be submitted to FDA IND for prior 
approval (if required).  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated without prior IRB 
approval is to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to a Subject or Subjects. However, 
the Principal Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately and the IRB within 5 
working days after implementation.  
All protocol violations will be reported on the p rotocol violation log and included in the 
study reports. A protocol violation is defined as any change, deviation, or departure from 
the study design or procedures of research project that is NOT approved by the IRB prior 
to its initiation or implementatio n, OR deviation from standard operating procedures, 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), federal, state or local regulations.

well-being of the study volunteers, the study will be conducted as described in the approved 
protocol and performed according to ICH/GCP guidelines. Any deviation from the protocol 
will be recorded and explained. If amendments to the protocol and/or amendments or 
revisions to the ICF are required, the modifications will be documented and submitted to an 
IRB for approval.  
 
27. SUBJECT  INTERVIEWS : 
 
Interviews will be conducted with selected patients, in order to (a) ensure comprehension of the 
IHSSA items, (b) describe the internal hemorrhoid signs and symptoms that are most bothersome 
to patients, and (c) explore the threshold for meaningful within -patient change on the IHSSA 
items.  
 
Cognitive interviews will be completed with the first 5 enrolled patients at a sponsor -selected site 
who agree to participate in the interview. The cognitive interview will involve administering the 
IHSSA to subject s and then asking them about their interpretation of the meaning of the 
instructions, items, and response scale. The cognitive interviews will be completed in-person 
during  Visit 1  or during a separate visit that will occur within 2 weeks of Visit 1 . A cogniti ve 
interview guide that includes a listing of questions that will be asked during the interview is 
included in Appendix 5 . 
 
Exit interviews will be completed with the first 25 enrolled subject s who reach Visit 4 and agree 
to participate in the interview. T he exit interview will involve asking the subject s questions 
regarding their experience in the clinical trial and the signs and symptoms that are most relevant 
for them. Subject s will be asked to discuss the importance of the changes in their internal 
hemo rrhoids while using the study medication. The exit interviews will be completed during or 
within 1 week following  Visit 4. An exit interview guide that includes a listing of questions that 
will be asked during the interview is included in Appendix 6 .

Version 4.0  
 The cognitive and exit interviews will be conducted by a third -party. The interview coordinator 
with the third -party vendor will be in communication with each site to work with each site 
coordinator to identify subject s coming due for their interview.  The site  coordinator will identify 
those who signed a consent form that allows them to be approached for the interview and who 
have already signed consent for their contact information to be provided to the interview team. 
The subject ’s name and telephone number w ill be provided to the interview coordinator via 
phone or posting on a secure FTP site. Contact information and identifying information will not 
be transmitted across unsecure email. The subject  will be telephoned by the interviewer and a 
time convenient to the subject  will be scheduled for the exit interview session.  The exit interview 
will be conducted by phone and audio recorded.  The deidentified voice files will be sent by 
secure FTP site to a professional transcription company  and returned to the third party vendor  for 
analysis.  
 
The consent form will include a description of the qualitative interviews being included in the 
study activities, and it will include a form that asks the subject  to consent to their information 
being provided to the interview coordinator so they can be phoned to schedule the exit interview.  
Participation in the interviews is voluntary.  The clinic coordinator will be provided with an 
overview of the importance and value of the interview s so they can relay this information to the 
subject  when the time for scheduling arrives.  The interview coordinator will provide the subject  
with a description of the purpose of the interview and an opportunity to ask any questions before 
the interview begi ns. A subject  may refuse to move forward with the interview at the time of 
their visit, and they may refuse during the scheduling process or at any time during the interview.  
If a subject  participates in the cognitive or exit interview, all personal contac t information will be 
destroyed immediately following the interview.  Reports generated from the interview data will 
be in aggregate form only and no subject  will be able to be individually identified from any 
report materials.

determine whether additional visits are needed. If a Subject is discontinued from the study during 
an Unsc heduled Visit, the Unscheduled Visit will be referred to as an Early Discontinuation Visit 
and all procedures scheduled for Visit 5 will be performed. If the Unscheduled Visit is not an 
Early Discontinuation Visit (i.e., the Subject will continue to take p art in the study), then all 
procedures scheduled for that interim visit will be performed, with the exception of the collection 
of Investigational Product and Subject diaries from Subjects.  If the Subject’s condition has 
worsened to the degree that it is unsafe for the Subject to continue in the study, the Subject may 
be discontinued from the study as treatment failure and a standard of care treatment may be 
advised at the Principal Investigator’s discretion.

Day Assessment  
 
Internal Hemorrhoid Sign and Symptom Assessment – Training Script  
 
Patient Training (to be completed in clinic upon enrollment)  
During the study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your hemorrhoid -related symptoms each 
day. You will use an electronic device – what we call an electronic diary – to complete the daily questionnaires. 
Some of the questions will be comp leted following a bowel movement.  
Bowel movement means  when you “poop” or “defecate” in the toilet.   
Immediately after every bowel movement during the study, you will make an entry in the electronic diary. This 
procedure will be reviewed with you when you hear more about how to use the electronic diary.  The questions 
following each bowel movement will as k you about the amount of blood in the toilet and on the toilet paper.  
 When we ask about blood in the toilet, we mean blood that you can see in or on the bowel movement or 
poop in the toilet AND blood that you can see mixed in with the water in the toilet .  
 When we ask about blood on the toilet paper, we mean blood that you can see on the toilet paper after 
you wipe yourself.  
There will also be questions following each bowel movement that ask you about hemorrhoid -related pain, 
swelling, pressure, burning, and discomfort  in your anus or rectum during the bowel movement. When we say 
“anus,” we mean the area where your bowel movement leaves your body. When we say “rectum,” we mean the 
area inside of your body just before the anus. The anus and rectum are where  your hemorrhoids are located. You 
would answer these questions by rating how bad the pain, swelling, pressure, burning, and discomfort were in this 
area during the bowel movement.  
Following each bowel movement, you will also answer a question about the sh ape of the bowel movement or 
poop. You will use the following scale to answer this question. You should use your own judgment about which 
picture most closely matches your bowel movement.

In addition to answering some questions following each bowel mo vement, you will answer some questions at the 
end of the day before you go to bed. These questions will ask you about the past 24 hours. If you complete the 
questions at about the same time each day, the 24 hours will be approximately equal to the time sin ce your last 
end of day questionnaire. In these questions, you will be asked to enter any bowel movements that you did not 
enter during the day when they occurred. You will also be asked about bleeding and pain that you may have 
experienced at times other than during bowel movements . For example, you may see blood on your clothes or 
underwear due to hemorrhoids or you might experience pain when sitting.  
You will also answer two questions about itching in your anus and rectum. For these questions about itch ing, you 
will be asked to rate the “worst” itching that you experienced in the past 24 hours and how often you felt itchy. 
You will also be asked a question about how often you experienced hemorrhoid -related pain.  
<For females only>  You will also be asked if you experienced any bleeding due to menstruation in the past 24 
hours. We ask this question so we can try to tell the difference between bleeding due to hemorrhoids and bleeding 
that you may experience due to menstruation.  
Finall y, there will also be questions asking you about how worried and embarrassed you were about your internal 
hemorrhoids and how they have impacted your daily activities and ability to sit down.  
I will now show you the questions and response options. Before I  do, do you have any questions about what you 
will be asked to do?

 IV. APPENDIX 4: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 
(NCI, 2009)  
 
Grades  
 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline. A Semi -colon 
indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade. A single dash ( -) indicates a grade is not 
available.  
 
Grade  Clinical description  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hos pitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care  ADL**.  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE.  
 
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade 
selection. Grade 5 Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL):  
*Instru mental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden

INTERVIEW GUIDE  
Cognitive Interviews for Internal Hemorrhoids  
 
TO BEGIN:    
1. Introduce yourself and your association with the study  
2. Explain purpose of the interview  
3. Thank him/her for willingness to participate  
4. Assure him/her of confidentiality  
5. Let him/her know the general process of how it will proceed  
 
 
 
The Primary Objective of this Interview:  
This interview will take approximately 60 minutes. First I will have you fill out a short questionnaire and then we 
will spend some time looking at how relevant or understandable each of those questions are to your experience with 
internal hemorrhoids.  
 
 
To begin the interview , I want to remind you that it is being recorded. I will try to not use your name from the point 
that I turn on the recorder, and I will ask you to try and not use your name or the names of friends or family in any 
of your responses. This will help keep the interview anonymous.   
 
I will be using the recording  only to remind me of the important things you said so we can represent everything 
more accurately at the end of the study. The recordings will be transcribed, and then put togeth er with transcripts 
from everyone else taking part in these interviews. You won’t be able to be individually identified in any of the 
reports that result from these interviews. This study  information will be used to help make better decisions about 
how to measure these important issues in future studies to treat issues related to people’s experience with internal 
hemorrhoids.    
 
Do you have any questions before we start?

COGNITIVE  INTERVIEW  
 
The Primary Objective of this Interview:  
Determine relevance and comprehension of survey items and instructions as they relate to participants diagnosed 
with internal hemorrhoids.   
First, you will complete a draft version of the questionnaire.  Then we will discuss the instructions and  each of 
the questions to see what they mean to you and how you came to your answer for each item.  
Please take a few minutes to complete the survey.  This survey is designed to be used by patients in a study of 
internal hemorrhoids to tell us about their experience on a daily basis by answering questions on a handheld 
electronic device. We developed the  questions to be completed every day. So, when you read the materials, imagine 
that you were completing them each day outside of the clinic. Be sure to read the instructions in each section, and 
complete each item as best as you can.  
 
[Interviewer : Note s tart time, finish time for the instrument as indicated below.].  
DO NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS during this time but make note of any that are asked]  
 
Time started: ________ Time completed: _________  
 
Total time needed: ___________(min)  
 
 
[Interviewer : Once Patient has completed the questionnaire and you have the timing recorded, please continue.]  
 
For the next part of the interview, I would like to ask you about the individual items on this questionnaire so we can 
understand specifically what each item means  to you (what they make you think about as you formulate your 
answer).  
 
I will be asking you to tell me what thoughts you had about each of these questions and what examples you thought 
about from your own life to help you come to the response you selected  in each case.  We also want your impression 
about how clear each item is, how easy or difficult each item is to complete, and to what degree the items are 
meaningful to you.

 INSTRUCTIONS:  
Let’s start with the instructions across the top of the page.  
Actual Instruction Text:  
During the study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your hemorrhoid -related symptoms 
each day. You will use an electronic device – what we call an electronic diary – to complete the daily 
questionnaires. Some of the questions will be comp leted following a bowel movement.  
 
Bowel movement means  when you “poop” or “defecate” in the toilet.   
 
Immediately after every bowel movement during the study, you will make an entry in the electronic diary. 
This procedure will be reviewed with you when you hear more about how to use the electronic diary.  The 
questions following each bowel movement will ask you about the amount of blood in the toilet and on the 
toilet paper.  
  
• When we ask about blood in the toilet, we mean blood that you can see in   or on the 
bowel movement or poop in the toilet AND blood that you can  see  mixed in with the water in 
the toilet.  
 
• When we ask about blood on the toilet paper, we mean blood that you can  see on the toilet 
paper after you wipe yourself.  
 
There will also  be questions following each bowel movement that ask you about hemorrhoid -related pain, 
swelling, pressure, burning, and discomfort  in your anus or rectum during the bowel movement. When 
we say “anus,” we mean the area where your bowel movement leaves your  body. When we say “rectum,” 
we mean the area inside of your body just before the anus. The anus and rectum are where your 
hemorrhoids are located. You would answer these questions by rating how bad the pain, swelling, pressure, 
burning, and discomfort wer e in this area during the bowel movement.  
 
Following each bowel movement, you will also answer a question about the shape of the bowel movement 
or poop. You will use the following scale to answer this question. You should use your own judgment 
about which picture most closely matches your bowel movement.

Version 4.0  
  
In addition to answering some questions following each bowel movement, you will answer some questions 
at the end of the day before you go to bed. These questions will ask you about the past 24 hours. If you 
complete the questions at about the same time eac h day, the 24 hours will be approximately equal to the 
time since your last end of day questionnaire. In the these questions, you will be asked to enter any bowel 
movements that you did not enter during the day when they occurred. You will also be asked ab out 
bleeding and pain that you may have experienced at times other than during bowel movements . For 
example, you may see blood on your clothes or underwear due to hemorrhoids or you might experience 
pain when sitting.  
 
You will also answer two questions a bout itching in your anus and rectum. For these questions about 
itching, you will be asked to rate the “worst” itching that you experienced in the past 24 hours and how 
often you felt itchy. You will also be asked a question about how often you experienced  hemorrhoid -related 
pain.  
 
<For females only>  You will also be asked if you experienced any bleeding due to menstruation in the 
past 24 hours. We ask this question so we can try to tell the difference between bleeding due to 
hemorrhoids and bleeding that you may experience due to menstruation.  
 
Finally, there will also be questions asking you about how worried and embarrassed you were about your 
internal hemorrhoids and how they have impacted your daily activities and ability to sit down.  
 
I will now show you the questions and response options. Before I do, do you have any questions about what 
you will be asked to do?  
 
 
To be sure these instructions are understandable; please give me a short description back, in your own words, 
what it is these instructions  are asking you to do.  
 Did you have any difficulty understanding these instructions?  (if so, please describe)

participating in the clinical trial you just finished for internal hemorrhoids.  
 
 
To begin the interview , I want to remind you that it is being recor ded. I will try to not use your name from the point 
that I turn on the recorder, and I will ask you to try and not use your name or the names of friends or family in any 
of your responses. This will help keep the interview anonymous.   
 
I will be using the  recording  only to remind me of the important things you said so we can represent everything 
more accurately at the end of the study. The recordings will be transcribed, and then put together with transcripts 
from everyone else taking part in these intervi ews. You won’t be able to be individually identified in any of the 
reports that result from these interviews. This study  information will be used to help make better decisions about 
how to measure these important issues in future studies to treat issues re lated to people’s experience with internal 
hemorrhoids.    
 
 
Do you have any questions before we start?

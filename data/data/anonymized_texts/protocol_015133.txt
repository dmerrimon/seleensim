PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) compared to placebo on a background of mometasone furoate nasal 
spray (MFNS) in reducing nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) severity 
and endoscopic nasal polyposis score (NPS) in patients with bilateral 
nasal polyposis (NP). In addition for Japan, reduction in computed 
tomography (CT) scan opacification of the sinuses will be also a co-
primary objective. 
Secondary objectives

score (TSS). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell.  
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan 
opacification of the sinuses (for Japan, this is part of the primary 
objective).  
• To evaluate the ability of dupilumab in reducing the proportion of 
patients who require treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) or 
surgery for NP. 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on patient reported outcomes 
(PROs) and health related quality of life (HRQoL). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w up to Week 52. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w up to Week 24 
followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) up to Week 52. 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with 
prior surgery and co-morbid asthma [including non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID) exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD)]. 
• To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP.  
• To evaluate functional dupilumab c oncentrations (systemic exposure) 
and incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA). 
Exploratory objectives  
• To explore the effects of dupilumab on biomarkers of type 2/TH2 inflammation in blood, . 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on healthcare resource utilization. 
• To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on SNOT-22 items: “decreased 
sense of smell/taste”, “difficulty falling asleep”, “'wake up at night”, 
“lack of a good night's sleep”, “wake up tired”, “fatigue”, and “reduced productivity”. 
• To assess the effect of dupilumab in improving sense of taste.

EFC14280 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 STUDY DESIGN General design 
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study comparing the efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo, in 
patients with bilateral NP treated with intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). 
Study periods The clinical trial consists of 3 periods: 
Run-in period (4 weeks +/-3 days): 
All patients will enter a run-in period of 4 weeks receiving MFNS of 2 actuations 
(50 µg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 400 µg, 
starting at Visit 1 (V1), unless the patients are unable to tolerate or there is a 
specific regulatory requirement preventing use of this dose in which case, they 
can stay on a lower dose regimen (200 µg once daily) of MFNS. 
Randomized treatment period (up to 52 weeks +/-3 days): 
Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatments: 
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) q2w until Week 52. 
• Arm B: dupilumab 300 mg SC q2w until Week 24, then 300 mg q4w 
until Week 52. 
• Arm C: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52. 
All patients will continue on the stable dos e of MFNS used during the run-in 
period except if dose is changed due to adverse event (AE). 
Rescue:  
During the study treatment period and off treatment follow-up, based on clinical 
evaluation, in case of worsening of signs and/or symptoms requiring medical 
intervention, the Investigator may consider rescue treatment with: 
• Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in 
case of acute infection) 
• Short course oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone) 
• Sino-nasal surgery for nasal polyps (based on previous observations, 
8 weeks of IMP treatment is reco mmended prior to surgery to allow 
onset of treatment effect). 
Patients receiving rescue treatment other than surgery during the study should continue on study drug unless the Investi gator decides to withdraw the study 
treatment (see Section 8.2.2). Before starting treatment with SCS patients 
should come to the study site for the clinical assessments including endoscopy and PROs. 
For patients who undergo or are planned for surgery for NP the Investigator may 
decide to continue IMP up to the time of surgery or end of treatment whichever 
date comes first (see Section 9.2.1.5 for details). At the time of surgery patients 
will be permanently discontinued from study treatment and assessed as soon as 
possible using
 the procedures described in Section  10.3.1 . 
Post treatment period (12 weeks +/- 3 days): 
After completing 52 weeks of treatment  with the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) (or following early discontinuation of IMP or discontinuation from 
the study), patients will be instructed to: 
Return to the study site for such evaluations as pharmacokinetic (PK) and ADA, 
physical examination, nasal peak inspir atory flow (NPIF), University of 
Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), NPS, PROs (SNOT-22, VAS),

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: 
The sample size is chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the 
efficacy between dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) and placebo 
with regard to the 2 co-primary endpoints, changes from baseline in NC and 
NPS at Week 24.  
The observed mean NC reduction of the dupilumab group with weekly dosing (qw) in ACT12340 is 0.95 and the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To calculate power, a conser vative estimate is used that assumes 
the placebo-adjusted NC reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% 
of the dupilumab 300 mg qw group, the mean NC reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 * (0.95 - 0.26) + 0.26. 
Assuming normal distribution of the change in NC, a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.03, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the 
q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will have 99% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.534 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group.  
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in 
ACT12340 is 1.85 and the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group 
is 0.30. Using same conservative appr oach that assumes the placebo-adjusted 
NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% of the dupilumab 
300 mg qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 
then assumed to be 1.54 = 0.8*(1.85-0.30)+0.30. Assuming normal distribution 
of the change in NPS, a common standard deviation (SD) of 2.11, which has 
incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the 
study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.588 using a two-sided 
test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab  
300 mg q2w group.  
Therefore, with a sample size of 240 patients for the q2w pool (Arm A and B) at 
Week 24, the combined power of the 2 co -primary efficacy endpoints is at least 
98% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the 2 endpoints. 
The observed mean LMK reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in 
ACT12340 is 9.07 and the observed mean LMK reduction of the placebo group is 0.23. Using same conservative appr oach that assumes the placebo-adjusted 
LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 80% of the dupilumab 
300 mg qw, the mean LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 
then assumed to be 7.30 = 0.8*(9.07-0.23)+0.23. Assuming normal distribution 
of the change in LMK, a common standard deviation (SD) of 5.50, which has 
incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% 
dropout rate, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the 
study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 1.285 using a two-sided 
test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in LMK at Week 24 in the dupilumab  300 mg q2w group. 
With a same sample size of 240 patients for the q2w pool (Arm A and B) at 
Week 24, the combined power of the 3 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Japan 
is at least 97% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming no 
negative correlation between the 3 endpoints. 
Assuming the proportion of patients receiving SCS and/or  who undergo or are 
planned for surgery for NP  is 15% in the placebo group, and is 5% in the 
dupilumab group, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in 
placebo, the study will have 87% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.316 between the treatment groups using a two- sided log rank test with alpha = 0.05. 
The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor 7. 
Randomization:  
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1:1 randomization ratio to dupilumab 
300 mg q2w, dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w, or placebo. The randomization will be 
stratified based on asthma status, prior surgery, and country. 
Analysis population  
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the 
randomized ITT population which includes all patients who have been allocated 
to a randomized treatment regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or 
not. The efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the treatment to which

The analysis population for safety endpoints is defined as all patients exposed 
to study medication, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. The 
safety analyses will be conducted according to the treatment patients actually 
received. 
The treatment emergent period is def ined as the time from the first 
administration of study medication to  Week 12 of post treatment period. 
Co-primary efficacy variables The co-primary efficacy variables are: change from baseline in NC and in NPS 
at Week 24 assessed for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) versus 
placebo, respectively. 
The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for pooled dupilumab 
arms against placebo:  
• H0: No treatment difference between the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo. 
• H1: There is a treatment difference between the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo. 
 Analysis of the co-primary efficacy variables 
Each of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (3 co-primary efficacy endpoints for 
Japan) will be analyzed using a hybrid method of the worst-observation carried 
forward (WOCF) and the multiple imputat ion. With this approach, for patients 
who undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data collected  
postsurgery or post SCS will be set to missing, and the worst postbaseline value 
on or before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to impute missing Week 24 
value (for patients whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will 
be used to impute). For patients who discontinue the treatment without being 
rescued by surgery or receiving SCS, a multiple imputation approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value, and this multiple imputation will use all 
patients who have not been rescued by surgery or receiving SCS at Week 24 and data collected after treatment discontinuation will be included in the 
analysis. Each of the imputed complete data will be analyzed by fitting an 
ANCOVA model with the baseline covariate and factors for treatment, asthma 
status, prior surgery history, and regions. Statistical inference obtained from all 
imputed data will be combined using Rubin’s rule. Descriptive statistics including number of subjects mean, standard error, and least squares (LS) means will be 
provided. In addition, difference in  LS means and the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) will be provided along with the p-values. 
Analyses of key secondary efficacy endpoints

300 mg q2w versus placebo  
The change from baseline in TSS, SNOT-22, UPSIT, daily loss of smell and 
LMK score at Week 24 will be assessed for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A

corresponding 95% CI will be provided for dupilumab 300 mg q2w versus the 
placebo. 
Analysis of the change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 52 
 
The change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 52 will be assessed 
separately for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (Arm A) and dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w 
(Arm B) versus placebo and will be analyzed using the hybrid method of the 
WOCF and the MI in the same fashion as for the co-primary endpoints.  
Analyses of other secondary efficacy endpoints  
Analyses of efficacy endpoints for Arm A and Arm B versus placebo at Week 52  
The change from baseline in TSS, SNOT-22, UPSIT, daily loss of smell and 
LMK score at Week 52 will be assessed separately for dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
(Arm A) and dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w (Arm B) versus placebo and will be 
analyzed using the hybrid method of the WOCF and the MI in the same fashion 
as for the key secondary endpoints of change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 52. 
Proportion of patients with first SCS rescue or surgery (actual or planned) for NP 
during the treatment period up to Week 52 will be assessed separately for 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w (Arm A) and dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w (Arm B) 
versus placebo and will be analyzed using the same approach as those for the key secondary endpoint of the proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery 
(actual or planned) for NP during the treatment period for dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w versus placebo. With this approach, proportion of patients with first SCS 
rescue or surgery (actual or planned) fo r NP during the treatment period will be 
derived and analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model and log rank test stratified by asthma status, pr ior surgery history, and regions, by 
considering the first SCS rescue use or surgery (actual or planned) for NP as 
the event. The entire treatment period in  Arms A, B, and C will be used in the 
analysis, and comparisons will be made between Arms A and C, and between 
Arms B and C, separately. Descriptive statistics including number of patients 
with rescue or surgery and number of patients without rescue or surgery 
(censored) and the corresponding rates will be provided by treatment group. 
The estimates of the hazard ratio and co rresponding 95% CI will be provided for 
Arms A versus C and Arms B versus C, respectively. 
Analysis for Arms A versus B at week 52
 
Comparisons between dupilumab 300mg q2w and dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w 
will be made at Week 52. For such comparisons, descriptive statistics will be provided, and no statistical testing will be conducted. In more details, for

statistics including number of patients with rescue or surgery and number of 
patients without rescue or surgery (censored) and the corresponding rates will 
be provided by treatment group. In addition, corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals between Arms A and B will be provided. 
Time course profile of the different efficacy endpoints over 52 weeks will be 
provided to estimate magnitude of effect loss after w24 potentially resulting from the switch to a lower dosing/regimen (q4w) in the arm B of EFC14280 study. 
Analysis of sub-groups with comorbid asthma/NERD and prior surgery 
 
For each subgroup factor, interaction tests will be carried out to investigate 
consistency of the dupilumab effect across different subgroups identified by that 
factor.  
In addition, for these subgroups, comparisons at Week 24 will be analyzed 
between dupilumab 300mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) versus placebo, and 
comparisons at Week 52 will be analyzed separately between dupilumab 300mg 
q2w (Arm A) versus placebo, and between dupilumab 300mg q2w/q4w (Arm B) 
versus placebo. Details of these analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. 
In addition to the analysis in the current study, statistical analysis for these 
subgroups with comorbid asthma/NER D and prior surgery will be further 
conducted using the pooled data of EFC14280 and EFC14146, and the details 
will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the Integrated Summary 
of Efficacy (ISE).  
Analysis of responder type endpoints
 
For any responder type endpoints, the Coch ran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified 
by asthma status, prior surgery histor y, and region will be used. Comparisons of 
the proportions of responders between dupilumab 300mg q2w and placebo and 
between dupilumab 300 mg q2w/q4w and placebo will be derived. Patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive SC S for any reason will be considered as 
non-responders for time points after using SCS or surgery. For patients who discontinue treatment without using SCS or surgery, data collected during the 
off- treatment period will be used to determine the responder/non- responder 
status. Missing data will be considered as non-responders. 
Analysis of the proportion and time-to-event of patients with SCS rescue for any 
airway exacerbated disease  
Proportion and time-to-event of patient s with SCS rescue for any airway 
exacerbated disease will be analyzed using a similar approach as the key 
secondary endpoint of the proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery 
(actual or planned) for NP. 
The safety variables, including AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical examinations will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. 
Missing data handling: 
For all continuous efficacy endpoints, in the primary approach for missing data 
handling, for patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data collected postsurgery or post SCS will be set to missing, and the 
worst postbaseline value on or before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to

postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will be used to impute), and for 
patients who discontinue the treatment without being rescued by surgery or receiving SCS on or before the analyzed visit, a multiple imputation approach 
will be used to impute missing value at the certain analyzed visit, and this 
multiple imputation will use all patients who have not been rescued by surgery 
or receiving SCS at that analyzed visit and data collected after treatment 
discontinuation will be included in the analysis. 
For responder type endpoints, patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive 
SCS for any reason will be considered as non-responders for time points after 
using SCS or surgery; for patients who discontinue treatment without using SCS 
or surgery, data collected during the off- treatment period will be used to determine the responder/non-responder status, and missing data will be 
considered as non-responders. 
In addition, the reason and pattern of missing data will be carefully examined 
and tipping point analyses and other sensitivity analyses will also be performed. 
Multiplicity considerations: 
The multiplicity procedure is proposed to control the overall type-I error rate for 
testing the co-primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha is 
0.05. The comparisons with placebo will be tested based on the hierarchical order below at 2-sided α = 0.05:  
1) Co-primary efficacy endpoints: 
In countries other than Japan: 
• Change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus placebo. 
In Japan: 
• Change from baseline in NC, in NPS, and in CT LMK at Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus placebo. 
2) Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
• Change from baseline in TSS at Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus 
placebo. 
• Change from baseline in UPSIT at  Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus 
placebo. 
• Change from baseline in loss of smell daily symptoms at Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus placebo. 
• Change from baseline in SNOT-22 at Week 24 for 300mg q2w versus 
placebo. 
• Change from baseline in CT LMK score at Week 24 for 300mg q2w 
versus placebo (this will not be a secondary endpoint for Japan as it is 
already a co-primary endpoint). 
• Proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery (actual or planned) 
for NP during the treatment period. 
• Change from baseline in NPS at W eek 52 for q2w (Arm A) versus 
placebo (Arm C). 
• Change from baseline in NC at Week 52 for q2w (Arm A) versus placebo (Arm C).

In countries other than Japan, the study  is considered positive when both  
co-primary endpoints, the change from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 24, 
achieve statistical significance. 
In Japan, the study is considered posit ive when all co-primary endpoints, the 
change from baseline in NC, in NPS, and in CT LMK at Week 24, achieve 
statistical significance. 
First step analysis:  
A first step analysis may be performed when all patients complete the Week 24 
visit, including early dropouts. The co-primary endpoints and other 24-week 
endpoints and proportion of patients with SCS rescue or surgery for NP (actual or planned) will be analyzed at this first step analysis
 as the final analysis for 
these endpoints, and 52-week endpoints will not be analyzed at this first step analysis. No decision on the conduct of the study will be made based on the first 
step analysis (in particular, no decision to prematurely stop the study). Specific 
steps will be taken to maintain the blind of the study to all individuals involved in 
the conduct of the study and/or analysis. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  The total duration of the study (per patient) is expected to be approximately 
68 weeks: 
• Run-in period (4 weeks +/- 3 days).  
• Randomized treatment period (52 weeks +/- 3 days). 
• Post treatment period (12 weeks +/- 3 days).

R*= Randomization; EOT: end of treatment; EOS: end of study; V: Visit; D: Day; q2w: every 2 weeks; q4w: every 4 weeks; 
IMP: Regardless of the treatment group, all randomized patients w ill receive q2w subcutaneous admini strations of dupilumab or plac ebo. For Arm B, after week 24 dupilumab ad ministration will be al terned by placebo 
matched injection every other week up to week 50 (last IMP admin istration). Every other week investigational product administra tions must be separated by at least 11 days. At V2 the Investigator or delegate will 
perform the injection. After V2, every other  week administration of IMP will be perform ed at the investigati onal site up to at least Week 8 (V6). Patients will be monitored at the study site for at least 30 minutes or 
minimum time required by your local regulator after injections. Fr om Week 10, every other week home administration of IMP (pati ent, caregiver, or health care professional) is possible if the patient (or the caregiver) 
has been trained. If the patient (or caregi ver) is unable or unwilling to  administer IMP, arrangements must be made for qualifi ed site personnel and/or healthcare professionals to administer IMP for the doses not 
scheduled to be given at the study site.  Non-investigational medicinal product : mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) w ill be self-administered by the patient twic e daily or once daily (if they cannot tole rate twice daily). At each visit the Investigator 
must ensure that the patient has the necessary doses up to the next visit, knowing that one MFNS device (1 bottle) contains suf ficient doses for: either 2 weeks of BID treatment/regimen or 4 weeks of QD 
treatment/regimen.

a The run-in period is 28 days in duration to run in any patient on MFNS, and to collect baseline data. Patients receiving rescue medication with SCS or and surgery during this period will not be randomized. V2 w ill take 
place 28 days+/-3 days window after V1. Window for subsequent visits is also +/-3 days. Assessments/procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order if applicable: Patient-reported outcomes and 
other questionnaires; Procedures; Safety and laboratory assessments; IMP administration. 
b Optional interim visits may be scheduled at site for IMP/NIMP supply or IMP administration. 
c Patients who discontinue treatment early will be assessed as soon as pos sible using the pr ocedures normally planned for the EOT  Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in  
Section  10.3.1. 
d Past medical history including allergic comorbidities (asthma, aspirin sensitivity, allergic rhinitis etc.). Surgeries for NP w ill be assessed including number, ty pe and dates of sino-nasal sur geries, polypec tomies in 
the past. Systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use (number of courses, doses, way of administration and duration) in the past 2 years before V1 and/or contraindication/intolerance to SCS, as well as long term 
antibiotics use (>2weeks) in the previous year will be entered in the e-CRF.  NERD: NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug) Exacerbated Respiratory Disease will be asse ssed through a s pecific questionna ire 
Appendix F.   
e Spirometry (FEV1, FVC and FEF 25-75): should be performed anytime during run-in period (between V1 and V2) before a first admin istration of IMP for all patients, locally after withholding the last dose of 
salbutamol/albuterol or levosa lbutamol/leval buterol for at least 6 hours. FEV1, FVC and FEF 25-75 will be determined at the des ignated treatment visits. All patients should have the result of FEV1 (% of predicted 
normal) recorded in e-CRF: anytime during run-in period (before V2). Patients with forced expiratory volume (FEV1) 50% or less (of predicted normal) will not  be randomized. For the ot her scheduled vi sits during 
the randomized treatment period, spirometry  will be performed only in patients with as thma and the result of FEV1, FVC and FEF 25-75 will be recorded in  e-CRF at the study scheduled visits. 
f Chest X-ray if no chest imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) is available within the previous year of V1. In countries for which a specific  approval procedure for the x-ray or CT scan is required by a different committee than 
the local EC/IRB, a chest MRI between V1 and V2 can be performed. Note for Japan: According to the request from the health auth ority, chest X-ray should be performed at V1 if there is no chest imaging (Chest 
X-ray, CT, MRI) available within 3 months prior to V1 to exclude patients with suspected active or untreated latent tuberculosi s.  
g Refer to Section  1 and Section  6 Study Design for details on treatment arms. IMP will be administered after completion of all scheduled clinical  assessments an d sample collections at the visit or at home. 
h Electronic diary/NPIF meter is used for daily recording of MFNS use, morning NPIF (daily up to Week 24 and monthly from Week 24  onward) and daily symptoms severity from V1 to end of study): 1) nasal 
congestion/obstruction 2) anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose), 3) posterior rhinorrhea (post nasal drip), and 4) loss of sense of smell, scored using a 0-3 categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 
2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms); This device is dispensed at V1 and information is downloaded from this device o n the other indicated days. For nasal congestion, a severity ≥2 on V1 and a 
weekly average severity greater than 1 at time of randomization (V2) is  required and will be made available to the site to dete rmine patient eligibility. If there are 4 or more measurements collected within 7 days 
prior to randomization, the baseline will be the average of these measurements; if less than 4 measurements are collected, the baseline will be the average of the most recent 4 prior to randomization.

be dispensed by the site to the patient through a scheduled or unscheduled in-clinic visit. Use of oral steroids for rescue tre atment of worsening nasal polyps or for another reason will be captured by the 
Investigator (or designee) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF page and the date and dosing information (daily dose, durati on, INN) will be informed. Details on act ual or planned date for surgery for NP, type 
and outcome (whenever possible) of surgery will be recorded in a specific e-CRF page.  If surgery is performed during the study treatment period or follow-up an AE or SAE page will be completed. Patients will be 
discontinued from study treatment and assessed as soon as possible using the procedures normally planned for the EOT Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in  
Section  10.3.1. If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be perfo rmed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date 
and outcome. Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
j Nasal endoscopy: endoscopy (incl uding use of decongestants before the procedure) will be performed after all other efficacy ass essments have been completed for each visit; Standard video sequences will be 
downloaded by the Investigator to  the central reader’s secured internet site. For eligibilit y, central reading of V1 will be us ed. At V2, Investigator will revi ew V1 results from central reader to confirm entry criteria and 
reconfirm eligibility based on review of Incl usion/Exclusion Crit eria and the V2 endoscopy loca l reading. To confirm eligibilit y at V2, only the V1 central reading will be made available to the site. In addition at V2 the 
investigator will perform the NE to confirm eligibility score and enter the result in t he e-CRF. Thus the pa tient is considered  eligible based on a V1 central reading followed by a V2 local reading NPS score of 5 or 
more and at least 2 each side. The final results of central reading from V2 onward will be made available to the site after the  study. 
k A CT scan should be performed anytime during the run-in period before the first administration of IMP and at V8 (Week 24). Cent ral reading will be used for comparison baseline (BL) to Week 24 for the primary 
analysis and at EOT. A Week 52 CT scan may be performed if approved by local ethics committees. A Week 52 CT scan may be perfor med if approved by local ethics committees. Whenever possible a cone 
beam CT scan should can be ut ilized. In countries where local EC  do not approve a CT scan or fo r which a specif ic approval proc edure for the CT scan is required by a different committee than the local EC/IRB, 
patients may be enrolled using a CT available in the previous year or perform an MRI of the sinuses between V1 and V2. These co untries will be exempt ed from all the planned study CT scans until approval from 
these committees is received. The MRI will be used only for confirmation of exclusion criteria. 
l During the study the PROs should be completed by the patient in the e-diary, in the following order: daily symptoms of NC, loss  of smell and anterior and posterior rhinorr hea; SNOT-22; VAS rhinosinusitis; EQ-5D; 
ACQ-6 (in patients with asthma). 
m Health care resource utilization to be collected through the eCRF.  
n Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), body temper ature (degrees Celsius) and body weight (kg) will be m easured at the screening and 
randomization visits  (V1 and V2) and subsequent visit pre-specified in the flow-chart. Height  (cm) will be measured at screenin g (V1) only. Vital signs will be measured prior to receiving IMP at the clinic visits in the 
sitting position using preferably the same arm at each visit. 
o Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell (WBC) count with five-part differential count, and total red blood cell count. Serum chemistry: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, uric acid, total cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in ca se of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and nonconj ugated bilirubin) , alanine amin o
 transferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonate, and cre atine phosphokinase. Clinical laboratory testing at V1 includes hepatitis screen 
covering hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) including  HBcAb IgM and total, hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCVAb), Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screen (anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies ) and antinuclear antibody (ANA). In case of results showin g HBsAg (negative), and HBcAb total or HBcAb IgM (positive), an HBV DNA 
testing may be performed prior to randomization to rule out a false positivity if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive, or to clarify the serological status if the Investigator finds it unclear to interpret in absence of known HBV infection. In case of results showing HCV Ab (positive), an HCV RNA testing may be performed to rule out a  false positivity, if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive. Note: 
Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is positive ( ≥1:160 titer). Tuberculosis local testing at baseline would be performed on a country by country basis according to local guidel ines if required by regulatory 
authorities or ethic committees.  
p This is only applicable for patients in countries/regions where there is local regulatory requirement who are HBs Ag negative a nd HBs Ab positive at the run-in period visit.  
q Serum pregnancy test at V1 and urine pregnancy tests every 4 weeks thereafter. A negative result must be obtained between V1 an d V2 prior to randomization visits. Urinary test could be performed at home as 
part of visit with or without the assistance of a home care provider. In case of positive urinary test the study treatment will be withhold and a serum pregnancy test to confirm the pregnancy should be performed as soon as possible. Pregnancy will lead to definit ive treatment discontinuation in all cases. 
r Serum dupilumab concentration, immune response assessment (ADA) samples will be collected and archived prior to administration of investigational product and during the randomized treatment period. Blood 
samples for PK and ADA assessment will be collected at any time in case an SAE occurs. In response to AE’s of special interest like anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity additional ADA samples closer to the event 
may be analyzed, based on the judgment of the medical Investigator and/or medical monitor. Patients who are ADA positive at the ir last study visit (early termination or end of study), will be considered for 
follow-up based on the overall clinical presentation at that time. Patients who are considered for follow-up may be asked to re turn to the clinic to have additional samples collected for analysis

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP ) is a clinical condition characterized by the 
presence of multiple polyps in the upper nasal cavity, originating from the osteomeatal complex 
(OC) and the spheno-ethmoid recess and characterized by mucosal inflammation of the nasal 
cavity and paranasal sinuses with symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks. Clinically, CRSwNP is defined by long-term symptoms of  nasal obstruction and congestion, reduction in or loss of sense 
of smell, and anterior and posterior rhinorrhea. These symptoms can impact greatly upon a patient’s quality of life (QoL). The presence or absence of polyps is confirmed by performing 
endoscopy. Coronal computed tomography (CT) scans can confirm the presence and extent of 
sinus and polyp involvement. With an estimated prevalence of 2% to 4% (in Europe and the 
United States [US]), CRSwNP has a high burden of symptoms and a high relapse rate after 
treatment. Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity associated with CRSwNP, treatment option range from local  or systemic corticosteroids (SCS) to functional endoscopic 
sinus surgery. Patients with CRSwNP and como rbid asthma (30% of  patients) have a 
characteristically poor therapeutic response and a high recurrence rate, and their disease tends to be more resistant ( 1, 2). 
The pathogenesis of nasal polyps is unknown. Nasal polyps are most commonly thought to be 
caused by allergy, although a significant number ar e associated with non-alle rgic adult asthma or 
no respiratory or allergic trigger that can be demonstrated. Risk factors include genetic 
susceptibility, anatomic abnormalities, infection, local immunologic imbalance and eicosanoid dysmetabolism (manifested as aspirin intolerance), some or most of which may play a role in its pathogenesis ( 3, 4, 5). 
Pathophysiologically, CRSwNP is an inflammatory  and remodeling process affecting the mucosa 
of the nose and paranasal sinuses often associated with mucocilliary impairment, bacterial 
infection, allergic disease, a nd/or anatomical abnormalities ( 6, 7, 8). CRSwNP is a T-helper cell-2 
(Th2) driven inflammatory process in which eo sinophils are the predominant inflammatory cell 
found in the sinuses and nasal polyps, and is frequently associated with asthma and aspirin 
sensitivity ( 9). In European and US populations, more than 80% of patients with CRSwNP have 
eosinophilic upper airway inflammation. The extent of sinomucosal involvement, the size of the 
polyps, and the severity of nasal disease correl ate with the extent of eosinophilic inflammation 
(10). The chronic inflammation asso ciated with eosinophilic polyps exhibits elevated levels of

immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the nasal polyps and local secretions ( 11).  
The therapeutic armamentarium of clinically proven medical interventions for CRSwNP is limited. First-line treatment is topical corticosteroids. Intranasal corticosteroid sprays (INCS) improve the symptoms of nasal obstruction ( 12), secretion, and sneezing to some extent. 
However, their effect in reducing polyp si ze and on improving the sense of smell ( 13), a cardinal 
symptom of nasal polyposis (NP) ( 14) is limited. Overall, due to the relatively modest effects on

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 the symptoms of NP, in many instances, INCSs do  not address the main QoL issues for patients. 
Short courses of oral steroids ar e also prescribed as adjunctive therapy to INCS or in cases of 
severe disease ( 15); however, the long-term use of systemic  steroids for the treatment of nasal 
polyps is not recommended as the risk of prolonge d systemic steroids use is not outweighed by 
the benefit ( 12). 
The current US practice guidelines indicate th at the duration of clin ical benefit of oral 
corticosteroids (OCS) is variable and may decrease with repeated courses of treatment ( 16). 
The only alternative for most patients that respond inadequately to medical tr eatment is surgery of 
the sinuses. However, even after surgical treatment , continued use of at least INCS is needed and 
disease recurrence requiring repeated surgeries is high. 
Recent therapeutic approaches have been focu sed on trying to control the Th2 response and 
clinical improvement in CRSwNP and associated symptoms were observed in other studies of 
biological therapies, including the anti- IgE monoclonal antibody (mAB) omalizumab ( 17) or the 
anti-IL-5 mAB mepolizumab ( 18).  
Dupilumab is a systemic targeted immunomodulatory agent, inhibiting the Th2 pathway. It is a 
fully human mAB directed against the interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R α) subunit, a component 
of IL-4 receptors Type I and Type II, which medi ate signaling by IL-4 (both receptors) and by 
IL-13 (Type II receptor). Dupilumab binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 activation of 
their respective receptors. For further information regarding the preclinical  and clinical evaluati on of dupilumab to date, 
refer to the current version of the Investigator Brochure.  Dupilumab is in clinical development for the treatment of CRSwNP worldwide. However in the 
US, based on FDA feed-back, this clinical deve lopment program will support the indication of 
nasal polyposis. 
Preliminary clinical evidence, based on the proof of concept (POC) data and the mechanism of 
action, suggests that dupilumab provides an effective treatment and substantial improvement over INCS for patients suffering from CRSwNP. In  a POC study (ACT12340), 60 patients with 
bilateral NP and chronic symptoms of sinusitis refractory to nasal corticosteroids were randomized to dupilumab 300 mg once weekly (qw)  SC administration for 16 weeks or placebo, 
with background mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) (NASONEX). In this study, dupilumab 
demonstrated a significant improve ment in endoscopic, radiographic and clinical measures of NP 
and sinusitis, as well as improvements in lung function and disease control in patients with comorbid asthma ( 19). 
Dupilumab, therefore, offers promise of signifi cant benefit above and bey ond current standard of 
care in this patient population and may provide an  alternative for those patients who are respond 
inadequately to INCS and may obviate the need for repeated surgeries.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 33 4.2 STUDY RATIONALE 
This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of dupilumab in 
patients with moderate to  severe signs and symptoms of NP who are not controlled on standard of 
care. 
This study will primarily investigate the efficacy  and safety of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks 
(q2w) (Arms A and B) as compared to placebo (A rm C) on top of the current standard of care 
background therapy (daily use of intranasal MF NS [NASONEX]), utilizing multiple objective and 
subjective outcome measures in patients with NP. By allowing Investigators, at their discretion, to 
use SCS or surgery as a rescue therapy for worsening of NP, the study will also assess the effect of dupilumab on the need for surgery and SC S use over the randomized treatment period. 
In addition, the study is designed to inform on th e long-term efficacy of an initial treatment with 
dupilumab 300 q2w for 24 weeks followed by a less frequent dosing regimen (300 mg every 4 weeks [q4w]) up to Week 52 .  
4.3 POPULATION 
The population of the EFC14280 study is composed  of patients with b ilateral NP (endoscopic 
bilateral nasal polyp sc ore [NPS] has to be ≥ 5 out of a maximum score of 8) who present with 
chronic symptoms of nasal congestion (NC) (mod erate/severe) and another symptom such as loss 
of smell or rhinorrhea despite background trea tment with INCS and maximum therapy with 
standard of care including SCS (in the previous  2 years) and/or surgery in the past (see Section  
7.1).  
The proposed patient selection cr iteria will reflect standard of care in this severe uncontrolled 
patient setting by allowing enrollment of patients that received INCS, SCS prior to the run-in 
period and/or patients with  previous surgeries.  
Approximately 26-50% of NP patients suffer from comorbid asthma and it is estimated that 
asthma is underdiagnosed in up to 25% of these patients ( 20, 21).NP has also been observed to be 
associated with chronic bronchitis and, in t hose with asthma, lower airway obstruction ( 6, 20).  
NP patients also more frequently present with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance ( 22) and if they also suffer from asthma they are diagnosed with NSAID exacerbated 
respiratory disease (NERD).  
These patients have the highest rates of exacer bation and hospital admissi ons and tend to have a 
poorer perception of control of disease, due to the persistence and severity of the associated 
sinonasal symptoms ( 23). Additionally, asthma symptoms tend to be more severe in these 
patients. Taking into account the high prevalence, the hi gh disease burden and unmet need of NP patients 
who have co-morbid asthma or NERD, these patients will be allowed to enter the study (unless 
they present with any of the exclusion criteria described in the Exclusion Criteria Section  7.2). In 
addition, stratification at rando mization for asthma and specif ic sub-group analysis will be 
performed to specifically assess efficacy in these subgroups.

4.4 STUDY DESIGN 
This phase 3 multinational, mu lticenter, randomized, double-bli nd, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study will evaluate the efficacy of dupilu mab 300 mg administered s ubcutaneous (SC) q2w 
for 52 weeks on a background of INCS. The efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w for 24 weeks 
followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) up to Week 52 versus placebo will be also evaluated.  
The proposed study, allowing daily use of INCS and SCS courses and/or surgery as needed or 
other treatments considered standa rd of care will aim at evaluating a potential role for dupilumab 
in the existing treatment paradigm, for the treatment of nasal polyps.  
The clinical study consists of 3 periods: 
• Run-in period where the patients will r eceive MFNS for 4 weeks +/-3 days; 
• Randomized dupilumab/placebo treatment period (52 weeks) where approximately 
360 patients w ill be randomized, 120 p/Arm, to one of the following treatments: 
- Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52, 
- Arm B: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 24, then 300 mg q4w until Week 52, 
- Arm C: placebo matching dupilumab SC  q2w administration until Week 52. 
• Post treatment period - where patients will be followed for 12 weeks to evaluate systemic concentrations of functional dupilumab (PK), immunogenicity and safety after they are off 
the IMP.  
During the whole study duration, patients will conti nue MFNS stable dose started at Visit 1 (V1) 
except if dose is changed due to AE. 
In addition patients may receive rescue medications (including SCS) and/or undergo surgery for 
NP as deemed necessary by the Investigator and patient. Short courses of oral steroids are often 
used as adjunctive therapy to INCS or in cases NP patients who fail standa rd of care with INCS 
(15). Refer to Section  8.2.2 for additional details. 
Overall, this study will evaluate the potential real life benefit that dupilumab may provide for 
patients that failed currently available therapies. 
4.4.1 Endpoints rationale and description 
Clinically, NP is defined by long-term symptoms  of nasal obstruction a nd congestion, reduction in 
or loss of sense of smell, and an terior and posterior rhinorrhea. The presence or absence of polyps 
is confirmed by performing endoscopy. These symptoms can impact greatly patient’s QoL.

EFC14280 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 35 Medical and surgical intervention decisions are ma inly driven by the nasal polyp symptom burden 
and response to standard therapy with topical and SCS. Therefore, in this study, severity of 
symptoms will be scored daily by the patient (0-3). For nasal congestions/obstruction which is a 
major clinical symptom, the monthly average of the daily recorded symptom score will be 
assessed as co-primary endpoint along with the ob jective endoscopic assess ment of NP score.  
Thus, the co-primary endpoints of this study are the change from baseline at Week 24 in: 
• Nasal congestion/obstruction symptom severity score consisting of the monthly average of 
the daily morning ante meridiem (AM) patie nt-assessed symptom severity (using a 0-3 
categorical scale). The NC is assessed by  the patient on a daily basis from V1 and 
throughout the study, using an electronic di ary (e-diary) using a 0-3 categorical scale 
(where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms , 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe 
symptoms). 
• The bilateral endoscopic NPS that ranges from 0-8 points and is the sum of the right and 
left scores (from 0 = no polyps; 1=small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below 
the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3= large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity) ( 17, 18, 24).  
For Japan, in addition to the 2 co-primary endpoints above, the following will also be a  
co-primary endpoint: 
• Change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the Lund 
Mackay (LMK) score at Week 24.  
Key secondary endpoints of the study include: 
• Change from baseline in total symptoms score (TSS): composite severity score consisting of the patient daily AM asse ssed Nasal congestion/obstruction, decreased/loss of sense of 
smell, anterior/posterior  rhinorrhea at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) at Week 24. 
• Change from baseline in the severity of decreased/loss of smell daily assessed by the patient at Week 24.  
• Change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the LMK score 
at Week 24. (Note for Japan: this is considered as primary end point) 
• Change from baseline in 22- item sino-nasal outco me test (SNOT-22) at Week 24.  
• Proportion of patients receiving SCS and/or are planned for surgery of nasal polyps during 
the study treatment. 
• Change from baseline in NC for q2w (Arm A) versus placebo (Arm C) at Week 52. 
• Change from baseline in NPS for q2w (Arm A) versus placebo (Arm C) at Week 52. 
• Change from baseline in NC for q2w/q4w (Arm B) versus placebo (Arm C) at Week 52. 
• Change from baseline in NPS for q2w/q4w (Arm  B) versus placebo (Arm C) at Week 52.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 36 The proposed study design and endpoints will answ er important clinical questions about the 
efficacy on symptoms and objective signs of the disease and the effect of dupilumab on reduction 
of SCS rescue therapy and surgery, which are the most relevant clinical-practice assessments and 
reflecting current standard of care.  
Other efficacy, safety and exploratory assessmen ts in patient reported outcomes (PROs), HRQoL 
and condition specific and general medical questionnair es to evaluate the potential real life benefit 
will be evaluated too.  These treatment approaches and endpoints reflects real-life clinical asse ssment and are in line 
with increasing focus in the medical field on the effects of medical conditions and treatments on 
the QoL of and functioning of patients ( 1).  
4.4.2 Dupilumab dose and regimen rationale  
The dose regimens are selected based on the to tality of clinical evidence in the dupilumab 
program including data from Phase 2 efficacy an d safety study (ACT12340) in patients with nasal 
polyps and symptoms of chronic sinusitis, the result of Phase 2b dose ranging study in patients with moderate to severe asthma (DRI12544), the Phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) and phase 3 studies (R668-AD-1334 and R668-AD-1416) in patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD), as well as the suppor tive PK/pharmacodynamic [PD] analysis.  
While the clinical manifestations may be distinct across NP, asthma and AD indications, Th2 mediated inflammation is implicated in the disease etiology and pathophysiology of all 
3 conditions. Dupilumab has demonstrated marked  concentration dependent inhibition of the 
upstream and downstream Th2 inflammatory bi omarkers including thymus and activation-
regulated chemokine (TARC) and IgE with a very similar PD profile  and exposure-response 
relationship in AD, asthma, a nd NP patients. In asthma dose ranging study (DRI12544), 300 mg 
q2w regimen demonstrated a robust treatment effect across all relevant indices of drug action, 
while less frequent regimens 200 mg q2w and 300mg q4w showed less effect in some endpoints including SNOT-22. Both dose-response and ex posure-response analys es indicated that 
therapeutic responses (eg, improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] at Week 12) and biomarker responses (including fractional exha led nitric oxide and TARC) 
plateaued by 300 mg q2w. Thus, a further increase in dose above 300 mg q2w is unlikely to 
achieve additional c linical benefit. The 300 mg q2w regimen is being currently evaluated as the 
higher dose regimen in the asthma Phase 3 pivotal study.  
In the AD dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021), similar treatment effect between 300 mg qw and 
300 mg q2w was also observed for most of efficacy endpoints (eg, IGA [Immunoglobulin A] and 
EASI [Eczema Area and Severity Index]). Consis tently, results from the Phase 3 efficacy and 
safety studies in AD patients (R668-AD-1334 an d R668-AD-1416) confirmed the highly similar 
clinical efficacy for the 300 mg qw and 300 mg q2w regimens across  all endpoints. 
In the Phase 2 POC study in NP patients with  chronic symptoms of sinusitis (ACT12340), the 
300 mg qw regimen demonstrated a robust, clinic ally and statistically significant treatment 
response on the primary and secondary efficacy e ndpoints for NP and chroni c sinusitis at the end 
of the 16 week treatment period. PK/PD analys is of ACT12340 efficacy endpoints predicted a 
superior therapeutic benefit at both 300 mg q2w  and 300 mg qw regimens, including clinical 
significant reduction in bilateral NPS (>1 point from baseline) and significant improvement in

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 37 symptoms of NC and decrease/loss of smell. The exposure-response analysis of SNOT-22 by 
leveraging both ACT12340 and the dose ranging data from DRI12544 NP pa tients consistently 
supports significant clinical benefits of 300 mg q2w regimen in improving SNOT-22 outcome 
(total score and selected nasa l components of loss of sme ll and nasal bloc kage) and limited 
additional benefit with further increase in dos e beyond 300 mg q2w. Thus, the available efficacy 
data from asthma, AD and NP trials collectively indicate a high potential for achieving an optimal 
treatment effect at 300 mg q2w in NP patients. 
Nasal polyposis is an inflammatory disorder of  upper airways of chronic and recurring nature 
requiring the use of long-term anti-inflammatory treatment to achieve a maintenance state ( 25).  
In the ACT12340 study, a gradual development of  treatment response was observed for bilateral 
NPS and NP symptoms of NC and sense of sme ll. The PD steady-state for the above endpoints 
was not reached at the end of treatment (EOT ) at Week 16, suggesting additional therapeutic 
benefit with longer treatment dur ation. The time-course PK/PD analys is predicts 24 weeks to be 
the optimal treatment duration to assess the maximal symptomatic effect for NPS, NC, and other 
key secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition, a pe rsistent off-treatment effect for dupilumab was 
also observed, where clinically relevant improve ment in the primary a nd secondary endpoints as 
compared to the baseline was sustained at th e end of the 16-week follow-up when dupilumab 
concentration already became undetectable. This  suggested that a dose regimen given less 
frequently might sustain a full treatment response.  Therefore, the current study will assess both 
the long term efficacy of the 300 mg q2w treatment for a 52-week period, as well as the 
maintenance of efficacy at a less frequent 300 mg q4w dosing regimen starting after an initial  
24-week "induction" treatment peri od with 300 mg q2w and continuing until completion of a total 
treatment duration of 52 weeks.  
In the ACT12340, a single loading dose of 600 mg was used on Day 1 to rapidly achieve an 
efficacious concentration range for a potentially earlier onset of significant response. Consistent 
with the observed PK and PD profile of NP response (gradual de velopment of response as well as 
slow offset of response during off-treatment), PK/PD simulation of co-primary endpoints of NPS 
and NC showed minimal difference in the develo pment of treatment effect and steady-state 
response of NPS and NC in the presence and absence of a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1. Therefore, no loading dose is included in the present study. 
In summary, the present clinical evidence from the 3 related Th2 disease populations of CRSwNP, 
AD, and asthma supports selection of 300 mg q2w as the potential efficacious dose regimen to be 
evaluated for benefit risk in the Phase 3 study. 
4.5 OVERALL BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT 
Polyps are generally comprised of eosinophilic inf iltrate and associated with a Th2 orchestrated 
inflammatory state characterized by high IgE, increased Th2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, 
and decreased T-regulatory function.  
Dupilumab prevents IL-4 and IL-13 binding and activation of their respective receptors involved 
in signaling pathways that play key roles in the pathophysiology of NP. A Phase 2a study in 
patients with NP and symptoms of sinusitis, demonstrated efficacy of dupilumab with improvements in endoscopic, ra diographic, and clinical measures of disease as well as

the POC data and the mechanism of action, dupilu mab may provide an effective treatment for 
patients suffering from NP despite maximal treatment with available therapy.  
Overall, 7408 subjects have been enrolled into the dupilumab development program (completed 
and ongoing studies) as of 30 September 2016.  
Based upon the currently available data for dup ilumab and the review of the data by an 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), systemic hypersensitivity has  been identified as 
an important potential risk. Use in patients with helminthic infections is considered missing 
information based on mechanism of action and evidence of the  role of IL-4 in helminth repulsion 
in animal studies published in literature. Othe r theoretical risks based on immune-modulating 
properties of IL-4 are being ma naged conservatively through: 
• Exclusion of patients with immunosuppre ssed status or receiving systemic 
immunosupressants, and/or having active bacterial, viral or para sitic infection, or at high 
risk for developing or reactivating infections. 
• Monitoring of safety data, including periodic blinded safety monitori ng team review and 
unblinded IDMC review. 
The total number of patients exposed to dupiluma b is over 5000.  Data from these patients showed 
that dupilumab is well tolerated and has a favorable safety profile. Th is, together with the efficacy 
demonstrated in ACT12340 study in patients with NP, show a favorable bene fit risk balance, and 
support continued developm ent of dupilumab in NP.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
EFC14280 is a multinational, multicenter, rando mized, double-blind, phase 3 placebo-controlled, 
parallel arm study to evaluate dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP.  All patients will enter a 
run-in period of 4 weeks +/- 3 days receiving MFNS of 2 actuations (50 µg/actuation) in each 
nostril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 400 µg, starting at V1, unless they are unable to 
tolerate or there is a specific regulatory requirement preventing use of this dose in which case, they can stay on a lower dose regimen (200 µg) of MFNS.  
Approximately 360 patients with bilateral NP at multiple cente rs will be randomized 1:1:1 
(120 patients per Arm) into 3 treatment groups as follows:  
•  Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52. 
• Arm B: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 24 then 300 mg q4w until Week 52. 
• Arm C: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52. 
Patients will be included in approximately 130 site s and will be randomized according to asthma 
status (history of asthma or not), pr ior NP surgery (yes or no), and country. 
In order to have adequate number of patients for the subgr oup analysis of patients with 
asthma/NERD, prior surgery, enrollment of the following categories of patients will be limited as 
follows (see rationale Section  4.2): 
• Patients without asthma and/or  NERD history will be limited to 180 patients (out of the 
total 360 randomized patients). 
• Patients without prior surgery will be limited to 180 patients ( out of the total 
360 randomized patients). 
These patients may fall in more than one  category without limitation in numbers. 
During the randomized treatment period, patients w ill continue the stable dose of intranasal 
MFNS stabilized during the run-in period except if dose is changed due to AE. For a schematic study design refer to Section  1.2. 
During the study patients who report deteriora tion requiring medical/surgical intervention may 
come to the site for an endoscopy and clinical evaluation. An unscheduled visit may be used for 
this purpose and if necessary the Investigator may consider one of the treatment alternatives described in Section  8.2.2. If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will 
not be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to 
document the surgery date and outcome (see Section  9.2.1.5). Surgery data will be collected until 
e-CRF closure of the trial.

6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The clinical trial will consist of 3 periods: 
• Run-in period (4 weeks, +/- 3 days):  to determine a patient’s eligibility and for  
run-in/standardization of background IN CS (MFNS) prior to randomization. 
• Randomized dupilumab/placebo treatme nt period (52 weeks +/- 3 days) : to randomize the 
patient into a treatment arm and treat with dupilumab or placebo dose regimen. 
• Post treatment period (12 weeks +/- 3 days):  to continue to collect data for PK, 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy after th e patient has completed the study drug 
treatment period. If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not 
be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned 
surgery to document the surgery date and outcome (see Section  9.2.1.5). Surgery data will 
be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
The total duration of study participation for patients that complete the randomized treatment period and post treatment follow up is approximately 68 weeks. The schedule of the visits is 
described in the specific flow chart in Section  1.2. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The last patient last visit will occur when the la st randomized patient has completed the end of his 
or her 12-week follow-up period or prematurel y discontinues from the study. The end of the 
clinical trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit.  
6.3 FIRST STEP ANALYSIS 
A first step analysis may be performed when a ll patients complete the Week 24 visit, including 
early dropouts. The co-primary endpoints and other 24-week endpoints a nd proportion of patients 
with SCS rescue or surgery for NP (actual or planned) will be analyzed at this first step analysis as 
the final analysis for these endpoints, and 52-week endpoints will not be analyzed at this first step 
analysis. No decision on the conduct of the study w ill be made based on the first step analysis (in 
particular, no decision to prematurely stop the study). 
In both cases, specific steps will be taken to maintain the blind of the study to all individuals 
involved in the conduct of the study and/or anal ysis, and to protect the overall blinding and 
integrity of the study data given the firs t step analysis as further described in  Section 11.5.

6.4.1 Data monitoring committee 
A data monitoring committee (DMC) with members independent from sponsor and Investigators 
is commissioned for the dupilumab clinical development program. This committee is comprised 
of externally-based individuals with expertise in th e diseases under study, biostatistics, or clinical 
research. The DMC will monitor the safety data of patients (serious adverse events [SAE], 
treatment emergent adverse events [TEAE] and/or adverse events of special interest [AESI]) at regular intervals and is responsible for providi ng recommendations for protecting the safety and 
ensuring the welfare of these patients and provide  Sanofi with a ppropriate recommendations in a 
timely manner to ensure the welfare and safety of the study patients. The DMC review is blinded with the ability to be unblinded at DMC request. 
The detailed DMC procedures and safety data to be reviewed are described in the DMC charter. 
In the above capacities, the DMC is advisory to  the Sponsor. The Sponsor is responsible for 
promptly reviewing and for taking into account  in a timely manner the recommendations of the 
DMC in terms of trial continuati on with or without alterations or  of potential trial termination.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.1.1 Dupilumab 
Sterile dupilumab 150 mg/mL will be  provided in pre-filled syri nges (2.25 total volume) to 
deliver 300 mg in 2 mL.  
8.1.2 Placebo for dupilumab 
Sterile placebo for dupilumab will be provided in identically matching pre-filled syringes to 
deliver 2 mL. 
8.1.3 Preparation of investigational medicinal product 
Dupilumab in pre-filled syringes will be dispensed to the patients, if required for home administration. 
8.1.4 Dosing schedule 
Regardless of the treatment arm, all randomized patients will recei ve q2w SC administrations of 
either dupilumab or placebo on D1 (V2). For Arm B, after Week 24, dupilumab administration 
will be alternated by placebo matched injection every other week up to Week 50 (last 
investigational medicina l product [IMP] administration). Every other week IMP administrations 
must be separated by at least 11 days.  
At V2, the Investigator (or delegate) will perfo rm the injection. After V2, every other week 
administration of IMP will be performed at the investigational site up to at least Week 8 (V6). The 
IMP will be administered followi ng clinic procedures and bl ood collection. Patients will be 
monitored at the study site for at least 30 minutes or minimum time required by your local regulator after injections for signs of hypersensitivity reaction.  
From Week 10, every other week home administration of IMP (by patient, caregiver, or health 
care professional) is possible if the patient (o r caregiver) has been trained for 4 injections. 
Training must be documented when completed successfully and training  injections must be 
recorded in the source documents. When IMP is administered at home, the patients must be 
advised by the site staff to self-monitor for pot ential signs and symptoms that may suggest a 
hypersensitivity reaction for at least 30 minutes after administration or minimum time required by 
your local regulator. If the patient (or caregiver) is unable or unwilling to administer IMP, arrangements must be made fo r qualified site personnel and/or  healthcare professionals to 
administer IMP for the doses not scheduled to be given at the study site. If the patient, or caregiver(s) do not develop the comfort to inject  the investigational drug at home, or the 
Investigator determines that patient (or caregiver) injection at home is not  appropriate, injections 
can be performed at the site by way of unscheduled visits.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 49 Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or  the upper arms, so that the same site is not 
injected twice consecutively. Injection in the upper arms could be done only by a trained person 
(caregiver trained by Investigator or Delegate) or health care professi onal but not the patients 
themselves.  
Detailed instructions for transport, storage, prep aration, and administration of IMP are provided to 
the patient. For doses not given at the study site patients will complete a paper dosing diary to 
document compliance with self-injection (or caregiver) of IMP, location of injection, and any symptoms. The diary will be kept as source data in the patient’s study file.  
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.2.1 Intranasal corticosteroid background therapy 
On a daily basis throughout the study, the patient will use an e-diary to record daily use of 
mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) (NASONEX) 50 µ g/actuation nasal spray, suspension 
(refer to the package insert & SmPC for a descri ption, administration details and precautions for 
use). MFNS is provided in a bottle that contains  18 g (140 actuations) of product formulation. The 
sponsor will provide the MFNS to the Investigator sites for dispensing to the patients. If patient is unable to tolerate 200 micrograms twice a day (total dose 400 micrograms) due to experiencing adverse event, patient may reduce dose to 200 micrograms once per day. 
Detailed instructions for transpor t, storage, preparation, and admin istration of NIMP are provided 
to the patient. Patients will complete the e-diary to document compliance. The e-diary will be kept 
as source data in the patient’s study file.  
8.2.1.1 Run-in period 
After V1, once patient eligibility for study entry has been confirmed, all patients will enter a run-in period of 4 weeks where they will receive starting at V1 MFNS:  
• Two actuations (50 µg/actuation) in each nostril BID (total daily dose of 400 µg), unless they are unable to tolerate the BID regime n or this dose is not approved in specific 
countries, in which case, they will follow a once daily (QD) regimen.  
MFNS will be self-administered by the patient, and at each visit the Investigator must ensure that 
the patient has the necessary doses up to the next  visit, knowing that one MFNS device (1 bottle) 
contains sufficient doses for either 2 weeks of bi -daily treatment/regimen or 4 weeks of once daily 
treatment/regimen. 
Patients who receive rescue medica tion including INCS drops or syst emic (oral, intravenous [IV], 
intramuscular [IM]) steroids between V1 and V2 will not be randomized. They can be rescreened 
as described in Section  10.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 50 8.2.1.2 Randomized treatment period 
During the randomized treatment period, all pa tients will continue on the MFNS stable dose 
initiated at V1. If they experience an AE du ring the treatment period, patients can reduce the 
frequency of MFNS administration. 
8.2.1.3 Post treatment period 
Upon completing the randomized tr eatment period (or following early discontinuation of IMP or 
discontinuation from the study), patients can conti nue treatment with the stable dose of MFNS 
maintained over the randomized treatment period until End of Study visit, or modify treatment 
based on medical judgment. 
If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up 
contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date 
and outcome (see  Section 9.2.1.5 ). Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the trial. 
8.2.2 Rescue treatment  
During the study treatment period and off treatment follow-up, based on clinical evaluation, in case of worsening of signs and/or symptoms requi ring medical intervention, the Investigator may 
consider rescue treatment with: 
• Nasal lavage with saline and/or systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks in case of acute infection). 
• Short course OCS (prednisone or  prednisolone up to 2 weeks). 
• Sino-nasal surgery for nasal polyps. Based on previous observations from PoC study, 
8 weeks of IMP treatment is recommended prior to surgery to allow onset of treatment effect. 
Patients receiving rescue treatment other than su rgery during the study should continue on study 
drug unless the Investigator decides to withdraw  the study treatment. Before starting treatment 
with SCS patients should come to the study site for the clinical assessments including endoscopy 
and PROs. 
For patients who undergo or are planned for surg ery for NP the Investigator may decide to 
continue IMP up to the time of surgery or end of treatment whichever date comes first (see 
Section  9.2.1.5 for details). At the time of surgery patients will be permanently discontinued from 
study treatment and assessed as soon as possibl e using the procedures normally planned for the 
end-of-treatment (EOT) Visit as described in Section  10.3.1. 
In any case patients who prematurely discontinued the treatment will be encouraged to return to the study site for the efficacy and safety assessmen ts planned at EOT visit and for additional visits 
as described in Section  10.3.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 51 8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
Dupilumab and placebo will be provided in identically matching 2 mL pre-filled syringes. To 
protect the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL ( dupilumab/placebo) glass pre- filled syringes will be 
prepared such that the treatments (dupilumab and its matching placebo according to its dose) are identical and indistinguishable and will be labeled with a trea tment kit number. The randomized 
treatment kit number list will be generated by Sanofi. Both the patient and Investigator will be blinded to assigned active drug or placebo for the whole study period. In addition, for Arm B after 
Week 24 to prevent differentiation between the regimens, dupilumab administration will be alterned by placebo matched injection ev ery other week. For further details, see Section  8.5, 
Packaging and Labeling. 
Study patients, Investigators, and study site pe rsonnel will not have access to the randomization 
code list except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected adverse drug  reaction unblinding by the Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
If possible, a contact should be initiated with the Monitoring Team before breaking the code. 
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by calling any other 
phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of da y and reason for code breaking. 
Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is made at the site level, not the study 
level. This means that if the Emergency Unblindi ng transaction is performed by the Investigator 
(ie, at the site level), then the patient will be withdrawn from treatment. However, if the 
Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by  the Global Safety Officer (GSO) (ie, at the 
study level, as the GSO is not s ite based), it is not re quired to withdraw the patient from treatment. 
At the facilities where the PK measurements, ADA, and selected biomarkers are determined, the 
samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to unblindi ng of responsible bioanalysts. 
Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. 
The Data Monitoring Committee will receive b linded by treatment group or unblinded (if 
necessary) confidential reports from an independent  statistician for review , which have to be 
handled strictly confidentially. None of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by Sanofi. The IMP 
(dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 52 The Sanofi Clinical Supplies team will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and the 
Study Biostatistician will provide  the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment 
allocation system. This centralized treatment allocation system will generate the patient 
randomization list according to which it will a llocate the treatments to the patients. 
Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms using a 1:1:1 randomization ratio: 
• Arm A: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 52. 
• Arm B: dupilumab 300 mg q2w SC until Week 24 then 300 mg q4w until Week 52. 
• Arm C: placebo matching dupilumab SC q2w administration until Week 52. 
Approximately 360 (120 pa tients/ Arm) patients shall be randomized. Ra ndomization will be 
stratified based on asthma status (history of asthma or not), prior NP surgery (yes or no), and 
country.  
In order to have adequate number of patients for the subgr oup analysis of patients with 
asthma/NERD, and prior surgery, enrollment of the following categories of patients will be 
limited as follows (see rationale Section  4.2): 
• Patients without asthma and/or  NERD history will be limited to 180 patients (out of the 
total 360 randomized patients). 
• Patients without prior surgery will be limited to 180 patients ( out of the total 
360 randomized patients). 
These patients may fall in more than one  category without limitation in numbers. 
At randomization, IVRS will allocate to a patient  a treatment number for dupilumab or placebo. A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. 
Patients who meet exclusion criteria may be re-screened and a different patient identification will 
be issued. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen-failure date and the re-screening date. The IVRS/IWRS report will flag re-screened patients. Patients that are re-screened must sign a new consent form and all V1 procedur es must be repeated. The Investigator obtains 
treatment kit numbers at rando mization and subseque nt scheduled visits via the IVRS/IWRS 
which will be available 24 hours a day. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
From randomization (V2) up to Week 6 (V5), dup ilumab 300 mg or placebo will be supplied as 
one glass pre-filled syringe packed in one pa tient kit box. From Week 8 (V6) on, dupilumab 
300 mg or placebo will be supplied as 2-glass pre- filled syringes packed in one patient kit box 
with individual cavities with number and arrow on the top of each cavity so that the order of 
dispensing for syringes is clear. The kits fo r Arm A (300 mg q2w admin istration) will contain 
only dupilumab 300 mg syringes and the kits for Arm C (placebo q2w administration) will 
contain only placebo syringes. Kits for Arm B (3 00 mg q2w/q4W administration) dispensed at 
Weeks 8 and 16 will contain 2 dupilumab 300 mg sy ringes and the kits dispensed at Weeks 24,

Investigators to inform the patients regarding the mandatory storage requirements for the IMP. No 
temperature monitoring will be performed at the patients’ homes. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES  
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator suppl y IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-

• The Investigator (or designee) tracks treatment accountability/compliance by diary, and by 
counting the number of used and unused treatme nt kits and syringes and completes the 
appropriate page of the patient treatment log.  
• The monitor in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the IMP and NIMP administration page by comparing them with the IMP and NIMP that have been retrieved 
and the patient treatment log forms. Reconciliation will occur with paper and electronic diary as appropriate depending on study visit/period. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Whenever possible all partially used, used or unused IMP and NIMP provided by the Sponsor will 
be destroyed on site according to the standard practices of the site. A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP and NIMP supplied by the Sponsor w ill be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by th e Investigator and the monitoring team. The Investigator will 
not destroy any IMP and NIMP supplied by the Sponsor unless the S ponsor provides written 
authorization. When destruction at  site cannot be performed, all IMP, and NIMP supplied by the 
Sponsor will be retrieved by the Sponsor. A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP and NIMP 
supplied by the Sponsor will be established w ith the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and 
countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 56 CYP substrates  
The impact of dupilumab on CYP enzymes activity has not been studied and the effect on 
dupilumab on the levels of IL4 and IL13 cy tokines has not been fully characterized. 
However, literature data of studies in human hepatocytes indicate that the IL-4 was able to upregulate CYP450 2E1, 2B6, 3A4 mRNA expr ession or down regulate CYP1A2 mRNA  
(26, 27). Another study in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM C) incubated with 
various Th2 cytokines, reports that Th2 cytokine s IL-4 and IL-13 generally increased the protein 
expression of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 ( 28). 
A drug-drug interaction study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected CYP450 substrates in adu lt patients with moderate to severe AD was 
completed recently.  The data indicated no clini cally meaningful effect of dupilumab on CYP1A2, 
CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 activity. 
During the study and at least up to the end of follow-up, caution should be used for drugs with 
narrow therapeutic index that are me tabolized via these CYP450 isoforms. 
This means that unless the drug is prohibited in the study Section  8.8.1, close clinical observation 
and/or laboratory monitoring as a pplicable are required in order to enable early detection of toxic 
manifestations or lack of activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or their withdrawal if needed.

Investigators must make best efforts to prevent missing data, in order that  a high level of quality 
can be achieved for the study. 
9.1 CO-PRIMARY ENDPOINTS 
There are 2 co-primary endpoints for this study for countries other than Japan:  
1. Change from baseline in the nasal congestion/obstruction at Week 24:  The NC is 
assessed by the patient on a daily basis from V1  and throughout the study, using an e-diary 
using a 0-3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate 
symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms) ( 2):  
Nasal congestion/obstruction will be scored as a reflective score (evaluation of symptom severity 
over the past 24 hours) by the patient: 
 
Scale Symptoms 
0 No symptoms 
1 Mild symptoms (symptoms clearly present, but minimal awareness and easily tolerated) 
2 Moderate symptoms (definite awareness of symptoms that is bothersome but tolerable) 
3 Severe symptoms (symptoms that are hard to tolerate, cause interference with activities 
or daily living) 
 
The e-diary is dispensed at V1 and informa tion is downloaded from this device on the other 
indicated days.  
A severity ≥2 on V1 and a weekly average severity grea ter than 1 at time of randomization (V2) is 
required and will be provided to the site to determine patient eligibility. If there are 4 or more 
measurements collected within 7 days prior to randomization, the baseline will be the average of 
these measurements; if less than 4 measurements are collected, the baseline will be the average of 
the most recent 4 prior to randomization. 
For the baseline to EOT analysis, 4 weeks average of the symptom scores will be used. 
2. Change from baseline in  the NPS at Week 24:  The NPS ( 17, 18, 24) is assessed by 
central video recordings of nasal endoscopy . The score (NPS) is the sum of the right

Polyp Score Polyp Size 
0 No polyps 
1 Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching bel ow the inferior border of the middle turbinate 
2 Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate  
3 Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate 
4 Large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity 
 
Nasal endoscopy should be performed at the end of  the scheduled visits before the administration 
of IMP and preceded by local administration of anesthetic drugs in combination with a 
decongestant. 
Standard video sequences will be downloaded or sent to centralized reader. Centralized imaging 
data assessments and scoring by independent physician reviewer(s) for the imaging data will be performed for all endoscopies. To confirm eligib ility at V2, only the V1 central reading will be 
made available to the site. In addition at V2 the investigator will perform the NE to confirm eligibility score and enter the result in the e-CRF. Thus the patient is considered eligible based on a V1 central reading followed by a V2 local reading NPS score of 5 or more and at least 2 each side. The final results of central reading from Visit 2 onward will be made available after the study. 
For the analysis of primary endpoint, central reading of V2 will be used for comparison with 
Week 24 reading. The sites will remove patient-identifying information from the imaging data header prior to sending the imaging data to the central reader. 
Further details on nasal endoscopy  will be available in a separa te operational ma nual provided to 
the sites. 
3. Lund-Mackay score 
For Japan, in addition to the two co-primary endpoints above, the following will also be a co-
primary endpoint: 
The LMK system is based on localization with  points given for degree of opacification:  
0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total op acification. These points are then applied to the 
maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinus on each side. The OC is 
graded as 0 = not occluded, or 2 = occluded de riving a maximum score of 12 per side. This 
scoring system has been validated in several studies ( 29, 30, 31). 
For patients in whom the OC is missing (because  of a previous surgery) the reader should 
consider the location of the former OC and provide a scoring (as if the OC was there).

9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Key secondary efficacy endpoints  
For the analysis of key secondary endpoints see Section  11.4.2.2. 
9.2.1.1 Disease specific daily symptom assessment and total symptom score (TSS) 
On a daily basis from V1 and throughout the study, the patient will use an e-diary to: 
• Respond to the morning individual rhinosinusitis symptom questions using a 0 to 
3 categorical scale (where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms) ( 3):  
- Congestion and/or obstruction. 
- Loss of sense of smell. 
- Anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose). 
- Posterior rhinorrhea (postnasal drip). 
The TSS is a composite score (ranging between 0 and 9) consisting of the sum of the following 
symptoms assessed daily in the morning: nasal congestion/obstruc tion, decreased/loss of sense of 
smell, rhinorrhea (average of ante rior/posterior nasal discharge). 
9.2.1.2 Smell test: University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)  
The UPSIT (UPSIT 40 odorant test) is a rapid and easy-to-administer method to quantitatively 
assess human olfactory function. The UPSIT show s a high test-retest reliability (r: 0.981) and 
scores on this test are strongly correlated with th e detection threshold for phenyl ethyl alcohol in 
the same individuals. When the UPSIT is administered in the standardized manner, clinical 
subjects show a high degree of uniformity in UPSIT performance when tested in different 
laboratories. 
The test will be dispensed to the patient by the study site personnel and consists of 4 booklets, 
each containing 10 odorants with one odorant per page. The test-time is about 15 min. The stimuli

page. Above each odorant strip is a multiple-choice question with four alternative words to describe the odor. The subject is asked to releas e the odorant by rubbing the brown-strip with the 
tip of a pencil and to indicate which of four wo rds best describes the odor. Thus each subject 
receives a score out of 40 possible correct answers. The final score will be recorded in the e-CRF. The odorants of the UPSIT test utilized in this study will take into account cultural differences. 
The 40-odorant UPSIT is used in over 1500 clinics and laboratories throughout the United States, 
Canada, South America, and Eur ope, and has been administered to  nearly 200 000 people since its 
development in the early 1980s. A particular strength  of this test is that it provides an olfactory 
diagnosis based on comparing the patient's test score with normative data, providing a percentile score of an individual relative to his or her age-matched normal group. Fu rthermore, a clinician 
can distinguish patients with a normal sense of smell ("normosmia ") from those with different 
levels of reduction ("mild, moderate, and severe micros mia") or loss ("anosmia") ( 32). 
9.2.1.3 Decreased/loss of sense of smell 
The decreased/loss of sense of smell severity is assessed by the patient on a daily basis from V1 
and throughout the study, using an e-diary to  using a 0-3 categorical scale (where 0 = no 
symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms).

Lund-Mackay score is a secondary efficacy endpoint in countries other than Japan. Details of this 
endpoint are presented in Section  9.1.  
9.2.1.5 Proportion of patients during the tr eatment period who receive SCS rescue or are 
planned to undergo surgery for NP 
SCS rescue  
Oral steroids for rescue treatment of nasal polyps or for another reason will be prescribed to the patient by the site depending on local legislation/regulation. PROs and a nasal endoscopy should be performed before starting treatment with SCS.  The Investigator (or designee) records the date 
and dosing information (daily dose, duration, INN) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF. Indication for SCS use will be also captured by selecting one or more of the following categories:  
1. Nasal polyposis. 
2. Asthma. 
3. Other respiratory disease (specify).  
4. Other ear, nose or thro at disease (specify).

For patients who undergo or are planned for sino-nasal surgery for NP, the reason (worsening 
signs and/or symptoms during the study), the ex pected and real surgery date, the type and 
outcome of surgery will be recorded in a specific CRF page. If surgery  
• Is performed during the study treatment peri od, patient and Investigator may decide to 
continue IMP up to the time of surgery or EOT whichever date comes first. At the time of surgery patients will be permanently discontinued from study treatment and assessed as 
soon as possible using the procedures norma lly planned for the EOT Visit and will be 
instructed to return to the study site as described in Section  10.3.1. An AE or serious 
adverse event (SAE) page will be completed.  
• Is performed during the follow-up the patients will be assessed according to the 
procedures normally planned for the EOS Visit and will be instructed to return to the study site as described in Section  10.1.15. An AE or SAE page will be completed.  
• If surgery is scheduled after the planned end of study, EOS visit will not be delayed. A follow up contact(s) should be performed ar ound the time of planned surgery to document 
the surgery date and outcome. Surgery data will be collected until e-CRF closure of the 
trial. 
9.2.1.6 22-Item sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) 
The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire to a ssess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on 
HRQoL (Appendix B ). The SNOT-22 has 22 items on a 5-cate gory scale applicable to sino-nasal 
conditions and surgical treatments. The rang e of the global score is 0-110 and a minimal 
important difference (MID), the smallest difference between clinical trial arms mean change from 
baseline (point estimates) that will be interpreted as important of 8.9 ( 33). Lower scores indicate 
less impact and the recall period is past 2 weeks. There are 5 domains that can be described within SNOT-22, including nasal, ear, sleep, ge neral and practical, and emotional.  
9.2.2 Other secondary endpoints  
For the assessment of other secondary endpoint s see analyses of efficacy endpoints,

9.2.2.1 SCS dose and number of courses 
Total SCS rescue dose prescribed (in mg/year) during the study period and total SCS rescue 
intake in days and courses during the study peri od could be derived based on SCS dose prescribed 
and intake days of SCS during the study, recorded in eCRF pages. 
A course of SCS is considered continuous if treatment is separa ted by less than 7 days. Various 
doses of systemic corticoste roids will be converted to prednisone-equivalent OCS.

The visual analogue scale (VAS) for rhinosinusitis is used to evaluate the total severity ( 2). 
Rhinosinusitis disease can be divided into  MILD, MODERATE and SEVERE based on total 
severity VAS score (0 to 10 cm): 
• MILD = VAS 0 to 3.  
• MODERATE = VAS >3 to 7.  
• SEVERE = VAS >7 to 10.  
• The patient is asked to indicate on a VAS the answer to the question below:  
“How troublesome are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis” 
The VAS ranks from 0 (Not troublesome) to 10 (Worst thinkable troublesome) (Appendix D ). 
9.2.2.3 Nasal peak inspiratory flow 
Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) evaluation represents a physiologic measure of the air flow 
through both nasal cavities during forced inspiration expressed in liters per minute. The NPIF is the best validated technique for the evaluation of  nasal flow through the nose. Nasal inspiration 
correlates most with the subjective feeling of obs truction and is the best validated technique for 
monitoring nasal flow in clinical trials. 
On V1 patients will be issued an NPIF meter for recording morning (AM) NPIF. Patients will be 
instructed on the use of the device, and written instructions on the use of the NPIF meter will be provided to the patients. In additi on, the Investigator will instruct the patients on how to record the 
following variables in the e-diary on a daily basis. 
• AM NPIF performed within 15 minutes afte r arising (before 12 noon) prior to taking 
MFNS.  
Three NPIF efforts will be performed by the patient; all 3 values will be recorded by the patient in the e-diary, and the highest value will be us ed for evaluation. The procedure takes about 
5 minutes. 
Baseline AM NPIF will be the mean AM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to the first 
dose of IMP. If less than 4 measurements are collected during the 7 days, the average of the most recent 4 prior to randomization during the r un-in period will serve as the baseline.  
The NPIF will be performed daily from V1 to Week 24 (V8). After V8 the NPIF will be performed every 4 weeks. 
The nasal flow is expressed in liter per minute, and consecutive measurements are performed. 
Taking the best of 3 outcomes with less than 10% variation is consid ered to be the best means of 
expression of the result ( 32).

comorbid with asthma 
The asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) was designed to measure both the adequacy of 
asthma control and change in asthma control whic h occurs either spontaneously or as a result of 
treatment. Only patients with co-m orbid asthma will be asked to complete the questionnaire in the 
e-diary during clinic visits. Patients should comple te the questionnaire before the spirometry test. 
The asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) ha s 6 questions which assess the most common 
asthma symptoms: 
• Frequency in past week awoken by asthma during the night. 
• Severity of asthma symptoms in the morning.  
• Limitation of daily activities due to asthma.  
• Shortness of breath due to asthma. 
• Frequency of wheezing, and 
• Short-acting bronchodilator use.  
Patients are asked to recall how th eir asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to 
the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment)  
(see Appendix E ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-6 score is the mean 
of the 6 questions and, therefore, between 0 (t otally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). 
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Pa tients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately 
controlled asthma and patients w ith scores above 1.0 reflect inad equately controlled asthma. On 
the 7-point scale of the ACQ-6, a change or differ ence in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that 
can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the Minimal Clinically Important 
Difference (MCID) defined by the developer. 
Measurement properties such as reliability, ability to detect change have been documented in the

Physical examinations will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, eyes, 
ear/nose/throat, heart, chest,  abdomen, reflexes, lymph nodes, spine, and extremities. All 
deviations from normal will be recorded, including those attributable to the patient’s disease. 
9.4.6 Electrocardiogram variables 
A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the sites at the time points noted in the Study Flowchart ( Section  1.2) to monitor any potential abnormality. In case of an 
abnormal ECG finding, the Investigator should enter details into the e-CRF. At V2, the 
Investigator should use their medical judgment to consider whether the patient is eligible for the 
study. 
9.5 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.5.1 Functional dupilumab concentration and anti-drug antibodies in serum 
9.5.1.1 Sampling time  
Predose blood samples will be collected for determination of functional dupilumab 
(pharmacokinetics, or PK) in se rum and anti-dupilumab antibodies at timepoints designated in the 
study flow chart (see Section  1.2). The date of collection should be  recorded in the patient e-CRF. 
The date and time also will be collected on the central laboratory requisition form and entered into 
the database through data transfers from the central laboratory. 
In the event of any SAE or any AESI of anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that 
are related to IMP and require tr eatment, or severe injection site  reaction lasting longer than  
24 hours, samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any additional analysis if required or for archival purposes. An unscheduled systemic drug  concentration page in 
the e-CRF must be completed as well. 
Patients who are ADA positive at their last study visit (early termination or planned end of study 
[EOS]), may be asked to return to the clinic  to have additional ADA samples collected for 
analysis based on the overall clinical pr esentation at the time of discontinuation.  
9.5.1.2 Handling procedures 
Special procedures for collecti on, storage, and shipping of se rum are described in separate

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 68 9.5.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Several biomarkers related to CRSwNP and Th2 polarization will be assessed for their value in 
predicting therapeutic response and/or in docum enting the time course of drug response.  
Patients, Investigators and site personnel will not have access to as say results for total IgE, TARC, 
periostin, and eotaxin-3 while the study is ongoing, as the related data are not essential for patient 
care and have the potential for unb linding the study treatments.  
Sample collection will be performed as per the study flow chart ( Section  1.2) and assay 
methodologies are briefly summarized below. In ge neral, duplicate aliquots of each sample for 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers should be stored to assure generation of a complete set of assay 
results. More detailed information on the collec tion, handling, transport and preservation of 
samples (eg, minimum volumes required for blood collection and for aliquot s for each biomarker 
assay) will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. 
9.5.2.1 Serum biomarkers 
Total IgE will be measured using quantitative me thods (eg, ImmunoCAP® FEIA), approved for 
diagnostic testing.  
Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine will be assayed with a validated enzyme 
immunoassay (eg, Human TARC Quantikine ELISA kit; R&D Systems). 
Concentrations of periostin will be assayed with a validated immunoassay. 
9.5.2.2 Plasma biomarkers 
Eotaxin-3 will be measured in heparinized plasma with a validated enzyme immunoassay. 
9.5.2.3 Urine biomarkers 
Leukotriene E4 and a metabolite of prostaglandin D2 (PGDM) will be measured in morning spot 
urine samples using validated quantitative assays. Assay results will be reported per mg of creatinine.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 70 9.6 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES  
Not all of the samples collected during this study may be required for the tests planned in this 
clinical trial. For patients who ha ve consented to it, the samples th at are archived, unused or left 
over after planned testing may be used for additi onal research purposes  
 For patients who have c onsented to it, archival 
blood samples will be collected at the visit specified  in the study flow chart, 10 mL each, will be 
collected into a dry, red topped tube with clottin g activator (or into smaller tubes of equivalent 
total volume) kept at room temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at approximately 
1500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The se rum will then be transferred, in equal portions, 
into 3 storage tubes, which will be immediately capped and frozen in an upright position at -20°C or colder. 
These archived serum samples, and any residual or leftover serum, plasma or blood remaining 
from planned laboratory work, may be used for re search purposes related to airway disease, 
response to dupilumab treatment, additional drug safety asse ssments or development and 
validation of bioassay methods beyond t hose defined in the present protocol. 
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers as the ones used during the study (ie, Subject ID, Sample ID). They will be transferred to a Sanofi site (or a subcontractor site) which can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting patient confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 
and Section  14.5). 
9.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
Refer to Section  4.4.1 for rationale on the co-primary endpoints. The proposed study design and 
endpoints will answer important c linical questions about the efficacy on symptoms and objective 
signs of the disease and the effect of dupilumab on reduction of SCS rescue  therapy and surgery, 
which are the most relevant clinical practice asse ssments and reflect curren t standard of care.

Medical history should be recorded consistent with Good Clinical and local practice.  This would 
typically include atopic medical history (including asthma history, hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs, NERD, allergy/atopy history), history of surgeries, concomitant medications, etc. 
10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE  
This section describes how the visits are carried out, in chronological order (according to the flow chart Section  1.2 and identical to the order shown in the e-CRF): 
The clinical trial consists of three periods , using an add-on therapy approach to INCS: 
• Run-in Period (28 days+/- 3 days; V1).  
• Randomized treatment period (up to 52 weeks +/- 3 days; Visits 2-10).  
• Post-treatment Period (12 weeks; +/- 3 days V11).  
The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection), as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to within the ± 3 day visit window. 
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from treatment, every attempt should be made for the 
patient to return to the study site as soon as po ssible after last IMP administration to perform all 
assessments planned at the EOT visit and patients will be asked and encouraged to return to the 
study site for the visit scheduled as described in Section  10.3.1 (early discontinuation) for a  
12-week follow up.  
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form  
 must be signed and dated (see Section  12.2). At 
selected sites, requirements for collection of samples for a nasal biomarkers substudy will be 
included in a separate written informed consent. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of a single visit 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perfo rmed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as 
long as the run-in period window prior to Day 1 (V2) is respected. These patients do not need to 
sign a new consent form and be allocated a new patient number within this same window.  
Rescreening 
Patients that fail screening between V1 and V2 may be rescreened for study eligibility only once 
for the following criteria: 
• They do not meet the inclusion criteria for a weekly average NC >1 at V2  
(electronic  
  
1.0)

AMENDED CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL NO. 01  17-May-2017 
EFC14280 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 • They had an acute illness such as acute sinusitis, nasal infection or upper respiratory 
infection (E07). These patients can be resc reened only after complete resolution of 
symptoms 
• They took one of the proh ibited treatments listed in Section  8.8.1 between V1 and V2.  
Patients that are re-screened must sign a new cons ent form and all of the V1 procedures must be 
repeated (refer to Section  8.4 for further instructions related to re-screening) unless a prior 
assessment is performed within the time frame permitted prior to study entry or the V1 baseline CT scan of sinuses and spot urine for biomarker sampling were performed. Patients with positive test for HIV or hepatitis will not be allowed for rescreening. 
Note, no waivers will be approved for randomization; all patients must fulf il all eligibility criteria 
before randomization into the study. If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility criteria, these laboratory assessments 
may be repeated, at the discretion of the investigat or, if it is judged to be likely to return to 
acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window. 
For patients who do not fulfil other exclusion crite ria, rescreening should be discussed with the 
Sponsor. In all cases, a given patient can only be re-screened only once. 
Order of assessments 
During the treatment and post tr eatment period, if necessary, it is possible to perform the study 
procedures within a 3 day period as long as these days are within the scheduled visit window and 
the order of procedur es is maintained. 
It is recommended that assessments/procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order if applicable: 
1. Patient-reported outcomes a nd other questionnaires: 
- Daily symptoms of NC, loss of smell a nd anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, 
- SNOT-22, 
- VAS Rhinosinusitis,  
- Reduced sense of taste sy mptom severity score, 
- QoL (EQ-5D), 
- ACQ-6 (in patients with asthma),  
- Other questionnaires. 
2. Procedures. 
3. Safety and laboratory assessments. 
4. IMP administration. 
NIMP boxes should be collected at all visits  following provision during all study periods.

10.1.1 Visit 1 (Week -4/Day -28 ±3 days): Run-in period 
Following a discussion of participation in the clinical trial, signed informed consent must be 
obtained and documented. 
The following procedures will then be performed: 
• Call IVRS/IWRS to assign pa tient number, register V1, and obtain first NIMP 
(NASONEX) box(es).  
• Interview to collect patient demographic information, NP information, other  medical 
history (including asthma history, hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs, NERD, 
allergy/atopy history, surgical hist ory (including number, type and dates  of previous 
surgery for nasal polyps in the past), and prior and concomitant medications (including  
background therapy for NP and asthma), courses of SCS in the previous 2 years (number of 
SCS courses, route of administration doses and duration in the previous 2 years will be entered in the e-CRF), long term antibiotics use [>2 weeks] in the previous year will be also entered in the e-CRF); inform if patient is considered eligible for nasal polyp surgery at study entry. 
• Review entry criteria to assess eligibility, with special attention to verify and document the following:  
- Use of SCS for NP within 2 years prior to V1; and/or contraindication/intolerance to 
SCS; and or prior surgery for NP (whenever in the past), 
- Nasal polyps score of 5 or greater (and at least 2 in each side), 
- Presence of nasal congestion (blockade/obstruction) severity ≥2 on V1 and loss or 
reduction of smell and/or rhinorrhea/nasal di scharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip),  
- Patients have not received any of the prohibited medications described in E 03 and/or 
Section  8.8.1.  
• Measure vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate , body temperature,  weight, 
height. 
• Perform physical examination. 
• Perform CT scan (within the time period between V1 and V2, prior to first administration 
of IMP). In countries for which a specific ap proval procedure for the CT scan is required 
by a different committee than the local EC/IRB, patients may be enrolled using a CT available in the previous year or perform an MRI of the sinuses between V1 and V2. 
• Perform urine sampling for biomarkers and creatinine. 
• Perform spirometry within the time period between V1 and V2, for all patients and ensure  
that patients with co-morbid asthma have FEV1>50%. Spirometry will be performed after the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol has been withheld for at least 6 hours.

• Obtain blood samples for he patitis screen (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, HCVAb, HIV screen 
(Anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). In case of results 
showing HBsAg (negative), and HBcAb total or HBcAb IgM (positive), an HBV DNA 
testing may be performed prior to randomization to rule out a false positivity if the 
Investigator believes the patient is a false positive, or to clarify the serological status if the Investigator finds it unclear to interpret in  absence of known HBV infection. In case of 
results showing HCV Ab (positive), an HCV RNA testing may be performed to rule out a false positivity, if the Investigator believes the patient is a false positive.  
- Note: Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is positive ( ≥1:160 titer). 
• Obtain serum β-HCG pregnancy test if WOCBP. 
• Perform chest X-ray if no chest imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) available within the previous 
year as per local standard of care or if there is local requirement.  
- Note for Japan: According to the request from the health authority, chest X-ray should 
be performed at V1 if there is no chest imaging (Chest X-ray, CT, MRI) available 
within 3 months prior to V1 to exclude patients with suspected active or untreated 
latent tuberculosis. 
• Perform nasal endoscopy a nd send to Central Reader. 
• Dispense e-diary/NPIF meter, provide instructions for daily use, and remind  patient to

Source data is all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are cont ained in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hos pital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. 
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central laboratories, endoscopy, CT scan, NPIF 
measurement, and patient diary will be considered source data. HCRU will be collected directly in 
the e-CRF. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
Patients who discontinue treatment permanently during the treatment period will be assessed as 
soon as possible using all procedures normally planned for the End-of-treatment Visit with the exception of CT Scan. Patients who discontinue early during the post-treatment period will be assessed as soon as possible using all procedures  normally planned for the end-of-study (EOS) 
Visit. 
For patients in whom the surgery date is schedul ed after the planned end of study, a follow up 
contact(s) should be performed around the time of planned surgery to document the surgery date. 
Surgery data will be collected only until e-CRF Closure and EOS will not be delayed. 
Patients will also be instructed to: 
• Return to the study site for ev aluations of NPS, SNOT-22, at: 
- Week 24, Week 52: If the ETD visit occurred between Week 0-Week 16, 
- Week 52: If the ETD visit occurred between >Week 16-Week 40, 
- Week 64 (EOS): If the ETD visit occurred between >Week 40-Week 52. 
• Return and have a CT Scan perform ed as scheduled at Week 24 and 52.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 90 Patients who discontinue prior to week 40 will have the following assessed through week 52, 
patients who discontinue after week 40 will have the following assessed through week 64: 
• Perform PK and ADA sampling at the initially scheduled visits for these assessments 
• Continue to complete the e-diary for nasa l congestion, loss of smell daily symptom and 
anterior/posterior rhinorrhea evaluation 
• Continue on MFNS stable dose but patients ar e not required to complete the INCS use 
daily in the e-diary after ETD. 
• Advise patients with comorbid atopic conditi ons (such as asthma) not to adjust their 
treatment without consultation with their physicians. 
• Report any AE up to the last scheduled vi sit (Week 52 or Week 64 depending on the 
discontinuation date). 
• Contact the Investigator during the post treatment period up to the EOS visit if the 
symptoms worsen requiring medical attention. 
- The Investigator will record in the corresponding e-CRF pages rescue medication 
prescribed or surgical interventions during the planned study treatment period. Use of 
oral steroids for rescue treatment of wors ening nasal polyps or for another reason will 
be captured by the Investigator (or design ee) on the appropriate page(s) of the e-CRF 
page and the date and dosing information (d aily dose, duration, INN) will be informed. 
Details on planned date for surgery, type, and outcome (whenever possible) of surgery 
will be recorded in a specific e-CRF page. If surgery is performed during the study treatment period or follow-up an AE or SAE page will be completed. 
For patients undergoing surgery for NP, refer to Section  9.2.1.5 for details. 
10.3.2 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of AEs. Re-
initiation of treatment with the IMP will be made under close a nd appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with IMP.  
In addition, any of the following conditions  will be a cause for temporary treatment 
discontinuation: 
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the infection is resolved 
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix G.  
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF. If the IMP is  interrupted for more than 2 doses, then the 
patient should permanently disc ontinue the study treatment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 91 10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients must be withdrawn from the study (ie, fro m any further IMP or study procedure) for the 
following reasons: 
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuati on in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being. 
In case of surgery for NP (refer to Section  9.2.1.5for details).  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a critical protocol deviation, at the request of the Investigator or the 
Sponsor. 
• Any code broken requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
• In the event of an anaphylactic systemic allergic reaction that is related to IMP and that requires treatment. 
• In the event that the patient is diagnosed w ith a malignancy during the study, excluding 
carcinoma in situ of the cervix  or squamous or basal cell. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculos is or other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunocom promised status (refer to Appendix I ). 
• Serum ALT >3 ULN and total bilirubin >2ULN. 
• Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT <2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline ALT >2 ULN.  
Stopping rules described in Appendix G  should be applied. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to  recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whicheve r comes last.  
If possible, and after the permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients will be assessed using the procedure normally planned for the last dosing day with the IMP (EOT Visit). (Refer to 
Section  10.1.14 Visit 10 (Week 52): End of treatment).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 92 Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected for analysis ba sed on the overall clinical presentation at the 
time of discontinuation. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for and participate in follow-up assessments described in ( Section  10.3.1). 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of  consent for treatment should be distinguished 
from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient 
contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. Patien ts requesting withdrawal should be informed 
that withdrawal of consent for follow-up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the procedures nor mally planned at the end-of-
treatment visit. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the I nvestigator in the appropriate screens of the  
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, 
at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unle ss the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the 
Investigator should make the best effort to recontact the patient (eg, contact patient’s family or 
private physician, review available registries or health care databases), a nd to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital st atus. Attempts to contact  such patients must be 
documented in the patient’s records (eg, times an d dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt 
for sending a registered letter). A patient should only be designated as lost to follow-up if the site 
is unable to establish contact with the patient after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods 
(phone, text, e-mail, certi fied letter, etc).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints will be considered.  
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.

EFC14280 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 93 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or. 
• Is life-threatening, or. 
• Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medicall y important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm,  
- Anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix H for Definition of Anaphylaxis), 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
• Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse. 
• ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN. 
• Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality. 
• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling).  
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions. 
• Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study. 
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 94 10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added or removed dur ing a study by protocol amendment. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described Section  10.4.4, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion.  
AESIs for this study include: 
• Anaphylactic or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and that require 
treatment (refer to Appendix H for the definition of anaphylaxis).  
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours. 
• Any infection meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: 
- Any serious infection (SAE), 
- Requires parenteral (IV, IM, SC) antimicrobial therapy,  
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks, 
- Is a parasitic infection,  
- Is an opportunistic infection (refer to Appendix I ). 
Note: Antimicrobial therapy refers to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents. 
• Significant elevation of ALT. 
- ALT >5 × ULN in patients with baseline ALT < 2 × ULN;  
or 
- ALT >8 × ULN if baseline ALT >2 × ULN 
• Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner 
of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills 
1 of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a male participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined.  
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by 
the Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic 
syringes or pills count) and defined as at least twice the intended dose during an 
interval of less than 11 days. The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE 
forms. 
Of note, asymptomatic overdose has to  be reported as a standard AE.

authorities 
Not applicable for this study. 
10.4.3 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the signature of 
the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF.  
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, 
corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by 
the study procedure(s). 
The Investigator should take appropriate measures  to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, 
or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that a dditional investigations may be 
requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end 
of the study as defined in Section  10.3.1.  
Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
• Symptomatic and/or,  
• Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or,  
• Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or,  
• Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or, 
• Defined as an AESI. 
See Section  10.4.6 for a table summarizing reporting timelines. 
10.4.4 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designee must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay.  
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the  
dates on which these examinations were performed, to the representative of the monitoring  
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol.  Care 
should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 98 10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypersensitivity  
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic mAB 
treatments. 
Allergic reactions may be define d as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms experienced 
by patients during or shortly after the pharmacolo gic or biologic agent is given. These reactions 
may present in a variety of ways, including di zziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, hypotension, 
tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticaria/angioedema,  flushing, nausea, or vomiting, and joint pain 
with fever. Allergic reactions may begin w ithin a few hours and persist up to 24 hours post 
dosing. Refer to Appendix H “Definition of Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical criteria for 
the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Patients should be monitored for at least 30 mi nutes (or minimum time required by your local 
regulator) after each study-site administered IMP administration for any signs or symptoms of a 
hypersensitivity reaction. Any instance of allerg ic reaction should be reported as an AESI. Any 
anaphylactic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate treatment will be an AESI with immediate reporting (within 24 hours) a nd study medication must be permanently 
discontinued. Trained personnel and medications should be available to treat anaphylaxis or any 
severe allergic reaction if it occurs. Furthermore, the study patients will be advised, when the IMP is administered at home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitivity reaction for at l east 30 minutes after administration. 
Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment must be reported as an adverse event of specia l interest (AESI) (within 24 hours, for further 
details, see AESI definition in Section  10.4.1.3 and Appendix H ) and study medication must be 
permanently discontinued. ADA and PK samples will be collected near the onset and completion 
resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis 
10.6.2 Severe injection site reactions 
Based on the SC mode of administr ation of high doses of protei n and on a higher incidence of 
local injection site reactions observed at the highest dose level (300 mg weekly) in dupilumab 
studies, severe injection site re actions, are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience 
an injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection 
site reaction with a future injection. Any severe  injection reaction that lasts over 24 hours will be 
reported as an AESI with immediate notification. ADA and PK sample s will be collected near the 
onset and completion resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis. 
Prophylactic treatment/premedication for an injection site reaction is not permitted. 
10.6.3 Infections, including opportunistic and parasitic infections 
Some immuno-modulating biologics have been associ ated with an increased risk of infection, 
including opportunistic infection. Though dup ilumab has not been shown to increase the 
frequency of severe or serious inf ections in general, as a precautionary measure, the Investigator

AMENDED CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL NO. 01  17-May-2017 
EFC14280 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 99 is required to carefully monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection such as, but not limited to, 
increased body temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, or serious febrile systemic illness. 
Since dupilumab binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 binding and activation of their 
respective receptors, it inhibits the Th2 cytokines productions. Infections with a diversity of 
helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The TH2 response is characterized by production of IL-4 and IL-5, subsequently generating IgG1 
[Immunoglobulin Gamma 1] and IgE-secreting ce lls, and eliciting eosinop hilia. Eosinophilia is 
prominent in a number of helminth ic parasitic diseases. The eosi nophilic response to helminths is 
determined both by the host's immune response an d by the parasite, including its distribution, 
migration, and development within the infected host. Therefore patient  with treatment of 
dupilumab may potentially have an incr eased risk of parasitic infection. 
Infections defined in Section  10.4.1.3 should be reported as AESIs within 24 hours. 
A complete diagnostic work-up shoul d be performed (ie, cultures, hi stopathological or cytological 
evaluation, antigen detection and serum antibody titers). Patients should be referred to an 
infectious disease specialist if deemed nece ssary for diagnostic work up and appropriate 
treatment. 
Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the infection is resolved. 
 For any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis or other infections whose nature or course 
may suggest an immunocompromised status (See Appendix I ), patients must be permanently 
discontinued from study medication. 
In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection is excluded from the 
study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic  infection, or those at high risk of parasitic 
infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (i f necessary) laboratory assessments have ruled 
out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever,  fatigue hepatosplenomegaly) that could be 
associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, extended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers and vectors,  etc.). Subsequent medical a ssessments (eg, stool exam, blood 
tests, etc.) must be performed in order to ru le out parasitic infecti on/infestation. Confirmed 
parasitic infections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate notification.  
10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests  
No pre-clinical or clinical data has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupilumab; however, as a general consideration of clinical developmen t, the administration of immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulating agents may represent an addi tional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. 
In order to closely follow liver function tests (LFT), assessment of total protein, albumin, total 
bilirubin, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, and al kaline phosphatase are measured as part of the

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size is chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the efficacy between 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) and placebo with regard to the 2 co-primary endpoints, changes from baseline in NC and NPS at Week 24. 
The observed mean NC reduction of the dupilumab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 0.95 
and the observed mean NC reduction of the placebo group is 0.26. To calculate power, a 
conservative estimate is used th at assumes the placebo-adjusted  NC reduction of the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group is 80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw group, the mean NC reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is then assumed to be 0.81 = 0.8 *  (0.95-0.26) + 0.26. Assuming normal distribution of  the change in NC, a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.03, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will have 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.534 using a two-sided test 
with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NC at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group.  
The observed mean NPS reduction of the dupilu mab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 1.85 
and the observed mean NPS reduction of the placebo group is 0.30. Using same conservative 
approach that assumes the placebo-adjusted N PS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group is 
80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean NPS reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
is then assumed to be 1.54 = 0.8*(1.85-0.30)+0.30. Assuming normal distribution of the change in 
NPS, a common standard deviation (SD) of 2.11, which has incorporated a 20% inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout ra te, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and  
120 patients in placebo, the study will have 99% powe r to detect an effect size of 0.588 using a 
two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in NPS at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group.  
Therefore, with a sample size of 240 patients for the q2w pool ( Arm A and B) at Week 24, the 
combined power of the two co-primary effica cy endpoints is at least 98% for dupilumab 300mg 
q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assuming no negative correlation between the 2 endpoints. 
The observed mean LMK reduction of the dupilu mab group with qw dosing in ACT12340 is 9.07 
and the observed mean LMK reduction of the placebo group is 0.23. Using same conservative 
approach that assumes the placebo-adjusted LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
is 80% of the dupilumab 300 mg qw, the mean LMK reduction of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group is then assumed to be 7.30 = 0.8*(9.07-0.23 )+0.23. Assuming normal distribution of the 
change in LMK, a common standard deviati on (SD) of 5.50, which has incorporated a 20% 
inflation from the observed SD in ACT12340, and a 25% dropout rate, with 240 patients for the 
q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will ha ve 99% power to detect an effect size of 
1.285 using a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 for the change in LMK at Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 102 Therefore, with a sample size of 240 patients for the q2w pool ( Arm A and B) at Week 24, the 
combined power of the three co-primary effi cacy endpoints for Japan is at least 97% for 
dupilumab 300mg q2w group with alpha = 0.05 assu ming no negative correlation between the  
3 endpoints. 
The sample size is also chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the efficacy between 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) and placebo with regard to the key secondary endpoints at Week 24, the change from baseline in the TSS, UPSIT score, the daily loss of smell 
assessment, the LMK, and the SNOT-22 scores, as well as the proportion of patients receiving 
SCS and/or planned to underg o surgery for nasal polyps. 
Assuming the proportion of patients receiving SCS for NP and/or planned to undergo surgery for NP is 15% in the placebo group, and is 5% in the dupilumab group, with 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will have  87% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.316 
between the treatment groups using a two- sided log rank test with alpha = 0.05.  
With 240 patients for the q2w pool and 120 patients in placebo, the study will have greater than 
99% power to detect difference between the treat ment groups for all other five key secondary 
endpoints at Week 24, using a similar assumption pr ocedure as the change from baseline in NC 
and NPS at Week 24.  
The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor 7.

11.4.2.1.1 Co-Primary efficacy variables 
The 2 co-primary efficacy variables are: chan ge from baseline in NC and in NPS at Week 24. 
These variables will be assessed for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (pooled A and B arms) versus 
placebo (Arm C), respectively.  
For Japan only, in addition to the 2 co-primary  endpoints above, the following will also be a  
co-primary endpoint: 
• Change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the LMK score 
at Week 24. 
The following null hypothesis and alternative w ill be tested for pooled dupilumab arms against 
placebo:  
• H0: No treatment difference between the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo.  
• H1: There is a treatment difference betwee n the dupilumab dose regimen and placebo.  
11.4.2.1.2 Analysis of the co-primary efficacy variables 
Each of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints (3 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Japan) will be 
analyzed using a hybrid method of the worst-observation carried forward (WOCF) and the 
multiple imputation (MI). With this approach, fo r patients who undergo surgery for NP or receive 
SCS for any reason, data collected postsurgery or post SCS will be set to missing, and the worst postbaseline value on or before the time of surgery or SCS will be used to impute missing Week 24 value (for patients whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will be used to impute).

For all continuous efficacy endpoints, in the pr imary approach for missing data handling, for 
patients who are indicated to undergo surgery for NP or receive SCS for any reason, data 
collected postsurgery or post SCS will be set to  missing, and the worst postbaseline value on or

been rescued by surgery or receiving SCS at that analyzed visit and data collected after treatment 
discontinuation will be included in the analysis. 
For responder type endpoints, patients who are in dicated for surgery for NP or receive SCS for 
any reason will be considered as non-responders fo r time points after using SCS or surgery; for 
patients who discontinue treatment without using SCS or surgery, data collected during the off-

The baseline value is defined generally as th e last available value before randomization.  
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  the Sponsor for clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG.  
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the treatment 
emergent period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment 
period, including unscheduled or repeated ev aluations. The number of all such patients 
will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.

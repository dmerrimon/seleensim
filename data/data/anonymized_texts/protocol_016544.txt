1. Subject has a diagnosis of bladder cancer  
2. Subject has a diagnosis of prostate cancer 
3. Subject with prostate -specific antigen (PSA) ˃ 10 ng/mL 
suggestive of prostate cancer is  not eligible unless patient has 
concomitant negative prostate biopsy 
4. Subject has acute prostatitis, a prostate abscess, or neurogenic 
bladder

6. Subject has uncontrolled bleeding disorders and coagulopathy 
7. Subject has untreated  urinary tract infection  (UTI)  
8. Subject requires  simultaneous  upper urinary calculi  lithotripsy

Statistical Methods   
Primary Statistical Hypothesis There is no formal hypothesis test.  
Statistical Test Method  A two -sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed using exact 
(Clopper- Pearson) method to estimate the SADE rate for each treatment 
cohort. 
Sample Size Parameters  The sample size justification is based on a confidence interval (CI) 
approach. As there is limited  published literature on the device safety 
measurement in a clinical study setting , a conservative assumption of 
3% SADE rate within  1 month of the procedure for lithotripsy cohort 
and 5% for BPH cohort within  3 months of the HoLEP procedure was 
assumed.  Ninety (90) subjects are needed for each cohort to construct a 
95% two- sided CI with a maximum width of 8.4% for lithotripsy cohort 
and 10.2% for HoLEP  cohort. Assuming 10% attrition within 1 month 
of the procedure for lithotripsy cohort and within 3 months of the HoLEP procedure, it is anticipated that 100 treated subjects will be required for each procedure cohort.

 4. Introduction  
4.1. Background 
The Holmium:yttrium-aluminum- garnet laser (Ho:YAG), is standard for endourological 
procedures. The Ho:YAG laser is established as the gold standard for endoscopic lithotripsy, 
used efficiently for any stone composition, and can also be used for other appli cations 
including soft -tissue ablation,  Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for Benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), tumor resections, and management of stricture disease1.  
Urolithiasis is the formation of one or more stones in the bladder or urinary tract. Kidney stones 
a
re small, hard deposits that can form in the renal pelvis of the kidney. Nonsurgical 
management and treatment of stone disease involves medical relief of pain, and/or medical expulsive therapy (MET). Observation of small ureteral stones (< 6 mm) with periodic evaluation is feasible in patients who do not develop complications
2. Another conservative 
treatment option is MET, which includes the pharmacological use of alpha (α) -blockers, 
calcium channel blockers, or phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  
Treatmen t  for urolithiasis has evolved from open surgery procedure to now less invasive 
ureteroscopy. As smaller, more flexible endoscopes became available in the 1990s and were 
used in conjunction with holmium laser fibers that can fit and bend in these flexible 
endoscopes, ureteroscopy became a mainstay of urolithiasis treatment3. Miniaturized tools are 
also being used with holmium laser fibers in retrograde intrarenal surgery to treat moderate -
to-large stones rather than using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL )4. Holmium 
laser fibers may also be used as intracorporeal lithotripters in the smallest of tracts during Percutaneous  Nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) procedures to dust stones of any composition or size
5. 
The use of Holmium laser has led to capability of fragmenting all stone types, leading to higher 
stone- free rates while maintaining a safety profile7. 
Another wide application of holmium:YAG laser in endourology is to  ablate prostatic  tissue in 
BPH patients. A common manifestation of prostate disease is lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS ). LUTS can be categorized as storage symptoms (increased frequency, nocturia, 
urgency) and voiding symptoms (feeling of incomplete emptying, intermittency, straining, and weak stream)
6. Surgical treatment for these symptoms is required in 25- 30% of men 50- 80 
years of age who suffer from moderate -to-severe LUTS. If l eft un treated, complications of 
BPH -related benign prostatic obstruction ( BPO ) may include renal insufficiency, acute urinary 
retention, urinary tract infection, bladder stones, bladder decomposition, urinary incontinence, upper urinary tract deterioration and azotemia, and hematuria
6. The main goal in treating 
prostatic diseases such as BPO is to alleviate the LUTS. The first step is conservative management. Men who are experiencing nonbothersome LUTS may be assessed and managed 
with watchful waiting rather than undergoing medical or surgical treatment right away. These patients may also be advised to undergo behavioral  (e.g., bladder training, double voiding)  and 
dietary changes  (e.g., reduction of fluid intake at specific times, avoidance of caffeine or 
alcohol).

Page 15 of 59 
 Pharmacological treatment is a common initial step in managing enlarged prostates and 
reducing LUTS . When drug treatments for symptomatic BPH have failed or proven to be 
intolerable due to side effects, surgical options for LUTS are considered. Surgical options ranging from minimally invasive to most invasive include prostatic urethral lift (PUL) with UroLift, laser procedures (vaporization or enucleation with holmium, thulium, greenlight, or diode laser), TUIP  (transurethral incision of prostate) , TURP  (transurethral resection of 
prostate) , Rezūm , and open prostatectomy. 
For treatment of BPH, TURP has been considered the gold standard, but the minimally invasive procedure of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate is a viable surgical treatment option with comparable improvements in IPSS and Qmax to TURP with better hemostasis and in turn, a lower risk of blood transfusion. HoLEP is a recommended option by AUA for patients with 
LUTS attributed to BPH as prostate size-independent option, or those who cannot stop 
anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  
In modern- day urology, surgical treatment options have steered away from open surgery for 
both urolithiasis and BPH. Holmium laser is among minimally invasive technologies available as alternatives.  
Flexiva Pulse and Flexiva Pulse ID Laser Fibers are state of the art devices for delivering holmium laser energy to manage and treat urological pathologies including lithotripsy and ablation and coagulation of tissue in urological applications (e.g., BPH).  
4.2. Study Rationale  
Ureteroscopy became a mainstay of urolithiasis treatment as smaller, more flexible endoscopes became available that are used in conjunction with holmium laser fibers that can fit and bend 
in these flexible endoscopes
8. The holmium laser fibers come in varying sizes. In general, 
larger core fibers (550 -1000 µm sizes) are used in a straight configuration with endoscopes 
used in PCNL procedures; whereas, smaller core fibers (≤ 365 µm)  have the greater flexibility required for flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) procedures
9.  
Holmium laser enu cleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure  
for the treatment of BPH. During a HoLEP procedure, a holmium laser fiber (usually 550 µm 
size10) is passed through an endoscope and used to deliver holmium laser energy for 
enucleat ion and removal of  enlarged prostate tissue away from the prostatic capsule.  
Selecting the right fiber size, and its impact on fiber flexibility and flow rates helps in  
understanding performance of the fiber during clinical use. However, fiber performance and 
safety data in a clinical setting  is limited. The objective  of the Flexiva Pulse registry is to collect 
on-going post -market safety and performance data for the  Flexiva Pulse and Flexiva Pulse ID 
Laser fibers in routine clinical use.

Page 24 of 59 
 Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used for study analysis, unless 
local regulations apply. 
9.2.1. Voluntary Withdrawal 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. At the time of withdrawal, the  Investigator 
shall document the reason for the withdrawal. For subjects who withdraw from  the study and 
decide to revoke their authorization to use and disclose their medical  information, the 
information that has already been collected in the study record may continue  to be used; 
however, no new information will be obtained or added. 9.2.2.  Involuntary Withdrawal Subjects may be involuntarily withdrawn from the study if the Investigator determines it is in 
the subject’s best interest. If the subject is withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion, the reason for withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s medical records.  
9.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
If a subject fails to return to the clinic and/or is unable to be reached for a follow -up visit  the 
site will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
Before the subject may be considered lost to follow-up, the investigator must make the 
following attempts to contact the subject:  
• Three documented telephone attempts 
• One certified letter  
If the subject can be reached and no longer wishes to participate in the study, the Investigator 
shall  document the reason for the withdrawal and complete the End of Study eCRF. 
If the subject is not able to be reached after the required attempts to contact the subject have 
been made and the subject has missed two consecutive follow -up visits, the subject may be 
considered lost to follow -up. The Investigator should document in the subject’s medical record 
the attempts to contact the subject and the reason for withdrawal. 
9.4. Subject Status and Classification  
A subject will be considered enrolled after a signed informed consent  form  is obtained and the 
lithotripsy/HoLEP  procedure is attempted . A subject’s participation ends when he or she has

  10.2. Study Candidate Screening  
All interested subjects will undergo screening during which their eligibility for the study will 
be determined.  Sites are expected to follow standard of care testing to diagnose and screen 
subjects for inclusion in the study.  
Subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered screen failures.   If the subject has completed the informed consent process and met all inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria, the subject will progress to the Lithotripsy/HoLEP procedure and follow -up 
phase of the study. 
10.2.1. Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Subjects will be recruited from clinician practice who are receiving device as standard of care.  
10.3. Informed Consent 
Written informed consent must be obtained from all potential study candidates before any 
study specific, non- standard of care screening tests or procedures are performed. Only current 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), Ethics Committee ( EC) or Research Ethics Board (REB)  
approved study specific ICF must be used. Study personnel should explain that even if a subject agrees to participate in the study and signs an ICF, certain screening procedures might demonstrate that the subject is not eligible to continue participation. Written informed consent must be recorded appropriately by means of the subject’s dated signature.   
10.4. Screening  Assessments/Procedures  
The Screening and Baseline visit s may occur on the same day or on different days. The 
following must be completed prior to collecting baseline data described in section 10.5:  
• Review o f Eligibility Criteria  
• Informed Consent Process, including informed consent signature  
10.5. Baseline Visit  
The Baseline Visit and assessments will occur prior to the subject having Lithotripsy/HoLEP

Flexiva Pulse holmium laser Lithotripsy procedure  per site’s SOC . Each subject in the  BPH 
cohort will be followed up to 6 months ( 180 days + 60 days) post discharge from HoLEP 
procedure per site’s  SOC . All subjects completing th e last follow -up visit  per site’s SOC  and 
their respective cohorts , will be considered to have completed the study. Subjects with any 
ongoing Adverse Events at the end of the study should be followed per institutions ’ standard 
of care. 
If subject in the Lithotripsy cohort  is undergoing a multi- staged  lithotripsy procedure that  does 
not use the Flexiva Pulse Laser Fibers, then subject should be exited from the study at the time 
of the additional procedure.  
10.11. Source Documents  
It is preferable that original source documents are maintained, when available. In lieu of 
original source documents, certified copies are required to be maintained.  A certified copy is a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified (i.e., by a dated signature or by generation through a validated process) to have the same information, including data that describe the context, content, and structure, as the original.  
10.12. Local Laboratory documentation 
The laboratory (blood and urine) analysis, collected in the study will be completed at the 
local centers per standard of care. Appropriate laboratory certifications and documentation 
records are required to be maintained at the site . 
11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1.  Endpoints 
11.1.1. Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint  is the occurrence of any Serious Adverse D evice Effects (SADE)  
(including burn, perforation, and hemorrhage) during Lithotripsy and BPH  procedures. 
11.1.1.1. H ypotheses 
There is no formal hypothesis test. The study is designed to evaluate primary safety endpoints with desired precision. 
11.1.1.2. S
ample Size  
The sample size justification is based on a confidence interval (CI) approach. As there is 
limited  published literature on the device safety measurement in a clinical study setting , a 
conservative assumption of 3% SADE rate within 1 month of the procedure for lithotripsy cohort and 5% for BPH cohort within 3 months of the HoLEP procedure was assumed. Ninety 
Form/Template 92120219 Rev/Ver F  
Confidential  Flexiva Pulse Registry – U0703, 92704912 Rev/Ver A  
Page 33 of 59 
 
  (90) subjects are needed for each cohort to construct a 95% two- sided CI with a maximum 
width of 8.4% for lithotripsy cohort and 10.2% for HoLEP cohort. Assuming 10% attrition 
within 1 month of the procedure for lithotripsy cohort and within 3 months of the HoLEP procedure, it is anticipated that 100 treated subjects will be required for each procedure cohort. 
11.1.1.3. S
tatistical Methods  
A two -sided  95% confidence interval will be  constructed  using exact (Clopper- Pearson) 
method to estimate the SADE rate at 30 days post procedure for lithotripsy cohort  and the 
SADE rate at 3 -month post procedure for BPH cohort. 
11.1.2. Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
Lithotripsy  procedure cohort: Stone clearance assessed by stone free rates (SFR) at 1 month  
follow-up. SFR is defined as c linically nonsignificant, non- obstructive residual fragments of ≤ 
3 mm, asymptomatic and no auxiliary procedures performed between the final Flexiva Pulse 
holmium laser lithotripsy procedure and the 1 month follow-up.  
BPH  procedure cohort: Improvement in BPH symptoms from Baseline as measured by 
favorable change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 3-month follow-up. 
11.1.2.1. H ypotheses 
There is no pre-specified hypothesis. All the endpoints are descriptive in nature. 11.1.2.2. S
tatistical Methods  
Lithotripsy  procedure cohort: The proportion of subjects who achieved stone clearance at 1 
month follow-up post lithotripsy procedure will be calculated.  
BPH  procedure cohort: The change of IPSS total score at 3 -month and 6-month post BPH 
procedure from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  The same analysis 
will be performed for subjects with and without cathe ter at baseline if applicable.  
11.2. General Statistical Methods  
11.2.1. Analysis Sets 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population includes all subjects who provide written 
informed consent to be enrolled into the study, and have the Lithotripsy  or BPH  procedure 
attempted.  
The As Treated (AT) subject population includes all the ITT subjects who had the Lithotripsy  
or BPH  procedure completed. 
The Per Protocol (PP) subject population includes all the AT subjects who also meet all  
eligibility criteria and have no major protocol deviations. The primary analysis of all the endpoints will be performed for the ITT population. Efficacy 
endpoints will be evaluated for the PP population as a sensitivity analysis and safety endpoints will be evaluated for the AS population as a sensitivity analysis.

12. Data Management  
12.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review 
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
Form/Template 92120219 Rev/Ver F  
Confidential  Flexiva Pulse Registry – U0703, 92704912 Rev/Ver A  
Page 37 of 59 
 
  The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by Medidata EDC System . All 
changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for 
review by the sponsor  or its representative. The associated R ave software and database have 
been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signature s. Database backups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides their  electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case report 
forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to  the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging 
and approving the changes. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. 
Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system and will be 
issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database.  
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read only” after all data is either “Hard Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archivi ng activities can begin. Once all 
closeout activities are completed , a request to IT is submitted to have the “Database Locked” 
or Decommissioned and all database access revoked.  
12.2. Data Retention  
The Principal Investigator or designee or Investigational site will maintain  all essential study 
documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.   
The Principal Investigator or designee will take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents. If for any reason the Principal Investigator or designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are required to inform BSC  in writing where paper 
or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
13. Deviations  
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol , except to protect the 
life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/E C/REB , and the regulatory authority if applicable of any 
deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in 
an emergency , and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical 
investigation . Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days 
after the emergency occurred, or per prevailing local requirements, if sooner than 5 working days.

• with the consent of the data subject; or 
• processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.  
 
14.5.1. Transparency  
BSC must only collect personal data by fair and lawful means. BSC must be transparent and open with individuals about how BSC collects and uses personal data, with whom BSC shares it, and where it may be processed.  
For this transparency principle, BSC must provide information to our health care providers and their study subjects about the purpose for collecting their personal data; who will have access to the data and to whom it may be shared, if it will be accessed or transferred to another country; and who to contact with questions or requests. 
14.5.2. Rights to Data Subjects  
In GDPR, a data subject is any living individual to whom the personal data relates. A data subject includes study subjects. Data subjects shall have the right to:  
• obtain from BSC confirmation of whether BSC has data relating to the individual; 
• have data relating to them communicated: 
o within a reasonable time (within 30 days from receipt of request, extendable if 
complicated or unclear request);  
o at a charge, if any, that is not excessive; 
o in a reasonable manner; and  
o in a form that is readily intelligible to the individual; 
• be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be 
able to challenge such denial;  
• challenge data relating to the individual and, if the challenge is successful, to have the 
data erased, rectified, completed, or amended. During the period of such challenge, the individual can require that access to the data be restricted;  
• "opt out"/oppose that their personal data are used for marketing purposes; and, 
• when requested, BSC must also communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. 
These rights will also be listed in the subject informed consent form. 
14.6. Insurance  
Where required by local/country regulation, proof and type of insurance coverage, by BSC for 
subjects in the study will be obtained.

  15. Monitoring  
Monitoring will be performed during the study to assess continued compliance with the 
protocol and applicable regulations. In addition, the clinical research monitor verifies that study records are adequately maintained, that data are reported in a satisfactory manner with respect to timeliness, adequacy, and accuracy, and that the Principal Investigator continues to 
have sufficient staff and facilities to conduct the study safely and effectively. The Principal Investigator/institution guarantees direct acc ess to original source documents by BSC 
personnel, their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities. 
The sponsor will put a plan in place to document the specific monitoring requirements.  The study may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by BSC or its designees, as well as 
inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the  Principal  Investigator 
and relevant study personnel are available during on- site monitoring visits or audits and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
16. Potential Risks and Benefits 
16.1. Instructions for Use  
Please refer to the Instructions for Use for an overview of anticipated adverse (device) effects, 
and risks associated to the commercial  device (s).   
16.2. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study

of the procedures associated with this study fall outside of a standard of care procedure. 
Therefore, there are no foreseen additional risks associated with the procedure, testing, or withdrawal from the study. 
16.3. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject selection criteria , close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research procedures and/or 
follow- ups and by promptly supplying BSC  with all pertinent information required by this 
protocol. 
16.4. Anticipated Benefits  
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in this study. Potential benefits include stone clearance, improved urodynamics , and improved quality of life. The Flexiva Pulse and 
Flexiva Pulse ID Laser Fibers are commercially available devices and can be utilized  with or 
without enrollment in this  study. However, information gained from the conduct of this study 
may be of benefit to  others with the same medical conditions.

17. Safety Reporting 
17.1. Reportable Events  by investigational site to BSC 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occurs 
in any of following categories , from the time of Lithotripsy/HoLEP procedure to the end of the 
study: 
• Serious Adverse Device Effects  (SADEs)  
• Procedure Related Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs)   
• Fatal Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs)  
• Adverse Device Effects  (ADEs)  
• Procedure Related Adverse Events  (AEs)  
• Device Deficiencies  (including BSC devices used during the procedure) 
 
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms. If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
Any reportable event  must be recorded in the eCRF.   
The Investigator or designee is responsible for updating the eCRF with new and/ or updated 
information in relation to the already  reported event as soon as he/she becomes aware.  
 Underlying diseases and chronic conditions are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded 
as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of one (1) specific SAE (see Table 17.2-1 
for AE definitions). 
Refer to Instructions for Use  for the known risks associated with the commercial device(s).  
17.2. Definitions and Classification  
Safety  definitions are provided in Table 17.2-1. A dministrative edits were made on the safety 
definition s from applicable regulations and guidance including (but not limited to) 21 CFR

  17.3. Relationship  to Study Device(s)  (Device Under Study and Comparator Device, 
if applicable) and/or Study Procedure 
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the reportable AE to the study device(s), and/or 
study procedure . See criteria in  Table 17.3-1:  
Table 17.3-1: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device (s) (Device Under 
Study and Comparator Device, if applicable) or Procedure to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Not Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 Relationship to the device , comparator  or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the study device or the 
procedures related to the use of the study device;  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device 
(if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body- site or an organ that cannot be affected by the device or 
procedure;  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by the study device used for 
diagnosis, when applicable;  
- In order to establish the non- relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.  
Possibly Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The relationship with the use of the study device or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases w here relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The relationship with the use of the study device  or, comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably explained by 
another cause.

Study and Comparator Device, if applicable) or Procedure to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Causal Relationship  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 The serious event is associated with the study device, comparator or with 
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with the study device use/application or 
procedures;  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the study device or procedures are applied to;  
-the study device or procedures have an effect on;  
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out; 
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
- the event depends on a false result given by the study device used for diagnosis, 
when applicable;  
- In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.

  17.5. BSC Device Deficiencies  
Device deficiencies  will be collected for BSC devices only and will be documented and 
reported to BSC. If possible, the device (s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions 
for returning the device(s) will be provided by the Clinical Project Manager. Device 
deficiencies  should also be documented in the subject’s source records. 
Device deficiencies are not adverse events. However, an adverse event that results from a 
device deficiency , would be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate e CRF.  
17.6. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / REBs/ Investigators 
BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating Principal 
Investigators , IRBs /ECs/REBs  and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC /REB , and regulatory 
authorities of UADEs and SAE s as required by local /regional regulations. 
17.7. Subject Death Reporting   
A subject death during the study should be reported to BSC as soon as possible and, in any 
event, within three (3) calendar days of site notification. The site’s IRB/EC/REB must be notified of any deaths in accordance with that site’s IRB/EC/REB policies and procedures. 
Notification of death must include a detailed narrative (death letter) that provides detailed 
information describing the circumstances surrounding the death. A death narrative in the local language is acceptable, if accompanied by a translation in English. The details listed below 
should be addressed in the death narrative, in order for BSC to understand the circumstance surrounding the death:  
• Date of death 
• Immediate cause of death  
• Whether the death was related to the device or to the procedure  
• Any other circumstances surrounding the death  
• Investigator or sub-investigator signature and date  
Also submit the following documentation: 
• If the patient expired in the hospital:

Confidential  Flexiva Pulse Registry – U0703, 92704912 Rev/Ver A  
Page 51 of 59 
 
  o Death certificate (if available)  
The Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  will review information regarding subject deaths. 
18. Informed Consent  
Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from  
each subject or subject’s  legally authorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any study devices, study- required 
procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority, as applicable. The ICF mus t be accepted  
by BSC or it s delegate (e.g. CRO), and approved by the site’s IRB/EC/REB , or central IRB, if 
applicable.  
BSC will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators participating in this 
study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the investigative site’s IRB/EC/REB .  Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to use of the form.  The 
ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC/REB  approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included in the body of 
the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall  at a minimum include the following steps, as 
well as any other steps required by applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines: 
• be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the process,  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical study, 
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate, 
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or subject’s  
legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if necessary, 
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the clinical study.
  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative  
competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by the investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent 
process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed consent for continued participation as soon as subject’s  medical condition allows. The original signed 
Form/Template 92120219 Rev/Ver F  
Confidential  Flexiva Pulse Registry – U0703, 92704912 Rev/Ver A  
Page 52 of 59 
 
  ICF will be retained by the site and a copy of the signed and dated document and any other 
written information must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent must be reported to  BSC. Any violations of the informed 
consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities 
(e.g. IRB/EC /REB ), as appropriate. 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following annual review by the IRB/EC /REB . The new version of the ICF must be approved 
by the IRB/EC /REB . Acceptance by BSC is required if changes to the revised ICF are 
requested by the site’s IRB/EC /REB. The IRB/EC/REB  will determine the subject population 
to be re-consented. 
19. Committees  
19.1. Safety Monitoring Process 
The BSC personnel from the Medical Safety and Safety Trial Operation s group review safety 
data as it is reported by the sites throughout the duration of the study. During scheduled 
monitoring activities , clinical research monitors further support this review  through their 
review of source document s and other data information. The BSC Medical Safety and Safety 
Trial Operations team include  health care providers with the necessary therapeutic and subject 
matter expertise to evaluate and classify the events into the categories outlined above.  
19.2. Clinical Events Committee  
Adjudication of clinical events will be performed by an independent physician or group of  
physicians with pertinent expertise. Independent physician(s) will review and adjudicate  
important endpoints and relevant adverse events reported by study investigators. Independent physician(s) will review a safety event dossier, which may include copies of subject source  
documents provided by study sites. 
Membership  will include practitioner(s) of urology with the necessary therapeutic and subject 
matter expertise to adjudicate important endpoints and relevant adverse events  reported by 
study investigators . Adjudication responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and 
adjudication procedures are outlined in the  adjudication charter. The adjudication charter will 
also specify the stage at which  adjudication activities will cease and events will be reviewed 
internally by BSC.

  20. Suspension or Termination  
20.1 Premature Termination of the Study  
BSC reserves the right to terminate the study at any stage but intends to exercise this right only 
for valid scientific or  business reasons and reasons related to protection of subjects.  
Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs /REBs , and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be 
notified in writing in the event of study termination.  
20.1.1 Criteria for Premature Termination of the Study  
Possible reasons for premature study termination include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Suspicion of an unacceptable risk, including serious health threat. In this case, the sponsor 
shall suspend the clinical investigation while the risk is assessed. The sponsor shall terminate the clinical investigation if an unacceptable risk which cannot be controlled is confirmed. 
• Instructions by the IRB/EC/REB or regulatory authorities to suspend or terminate the clinical investigation.  
• An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the study.  
• A decision on the part of BSC to suspend or discontinue development /marketing  of the 
device.  
20.2 Termination of Study Participation by the Investigator or Withdrawal of IRB/ EC/REB Approval 
Any investigator, or  associated  IRB/EC/REB  or regulatory authority may discontinue 
participation in the study or withdraw approval of the study, respectively, with suitable written 
notice to BSC . Investigators, associated IRBs/ECs /REBs , and regulatory authorities, as 
applicable, will be notified in writing in the event of these occurrences . 
20.3 Requirements for Documentation and Subject Follow -up 
In the event of  premature study termination , a written statement as to why the premature 
termination has occurred will be provided to all participating sites by BSC. The IRB/EC /REB  
and regulatory authorities, as applicable , will be notified. D etailed information on how enrolled 
subjects will be managed thereafter  will be provided.  
In the event an IRB /EC/REB  terminates participation in the study, participating investigators, 
associated IRBs/ECs /REBs , and regulatory authorities, as applicable, will be notified in 
writing . Detailed information on how enrolled subjects will be managed thereafter will be 
provided by BSC.

Specific Aims  
Permanent supportive housing (PSH) using a Housing First approach is an evidence -
based  intervention to end chronic homelessness by providing low -barrier affordable housing 
paired with flexible health  and social services.1 In Los Angeles County (LAC), where the 
number of PSH units is expected to increase  dramatically over the next 10 years,2 clinical 
guidelines and standards for support services are lacking. This is  especially problematic given 
that the target population is older and prematurely ageing . The chronically  homeless population 
in the United States has an average age approaching 60 years old3 and experiences  accelerated 
aging,4 including an elevated prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as functional impairment,  
falls, and urinary incontinence that can jeopardize PSH tenants’ ability to live independently and 
age in place.5–7 Current support services are not equipped to address these needs, which 
ultimately jeopardizes the success  of PSH to maintain high rates of housing stability while 
tenants “age in place.”8 
We propose d conducting a pilot project to implement the CAPABLE model in PSH. 
CAPABLE, which  stands for Community Aging in Place —Advancing Better Living for Elders, 
is a client -directed, home -based  intervention that consists of time -limited services (no more than 
6 months) from an occupational therapist (OT),  a nurse, and a handyman working collaboratively 
with the older adult client.9 CAPABLE was developed to  support older adults who are returning 
to independent living after hospitalization and has been shown to  improve functioning (activities 
of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs]), decrease  falls and  
nursing home admissions, and reduce health care costs based on multiple studies including 
several  randomized controlled trials.9–17 CAPABLE has the potential to be used in PSH as a  
model of support services  that can address needs of prematurely aging tenants, which could help 
transform PSH from an intervention  that ends homelessness to an intervention that addresses 
homelessness and supports successful aging in  place . 
 
The specific aims of this study were to: 
1. Examine the impact of CAPABLE on PSH client outcomes (e.g., ADLs, IADLs, 
falls).  This aim  was accomplished using a pre –post design with a waitlist control 
group.  
2. Determine what adaptations, if any, need to be made to implement CAPABLE in 
PSH.  We accomplish ed this aim by using the dynamic adaptation process (DAP) 
implementation approach, which  was designed to allow for an evidence -based 
practice to be adapted in a planned and considered,  rather than ad hoc, manner.  
 
Background and Significance  
The chronically homeless population in the United States represents a stable, aging 
cohort whose  functional age is significantly older than its chronological age.3,18 Born at the 
end of the baby boomer  generation, this predominantly male and African American population 
first became visible in the 1980s. More  than three  decades into the homelessness crisis, nearly 
half of homeless adults are aged 50 or older, a significant  increase from only 11% in the early 
1990s and 32% in 2003.3,18 Homeless adults aged 50 or older have  chronic disease rates  like 
housed adults aged 65 or older.4,19–21 Homeless adults also have a higher  prevalence of geriatric 
syndromes (e.g., functional and cognitive impairments, frailty,  depression, hearing and  visual 
impairments, urinary incontinence) compared to population -based samples that are 2 decades 
older.4,22 Such premature aging has resulted in homeless adults having age -adjusted mortality 
rates three  to four times higher  than housed adults.23,24 
 
PSH has become the leading homelessness policy in the United States regardless of 
age. PSH refers to  immediate access to affordable, independent housing along with home - and 
community -based services that  are intended to support a population with complex behavioral 
health and social needs.25,26 PSH through a  Housing First approach has been recognized as the 
“clear solution” to chronic homelessness by the U.S.  federal government.1 This represents a 
remarkable policy shift during the past decade from a  previous focus  on shelters and transitional 
housing. PSH has been shown to increase quality of life27,28 and reduce overall  public costs by 
removing people from the institutional circuit of hospitals, jails, shelters, and life on the 
streets10,3 and placing them in independent  community living.29–31 In 2013, there were more than 
280,000 PSH units  across the country, a figure that has been increasing by an average of more 
than 10,000 units annually since  2006.32,33 In LAC, local health service systems and tax 
initiatives are supporting the  development of more than  20,000 units of PSH over the next 10 
years.2 To date, there has been limited research that considers whether  and how PSH programs 
can help residents maintain independent living as they age (i.e., “age in place”).8 
 
A significant portion of the population that now resides in PSH is at high risk of 
premature onset of  geriatric syndromes, which can jeopardize aging in place. Prior research 
with currently homeless adults  suggested that PSH residents experience early onset of geriatric 
syndromes at disproportionately high  rates.7,22 This was confirmed in the only study to explore 
rates of geriatric syndromes among PSH tenants.22 Geriatric syndromes, which are often 
multifactorial and cross discrete disease categories, can undermine the  significant investment in 
PSH in cities across the United States.34 High rates of geriatric syndromes among the  increasing 
number of adults who have transitioned from homelessness to independent community living 
will likely result in higher health care utilization and increased morbidity, mortality, and 
institutionalization.25-29 The recognition that PSH tenants will face challenges aging in place has 
only recently been articulated.22,27 To date,  research has not examined the capacity of PSH to 
address geriatric syndromes . 
 
CAPABLE is an evidence -based practice designed to address many of the geriatric 
conditions  experienced by PSH tenants. CAPABLE is approved by the National Council on 
Aging as an evidence -based  falls prevention program and is recognized by federal and state 
agencies as an effective program for improving  health and decreasing costs among older adults.10 
As of August 2018, CAPABLE is being offered through  programs in 22  organizations across 12 
states in the United States and Australia.11 CAPABLE has the potential  to be used in PSH as a 
model of support services that can address needs of prematurely aging  tenants.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
Tenants Aging in Place (TAP) study (R21AG050009; PI: Henwood). As part of the PI’s 
recently  completed NIA -funded R21 study, 237 adults aged 45 or older were recruited from two 
PSH agencies in Los  Angeles, California. Residents completed in -person interviews on 
demographics, housing and homelessness  history, and overall health status. We also assessed 
common geriatric syndromes. Despite their average age  of only 57 years old, we found 42% of 
respondents had difficulty performing ADLs (e.g., bathing, dressing) and  68% reported having 
difficulty performing IADLs (e.g., taking transportation, managing medication). More than  half 
of the sample (56%) had experienced one or more falls in the past year. 22 Based on these 
findings and  with the support of a planning grant from the Unihealth Foundation that covered 
staff time at our partner  organizations, during the past 12 months, we have explored existing 
evidence -based practices that have  potential to meet the needs of older adult PSH tenants. The 
CAPABLE model was determined to be the best fit  given client needs  and existing 
organizational capacity.  
 
Methods  
For this study, we w orked  with one of our existing community partners, the Skid Row 
Housing Trust  (SRHT), to pilot the CAPABLE model. SRHT ha d the required staffing for 
CAPABLE, including an  advanced practice OT staff member , nurses from LAC DHS who are 
assigned to SRHT tenants through their existing  Housing for  Health program, and existing 
handyman resources. CAPABLE training is required for nurses and  OTs, which will be provided 
by our partners at Johns Hopkins University, where the intervention was  developed . The training 
took approximately 20 hours to complete and include d: five 60 -minute o n-line learning modules 
(self-paced, recommended to be completed  over the course of two  weeks); up to an 8 -hour live 
(virtual) training; and five coaching calls or webinars. The implementation of CAPABLE over 6 
months  was used to accomplish both study aims.  
The program was initially scheduled to begin in March 2020 but due to the onset of the 
COVID -19 pandemic was delayed until February 2021. During this time, study measures were 
updated to be maximally consistent with other CAPABLE studies in collaboration w ith Johns 
Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSN) that provided Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data 
dictionaries. JHSN also provided on-line CAPABLE training to RNs and OTs along with 
ongoing technical assistance phone calls throughout the project. For this pilot, the trained OT 
was a full -time staff member at the PSH agency, and the two trained RNs worked part -time 
through an online sche duling platform with oversight from a local federally qualified health 
center . 
Site description . SRHT is one of the largest providers of PSH in LAC. Founded in 1989, 
the SRHT  operates nearly 1,600 housing units in 24 buildings, providing housing for nearly 
1,200 adults aged 50 or older.  SRHT predominantly serves adults with disabilities who are high 
utilizers of public health or mental health  services. SRHT employs approximately 75 support and 
medical staff members, including case managers,  program managers, paraprofessionals,  
substance abuse professionals, OTs, social workers, psychologists,  psychiatrists, nurses, primary 
care physicians, and a hoarding specialist.4 
 
Aim 1: Examine the impact of CAPABLE on PSH client outcomes.  
Implementation of CAPABLE.  We trained  two registered nurses (RNs) and an OT to 
handle a  caseload of 50 PSH tenants. In most cases, the OT made  six visits, the RN made  four 
visits, and a  handyman made one to two visits to modify the client’s home during a 6 -month 
period. However, t he program can be  completed in fewer visits, with a  minimum of four OT 
visits and three RN visits . CAPABLE home visits are key to meeting participants “where they 
are.” The first visits for the OT and RN were usually 90 minutes each, and the later ones are 
usually an hour each. Visits are spaced to enable older adults  to practice new strategies learned in 
the previous visit. Visits were allowed to be rescheduled given unforeseen  circum stance s. There 
was a clear  conclusion or graduation, with the older adult  understanding how to use their new 
skills and apply them to future situations.10 For this study, we plan ned to recruit 100 eligible 
SRHT tenants. As a result, a waitlist control  design  was used , for a case -crossover  between - and 
within -subject comparison of the CAPABLE intervention effect.   
Participant recruitmen t and data collection . Starting in December 2020, the PSH support 
staff began identifying eligible participants for the CAPABLE program . PSH te nants were 
eligible for the study if they were over the age of 50, had  some or a lot of difficulty performing 
ADLs , and were cognitively intact or ha d only mild cognitive impairment. Tenants who were 
perceived to meet these criteria received details about the CAPABLE program from the trained 
OT, who also asked whether tenants would be interested in participating in a study. Interested 
tenants were refer red to the research team  to be scre ened to confirm eligibility status, obtain 
informed consent, and randomly assigned to either the intervention or waitlist control group 
using a random number generator.   
Between December 2020 and January 2021, 75 PSH tenants were referred to the research 
team . Fifteen PSH tenants  declined to participate, resulting in 60 individuals who answered a 
survey -administered baseline assessment and were randomized into the intervention or waitlist 
control group. The CAPABLE team then received the list of 30 tenants randomized to initially 
receive  the intervention. Two  tenants  decided they no longer wanted to participate in the 
program and one  could not be r econtacted  (the team later discovered this person had died), 
leaving 27 who received the intervention starting in February 2021. In June 2021, the 30 tenants  
in the waitlist control group completed a follow -up research assessment, along with the 17 who 
had finished the CAPABLE intervention at that time. By September 2021, the remaining 10 
tenants all completed the CAPABLE program but only nine had completed the follow -up 
research assessment; one person declined to complete but was contacted 6 months later and 
completed the follow -up assessment  at that time.  
Most intervention visits occurred in person at the participant’s residence (a few visits by 
the nurse were conducted by phone if the tenant was able to share progress and could follow 
guidance through this format). All research data collection was conducted by telephone as part of 
COVID -19 safety protocols. PSH tenants received a $20 gift card for completing the baseline 
assessment and a $25 gift card for completing the follow -up assessment . 
All data were collected and managed using the REDCap p latform. Measures collected 
only at baseline included demographic characteristics , years in current PSH  unit, and cumulative 
years spent homeless. Tenants were also asked about history and nu mber of falls , emergency 
room visits, and overnight h ospitalizations within the last year at baseline ; these items were 
asked again at follow -up but used only a 6 -month retrospective. Additional health -related 
outcomes measure d at baseline and follow -up included  information on : ADLs and IADL s; falls 
efficacy; de pression; pain interference  with usual activities; self -rated hea lth; and overall quality 
of life. A desc ription of primary outcome measures are inclu ded in the following table:  
 
Table 1. Descri ption of primary outcome measures.  
 
Mea sure Description  
Katz Activities of 
Daily Living Scale  The modified Katz ADL Scale w as used to rate ability to bathe, 
dress, transfer, toilet, and eat using three  categories: no difficulty , a 
little or some difficulty , or a lot of difficulty or inability to perform .36 
The Brief Instrumental 
Functioning Scale  The Brief Instrumental Functioning Scale w as used to assess ability 
to perform six IADLs on a scale similar to the Katz ADL Scale .37 
Falls  History of falls during the past year w as assessed by asking: “Did 
you fall to the ground  in the past year ?” 38 The number of falls in the 
past year w as also assessed. 
Falls eff icacy  Participants rated their confidence they could do each of 10 
activities without falling on a 10 -point scale, with total scores 
ranging from 10 (not very confident) to 100 (very confident) using 
the Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale.  
Depression  Eight of the nine items in the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 were 
used to measure depression, rated on a 4 -point scale of how 
frequently participants were bothered by the eight problems during a 
2-week period (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more th an half 
the days, and 3 = nearly every day). 39 Items were summed to obtain 
a score with minimum and maximum values of 0 to 24, respectively, 
whereby higher scores represent greater depressive symptoms.  
Pain interfere nce with 
usual activities  Pain interference with usual activities was assessed using an item 
from the 3 -item PEG to assess average pain intensity (P), 
interference with enjoyment of life (E), and interference with 
general activity (G) on a 10 -point Likert scale from 0 (does not 
interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  
 
 
Statistical Analysis  Plan. We conducted a power analysis using G*Power to estimate the power 
obtained with 100  individuals proposed for this pilot. When specifying an effect size of .30 and a 
correlation among repeated  measures of .70, 70 participants across two groups  were  needed to 
achieve an exact power of .80. This allow ed our study to have up to a 30% overall dropout rate 
while maintaining sufficient power . 
The balance between the intervention and control groups at baseline was assessed using 
Fisher ’s exact test for nominal varia bles, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel test for ordinal 
variables, and two -sample  t-tests for continuous and count variables. Given that the main 
analytic goal of this pilot study was to consider the effect size of the intervention, we calculated 
within - and between -group standardized mean differences (Cohen’s  d) between time points. 
These tests were also used to compare differences in falls, ER visits, and hospitalizations 
between the groups at follow -up. To consider statistically significant changes in key outcomes in 
each study group (i.e., intervention versus  control) between baseline and follow -up, we also used 
paired  t-tests. Between -group analyses included a two -sample  t-test to test whether the mean 
change in outcomes between baseline and follow -up differed between the intervention and 
control groups .  
Aim 2: Determine what adaptations, if any, need to be made to implement CAPABLE in 
PSH.  
Adaptation of CAPABLE.  Following the DAP implementation approach, which was 
designed to allow an evidence -based practice to be adapted in a planned and considered, rather 
than ad hoc, manner,40 our investigative team monitor ed the implementation of CAPABLE and 
work ed in conjunction with program leaders,  clinicians, clients, county health systems, and 
model developers to make any adaptation s to the model that would also  preserve fidelity to core 
components. For example, we expect ed that within PSH, CAPABLE w ould need to  include 
collaboration with existing PSH case workers and social workers. DAP is a continuously 
iterative  process, in that ongoing experience can inform continued adaptation as needed. 
Although DAP can be used  during all four phases of the implementation conceptual model 
known as EPIS (i.e., exploration, preparation,  implementation, and sustainment),41,42 this study 
focus ed on two of the phases: preparation and  implementation. The initial exploration phase was 
completed as part of our previous work (see  Preliminary Studies section), and the 
implementation  phase represents this next step .  
Data collection and monitoring.  The investigative team (Henwood and Pitts) had primary  
responsibility for monitoring the implementation of CAPABLE through weekly case reviews and  
note taking  on any possible deviations from the model. The investigative team met monthly with 
the larger  implementation resource team (IRT), which  include d the developers of the CAPABLE 
model, via a  conference call to discuss fidelity to CAPABLE and consider adaptation needs. 
With DAP, adaptations were  explicit and done in a planned way by the IRT, in conjunction with 
service providers and coaches, to preserve  fidelity to core components. This w as accomplished 
by reviewing weekly implementation monitoring with the  IRT. Discussion and decisions were 
documented through an ongoing audit trail.43  
Data analysis.  At the end of the implementation phase, the IRT review ed all 
implementation decisions  documented in the audit trail and determine d what adaptations of 
CAPABLE should be included for PSH. These  decisions w ere formalized through a written 
manual to be used for future implementation and research  projects.

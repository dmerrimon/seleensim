Name  of Sponsor/Company:  Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. 
Name  of Investigational Product:  Light- activated  AU-011 
Name  of Active  Ingredient:  AU-011 
Title  of Study:  A Phase  1b/2 open- label,  ascending  single  and repeat  dose  clinical trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of light -activated AU -011 for the treatment of subjects with small 
primary choroidal melanoma. 
Number  of Subjects  (planned) : Approximately  60 adult  subjects  
Number  of Study  Sites:  Up to 15 clinical sites 
Phase  of Development:  Phase 1b/2 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of IVT administration of one of 3 dose 
levels,  repeat  dose regimens and  one or two laser  applications of Light -activated  AU-011 given in one 
or two treatment cycles in the treatment of subjects with small primary choroidal melanoma.  
Secondary objectives  include  evaluating:  
• Efficacy  of AU-011 with one or two cycles of treatment  with the maximum  safe and feasible dose 
• Efficacy  and safety  of AU-011 in subjects with documented growth 
• The immunogenicity  of AU-011 
• A-scan amplitudes  of the internal  reflectivity  of the lesion  at sites with diagnostic probes  
• Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)  image  changes at sites with OCTA imaging 
systems for Cohorts 6 through 9  
Study  Design:  
This is an open-label, ascending single and repeat dose and cycle, multicenter study designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of Light -activated AU -011 at three dose levels and repeat dose 
regimens and cycles of Light- activated AU -011 and one or two laser applications in subjects with 
small  primary  choroidal melanoma  (CM).  The dose escalation  design is shown  in the figure below.

(Rev -11) at each site and subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 12.
Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Cohorts
Three subjects will receive a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of Light- activated AU -011 low dose 
(20 µg in µL). The injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. No 
more than one subject may  be treated perday, and the treated subject must complete the 24-hour post- 
treatment visit with no safety issues before the next subject in a given cohort may be treated.
If all 3 subjects in the low dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 
escalation to the medium dose level group will be initiated.  If a DLT is observed in 1 subject in the 
low dose group, this  group willbe expanded to 6 subjects. Dose escalation willnot be allowed if 2 or 
more subjects in the low dose group experience a treatment -related DLT. Instead, if 2 or more 
subjects in the low dose group experience a treatment -related DLT, dose reduction to 10 µg in µL 
may be considered for enrolling an additional 3 subjects.
One week after thelastsubject inthe low dose group completes treatment, the study medical  monitor 
and an independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects in the low dose group. 
After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding to treatment with the medium dose group, three subjects will receive a single intravitreal injection of Light- activated AU -011 medium 
dose (40 µg in µL). The injection is  followed 6 to 8 hours later  by exposure to689 nm laser light.
If all 3 subjects in the medium dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), escalation to the high dose level group will be initiated. If a DLT is observed in 1 subject in the medium dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in the medium dose  group experience a DLT after their treatment, thiswillconfirm that the lower  dose level 
is the maximum feasible dose (due to formulation limits).

 One week after the last subject in the medium dose group completes treatment, the study medical 
monitor and an independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects in the medium dose group. After  review  and confirmation  that the data support proceeding to treatment  with  the high 
dose group, 3 subjects will receive a single dose of Light -activated AU -011 high dose (80 µg 
administered as 2 injections of µg in µL not more than 2 hours apart). The second injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. If a DLT is observed in 1 subject in  the 
high dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in the high dose 
group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that the medium dose level is the 
maximum feasible dose and the dose chosen for the repeat dose phase of the study will drop to one dose below the maximum feasible dose of 40 µg and the lower dose of 20 µg will be given as repeat doses.  
Multiple  A
scending  Dose  (MAD)  Cohorts  
One day after  the last subject in  the high dose group completes treatment, the study  medical  monitor 
and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and identify the  maximum 
feasible dose for evaluation  in the repeat  dose phase  of the study. After  review  and confirmation  that 
the data support proceeding to a repeat  dose regimen, 3 subjects will  receive an  intravitreal injection 
of 40 µg in µL of Light- activated AU -011 as 2 repeat doses one week apart. Each injection is 
followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. 
If all 3 subjects in this 2 repeat 40 µg dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) after 2 injections, then this regimen of Light- activated AU -011 may be investigated 
further in subsequent  studies.  If a DLT  is observed  in 1 subject in this 2 repeat 40  µg dose group, this 
group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in this 2 repeat 40 µg dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that a lower dose repeat regimen should be investigated.  
One day after the last subject  in the 2 repeat  40 µg dose group completes  treatment,  the study  medical 
monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and identify whether it is safe to evaluate 3 repeat 40 µg doses in the next cohort of the study. 
After review  and confirmation that the data support proceeding to a 3 repeat 40 µg dose regimen, 3 
subjects will receive an intravitreal injection of 40 µg in µL of Light- activated AU -011 as 3 
repeat doses  1 week  apart.  Each  injection  is followed  6 to 8 hours later by exposure  to 689 nm laser 
light.  
If all 3 subjects in this 3 repeat 40 µg dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) after 3 injections, escalation to the next dose cohort will be initiated. If a DLT is 
observed in 1 subject  in this 3 repeat  40 µg dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If  2 
or more subjects in this 3 repeat 40 µg dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that a fewer number of repeat administrations, or a lower dose at each administration should be investigated.  
One day after the last subject  in the 3 repeat 40 µg dose group completes  treatment,  the study  medical 
monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and identify the maximum feasible dose for continued evaluation in the repeat dose phase of the study. After review 
and confirmation that the data support proceeding, an 80 µg single dose repeat laser regimen will be 
initiated. Three subjects will receive intravitreal administration of 80 µg of Light- activated AU -011 
administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µL (not more than 2 hours apart) followed by two 689

nm laser  applications  30 minutes  (± 10  minutes)  apart,  with the first of  the 2 laser  applications 
occurring 6 to 8 hours after the second injection. 
If all 3 subjects in this 80 µg single dose followed by 2 laser applications dose group complete 
treatment  without any dose limiting  toxicity  (DLT),  then the study may progress  to the next cohort. If 
a DLT is observed in 1 subject in this 2 repeat laser applications following 80 µg single dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in this 2 repeat laser applications following 80 µg single dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that a 
lower dose followed by repeat laser regimen, or a repeat dose followed by single laser application 
should be investigated further.  
One day after the last subject in the 2 repeat laser applications following 80 µg single dose group completes  treatment,  the study  medical  monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review  safety 
data for all subjects and identify whether  it is safe to evaluate repeat  laser  applications after each of 3 
repeat doses of 80 µg in the study. 
After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding to the 3 repeat 80 µg dose regimen 
followed by a single laser application, 3 subjects will receive an intravitreal administration of 80 µg  
of Light- activated AU -011 administered as 2 injections of µg in µL (not more than 2 hours 
apart)  as 3 repeat  doses one week  apart.  Each  administration  is followed  6 to 8 hours  (after  the second 
injection) later by exposure to 689 nm laser light.  
One day after the last subject  in the 3 repeat  80 µg dose group followed by a single laser  application 
completes treatment, and 4 weeks after the last subject in the 80 µg single dose followed by 2 laser applications dose group complete treatment, the study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all  subjects and identify whether  it is safe to  evaluate 3 repeat 
doses of 80 µg, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications, in the next cohort of the study. 
After  review  and confirmation  that the data support proceeding to repeat  laser applications after each 
of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, 3 subjects will receive an intravitreal administration of 80 µg of Light- 
activated AU -011 administered as 2 injections of  µg in µL (not more than 2 hours apart) as 3 
repeat  doses one week  apart.  Each  administration  is followed  6 to 8 hours (after  the second injection) 
later by 2 exposures to 689 nm laser light 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) apart. 
If all 3 subjects in this group, who receive 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser 
applications, complete treatment and have been followed for 4 weeks without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after 3 weekly administrations, then this dose and regimen will be considered the maximum  feasible  dose and investigated in the expanded cohort. If  a DLT  is observed  in 1 subject in 
this 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications group, this group will be expanded to 6 
subjects. If 2 or more subjects in this 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications group 
experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that a fewer number  
of repeat  administrations  of either  Light -activated  AU-011 or laser,  or both, or a lower  dose  of Light - 
activated AU -011 at each administration should be investigated further. 
Four weeks after the final treatment of the final subject in this cohort, a review of the safety data (including EDI-OCT)  by the study medical  monitor  and independent ocular  oncologist will occur. If 
safety is confirmed, the 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications will be considered the maximum feasible and tolerated dose and this regimen will be expanded by up to 12 additional subjects in Cohort 9.

Efficacy  will be assessed  at all study  visits  from  Week  12 onwards. 
Repeat Cycle and Observation Cohorts 
Once the last subject in the expansion cohort has been enrolled and safety of the maximum safe and 
feasible dose is confirmed, approximately 6 additional subjects, who fulfil the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of CM,  but without  documented  growth, will be enrolled  into an observation cohort (Cohort 
10). These subjects will be assessed every 3 months (ie, 90 day (+/ - 7 days) intervals from the 
Screening Visit) until tumor growth of the CM lesion is established (as defined in Section 8.3.4.) and 
at which time will then receive treatment with AU -011, as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 
repeat laser applications and move to the same visit schedule as subjects entering the trial and receiving treatment with AU -011 immediately. These subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 
administered as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be 
administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation has resolved or is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as outlined in section 8.2.2 
and the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual. 
In addition, approximately 6 additional subjects, who meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of CM, with or without documented growth, will enter  Cohort 11 and receive  two cycles  of AU-011 treatment 
(each cycle will be comprised of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications). Cycle 2 of AU-011 will be administered as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications no earlier than  the Week  12 Visit and  after resolution  of any inflammation  resulting from 
the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation has resolved or is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as 
outlined in section 8.2.2  
and the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual. 
The intention is to alternate the enrollment of Cohorts 10 and 11. If during the enrollment of these 
subjects, a subject has just been enrolled into Cohort 11 and a subject with documented growth 
presents, then that subject may instead be enrolled into Cohort 11 rather than Cohort 10 for which 
they would  not be eligible  due to the presence of documented  growth and instead  will be assigned  to 
receive the first of 2 cycles of AU -011. 
If 2 subjects  experience a DLT  during treatment with Cycle  2, as defined in  Section  8.4.1., then no 
further subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU -011 until discussed with the independent ocular 
oncologist and medical monitor and continuation of enrollment is confirmed. 
Subjects w ith  Documented  Growth  
Enrollment in Cohorts 10 and 11 was closed following approval of protocol revision 11 (Rev-11) at each site. An additional cohort, Cohort 12, of subjects with minimum defined levels of documented growth will be initiated  to allow  assessment of  safety and efficacy  of 2 cycles of AU -011 treatment in 
this key subgroup of subjects with CM. Since  Cohort 12 has the same  dose as Cohort 11 no additional 
safety review will be required prior to initiating this cohort.

Up to 15 subjects, who meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of CM with documented growth as 
defined in Inclusion Criteria 5C, will enter Cohort 12 and receive two cycles of AU-011 treatment 
(each cycle will be comprised of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications). Cycle 2 of AU-011 will be administered as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications no earlier  than the Week  12 Visit  and after resolution of any inflammation  resulting  from 
the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 shoul d be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation has resolved or is 
minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as 
outlined in 
section 8.2.2  and the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual. 
If 2 subjects experience a DLT  during treatment  with  Cycle  2, as defined  in Section  8.4.1., then no 
further subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU -011 until discussed with the independent ocular 
oncologist and medical monitor and continuation of enrollment is confirmed. 
Study  Methods:  
Subjects will be screened for enrollment into the study after providing written informed consent 
between Day -28 and Day 1. Screening procedures include medical history, ophthalmic assessments, vital signs, and safety laboratory analyses. To be eligible for enrollment, subjects will have a small 
CM of ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 3.0 mm in thickness
, and largest  basal  diameter  ≤ 13.0 mm, OR tumor thickness  of 
≥ 1.2 and ≤ 3.0 mm with  documented growth and largest  basal  diameter  ≤ 13.0 mm. To be eligible  for 
enrollment in Cohort 12, subjects will have clinically diagnosed primary CM with  tumor thickness of  
≥ 0.5 mm and ≤ 3.0 mm on B -scan ultrasound, a largest basal diameter of ≤ 13.0 mm on fundus 
photos with an estimated  tumor  volume  ≤50 mm3 associated  with documented tumor  growth, defined 
as ≥ 0.4 mm based on intersite measurements (clinical site and referring center) or ≥ 0.3 mm based 
on within site measurements on tumor thickness within 2 years of screening. 
Qualified subjects will be enrolled into one of twelve cohorts and treated as described above. Each 
subject in the first 3 cohorts and in cohort 6 will receive a single IVT treatment with Light- activated 
AU-011, subjects in Cohort 4 will receive 2 repeat doses, and subjects in Cohorts 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 
and 12 will receive 3 repeat doses. After administration of Light -activated AU -011, the CM is 
exposed to 689 nm laser light. Subjects in Cohorts 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will receive 2 laser applications 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) apart at 6 to 8 hours after each intravitreal administration (after the second injection for these 80 µg cohorts), while the remaining cohorts will receive a single 
laser application at 6 to 8 hours after each intravitreal administration (after the second injection in the 80 µg cohorts). In addition, Cohorts 10, 11 and 12 will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 at the same dose and regimen  no earlier  than the Week  12 Visit  and after resolution of any inflammation  resulting  from 
the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation has resolved or is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as 
outlined in section 8.2.2  
and the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual. 
If subjects are discharged during daylight hours, appropriate  sun protection, e.g., sunglasses  and a hat, 
will be required.  
Study subjects will be required to return for ocular assessments 24 hours (± 4 hours) following 
intravitreal  administration  of study  drug and on Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Week  6, Week  8, Week  12,

Week 26, Week 39, Week 52, Week 78, and Week 104. In addition, subjects in both the 2 and 3 
repeat Light- activated AU -011 administration cohorts will have an additional safety visit on Day 9. 
Subjects in the 3 repeat Light- activated AU -011 administration cohorts will have an additional safety 
visit at Day  16. Subjects  in the observation cohort (Cohort 10) will be seen every  3 months (ie,  90 day 
(+/- 7 days) intervals from the Screening Visit) until tumor growth is established and then seen at the 
schedule described in Section 10 and Appendix 1 until the time of receiving Cycle 2, when they will 
then follow the schedule described in Appendix 4. Subjects in the observation cohort in whom tumor 
growth is not observed during the 2 year study period will exit the study at Week 104. Subjects in the 
repeat cycle of AU -011 cohorts (Cohorts 11 and 12) will also follow the schedule described in 
Section 10  and Appendix 1 until the time they receive the second cycle of AU-011, when they will 
then follow the schedule described in Appendix 4. 
If the second cycle of AU -011 occurs after Visit 15 (Week 78), subjects will be followed for 26 
weeks post -treatment and then may be rolled into the long- term follow -up study pending subject 
consent.  Details  regarding the follow -up visit schedule after the second cycle of AU-011 can be found 
in Appendix 4 . 
All subjects’  study participation  will be for a minimum of  2 years  and all  subjects in  this study may 
then be rolled into the long -term follow -up study pending consent. 
Ocular  assessments include:  
• Best Corrected  Visual  Acuity  (BCVA)  
• Slit lamp  biomicroscopy  
• Intraocular pressure (IOP)  
• Fundoscopy 
• Color fundus photography (fundus photos)  
• Fluorescein  angiography (FA) 
• B-scan ultrasound (B-scan)  
• A-scan ultrasound (A-scan)  as a separate  sub-study at sites with diagnostic  probes  
• Enhanced depth  imaging  optical coherence tomography (EDI -OCT)  
• Optical coherence tomography angiography  (OCTA) as  a separate  sub- study  at sites with 
OCTA imaging systems for Cohorts 6 through 9 
• Visual  field 
• Tumor size will be evaluated  during the study.  
• Hematology, serum  chemistry  and anti-drug antibodies (ADA)  
• Concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) will be reviewed through 30 days following the study treatment. After 30 days, for Cohorts 1 to 9, only AEs or SAEs determined  by the Investigator to be related  to study product and/or study procedures  are to 
be reported. For Cohort 10, 11 and 12 subjects concomitant medications and all adverse events will be reviewed through their last study visit.

8. Have  a tumor  for which  the entire  extent  must  be able to be imaged  on required  fundus 
photography in a single frame and treated by the laser. 
9. If female and capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have pregnancy testing performed at 
screening (must be negative) and if required at Visit 2 (must be negative); must not be lactating; and must agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control before administration of the investigational product and for three months after administration of the investigational product.  Women  considered capable of becoming pregnant  include all females 
who have experienced menarche and have not experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than 12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful 
surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy). 
10. For women of childbearing potential and for males with sexual partners of childbearing potential:  Acceptable forms  of birth  control  are spermicide with barrier,  oral contraceptive, 
injectable or implantable method of contraception, transdermal contraceptive, intrauterine device, or surgical sterilization of partner. For non- sexually active females and males, 
abstinence will be considered an acceptable form of birth control. 
11. Be otherwise  in good general health,  with no significant or uncontrolled  medical  conditions, 
as determined by the Investigator. 
12. Be able and willing  to avoid  all prohibited  medications for the appropriate washout  period.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects must  not: 
1. Have  known contraindications or sensitivities  to IRDye®700DX phthalocyanine- based  dye, or 
laser in the study eye.  
2. Have  any ocular  condition in the study eye that, in the Investigator’s opinion, could affect  the 
subject's safety or trial parameters.  
3. Have  a CM that invades or encompasses the optic  nerve that precludes treatment,  as 
determined by the investigator and/or shows extraocular extension. 
4. Have  metastatic  disease confirmed  by abdominal and chest  imaging  within  three  months prior 
to screening. 
5. Have  undergone vitrectomy  at any time or have  undergone any ocular surgical  intervention in 
the study eye within three months before Visit 1, or are planning/will require ocular surgery in the study eye prior to the study drug administration. If the subject is likely to require cataract surgery  in the study eye at any time prior to the Week 104 visit, he/she  should not be 
enrolled.  
6. Have  a history  of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,  diabetic retinopathy, or other  active 
retinal disease in the study eye unrelated to the CM.  
7. Have  any active  ocular  disease in the study  eye (other than CM) that may progress during the 
study and result in a change in vision or loss in vision (e.g., clinically significant corneal 
dystrophies, keratoconus, glaucoma or clinically significant retinal or macular disease).  
8. Have  an active  ocular  infection  (bacterial,  viral or fungal).

9. Use or require  use of heparin  or low molecular  weight  heparins  within  one week  of treatment.  
10. Use or require use of immunosuppressive or antineoplastic  medications  within  five half-lives 
of Visit 1. Steroids, including inhalation steroids, are permitted. 
11. Have  previously received  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  vaccination.  
12. Any active malignancies other than CM, or squamous or basal cell skin cancer. If there is 
evidence of clinical  remission  for at least one year,  the subject’s eligibility  may be discussed 
with the medical monitor.  
13. Have  any significant illness  (e.g., an uncontrolled  autoimmune disease,  severe cardiovascular 
disease [confirmed by a cardiologist], active infection, etc.) that the Investigator determines could interfere with study participation or safety, or put the subject at any unnecessary risk. 
14. Have  planned or will require systemic surgery  during the active study  treatment  period.  
15. Have  used an investigational drug or medical  device within  30 days or 5 half-lives of Visit 1 
or be concurrently enrolled in another investigational product trial. 
Additional  Therapy  with  AU-011 
Subjects may receive additional therapy with AU-011 at the maximum tolerated and feasible dose 
which is 3 repeat doses of 80 µg each followed by two laser applications (treatment regimen) as outlined in Section  8.3.3 of the protocol.  Also,  as outlined  in Section  8.2.2 and the Injection and Laser 
Procedure Manual, if the fovea is near the  tumor  edge, an adjustment to  the laser procedure  should be 
performed on each treatment day. 
Investigational product,  dosage and mode  of administration:  
The investigational treatment  is Light -activated  AU-011, a combination product consisting of a drug 
(AU-011) and a laser (Aura Photoactivation System) that delivers 689 nm light to activate the drug once it is bound to the tumor cells. AU-011 drug substance is a modified human papillomavirus- derived, empty viral like particle (VLP) conjugated to approximately 200 molecules of a phthalocyanine-based photosensitizer IRDye
®700DX (the “Dye”). 
AU-011 is administered  by intravitreal  injection.  Laser  light (689 nm) is applied  to the CM  from 
6 hours to 8 hours after administration. 
Statistical  Methods:  
Since this is an open -label, exploratory study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed. 
Efficacy will be assessed at the Week 12, 26, 39, 52, 78 and 104 visits for any potential tumor response  and changes in  ETDRS  best corrected  visual acuity  (BCVA).  This  will include change from 
baseline at each visit in tumor thickness by ultrasound and largest basal diameter by digital fundus photography. The proportion of subjects who meet the definition of stable disease (do not meet the definition of disease progression) will  also be reported  for each  visit using change  in tumor thickness 
and changes in largest basal diameter. Change from baseline in ETDRS BCVA letter score at Week 12 and at each  subsequent  visit and the proportion of subjects who lose or gain 5, 10 or 15 letters will 
also be evaluated.

Exploratory analyses will be performed for change in internal reflectivity of tumors by A -scan 
ultrasound at each visit and macular  changes (foveal  avascular  zone  and capillary  density) by OCTA 
at each visit.  
Background and demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized  by descriptive  statistics (sample  size, mean,  standard deviation, median,  minimum and 
maximum).  Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  
Efficacy  and safety  will be analyzed  at various intervals  after the first 2 cohorts have completed  12 
months of follow -up and then at further intervals as subsequent cohorts reach similar milestones. 
Specific details of the timing of such analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Uveal  Melanoma  
The most common primary malignancy of the eye is uveal melanoma (UM)., or more precisely, 
choroidal melanoma (CM) ( Bell 2004) . The neoplasm is most commonly manifested in the 
choroid (90% of cases) followed by the ciliary body (7%), or iris (2%). It is more common in Caucasian  adults of northern  European descent,  who have blue or green  eyes  and fair skin with a 
tendency to sunburn, though a definitive link between sun exposures and UM has not been proven ( Shields 2014) . There are some who believe that blue-eyed persons with extensive sun 
exposure have higher risk for melanoma ( Schmidt-Pokrzywniak 2009) . Nevi on the skin have 
been shown to have an association with increased risk for development of CM ( Shah 2005;  
Singh 2012;  Weis 2009). The condition rarely appears in pediatric populations ( Shields 2012).  
Intraocular tumors present with general visual symptoms, but some patients are asymptomatic 
with tumors detected as an incidental finding on routine ophthalmologic examination. Visual 
symptoms include persistent photopsia, floaters, visual field loss, or visual acuity loss (Shields  
2014) . Diagnosis is based on fundoscopic examination by an experienced clinician using 
noninvasive testing techniques such as ultrasound, fluorescein angiography (FA) and ocular 
coherence tomography (OCT). This trial will utilize enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) which is more sensitive in assessing disease findings in choroidal melanoma than standard spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT). CM is 
believed to result from transformation of benign choroidal nevi or develop as a de novo malignancy. Though early detection can be challenging, there are clinical features that suggest a lesion  is “at-risk”  for transforming  into melanoma  and these include lesion  thickness over 2 mm, 
presence of orange pigment, ≤ 3 mm distance from the optic nerve, subretinal fluid 
accumulation, hollowness on ultrasound, and absence of halo (Shields 2014)
. Poor prognosis 
depends on several  clinical factors  including large  tumor size, involvement with the ciliary  body, 
increased age, and extraocular extension.  
Because CM is less prevalent than other cancers, is often asymptomatic in early phases, and is 
slow-growing, detection and prompt diagnosis have complicated treatment studies. In the absence of new therapies and efficacy trials, historical treatment focused on local control of tumor growth, most often through radiation treatments (both plaque brachytherapy and proton beam radiotherapy) or a surgery called enucleation (complete removal of the affected globe). Even with radical treatment such as enucleation; however, metastatic growth – most often and always fatally to the liver – has been widely reported ( Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study 
Group [COMS] 2004;  Bishop 2014) .The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study ( COMS 1998), 
w
hich recruited 3,217 patients with primary ciliary body or choroidal melanoma in the US from 
1987 to 1998, was commissioned to address  the paucity of data regarding prospective evaluation 
of CM treatment, and it has subsequently produced a large body of data regarding CM. This 3- arm study included two multicenter randomized clinical trials. One arm compared the effectiveness of brachytherapy (also known as plaque brachytherapy, plaque radiotherapy or simply,  plaque) to  enucleation  for treatment  of medium- size (>2.5 mm to <10.00 mm)  choroidal 
melanomas. The second arm compared the effectiveness of enucleation with and without preoperative external -beam  radiotherapy for large choroidal  melanomas (>10.00 mm).  The third 
arm was an observational study of small (<2.5 mm) choroidal melanomas.

 Cumulative  rates  of metastases  at 5 and 10 years  after treatment  have been  reported  at 25% and 
34%, respectively ( COMS 2005). The most frequently reported sites of metastases include the 
liver (90%), lungs (24%), and bone (16%) ( COMS 2001a ; COMS 2004). Patients with 
metastases that do not involve the liver have longer survival (19–28 months) ( Eskelin 2000).  
The median  survival for a patient  with hepatic metastasis  is 6 months (estimated  survival of 15– 
20% at 1 year; 10% at 2 years), irrespective of treatment ( Bedikian 2006; COMS 2005). 
Asymptomatic  patients  at the time of diagnosis of metastases  have a slightly  longer survival in 
relation to symptomatic patients ( Kim 2010).  
COMS provides excellent historical control data for melanoma treatments, and has refined 
standard CM treatment protocols. For example, COMS showed no difference in 5- or 10- year 
mortality for large - and medium -sized UMs whether treated with plaque brachytherapy or 
enucleation ( COMS 2001b); nor was there improved survival with preoperative radiation for 
large choroidal melanomas. Consequently, plaque has remained the standard of care treatment, while  enucleation  is reserved  for patients  with the most symptomatic  and recurrent CM.  The data 
also steer the direction of optimal treatment to secondary outcomes, such as preservation of visual acuity, instead of solely focusing on mortality and tumor growth. 
It is hypothesized that since Light- activated  AU-011 treatment  is both potent and highly targeted 
to the tumor that healthy ocular tissues will be preserved. 
 
4.2. Existing Therapies  for Choroidal Melanoma  
CM is commonly treated according to size (or thickness) of the neoplasm (small ≤ 2.4 mm, 
medium = 2.5-10 mm, and large > 10 mm according to thickness as measured by ultrasound), documented growth rate, and location ( COMS 2004b; Shields 2014). Currently, the most 
widely used first line treatment options are radiation therapy and enucleation. Management of small suspicious nevi that are at high risk of evolving into CM and small neoplasms is not 
standardized.  Depending on a number of clinical  judgment factors,  including patient  choice and 
rate of tumor growth, the patient may be treated immediately or followed further before being 
treated.  
There are two main types of radiation therapy: plaque brachytherapy (using iodine-125, 
ruthenium-106, or palladium-103) and external  beam  radiation  therapy  applied  as proton beam 
radiotherapy ( Laver  2010 ). Both of these radiation -based  therapies  require surgical  procedures. 
In plaque brachytherapy, surgery is required to place the plaque, and in proton beam radiotherapy, surgery is required to enable localization of the tumor. In addition, radiation therapy lacks tumor tissue specificity.  As such, it is usually accompanied by irreversible 
radiation damage to the retina and other ocular structures and results in up to a 6 line or more vision loss at 24 months (COMS 2001c ; Bianciotto 2010). In 4% of cases, enucleation is 
performed after radiation therapy due to blindness, painful eyes or uncontrolled tumor growth (COMS 2001c). 
Alternatives to radiation therapy that are not standard of care but have been explored include 
t
ranspupillary thermotherapy and photodynamic therapy. These therapies are not targeted and 
may offer limited benefit or may be appropriate for only a subset of patients (e.g., amelanotic 
tumors),  and are not without risks,  such as retinal  bleeding or vision loss shortly  after treatment

 (Shields 2002; Pereira 2013).  Larger  scale tumors cannot be treated  by radiation  therapies and 
require enucleation. 
4.3. Viruses as Anti -Cancer Agents  
The use of viruses as anti-cancer agents has been considered for many years. Initially, the use of 
viruses in cancer therapy has been towards cancer cell lysis, as many viruses undergo a lytic 
phase in their life cycle. For instance, the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 is an oncolytic virus that has been developed for anti- cancer therapy as talimogene laherparepvec (T -VEC; Imlygic
®) 
(Andtbacka 2013), and the FDA has approved T- VEC for the local treatment of unresectable 
cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery, based on results from the Phase III OPTiM study (Andtbacka 2013, Broderick 2015). It utilizes the property of tumor lysis as a result of viral replication within the tumor as its mechanism of action. Other similar therapies based on other oncolytic virus types (Reovirus, Vaccinia virus) are also in clinical trials ( Alemany 2013; Vacchelli 2013 ). However, the 
limitation of oncolytic virus based anti-cancer therapy is that of tumor targeting, and as such, T- VEC  must be administered  by direct  intra-lesional  injection.  Additionally, the tumor cytotoxicity 
is dependent upon the active replication of the viral agent within the tumor, which may limit its efficacy and increase the risk of toxicity after multiple administrations.  
A novel approach to anti- cancer therapy is the use of viral like particles  or pseudo- viruses as 
drug delivery vehicles for targeted therapy. The use of these novel viral-derived structures 
presents  advantages  over using full replicating  viruses.  VLPs  and pseudo-viruses are comprised 
of the outer protein capsid of a virus without any of its genetic material and can be used to deliver drugs efficiently to tumors without relying on viral replication and as such, overcomes the limitations of oncolytic technologies. 
In particular, the papillomavirus (PV) has a simple two protein outer shell structure that self - 
assembles into 55 nM VLPs without incorporating the viral genome. Papillomaviruses have a 
unique tropism towards cancer  cells that is mediated  by the binding of the viral capsid  to specific 
modifications of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of the cancer cell (Handisurya 2012 ). 
In a number of nonclinical studies, it has been found that PV can bind cancer cells with high 
selectivity both in vitro and in vivo through a mechanism of action that involves the initial 
binding to HSPGs on the tumor cell membrane as well as the basement membrane (Handisurya  
2012). HSPGs interact with many proteins, playing a role in cell signaling via growth factors and chemokines  modulating cell growth, motility,  adhesion and differentiation. Up-regulation of 
HSPGs can be found on tumors, which can lead to unregulated autocrine signaling loops promoting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis ( Blackhall 2001;  Perrimon 2000; Schlessinger 2000; 
Yu 2002) . 
4.4. Light  Activated  AU-011 for the Treatment  of Choroidal Melanoma  
Though several  treatment  options exist  for CM, no treatment  both reliably  controls tumor growth 
and preserves vision. Since Light- activated AU -011 therapy is extremely potent and highly 
targeted to the tumor itself, this therapy has great potential to preserve healthy ocular tissues. 
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  24  
 The investigational treatment is Light- activated AU -011, a combination product consisting of a 
drug (AU-011) and a laser (Aura Photoactivation System) that delivers 689 nm light to activate 
the drug once it is bound to the tumor cells. AU-011 drug substance is a modified human papillomavirus-derived, empty  viral like particle  conjugated to approximately 200 molecules  of 
a phthalocyanine-based photosensitizer IRDye
® 700DX (the “Dye”). 
Figure 1 Structure of AU- 011 
 
The VLP is composed of two modified viral capsid proteins that self-assemble into an empty proteinaceous sphere of approximately 55 nM in diameter. Each VLP comprises 72 capsomeres, which  are made of ~5 molecules  of viral capsid  protein L1 and ~1 molecule  of capsid  protein L2. 
The native amino acid sequence of the L1 protein FG loop which harbors the major epitopes for immune recognition has been altered to minimize an immunogenic response ( Fleury 2014).  
The Dye molecule is a phthalocyanine that is derivatized with hydrophilic chains for aqueous application on one end and with a labile succinimido group on the other. The labile succinimido moiety covalently cross-links to proteins via the primary amine of lysyl residues. An aliphatic chain  acts as a spacer  to relieve steric  hindrance between  the protein and the phthalocyanine core 
for subsequent activation with light at 689 nm. Upon light activation at 689 nm, the phthalocyanine core acts as a photosensitizer. When targeted to the CM via the AU-011 VLP component, the photosensitizer activity  of the Dye results  in the selective cell necrosis  of the CM 
tumor cells while sparing healthy cells ( Mitsunaga 2012, Kines 2018). A second laser 
application will also be investigated in this study to ensure that maximum tumor cell necrosis occurs with each administration of Light- activated AU -011. This will ensure selection of the 
maximum feasible dose in terms of drug dose, number of treatments and number of laser applications.  
4.5. Nonclinical  Studies  of AU-011 
The nonclinical program for AU-011 consists of pharmacology (pharmacodynamic), 
pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies. The results of these studies support the clinical development of Light- activated  AU-011 for the treatment of primary  CM. Refer  to the IB  for 
additional information.

 4.5.1. Pharmacodynamic Studies  
In vitro  and in vivo pharmacology or pharmacodynamic studies with AU-011 were undertaken to 
demonstrate the following attributes of AU -011: 
• AU-011 binding to ocular  melanoma  cells and the dependence of this binding on the 
interaction of AU-011 with HSPGs on the tumor cell surface. 
• AU-011 killing  of uveal  tumor cells as a function of AU-011 concentration  or dose 
and the amount of light delivered. 
• Additionally, efficacy  in orthotopic xenograft, animal  models of UM after systemic 
and IVT administration of AU-011. 
Additional information  on the AU-011 pharmacodynamic studies conducted to date is provided 
in the IB. 
 
4.5.2. Pharmacokinetics  
After IVT administration in a rabbit orthotopic xenograft model of UM, AU-011 was able to 
penetrate the tumor and was evenly distributed throughout the tumor. Studies in a rabbit orthotopic xenograft model demonstrated  that detectable and quantifiable AU-011 concentrations 
were seen in tumor tissue at 30 minutes and 8 hours and less so at 16 and 24 hours. 
In separate studies in naïve rabbits, AU-011 was readily detectable in the vitreous and 
retina/choroid samples at 24 hours after IVT injection, and at 96 hours, AU-011 vitreous and retina/choroid concentrations were  no longer detectable.  No detectable concentrations of AU-011 
were found in the lens, and results  showed that  the systemic  concentrations  of AU-011 were near 
or below the limit of detection.  
4.5.3. Toxicology  
AU-011 was administered as a single dose via IVT injection at doses of 5, 20, or 40 µg/eye 
followed by laser  photoactivation to dogs; after dosing, animals  were observed for 7 days (Study 
Day 8, terminal sacrifice) or 35 days (Study Day 29, recovery sacrifice) to assess the 
reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of effects (AU -TOX-020). No AU-011- related 
organ weight, macroscopic, or microscopic findings occurred at any of the doses and the No- Observable-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) was considered to be 40 µg/eye of AU-011 
delivered as a single IVT dose with a corresponding laser treatment of 50 J/cm
2. 
Additional information  on the AU-011 toxicology studies conducted to date is provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
 
4.6. Rationale  for the Phase  1b/2 Clinical  Trial  of Light -Activated  AU- 
011 in Choroidal Melanoma  
Light- activated AU -011 is being developed for the treatment of primary CM. This treatment is 
designed as a targeted  tumor  killing  agent  that has the potential to preserve healthy ocular tissues 
while controlling the tumor. This mechanism of action addresses a significant unmet medical need in patients with CM where vision loss is a common side effect of current therapies. If AU- 
011 treatment controls tumor growth successfully without the concomitant loss of vision associated with radiotherapy or complete loss of vision following enucleation, earlier treatment 
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  26  
 of CM may become the standard of care for these patients. Because AU -011 specifically targets 
tumor cells, the response of tumors after treatment may be different than that following plaque 
radiotherapy, which is less selective and will cause death, not only to the melanoma tumor cells, but also the benign choroidal nevus cells, the vascular cells and even the sclera within the treatment area. The number of malignant tumor cells versus benign nevus cells in small melanomas is currently unknown. Some clinical trials ( Singh 2005) presume that all melanomas 
arise from transdifferentiated nevi whereas others presume a portion of these lesions will occur spontaneously or ‘ de novo.’ Despite the possibility of a different tumor response with a targeted 
therapy like AU-011 versus radioactivity, all tumors being treated with AU-011 should meet the 
definition  of stable  disease as a result  of the selective necrosis of the tumor cell  component of the 
lesion.  
The first expansion cohort (Cohort 9) is designed to establish  the preliminary  efficacy  of AU-011 
delivered at the highest dose that is safe and well tolerated from the escalation phase of the trial. 
Cohort 10 is designed to provide estimates of growth rates in observation subjects and Cohort 11 is designed to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of administering two 3- week treatment 
cycles of AU -011. Cohort 12 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AU-011 in 
subjects with documented growth who are similar to the planned Phase 3 population.

6.1. Overall Study Design
Study Design:
This is an open-label, ascending single and repeat dose and cycle, multicenter study, designed to 
evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Light- activated AU -011 at 3 dose levels and 
single and 2 repeat dose regimens and cycles of Light- activated AU -011 and up to two laser 
applications in approximately 60 subjects with primary CM. The dose escalation  design is  shown 
in the figure below. Safety assessments will take place at all study visits and the efficacy assessments will commence at the Week 12 visit.
Figure 2 Dose  Escalation Schematic
*Alternating enrollment; enrollment inCohorts 10 and11 closed following approval of protocol revision 11(Rev - 
11) at each site and subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 12.
Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Cohorts
Three subjects willreceive a single IVT injection  of Light- activated AU-011 low dose (20µg in 
50 µL). Theinjection is  followed 6 to 8 hours later  by exposure to  689 nm laser light. Nomore 
than one subject may be treated per day, and the treated subject must complete his/her 24-hour 
post-treatment visit with no safety issues before the next subject in a given cohort may be 
treated.
If all 3 subjects in the low dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT), escalation to the medium dose level (40 µg in µL) group will be initiated. If a DLT
is observed in 1 subject in the low dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. Dose escalation will not be allowed if 2 or more subjects in the low dose group experience a treatment - 
related DLT. Instead, if 2 or more subjects in the low dose group experience a treatment- related 
DLT, dose reduction to 10 µg in µL may be considered for enrolling an additional 3 subjects.

 One week after the last subject in the low dose group completes treatment, the study medical 
monitor and independent ocular  oncologist will review  safety  data for all  subjects  in the low dose 
group. After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding to treatment with the medium dose group, three subjects  will receive a single IVT injection  of Light- activated  AU-011 
medium dose (40 µg in µL). The injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. If all 3 subjects in the medium dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), escalation to the high dose level group will be initiated. If a DLT is observed in 1 subject in the medium dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in the medium dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will 
confirm that the low dose level is the maximum feasible dose (due to formulation limits).  
One week  after  the last subject  in the medium dose group completes  treatment,  the study medical 
monitor and an independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects in the 
medium dose group. After  review and  confirmation  that the data support proceeding to  treatment 
with the high dose group, three subjects will receive a single dose of Light- activated AU -011 
high dose (80 µg administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µL not more  than two hours apart). 
The second injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. If a DLT is 
observed in 1 subject in the high dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in the high dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that the medium dose level  is the maximum feasible dose and the dose chosen  for the repeat  dose 
phase of the study will drop to one dose below the maximum feasible dose of 40 µg and the lower dose of 20 µg will be given as repeat doses. 
Multiple  
Ascending Dose  (MAD) Cohorts  
One day after the last subject  in the high dose group completes  treatment,  the study medical 
monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and 
recommend proceeding to the repeat dose phase of the study. 
After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding to repeat dose regimens, 3 
subjects will receive an intravitreal injection of 40 µg in  µL of Light- activated  AU-011 as 2 
repeat doses 1 week apart. Each injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm laser light.  
If all 3 subjects in this 2 repeat 40 µg dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) after 2 injections, then this regimen may be investigated further in subsequent 
studies. If a DLT is observed in 1 subject in this 2 repeat 40 µg dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If 2 or more  subjects  in this 2 repeat  40 µg dose group experience a DLT 
after their treatment, this will confirm that a lower repeat dose regimen should be investigated.  
One day after the last subject in the 2 repeat 40 µg dose group completes treatment, the study medical  monitor and independent ocular  oncologist will review  safety  data for all subjects  and 
identify whether it is safe to evaluate 3 repeat 40 µg doses in the next cohort of the study. 
After  review  and confirmation that the data support proceeding to 3 repeat  40 µg dose regimen,  3 
subjects will receive an intravitreal injection of 40 µg in  µL of Light- activated AU -011 as 3 
repeat doses 1 week apart. Each injection is followed 6 to 8 hours later by exposure to 689 nm 
laser light.

 If all 3 subjects in this 3 repeat 40 µg dose group complete treatment without any dose limiting 
toxicity  (DLT)  after 3 injections, escalation  to the next dose cohort will be initiated.  If 2 or more 
subjects in this 3 repeat 40 µg dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will 
confirm that a fewer number of repeat administrations, or a lower dose at each administration  should be investigated.  
One day after the last subject in the 3 repeat 40 µg dose group completes treatment, the study 
medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and identify the maximum feasible dose for continued evaluation in the repeat dose phase of the study. After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding, an 80 µg single dose 
repeat  laser  regimen  will be initiated.  Three subjects will receive intravitreal  administration  of 80 
µg of Light- activated AU -011 administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µL (not more than 2 
hours apart)  followed by two 689 nm laser  applications 30 minutes  (± 10 minutes) apart,  with the 
first of the 2 laser applications occurring 6 to 8 hours after the second injection. 
If all 3 subjects in this 80 µg single dose followed by 2 laser applications dose group complete 
treatment without any dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then the study may progress to the next cohort. If  a DLT  is observed in 1 subject  in this 2 repeat laser  applications following 80 µg single 
dose group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in this 2 repeat laser applications following 80 µg single dose group experience a DLT after their treatment, this will confirm that a lower dose followed by repeat laser regimen, or a repeat dose followed by single laser application, should be investigated further. 
One day after the last subject  in the 2 repeat  laser  applications following 80 µg single dose group 
completes treatment, the study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review 
safety data for all subjects and identify whether it is safe to evaluate repeat laser applications after each of 3 repeat doses of 80 µg in the study. 
After review and confirmation that the data support proceeding to the 3 repeat 80 µg dose 
regimen followed by a single laser application, 3 subjects will receive an intravitreal 
administration  of 80 µg of Light- activated  AU-011 administered  as 2 injections  of 40 µg in 
µL (not more than 2 hours apart) as 3 repeat doses one week apart. Each administration is followed 6 to 8 hours (after the second injection) later by exposure to 689 nm laser light. 
One day after the last subject in the 3 repeat 80 µg dose group, followed by a single laser 
application, completes treatment and 4 weeks after the last subject in the 80 µg single dose followed by 2 laser applications dose group complete treatment, the study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review safety data for all subjects and identify whether it is safe to evaluate 3 repeat  doses of 80 µg, each followed by 2 repeat  laser  applications,  in the next 
cohort of the study. 
After  review  and confirmation  that the data support proceeding to repeat  laser  applications after 
each of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, 3 subjects will receive an intravitreal administration of 80 µg of 
Light- activated AU -011 administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µL (not more  than 2 hours 
apart) as 3 repeat doses one week apart. Each administration is followed 6 to 8 hours (after the second injection) later by 2 exposures to 689 nm laser light 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) apart. 
If all 3 subjects in this group, who receive 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser 
applications, complete treatment and have been followed for 4 weeks without any dose limiting 
toxicity  (DLT)  after 3 weekly  administrations,  then  this dose and  regimen  will be considered  the

 maximum feasible dose and investigated in the expanded cohort. If a DLT is observed in 1 
subject in this 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications group, this group will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects in this 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications group experience a DLT  after  their treatment,  this will confirm  that a  fewer  number 
of repeat administrations of either Light- activated AU -011 or laser, or both, or a lower dose of 
Light- activated AU -011 at each administration should be investigated further. 
Four weeks  after the final treatment  of the final subject  in this cohort, a review  of the safety  data 
(including EDI-OCT) by the study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will 
occur. If safety is confirmed, the 3 repeat 80 µg dose with 2 repeat laser applications will be considered  the maximum feasible and  tolerated  dose and this regimen  will be expanded by up to 
12 additional subjects in Cohort 9. 
Repeat  C
ycle and  Observation  Cohorts  
Once the last subject in the expansion cohort has been enrolled and safety of the maximum safe 
and feasible dose is confirmed, approximately 6 additional subjects,  who  fulfil the criteria  for the 
clinical diagnosis of CM, but without documented growth, will be enrolled into an observation cohort (Cohort 10). These subjects will be assessed every 3 months (ie, 90 day (+/- 7 days) intervals  from  the Screening  Visit)  until tumor growth of the CM lesion  is established  (as defined 
in Section 8.3.4.) and at which time will then receive treatment with AU -011, as 3 repeat 80 µg 
doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications and move to the same visit schedule as subjects entering the trial and receiving treatment with AU -011 immediately. These subjects will 
receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 administered as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser 
applications no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation has resolved or is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day 
of both cycles as outlined in section 8.2.2 and 
the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual . 
In addition, approximately 6 further subjects, who meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of 
CM, with or without documented growth, will enter  Cohort 11 and receive two  cycles  of AU-011 
treatment (each cycle will be comprised of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser 
applications). Cycle 2 of AU-011 will be administered as 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation  has resolved or is minimal and decreasing  based  on investigator judgement. If 
the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as outlined in section 8.2.2 and 
the Injection and Laser Procedure 
Manual . 
The intention  is to alternate the enrolment of Cohorts 10 and 11. If during the  enrollment of these 
subjects, a subject has just been enrolled into Cohort 11 and a subject with documented growth presents, then that subject may instead be enrolled into Cohort 11 rather than Cohort 10 for which they would not be eligible due to the presence of documented growth and instead will be assigned to receive the first of 2 cycles of AU -011.

 If 2 subjects  experience a DLT  during treatment with Cycle 2, as defined in Section  8.4.1., then 
no further subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 until discussed with the independent ocular 
oncologist and medical monitor and continuation of enrollment is confirmed. 
Subjects  w ith  Documented  Growth  
Enrollment in Cohorts 10 and 11 was closed  following  approval of protocol revision 11 (Rev -11) 
at each site.  An additional cohort, Cohort 12, of subjects with minimum defined levels of 
documented growth will be initiated to allow assessment of safety and efficacy of 2 cycles of 
AU-011 treatment in this key subgroup of subjects with CM. Since Cohort 12 has the same dose as Cohort 11 no safety review will be required. 
Up to 15 subjects, who meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of CM with documented growth 
as defined in Inclusion Criteria 5C, will enter Cohort 12 and receive two cycles of AU-011 treatment (each cycle will be comprised of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications). Cycle 2 of AU -011 will be administered  as 3 repeat  80 µg  doses,  each followed  by 
2 repeat laser applications no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation  has resolved or is minimal and decreasing  based  on investigator judgement. If 
the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on 
each treatment day of both cycles as outlined in section 8.2.2 and 
the Injection and Laser Procedure 
Manual . 
If 2 subjects  experience a DLT  during treatment with Cycle 2, as defined in Section  8.4.1., then 
no further subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 until discussed with the independent ocular 
oncologist and medical monitor and continuation of enrollment is confirmed. 
Study  Methods  
Subjects  will be screened  for enrollment into the study after providing written  informed  consent 
between Day -28 and Day 1. Screening procedures include medical history, ophthalmic 
assessments, vital signs, and safety laboratory analyses. To be eligible for study enrollment, subjects will have a small CM of ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 3.0 mm in thickness, and largest basal diameter ≤  
13.0 mm, OR tumor thickness of ≥ 1.2 and ≤ 3.0 mm with documented growth and largest basal diameter ≤ 13.0 mm. To be eligible for enrollment in Cohort 12, subjects will have clinically diagnosed primary CM with tumor thickness of ≥ 0.5 mm and ≤ 3.0 mm  on B-scan ultrasound, a 
largest basal diameter of ≤ 13.0 mm on fundus  photos with an estimated tumor volume ≤50 mm
3 
associated  with documented  tumor growth, defined  as ≥ 0.4 mm based  on intersite  measurements 
(clinical site and referring center) or ≥ 0.3 mm based on within site measurements on tumor thickness within 2 years of screening. 
Qualified subjects will be enrolled into one of the 12 Cohorts described above. Each subject in 
the first three Cohorts 1-3 and in Cohort 6 will receive a single intravitreal treatment  with Light- 
activated AU -011, subjects in Cohort 4 will receive 2 repeat doses, and  subjects in Cohorts 5, 7, 
8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will receive 3 repeat doses. After administration of Light- activated AU -011, 
the CM is exposed to 689 nm laser light. Subjects in Cohorts 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will receive 2 
laser applications 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) apart at 6 to 8 hours after each IVT administration (after the second injection for these 80 µg cohorts), while the remaining cohorts will receive a single laser  application  at 6 to 8 hours after each IVT administration  (after the second  injection  in

 the 80 µg cohorts). In addition, Cohorts 10, 11 and 12 will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 at the 
same dose and regimen no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably possible after inflammation  has resolved or is minimal and decreasing  based  on investigator judgement. If 
the fovea is near the tumor edge, an adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as outlined in section 8.2.2 and 
the Injection and Laser Procedure 
Manual . 
If subjects are discharged  during daylight hours, appropriate sun protection, e.g., sunglasses and 
a hat, will be required. 
Study subjects  will be required  to return  for an ocular examination  24 hours ± 4 hours following 
intravitreal administration, followed by 11 visits (Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Week 6, Week 8, 
Week 12, Week 26, Week 39, Week 52, Week 78, and Week 104). At these visits, subjects will 
be monitored with systemic  and ophthalmic assessments. In  addition, subjects  in both the 2 and 3 
repeat Light -activated AU -011 administration cohorts will have an additional safety visit on Day 
9. Subjects in the 3 repeat Light- activated AU -011 administration cohorts will have an 
additional safety visit at Day 16. Subjects in the observation cohort (Cohort 10) will be seen every  3 months (ie,  90 day  (+/- 7 days) intervals  from  the Screening  Visit) until tumor growth is 
established and then seen at the schedule described in Section 10 and Appendix 1 until the time of receiving  Cycle 2, when  they will then follow the schedule described  in Appendix 4. Subjects 
in the observation cohort in whom tumor growth is not observed during the 2 year study period will exit  the study at  Week  104. Subjects  in the repeat  cycle of AU-011 cohorts (Cohorts 11 and 
12) will also follow the schedule described in Section 10 and Appendix 1 until the time they receive the second cycle of AU -011, when they will then follow the schedule described in 
Appendix 4. 
If the second cycle of AU -011 occurs after Visit 15 (Week 78), subjects will be followed for 26 
weeks  post- treatment  and then may be rolled  into the long- term follow-up study pending subject 
consent. Details regarding the follow-up visit schedule after the second cycle of AU-011 can be 
found in Appendix 4.  
All subjects’  study participation  will be for a minimum of 2 years  and all  subjects  in this study 
may then be rolled into the long- term follow -up study pending consent. 
Ocular assessments including Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) by Early Treatment D
iabetic Retinopathy Study method (ETDRS), slit lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure 
(IOP), fundoscopy, color fundus photography (FP), fluorescein angiography (FA), B- scan 
ultrasound (B- scan), A -scan ultrasound (A-scan), enhanced depth imaging optical coherence 
tomography (EDI-OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and visual fields will be evaluated during the study. Phlebotomy will be performed at various time points for hematology, serum chemistry and anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) will be reviewed through 30 days following the study treatment. After 30 
days, for Cohorts 1 to 9, only AEs or SAEs determined by the Investigator to be related to study product and/or study procedures are to be reported. For Cohort 10, 11 and 12 subjects, concomitant medications  and all adverse  events  will be reviewed  through their last study visit. If 
peri-tumoral whitening/pigmentary changes are seen  during the study, additional assessments as 
outlined in Section 10.3.10 should be conducted. Further treatment (additional therapy) for CM

 will be documented throughout the study. Section  10 provides further details  on the conduct of 
the study, study visits, and assessments. 
Ocular imaging, including B- scan, A -scan, FP, FA, EDI-OCT, and OCTA will be read by a 
centralized Independent Reading Center (IRC) to provide consistency and reliability in data 
generated for each subject at each study site. At least two independent readers at the IRC will review  required  screening  B-scan images  for determination  of eligibility  and at the predefined 
time points.  
6.2. Criteria for Study  Termination  
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study at any time for any reason. If the Investigator suspends or terminates  the study at  their site, the Investigator will promptly inform  the Sponsor 
and the Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  and provide them  with a detailed  written  explanation. 
The Investigator will also return all study drug and other materials to the Sponsor as required. Upon study completion, the Investigator will provide the IRB with notice of closure.

7.3. Withdrawal of Subjects  
7.3.1. Subject  Discontinuation  
Subject  participation  is voluntary; any subject may discontinue participation  in the study without 
prejudice or may be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator or Sponsor for the following 
reasons:  
• Pregnancy  
• Intolerable toxicity  thought to  be related  to study drug  
• Subject  request  
• Inability  to comply with trial requirements  
• Conditions requiring treatment intervention not permitted  by protocol  
• Intercurrent illness  (Investigator’s discretion)  
• Non-compliance/lost to follow- up 
• D iscontinuation by Sponsor  
If the subject  wishes  to withdraw study consent, every  effort  will be made to encourage the 
subject to return to the study site for a final visit prior to withdrawing consent. 
 
7.3.2. Loss to  Follow- up 
The study sites will attempt to follow -up on subjects who do not return for scheduled study 
examinations. Sites  must make a minimum of three documented attempts  via telephone, email,  or 
regular mail to contact the subject. If the subject does not reply to any of these attempts, the site must send a letter by certified mail (with a request for notification of receipt of delivery) to the  
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011

 subject.  If a subject is non-responsive to these  follow-up attempts,  he/she will be considered  to 
be lost to follow-up and the electronic case report form (eCRF) will be updated to note lost to 
follow-up as the reason for discontinuation. 
 
7.3.3. Early  Subject  Termination  or Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects  who  discontinue from  the study early for any  reason will  be asked to  undergo Week 
104/Early Termination  assessments.  If termination  occurs  before Visit 11 (Week  12), then all 
ophthalmic assessments, including imaging should be performed on both eyes at the Early Termination Visit.  
All subjects  who discontinue from  the study early will be followed for up to 30 days after their 
last administration of study medication for the development of new AEs. 
 
7.3.4. Follow- up of Subjects  with  Adverse Events  
If any study subject has an AE at the time of completion, termination, or withdrawal, the subject should be followed until the event has resolved, returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. If in the opinion of the Investigator, the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease, the Investigator must record  his or her reasoning for this decision  in the subject’s medical  record  and 
on the eCRF.

 8. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS  
8.1. Description  of Study  Drug  
Light- activated AU -011 is a combination product consisting of a drug (AU-011) and a laser 
(Aura  Photoactivation System)  that delivers  689 nm light to activate the drug once it is bound to 
the tumor cells. AU -011 drug substance is a modified human papillomavirus-derived, empty 
viral like particle conjugated to approximately 200 molecules of a phthalocyanine- based 
photosensitizer IRDye®700DX. AU- 011 will be administered via intravitreal injection as a low 
dose (20 µg)  intravitreal injection (  µL injection), a medium dose (40 µg) per intravitreal 
injection (  µL injection), or a high dose (80 µg) per intravitreal injection ( µL 
injections with interim IOP assessment). Refer to Section 4.4. Additional information can be 
found in the IB. 
8.2. AU-011 Treatment 
8.2.1. Administration  of AU-011 
In this clinical trial, AU -011 study drug will be administered by IVT injection and will be 
followed by laser light application (689 nm) to the CM 6 to 8 hours after intravitreal administration of AU -011. The maximum concentration of the current AU-011 formulation is 
40 µg in µl and as a result,  the maximum feasible dose is 80 µg administered  as 2 injections 
of 40µg in  µl. 
Subjects in Cohorts 1 (20 µg single dose), 2 (40 µg single dose) and 3 (80 µg single administration given as 2 injections of 40 µg in  µl) will receive one treatment followed by a 
single laser application, subjects in Cohort 4 (40 µg two repeat doses) will receive 2 injections one week apart followed by a single laser application, subjects in Cohort 5 (40 µg three repeat doses) will receive 3 injections  one week  apart  followed by a single laser  application, subjects  in 
Cohort 6 (80 µg single dose followed by 2 laser applications) will receive a single dose administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µl followed by 2 laser applications, subjects in Cohort 7 (80 µg three repeat doses followed by a single laser application) will receive 3 doses each administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µl one week apart followed by a single laser 
application, and subjects in Cohorts 8 and 9 (80 µg three repeat doses followed by two laser applications) will receive 3 doses each administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µl one week 
apart  followed by 2 laser  applications. Subjects  in cohorts 3, 6, 7, 8 and  9 receiving  80 µg doses 
given as 2 injections of 40 µg in µl will have their IOP measured prior to and after each 
injection. IOP must be 21 mm Hg or less before each injection can be given and the maximum interval between the two injections is 2 hours . IOP must also be 21 mm Hg or less before the 
patient is discharged from the clinic.  
Subjects enrolled in the observation cohort and after exhibiting tumor growth (Cohort 10), and 
repeat cycle cohorts  (Cohorts  11 and 12) will receive  2 cycles  of AU-011 at the highest feasible 
and tolerated dose of 3 repeat 80 µg doses, each followed by 2 repeat laser applications. The second cycle of AU -011 will be administered no earlier than the Week 12 Visit and after 
resolution of any inflammation resulting from the first cycle or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Cycle 2 should be administered as soon as reasonably  possible after inflammation  has resolved  or is minimal and decreasing  based

 on investigator judgement. However,  if 2 subjects  experience a DLT  during treatment  with Cycle 
2, as defined in Section 8.4.1, then no further subjects will receive Cycle 2 of AU-011 until 
discussed with the independent ocular oncologist and medical monitor and continuation of enrollment is confirmed. If  the fovea is near  the tumor edge,  an adjustment to  the laser  procedure 
should be performed on each treatment day of both cycles as outlined in s ection 8.2.2 and 
the 
Injection and Laser Procedure Manual . 
All subjects will be monitored with systemic and ophthalmic assessments. If subjects are discharged during daylight hours, appropriate sun protection, e.g., sunglasses and a hat, will be required. Study subjects will be required to return for an ocular examination 24 hours ± 4 hours following administration of AU-011 for slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOP, fundoscopy, assessment of any changes in their vision, and AE and concomitant medications review. Cohort 1, 2, and 3 subjects  only will also have B- scan ultrasound performed  24 ± 4 hours following administration 
of AU -011. 
Procedures  for intravitreal injection,  which  will be administered  by an ophthalmologist, are 
provided in the study procedures binder. 
 
8.2.2. Laser Activation of AU -011 
This study will use the Aura Photoactivation System which will deliver light at 689 nm to the 
CM 6 to 8 hours after the intravitreal administration (after the second intravitreal injection for the subjects  receiving  80 µg  doses) of study drug AU-011. A second  laser  application  will also 
be investigated in this trial to ensure that maximum tumor cell necrosis occurs with each administration of Light- activated AU -011. 
The Injection  and Laser  Procedure Manual  provides detailed  instructions on the procedures  for 
laser application for this study including tumor margin, laser spot size, foveal treatment, and 
specific high -risk tumor situations including but not limited to:  
Subfoveal tumors  
Tumor edge ≤1.0mm  from the  fovea  
Tumor edge >1.0mm to  2.0mm from  the fovea 
Tumor edge >2.0mm to  3.0mm from  the fovea 
Tumor edge >3.0mm from the fovea 
Suggested treatment patterns and estimated number of treatment spots for several tumor size 
examples  have been  updated in the Injection  and Laser  Procedure Manual in  conformance to the 
instructions provided. 
8.3. Concomitant  Medications  
All concomitant medications taken by the study subjects within seven days prior to the first dose 
of study drug will be documented. Additionally, through 30 days after the completion of study treatment,  the Investigator or study staff will ask the subject  about any new medications  he/she is 
taking or has taken after the start of the study drug and this information will be documented in the study eCRF. For Cohort 10, 11 and 12 subjects, concomitant medications will be documented through their last study visit. Further treatment (additional therapy) for CM will be documented throughout the course of the study.

Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  41  
 The safety committee  may, at  its discretion, decide to  mandate prophylactic use  of topical  and/or 
systemic corticosteroids at any point in this dose and frequency escalation study if the severity 
and/or time course of ocular inflammation suggests that doing so would be in the best interest of study subjects. If any diabetic subjects are prescribed systemic steroids, the site should ensure that the subject  is willing  to check  their blood pressure and fasting  glucose levels  on a daily  basis 
during treatment and to inform the study physician immediately of any signs or symptoms that suggest either are abnormal.  
Artificial tears may be administered within the immediate 24 -hour period prior to study 
treatment  and following the study treatment.  However,  a new,  unopened bottle or vial must be 
used.  
 
8.3.1. Concomitant Steroid Treatment  
On study Day 1, ie, day of first administration of AU-011 treatment and before the first laser 
administration, the Investigator should begin topical 1% prednisone acetate or difluprednate 0.05% topical  eye drops and an oral prednisone taper  or periocular  steroid  injection. Subtenon’s 
injection of triamcinolone acetonide (40mg/ml) can be given with up to 1 ml delivered as tolerated. Oral prednisone starting at 60 mg/day and tapering off (for example, over six to eight weeks) can also be used.  
These regimens are intended to be a minimum treatment regimen and the Investigator can treat with higher doses than proposed in the guidelines in order to minimize  the severity  and duration 
of posterior segment inflammation and allow Cycle 2 of AU-011 therapy to be administered at 12 weeks or as soon as possible thereafter. 
If posterior synechiae develop, the Investigator can also start mydriatric  agents  like mydriacyl, 
cyclogyl or atropine and miotic inhibitors like phenylephrine. 
In the event  of any potential breakthrough inflammation,  the Investigator may restart  clinically 
appropriate levels of oral prednisone treatment. Additionally, the Investigator may choose to 
taper subjects more quickly than described above. 
If a subject continues to show inflammation during the active treatment period, the Investigator 
should determine the necessity of increasing the oral prednisone dose to 80 mg daily with slow 
taper  or hospital admission  with  250 mg  intravenous methylprednisolone 4 times  per day over 3 
days to protect the eye and vision. 
When  C
ycle 2 or additional therapy  of AU-011 is administered,  topical  prednisone acetate 1% or 
difluprednate 0.05% topical eye drop taper and periocular steroid injection or oral steroid use 
should be instituted on the day of the first AU- 011 treatment and before the first laser  
application . The topical steroid eye drop can be tapered and discontinued at the discretion of the 
Investigator. The periocular or oral steroid may consist of a periocular triamcinolone acetonide (40mg/ml) injection up to 1 ml as tolerated or an oral steroid taper similar to the oral taper described for  Cycle 1 of therapy above. These regimens are intended to be a minimum treatment 
regimen and the Investigator can treat with higher doses than proposed in the guidelines, but not with lower doses.

 8.3.2. Prohibited  Concomitant Medications  
Heparins or low molecular weight heparins are prohibited within one week prior to AU-011 
intravitreal injections.  Immunosuppressive or antineoplastic  medications  are prohibited within  5 
half-lives of Visit 1. Steroids, including inhalation steroids, are permitted.  
 
8.3.3. Additional  Therapy  
 
Additional therapy  with AU-011 at the maximum tolerated  and feasible  dose of 3 repeat  doses of 
80 µg each followed by two laser applications (treatment regimen) can be provided to: 
• ensure that all subjects  are able to receive the maximum tolerated  and feasible dose, 
particularly for subjects that were treated with lower doses previously 
• allow  additional treatment  regimens  in subjects  that have stable  disease (treatment 
extension)  
• allow  retreatment  in subjects that  meet  the protocol definition  of disease progression  
 
If the fovea is near the tumor  edge,  an adjustment to the laser  procedure should be performed  on 
each treatment day as outlined in section 8.2.2 and the Injection and Laser Procedure Manual. 
Subjects may be considered for additional therapy with AU-011 (defined above) after Visit 11 (Week 12) and only after inflammation from the previous treatment has resolved or when the inflammation is minimal and decreasing based on investigator judgement. Additional therapy with AU-011 must be approved by the Sponsor on a case- by-case basis prior to the 
initiation of therapy. Alternatively, also after Visit 11 (Week 12 Visit), standard of care therapy, including plaque brachytherapy, proton beam radiotherapy or enucleation may be used if the subject meets the protocol definition of disease progression or the Investigator judges that the disease is progressing per their clinical judgement for increases in tumor thickness or LBD that are less than the protocol definition of disease progression. Before additional therapy is performed, the following protocol assessments must be collected in the study eye unless otherwise noted: ETDRS BCVA (both eyes), slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOP measurement, fundoscopy, Fundus photos, EDI-OCT,  B-scan ultrasound, A- scan ultrasound, OCTA (Cohorts 6 
to 9 only) and a visual field examination. If these assessments have not been performed at the most recent study visit, an unscheduled visit is required to be performed to obtain these assessments.  
The criteria  for implementing  additional therapy due to disease progression  is as follows:  
• An increase on B- scan ultrasound of >0.5 mm in melanoma  thickness from  baseline,  not 
due to intralesional hemorrhage/inflammation  
OR 
• An increase on digital fundus photos of >1.0 mm in melanoma  diameter  from  baseline, 
not due to intralesional hemorrhage/inflammation or pigmentary changes 
If additional therapy with  AU-011 occurs  after Visit 15 (Week  78), subjects  will be followed for 
26 weeks post retreatment and then may be rolled into the long- term follow -up study pending 
subject  consent. Details  regarding the follow-up visit schedule after additional therapy  with AU- 
011 can be found in Appendix 4.

 The Investigator may offer  fine needle aspiration  biopsy of the melanoma  for genetic analysis 
before initiating additional therapy. 
Any progression of the subject’s  condition and subsequent treatment  must be recorded  on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
Details  about concomitant  steroid  treatment for management  of anterior  and posterior segment 
inflammation  are provided in section 8.3.1 and in the study procedures manual. 
At the discretion  of the PI, cycloplegic/mydriatic  agents may be administered  as part of the 
treatment of anterior ocular inflammation.  
8.3.4. AU-011 Treatment  Criteria  for Observation  Cohort  
Once tumor growth is established in the observation cohort as described below, subjects will 
receive the first of 2 cycles  of AU-011 treatment  and the visit schedule for treatment  and follow- 
up is described in Section 10  and Appendix 1 of this protocol until Cycle 2 is administered, at 
which time the visit schedule in Appendix 4 will be followed.  
The criteria  for confirming tumor growth in subjects in  the observation cohort are as follows:  
• A growth rate of 0.5 mm per year (with  a minimum detectable  increase of 0.15 mm over 
a minimum period of 3 months) in melanoma thickness from baseline or an absolute 
increase of ≥ 0.5 mm during the study period 
OR 
• A growth rate of 1.0 mm per year (with  a minimum detectable  increase of 0.6 mm over a 
minimum period of 3 months) in melanoma LBD from baseline or an absolute increase 
of ≥ 1.5 mm during the study period  
8.4. Dose  Escalation  Design  and Toxicity  
8.4.1. DLT Definition  
Dose  limiting  toxicity[ies]  (DLT[s]) is defined  as a treatment -related  safety event  (related  to drug 
and/or laser), severe enough to limit dose escalation (increase of dose or frequency of dosing) of AU-011. 
8.4.2. Dose  Escalation / Termination  
Dose escalation to the next higher dose level, repeat dose group, repeat laser application or repeat  cycle will be implemented  only if less than 2 subjects  in the prior cohort complete  the 
treatment without a DLT.

 9. STUDY  DRUG  
9.1. Study  Drug  
AU-011 drug product is a sterile, aqueous solution supplied at a concentration  of 
mg per mL of buffered isotonic solution (pH 6.5). Each vial contains mL. Additional 
information is provided in the study pharmacy manual. 
9.2. Study  Drug  Packaging,  Labeling,  and Storage  
AU-011 is supplied in a mL, high density plastic, single- use vial; each vial contains a fill 
volume of mL. AU-011 will be shipped to clinical  sites on dry ice. Once  the site receives  the 
study drug, it should be immediately stored at frozen temperature (- °C ± °C). 
All study drug must be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage conditions. The Sponsor 
or its representatives must be granted access on reasonable request to check drug storage, 
dispensing procedures, and accountability records. 
9.3. Study  Drug Preparation  
The designated  site personnel will prepare AU-011 per the manual  provided by the Sponsor. The 
ophthalmologist will administer the study drug as specified in the injection and laser procedure, 
located in the study procedures manual. 
 
9.4. Study  Drug Accountability  
Each  clinical  site is responsible for accountability  of all used and unused study drug supplies at 
the site.  
The Sponsor or designee will verify receipt of the study drug at the site during monitoring 
visit(s), and will conduct an inventory of remaining clinical trial supplies at the site close -out 
visit.  All study drug inventories must be made available  for inspection by the monitor, Sponsor, 
or representatives of the aforementioned and regulatory agencies upon request. 
Dispensation and destruction of study drug will be recorded in the source document and drug 
accountability records. Clinical trial supplies must not be returned or destroyed unless the Sponsor or its representative has granted  prior approval. Refer  to the study pharmacy  manual  for 
additional details.  
9.5. Laser  System  
The Sponsor will be providing the Aura Photoactivation System to the study sites. The Aura Photoactivation System (supplied by a contract manufacturer in accordance with Aura’s specification) consists of a laser console and a compatible slit lamp adaptor.  The Sponsor will 
also provide each site with a compatible standard slit lamp biomicroscope and a table for the 
equipment. The laser  photoactivation system  has been  tested  for compliance  to applicable FDA 
laser standards.  
The laser  system  will be labeled  “For investigational use only.” Refer  to the laser  user manual 
for additional information.

 10. CONDUCT  OF STUDY  AND  STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
10.1. Conduct  of Study  
10.1.1. Screening  and Informed  Consent  
All subjects will receive a written ICF describing this study and providing sufficient information 
to make an informed  decision about participating  in this study. Written  informed  consent must be 
obtained before any protocol specific procedures are performed. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that a careful and thorough informed consent 
procedure is implemented before a subject enters the study and at any time during the study should ICF changes  be introduced. This includes, but is not limited  to: (1) providing a quiet place 
for the subject to read the ICF and allowing ample time for this review; (2) ensuring that 
qualified medical personnel are available to directly answer questions that a subject may have;  
(3) ensuring that each potential study subject understands that his or her medical treatment will 
not be otherwise affected  based  on the decision  whether  or not to participate in the study, that his 
or her participation  is completely  voluntary, and that he or she can opt to stop participation  in the 
study at any time for any reason; and (4) ensuring that a full copy of the signed ICF is given to the subject to take home for his or her medical records. The process for obtaining informed consent should also be noted in the subject’s source documentation. 
In addition, whenever  available,  historical B- scans  and/or color  fundus photographs, either  from 
the investigative  site or the referring  site, should be provided to the Independent Reading  Center 
for subjects at the time of entry to the study. The investigative site should make all reasonable 
efforts to obtain this information from referring sites. 
Appendix 1 and the sections  below describe the procedures that  will be performed  at each visit.  
Additionally, for the observation cohort visits every 3 months (ie, 90 day (+/- 7 days) intervals 
from  the Screening  Visit),  which  occur  prior to evidence  of tumor growth, the same procedures 
outlined for Visit 6 (Day 15) will be performed with the exception of OCTA and Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) testing which is not required.

differential), CMP, and ADA results. 
If a situation arises in which the Investigator needs results more quickly than the central 
laboratory can accommodate,  the Investigator may use a local  laboratory  in parallel,  e.g., 
pregnancy test results for confirming subject eligibility. 
 
10.2.2.1. Hematology and Differential  Panel  
CBC plus differential panel that includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells (RBC), white 
blood cells (WBC), WBC differential, and platelets will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), at Visit 2 (Day 1) if Visit 2 occurs more than 7 days after Visit 1, Visit 4 (Day  8), and Visit 8 (Day  
29). 
 
10.2.2.2. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel  (CMP)  and Electrolyte Panel  
A CMP includes the following: total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT 
(SGPT), AST (SGOT), GGT, LDH, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus (or phosphate), total protein, albumin, globulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, CK, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, and magnesium. Blood samples for a CMP and Electrolyte  Panel  will be performed  at Visit 1 (Screening),  Visit 2 (Day  1) if Visit 2 occurs  more 
than 7 days after Visit 1, Visit 4 (Day 8), and Visit 8 (Day 29). 
10.2.2.3. Pregnancy  Test and Contraception  Requirements  
For women of childbearing potential, serum pregnancy test will be performed at Visit 1 
(Screening). A  central  laboratory will be used for analyzing  and reporting serum  pregnancy 
results.  If Visit 2 (Day  1) occurs  more  than 7 days after  Visit 1, urine pregnancy  test will be 
performed at Visit 2. If the pregnancy test(s) is positive, the subject will be screen failed. 
Women of childbearing potential and males with sexual partners of childbearing potential must 
agree to use a medically  acceptable form  of birth control before the first single administration  of 
the investigational product and for three months after the last administration of Light- activated 
AU-011 treatment. Women considered capable of becoming pregnant include all females who have experienced  menarche and have not experienced  menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for 
greater than 12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical sterilization 
(hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy). 
Acceptable forms of birth control are spermicide with barrier, oral contraceptive, injectable or 
implantable method of contraception, transdermal contraceptive, intrauterine device, or surgical 
sterilization  of partner.  For non- sexually  active females  and males,  abstinence will be considered 
an acceptable form of birth control.

 10.2.2.4. Anti -Drug  Antibodies  (ADA)  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) blood samples will be taken at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 4 (Day 8), 
Visit 8 (Day  29), Visit 11 (Week  12), and Visit 14 (Week  52). For 3 repeat Light -activated  AU- 
011 administration cohort subjects only, also performed at Visit 6 (Day 15). 
Study staff will record the visit numbers and dates, and exact times of AU -011 injections and 
blood samples  taken  in source documents. A central  laboratory will be used for analyzing  and 
reporting ADA data. 
 
10.2.3. Safety  Monitoring  
The safety and tolerability of Light- activated AU -011 treatment will be assessed through the 
collection  and analysis  of AEs,  vital signs, ocular  examinations, and laboratory tests.  All safety 
assessments and protocol specified tests, including occurrence of AEs, intensity/severity, 
relationship  to study drug, and treatment  or action  taken  to resolve the event,  will be performed 
by qualified study personnel and/or the evaluating physicians. 
For the purposes of safety  monitoring, baseline is defined  as the pre-dose value at Visit 2 (Day  1) 
or, if no pre- dose Visit 2 (Day 1) result is available, it is the pre -dose test performed closest to 
Visit 2 (Day 1). 
The study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist will review SAEs and AEs on a 
monthly basis  for the early  part of the study and thereafter  every  six months during the follow up 
phase for any trends within and between the cohorts. 
The study data, including any adverse and/or serious adverse events, together with any 
determinations  of DLTs  and decisions on dose reductions, or dose escalations,  will be reviewed 
by the study medical monitor and independent ocular oncologist. 
10.2.3.1. Definitions  of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered  a pharmaceutical  product and which  does not necessarily  have  to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
Therefore,  an AE can be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
Any clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing condition other than CM is considered to 
be an AE. However, worsening of CM is considered to be “disease progression” or “lack of efficacy”  and need  not be reported  as an AE unless it or the signs and symptoms associated  with 
CM are more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
An AE oc
curring from  overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that indicated  in the protocol) of a study 
drug, whether accidental or intentional. 
The criteria for determining  whether  an abnormal  objective test finding should be reported  as an 
AE are as follows:  
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  58  
 • Test result  is associated with  accompanying symptoms  
• Test result  requires  additional diagnostic testing  
• Test result  requires  significant additional concomitant drug treatment,  or other 
therapy or intervention 
• Test result leads  to a change in  trial dosing  or discontinuation of study drug 
• Test result  is considered  to be an  AE by the Investigator or Sponsor  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute  an AE. Any abnormal test result  that is determined  to be an error  does not require 
reporting as an AE. 
A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in laboratory or other assessment should be 
recorded  on the eCRF  as appropriate (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value,  bundle branch 
block rather than abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG)).  
For Cohorts 1 to 9, from the time the subject receives the single administration (or initial for repeat)  study treatment  until 30 days after the subject  completes  the study treatment,  protocol- 
related events should be recorded as well. For Cohort 10, 11 and 12 subjects, these should be recorded until the last study visit for the subject. A protocol-related AE is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not related to the study product, but is considered by the Investigator or medical monitor to be related to the research conditions. For example, a 
protocol-related AE may be an event related to a medical procedure required by the protocol. 
10.2.3.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
Any adverse  experience occurring at  any dose that results  in any of the following outcomes is 
classified as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
• Results  in death  
• Life threatening (see below for definition)  
• Results  in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  (see below for definition)  
• Requires  subject  hospitalization  or prolongs subject hospitalization  (see below  for 
definition)  
• Results  in a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  in a neonate/infant  
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious AEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at home,  blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening refers  to immediate  risk of death  as the event  occurred  per the reporter.  A life- 
threatening experience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk of death. 
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  59  
 For example, an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life 
threatening, even  though angioedema of the larynx, allergic  bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can 
be fatal.  
Hospitalization is official admission to a hospital. Hospitalization or prolongation of a 
hospitalization constitutes criteria  for an AE to be serious; however, it is not in itself considered 
a SAE.  In the absence of an  AE, a hospitalization  or prolongation of a hospitalization  should not 
be reported by the PI. This is the case in the following situations: 
• The hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine procedure 
followed by the center  (e.g., stent  removal  after surgery, or other elective  procedures). 
This should be recorded in the study file. 
• Hospitalization  for survey visits  or annual physicals falls  in the same category.  
Disability  is defined  as a substantial disruption in a person’s  ability  to conduct normal life 
functions.  
 
10.2.3.3. Adverse Event  Recording  and Reporting  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) should be reported from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent to 30 days after the subject completes the study treatment. Adverse Events (AE) should be reported from the time the subject receives the single Light- activated AU -011 administration 
(or initial for repeat) study treatment to 30 days after the subject completes the study treatment. After  30 days, for Cohorts 1 to 9, only AEs or SAEs  determined  by the Investigator to be related 
to study product and/or study procedures are to be reported. Relatedness to Light- activated AU - 
011 treatment and/or study procedures is determined by the Investigator. For Cohort 10, 11 and 12 subjects, all SAEs and AEs will be reported from the time the subject signs the informed consent through their last study visit. All AEs,  regardless  of severity  and whether  or not they are 
ascribed  to the study treatment,  will be recorded  in the source documents. All AEs and SAEs  for 
subjects who are not screen failures will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Study Investigators must follow-up on all AEs, SAEs, and other reportable events until the 
events have resolved, returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes.  If, in the opinion of the Investigator, the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies 
are not likely  to improve because  of the underlying disease,  the Investigator must record  his or 
her reasoning for this decision in the subject’s source documentation and on the eCRF. Any medication  or other intervention necessary  for the treatment  of an AE  must be recorded  on the 
concomitant medication eCRF.  
All AEs  will be characterized  by the following criteria:  
• E
vent term 
• Intensity  or severity  
• Relationship  to study treatment  
• Outcome  
• Treatment  or action  taken.  
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  60  
 Whenever  possible, recognized  medical  terms  should be used when  recording AEs. 
Colloquialisms and/or abbreviations should not be used. 
If more than one distinct AE occurs, each event should be recorded separately. However, if 
known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) should be recorded on the eCRF  rather  than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record  congestive heart  failure  rather  than 
dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as a separate AE. A diagnosis that is subsequently established should be reported as follow-up information. However, signs and symptoms that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at the same time, each event should be recorded as an individual AE). 
AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by the primary 
cause;  a "primary" event,  if clearly  identifiable,  should represent  the most accurate clinical  term 
to record as the AE event term.  For example:  
Orthostatic  hypotension fainting  and fall to floorhead  traumaneck  pain 
The primary  event  is orthostatic  hypotension and the sequelae are fainting, fall, head 
trauma and neck pain. 
 
10.2.3.4. Classification  of Adverse Events  by Intensity/Severity  
All AEs should be graded by Investigators using the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 ( Appendix 3). If the AE is not specifically listed in the CTC 
toxicity criteria (for instance posterior segment inflammation, as opposed to uveitis), use the 
following grades: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical  or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2: Moderate;  minimal,  local  or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
− Instrumental ADL  refer  to preparing meals,  shopping for groceries  or clothes, 
using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
• Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization  or prolongation of hospitalization  indicated;  disabling; limiting  self- 
care ADL.  
− Self-care ADL  refer  to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self,  using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden 
• Grade  4: Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death  related to AE  
There is a distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. Severity is a measurement  of intensity; thus, a severe reaction  is not necessarily  a SAE.  For example,  a 
Clinical Protocol, Rev -15 
AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  61  
 headache may be severe in intensity,  but would not be serious unless it met one of the criteria  for 
SAEs.  
Expectedness  
All AEs considered  related  to Light- activated  AU-011 will be evaluated  as to whether  they are 
expected or unexpected, and related to Light- activated AU -011, the laser, and/or both. 
Expectedness will  be determined  by the Sponsor.  
Expected  (anticipated):  An AE is expected  when  the nature,  severity, or degree of incidence was 
previously described in the IB. 
Unexpected  (unanticipated): An AE is unexpected  when  the nature,  severity,  or degree of 
incidence was not previously described in the IB. 
Relatedness  
The Investigator will determine  the assessment  of the causal  relationship  of the AE to the study 
product and/or laser treatment. The following terms for assessment of the causality to study 
product or study procedures are to be used: 
• Not related:  An event  that does not follow a reasonable temporal  sequence from 
administration of the study product or procedure, does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the suspect product or procedure and that could be reasonably explained by the  known characteristics  of the subject's clinical  state.  
• Related:  An event  that follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence from  administration  of 
the study product or procedure, follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected product or procedure and that could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Outcome  
The clinical  outcome of an  AE will be  characterized  as follows:  
• Ongoing  
• Resolved  
• Resolved  with  sequelae  
• Death  
• Unknown  
Action  Taken  with  Study  Drug  or Procedure  
• None  
• Study product or procedure interrupted  
• Study product or procedure discontinued  
10.2.3.5. Serious  Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious A
dverse Events (SAE)  must be reported  to the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later 
than 24 hours after the Investigator first learns of the event. The SAE form is to be completed

Medical  Monitor,  and submitted by email to Aura Biosciences. For initial reports, Investigators should record all 
case details  that can be gathered  within  the reporting timeframe.  Relevant  follow-up information 
should be submitted to the Sponsor as soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. For some events, the Sponsor or designee or the medical monitor may follow up with the site by telephone, fax, electronic  mail,  and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  deemed 
necessary to appropriately evaluate the event (e.g., hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or autopsy report). Reports relating to the subject’s subsequent medical course must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event has resolved or, in case of permanent impairment, until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained.  
SAE  reporting timelines  should be followed when  reporting a pregnancy  or symptomatic 
overdose.  
The SAE report should be sent to the medical monitor and Aura Biosciences via e- mail – 
Safety@aurabiosciences.com.  The following contact  information  (during both business and non- 
business hours) is also available: 
• : 
 
• Aura  Biosciences,  
Study personnel are free to contact  the medical  monitor,  by phone at  
, or by email at  regarding any  SAE  or medical  concerns.  
Transmission of the SAE report should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report. 
Follow-up information for SAEs  and information  on non-serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to the Sponsor as soon as it is available; these reports should be submitted using 
the SAE Report Form. Non-serious AEs that become serious should be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours and recorded on the SAE Report Form. 
10.3. Ophthalmic  Assessments  
10.3.1. Best Corrected  Visual  Acuity  (BCVA)  
The study’s independent visual acuity consultants will certify the visual acuity equipment, 
examination  rooms, and examiners  before the study begins at each site. Manifest  refraction  and 
BCVA  measurement  will be  performed  according to the standard  ETDRS  refraction  and visual 
acuity testing protocol in both eyes at all visits . 
 
10.3.2. Intraocular Pressure (IOP)  
IOP will be measured using applanation or tonopen in the study eye at every study visit and in both  eyes at Visit 1 (Screening)  and Visit 11 (Week  12), and at any Early  Termination  Visit that 
occurs before Visit 11 (Week 12). In addition, for all 80 µg dose cohorts, IOP must be 21 mm 
Hg or less before each injection and before discharge from the clinic.  
10.3.3. Slit Lamp  Biomicroscopy and Fundoscopy  
Slit lamp  biomicroscopy and fundoscopy will be performed  in the study eye  at every  study visit 
except at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 11 (Week 12), and at any Early Termination Visit that

 occurs  before Visit 11 (Week  12), where Slit Lamp  Biomicroscopy and Fundoscopy will be 
measured in both eyes . 
10.3.4. Fluorescein  Angiography (FA) and Color Fundus  Photography (Fundus  Photos)  
FA will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 11 (Week 12), Visit 14 (Week 52), and Visit 
16 (Week 104), and at any Early Termination Visit. Fundus photos will be performed in both eyes at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 11 (Week 12), and at any Early Termination Visit if that occurs before Visit 11 (Week 12). Fundus photos will be taken for the study eye only at all other visits including Early Termination that occurs after Visit 11 (Week 12). All FAs and fundus photos will be performed using digital fluorescein photography equipment and cameras certified 
by the IRC.  The IRC will certify  all photographers performing  FA and fundus photos before they 
perform any imaging on study subjects. The IRC will provide each site with the protocol for 
image acquisition and transfer. 
The largest basal diameter (LBD)  of the CM will be  measured on the Fundus Photos at baseline 
and all visits  described  above. The  greatest  basal  area (GBA)  of tumor will also be measured  on 
Fundus Photos at the same visits and tumor volume will be derived using the GBA and the 
maximum tumor thickness (measured  by B- scan ultrasound) using the formula  πr
2h/3 where r is 
the radius derived  from  the GBA and h is the maximum tumor thickness. The criteria  to classify 
tumor response (diameter) on Fundus Photos will be: 
Tumor Control:  
• Regression  = Any reduction > 0.5 mm in the largest  basal  diameter  (LBD) of the CM 
from baseline 
• Stable  Disease (SD) =  Maximum LBD  of the CM is within  ≥ -0.5 mm to ≤ +1.0 mm 
change in diameter from baseline 
Tumor Progression:  
• Progression = Any increase > 1.0 mm in the LBD  of the CM from  baseline not judged 
by the Investigator to be due to inflammation/swelling, hemorrhage or pigmentary 
changes  
10.3.5. Enhanced Depth  Imaging  Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI -OCT)  
The study’s IRC  will certify  the EDI-OCT  machine and technician(s)  before the study begins at 
each site. EDI -OCT will be performed in both eyes at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 11 (Week 
12), and at any Early Termination that occurs before Visit 11 (Week 12) and in the study eye only at all other visits including Early Termination that occurs after Visit 11 (Week 12).  All 
images will be sent to the IRC for assessment throughout the study and in accordance with the IRC-provided protocol. 
10.3.6. Op
 tical Coherence  Tomography Angiography (OCTA)  
OCTA will be recorded  at sites with OCTA imaging  systems in  Cohorts 6 through 9. The study’s 
IRC will certify  the OCTA machine and technician(s) before the study begins at each site. OCTA 
will be performed in both eyes at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 11 (Week 12), and at any Early 
Termination that occurs before Visit 11 (Week 12) and in the study eye only at all other visits

 including Early  Termination  that occurs  after Visit 11 (Week  12). All images  will be sent to the 
IRC for assessment throughout the study and in accordance with the IRC-provided protocol. 
10.3.7. B-scan  Ultrasound  
B-scan ultrasound (B-scan) will be performed in both eyes at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 11 
(Week 12), and at any Early Termination Visit if that occurs before Visit 11 (Week 12) and in the study eye only at Visit  2 (Day  1), Visit 3 (Day 2)  for cohorts 1, 2 and 3 only, Visit 4 (Day  8), 
Visit 6 (Day  15), Visit 8  (Day 29), Visit 10 (Week  8), Visit 12  (Week  26), Visit 13 (Week 39),  
Visit 14 (Week  52), Visit 15 (Week  78), Visit 16 (Week  104), and  at any Early  Termination  that 
occurs after Visit 11 (Week 12). Ultrasound technicians will be certified by the IRC prior to study initiation based on adherence to IRC provided imaging acquisition and transfer protocols. 
Tumor thickness eligibility for the study is determined by B- scan measurement.  
Criteria  to classify tumor response (thickness) on B- scan will be:  
Tumor Control:  
• Complete  Response (CR)  = Entire  tumor is a flat lesion  and of equal  (or less) 
thickness to the surrounding choroid 
• Regression  = Any reduction > 0.5 mm in the maximum thickness of the CM from 
baseline  
• Stable  Disease (SD) = Maximum thickness of the CM is within  ≥ -0.5 mm to ≤ +0.5 
mm change from baseline 
Tumor Progression:  
• Progression = Any increase > 0.5 mm in the maximum thickness of the CM from 
baseline not judged by the Investigator to be due to inflammation/swelling or hemorrhage  
10.3.8. A-scan  Ultrasound  
A-scan ultrasound (A-scan)  will be recorded  in the study eye at  sites  with  diagnostic probes. The 
amplitude of the  internal reflectivity of the  lesion will be recorded at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 4 
(Day 8), Visit 8 (Day 29), Visit 10 (Week 8), Visit 11 (Week 12), Visit 12 (Week 26), Visit 13 (Week 39), Visit 14 (Week 52), Visit 15 (Week 78), Visit 16 (Week 104), and at any Early T
ermination  Visit.  Ultrasound technicians  will be certified  by the IRC  prior to enrollment of 
subjects in to the sub-study, based on adherence to IRC provided imaging acquisition and transfer protocols.  
10.3.9. Visual  Field  Examination  
Visual field assessment will be performed using automated perimetry testing (e.g., Humphrey 24-2 SITA standard). Visual field examinations will be performed in both eyes at Visit 1 (Screening)  and Visit 11 (Week  12), and at any Early  Termination  Visit that occurs  before  Visit 
11 (Week 12) and in the study eye only at Visit 14 (Week 52), Visit 16 (Week 104), and any Early Termination Visit that occurs after Visit 11 (Week 12).

Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  65  
 10.3.10. Additional  Assessments  
If peri -tumoral whitening/pigmentary changes are seen at any time during the study, the 
Investigators should notify the sponsor and the additional assessments outlined below should be 
conducted if the required equipment is available at the Investigational site: 
1. Wide field fundus autofluorescence (FAF)  over lesion  and extent  of whitening 
2. Single line scan OCT  images  oversampled  at least 50 times  with EDI on, including normal 
retina, whitening and tumor 3. Indocyanine green  (ICG)  angiography  
4. OCTA in  the area of retinal whitening  
These assessments should be conducted at the visit that the changes are first observed and at 
scheduled  visits  through 26 weeks  (as outlined in Appendix 1) from  the last treatment  day for 
that cycle. If changes were seen with the first cycle of treatment and there are further changes/increases observed during the second cycle, the additional assessments should be conducted at the visit when  observed and  at scheduled  visits  through 26 weeks  (as outlined in 
Appendix 4) from the last treatment day of second cycle.  
 
10.4. General  Methodology 
 
Since this is an exploratory study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Descriptive 
statistics  will be used to tabulate and summarize efficacy  and safety  outcomes. Background and 
demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum). Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  
Safety  assessments will be made at all  study visits  and both safety  and tolerability  will be 
evaluated by assessing the incidence of DLTs (as defined in Section 8.4.1), AEs and the 
incidence of SAEs.  
AEs,  SAEs,  and other  findings will be summarized  by presenting the percentages  of subjects 
with each event for each treatment group. When relevant, the time course of AEs will be presented.  
All safety  analyses  will be presented  by dose group and over all subjects.  Safety  analyses  will 
summarize subjects by the treatment received.  
The safety  analysis  will summarize  ocular treatment- emergent  AEs (TEAEs)  in the study eye for 
all treated subjects using discrete summaries at the subject- and event -level by system organ 
class and preferred term. A TEAE will be defined as occurring on or after the day that treatment is initiated. An additional analysis will investigate ocular  AEs for the  non-study eye. Non- ocular 
TEAEs will be summarized using discrete summaries at the subject- and event -level by system 
organ class and preferred term. Treatment -related ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will be 
summarized similarly. Ocular and non-ocular TEAEs will also be summarized by severity or toxicity grade. Additionally, TEAEs will be summarized by treatment schedule as deemed necessary to better understand the safety profile.  
The p
resence or absence of  anti-drug antibodies will be summarized  by treatment group.

Since this is a single arm, exploratory study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed. 
Efficacy will be assessed at the Week 12, 26 39, 52, 78 and 104 visits for any potential tumor response and changes in ETDRS best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). This will include change from baseline at each visit in tumor thickness by ultrasound and largest basal diameter by digital fundus photography. The proportion of subjects  who meet  the definition  of stable  disease  (do not 
meet the definition of disease progression) will also be reported for each visit using change in tumor thickness and for changes in largest basal diameter. Change from baseline in ETDRS BCVA at Week 12 and at each subsequent visit will include changes in letter score and the proportion of subjects who lose or gain 5, 10 or 15 letters. 
 
Exploratory analyses  will be performed  for change  in internal  reflectivity  of tumors by A- scan 
ultrasound at each visit and macular changes (foveal avascular zone and vessel density) by 
OCTA at each visit.  
Background and demographic characteristics will be presented. Continuous variables will be 
summarized  by descriptive statistics  (sample  size, mean,  standard  deviation, median,  minimum 
and maximum). Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  
 
Efficacy  and safety  will be analyzed  at various intervals  after the first 2 cohorts have completed 
12 months of follow-up and then at further intervals as subsequent cohorts reach similar milestones. Specific details of the timing of such analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 11. SOURCE  DATA/DOCUMENTS  
11.1. Study  Monitoring  
The Investigator will permit monitoring, quality audits, and inspections by the government 
regulatory authorities,  and the Sponsor or its representative(s)  of all study related  documents 
(e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, eCRFs). 
Study monitoring involves the following elements:  
• Aura Biosciences personnel, or designee, may meet with Investigators prior to the 
initiation of the study in order to review the adequacy of the subject population, 
facilities,  and equipment with  respect  to the needs  of the study, and to familiarize  the 
Investigator and support staff with the study protocol. 
• Aura Biosciences personnel, or designee, may meet with the Investigators at the time 
enrollment is initiated  in order to ensure that subjects are being properly  selected,  that 
the methods described in the study protocol are thoroughly understood by the Investigator, and that study data are being correctly recorded. 
• Aura  Biosciences  personnel,  or designee,  may visit the clinical  site at any time during 
the course of the study to review and/or collect completed eCRFs. Additionally, telephone consultation will occur as necessary during the course of the study to ensure the proper progress and documentation of the study findings. 
• Aura  Biosciences  personnel will review  protocol deviations regularly.  
11.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Aura Biosciences, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee, or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were  recorded,  analyzed,  and accurately  reported  according to the protocol, 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact Aura Biosciences immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
 
11.3. Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  
The Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation. Initial IRB approval, and all materials  approved by the IRB  for this study including the subject  consent form  and recruitment 
materials must be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection.

 12. QUALITY CONTROL  AND  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
The eCRFs  will be reviewed  by Aura  Biosciences  or designee.  All data on eCRFs  will be 100% 
source- verified  by office- based  monitoring and during site visits  for accuracy  and completeness 
by a clinical monitor. All data captured by the EDC system will be transferred through an 
electronic interface into a study database for management, analysis, and reporting. Any other data (eg, laboratory results) will also be transferred into the database. Upon completion of data collection, the database will receive a quality assurance (QA) check to ensure acceptable accuracy and completeness.

 13. ETHICS  
13.1. IRB Review  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the IB, any subject diary card or 
written instructions to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., study website),  information  about payments and compensation available  to the 
subjects and documentation evidencing the Investigator’s qualifications should be submitted to 
the IRB for review and approval according to local regulations, prior to the study start. The 
written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name and version. 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment. The Investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain IRB and/or Sponsor approval for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the ICF or changes of the investigational site, facilities  or personnel. The Investigator should notify the IRB of protocol 
deviations or SAEs occurring at the site and other AE reports received from the Sponsor in accordance with local procedures.  
Safety  updates for Light- activated  AU-011 will be prepared  by the Sponsor or its representative 
as required, for submission to the relevant IRB. 
 
13.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, principles set forth in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki (1998 version applicable for study sites in the EU),  ICH  Guideline E6 for 
GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95 Jan 1997), and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, 
parts 50, 54 56, and 312. 
Appe ndix 2 provides more detail  about the Sponsor’s commitments  to clinical  research  and to 
this study. 
 
13.3. Written Informed  Consent  
Informed  consent is a process  by which  a subject  voluntarily  confirms  his or her willingness  to 
participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are 
relevant  to the subject's decision  to participate. Informed  consent is documented by means  of a 
written, signed and dated ICF. 
The ICF will be submitted  for approval to  the IRB that is responsible for review  and approval of 
the study. Each consent form must include all of the  relevant elements currently required by the 
national regulatory body, as well as local county authority or state regulations. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial. Once the essential information has been provided to the prospective candidate,  and the Investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications 
of participating in this trial, the candidate will be  asked to give consent to participate in the trial 
by signing an ICF. A notation that written informed consent has been obtained will be made in the subject’s medical record. A copy of the ICF, to include the subject’s signature, will be provided by the Investigator to the subject.

AU-011-101, 21 Feb 2020  AU-011 
IND 121,893  
Aura  Biosciences,  Inc. Confidential  Page  70  
 If an amendment  to the protocol substantially  alters  the trial design or the potential risks  to the 
subjects, the subject’s consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained. 
13.4. Subject  Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of subject’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  and national data protection laws, 
as applicable. HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the trial, a subject must 
sign an authorization from the trial that he or she has been informed of following: 
• What  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be collected  from  subjects  in this trial; 
• Who  will have access  to that information  and why;  
• Who  will use  or disclose that information;  
• That health  information may be further disclosed  by the recipients  of the information, 
and that if the information  is disclosed  the information  may  no longer be protected  by 
federal or state privacy laws;  
• The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the 
subject’s  medical  records,  but the subject  will be able to obtain the research  records 
after the conclusion of the trial; 
• Whether  the authorization  contains an  expiration date;  and 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke his or her authorization.  
In the event  that a subject  revokes authorization to  collect  or use his or her PHI,  the Investigator, 
by regulation, retains  the ability  to use all information  collected  prior to the revocation  of subject 
authorization. For subjects  that have revoked authorization  to collect  or use PHI, attempts  should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled trial period. 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines, it is a requirement that the Investigator and institution 
permit authorized  representatives  of Sponsor, the regulatory authorities  and the IRB direct  access 
to review the subject’s original medical records at the site for verification of trial- related 
procedures and data. 
Measures  to protect  confidentiality  include: only a unique trial number and initials  will identify 
subjects on the eCRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor. This information, together 
with the subject’s date of birth, will be used in the database for subject identification. Subject names or addresses will not be entered on the eCRF or in the database. No material bearing a subject’s name will be kept on file by the Sponsor. Subjects will be informed of their rights within the ICF.

 14. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORDKEEPING  
14.1. Data  Collection  
The eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. eCRFs will be kept current to 
enable the monitor to review the subjects’ status throughout the course of the trial. In order to maintain confidentiality, only the study number, subject number and date of birth will identify the subject  on the eCRF. All  data requested  on the eCRF  must be supported by and be consistent 
with the subject’s source documentation. 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copies of original 
records  of clinical  findings, observations and activities  from  which  the subject’s  eCRF  data are 
obtained. These can include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory, medico- technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, ECG 
traces, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, and correspondence. 
All missing data must be  explained. When a required laboratory test, assessment, or evaluation 
has not been  done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the eCRF,  a note should be created 
verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown”. For any entry errors made, the error(s) 
must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. 
The Principal  Investigator will sign and date the subject  eCRF  casebook  indicating  that the data 
on the eCRF have been assessed, once all data for that subject is final.  
 
14.2. Study  Documentation  and Retention  of Records  
All study -related records must be maintained for at least 2 years after a marketing application is 
approved for the drug; or if an application  is not approved for the drug, until at least 2 years  after 
shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA/health 
authorities or regulatory agencies have been notified. The Sponsor will notify the principal Investigator when records are no longer needed. The Investigator will not discard any records 
without notifying the Sponsor. If the Investigator moves from  the current  investigational site, the 
Sponsor should be notified in writing or by email of the name of the person who will assume 
responsibility for maintenance of the records at the investigational site or the new address at which the records will be stored. The Investigator will notify the Sponsor as soon as possible in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study documentation. 
14.3. Amendments  to the Protocol  
Amendments to the protocol shall  be planned, documented, and signature authorized prior to 
implementation.  
If an amendment  to the protocol is required, the amendment will be originated  and documented 
by the Sponsor (or its representative). The written amendment must be reviewed and approved 
by the Sponsor, and submitted to the IRB for approval. 
Amendments specifically  involving change to trial design, risk to subject,  increase to dosing or 
exposure, subject number increase, addition or removal of new tests or procedures, shall be 
reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB.

 The amendment will be submitted formally to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor as 
applicable, after IRB approval and specifically when an increase to dosing or subject exposure and/or subject  number has been  proposed; or, when  the addition or removal  of an Investigator is 
necessitated.

 15. DISCLOSURE  AND  PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information provided regarding the trial, as well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the trial, will be regarded  as confidential. The  Sponsor reserves  the right to 
release literature publications based on the results of the trial. Results from the trial will be published/presented as per the Sponsor’s publication strategy. 
Inclusion of the Investigator in the authorship of any multi- center  publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically 
revising any manuscript(s) derived from the trial. The Investigator acknowledges that the trial is part of a multi-center trial and agrees that any publication by the Investigator of the results of the trial conducted at his/her research site shall not be made before the first multi- center  publication. 
In the event  there is no multi- center  publication within  fifteen  (15) months after the trial has been 
completed or terminated at all trial sites, and all data has been received, the Investigator shall have the right to publish its results from the trial, subject to the notice requirements described herein and subject to acknowledgement of the Sponsor as appropriate. Investigator shall provide the Sponsor thirty (30) days to review a manuscript or any poster presentation, abstract or other written or oral material which describes the results of the trial for the purpose only of determining if any confidential or patentable information is disclosed thereby. If the Sponsor 
requests in writing, the Investigator shall withhold any publication or presentation an additional 
sixty (60) days solely to permit the Sponsor to seek patent protection.

 APPENDIX 4.  AU-011 ADDITIONAL  THERAPY  AND  SECOND  CYCLE 
(COHORTS 10, 11 & 12) VISIT SCHEDULE  
If the Investigator elects  to give additional therapy  with  AU-011 as outlined in Section  8.3.3 then 
the following visit schedule and assessments must be performed. Similarly, the same visit 
schedule will be used for the second cycle of AU -011 for Cohorts 10, 11 and 12. Concomitant 
steroid treatment as outlined in section 8.3.1 should be administered with additional therapy or second cycle of AU -011. Prior to additional therapy and second cycle with AU-011, subjects 
must have provided informed consent and women of child-bearing potential must undergo a urine pregnancy test. 
Subjects  will be assessed  for safety  24 hours after each  AU-011 administration  and at 2 weeks,  4 
weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks after completion of additional therapy with AU-011. Additional 
unscheduled visits may occur at the discretion of the investigator. If a protocol defined visit is 
scheduled to occur within 1 week of either the 4 week, 12 week or 26 week post additional 
therapy or second cycle follow-up visit, only one visit is required and the visit should be recorded as the protocol defined visit and all the assessments of that visit should be performed. After  the 26 week  post additional therapy  or second  cycle follow-up visit, remaining  study visits 
will be conducted per the visit schedule in Section 10 and Appendix 1. If any post additional therapy, or second cycle follow-up visit will occur after the planned Week 104 End of Study Visit, the  26 week post additional therapy, or second cycle follow-up visit should be recorded as 
the Week 104 End of Study Visit.

 − Intravitreal injection of AU -011 study drug (Highest established safe dose at the 
time of the retreatment request will be offered).  The subject will receive 80 µg 
doses administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in µl and the subject’s  IOP will be 
measured prior to and after each injection. IOP must be 21 mm Hg or less before 
each injection can be given and the maximum interval between the two injections is 2 hours . IOP must also be 21 mm Hg or less before the patient 
is discharged  from  the clinic).  
− Laser treatment (Highest safe regimen at the time of the retreatment request will be offered  and given 6 to 8 hours after intravitreal administration  of AU-011). As 
the subject will receive 80 µg doses administered as 2 injections of 40 µg in 
µl, the two laser treatments will be administered 6 to 8 hours after the second 
injection 30 minutes ( ±10 minutes) apart. If the fovea is near the tumor edge, an 
adjustment to the laser procedure should be performed on each treatment day as 
outlined in section  8.2.2 and  the Injection  and Laser  Procedure Manual.  Subjects 
should remain at the study site after intravitreal injection until approximately ½ hour after laser treatment.  
− If subjects are discharged during daylight hours, appropriate sun protection, e.g., 
sunglasses and a hat, will be required.

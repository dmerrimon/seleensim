STUDY SUMMARY  
 
Title:      Randomized open -label neo -adjuvant phase  II study  comparing  
ixabepilone (I) vs. ixabepilone plus cetuximab (IC) in Triple negative breast 
cancer patients  
 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
1. To determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) (breast and 
axilla) of  Ixabepilone versus Ixabepilone when combined with cetuximab 
in patients with invasive breast adenocarcinoma  T1N1 -N3M0 or  
T2-4 N0 -3M0 diseas e who are Triple negative and who are candidates for 
preoperative chemotherapy.  
Secondary Objective(s):  
1. To evaluate overall objective response rate in both treatment groups.  
2. To assess toxicity of each regimen.  
Exploratory Objective s: 
1. To correlate the  expression of biomarkers such as PTEN, EGFR 
and EGFR -pathway associated genes ( including, but not limited to, 
TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS 
amplicon genes) with the objective clinical and pathologic response.  
2. To potentially explore other gene/protein expression patterns , 
mutations and gene/chromosomal copy number alterations related 
to sensitivity or resistance to ixabepilone, other anti -microtubule 
agents and cetuximab.   These additional exploratory analyses m ay 
include, but are not limited to, beta tubulin isoforms, ABC 
transporters, TACC3, HCAPG , GTSE1, Kallikreins  and defined  
gene models associated with ixabepilone response .

Treatment 
Plan:   
This is a randomized open -label phase II trial; 116 triple negative breast 
cancer patients will be randomized equally between 1) Ixabepilone or  
2) Ixabepilone plus Cetuximab.  
TThe study population will include subjects ≥ 18 years of age diagnosed 
with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).    TRandomization will be stratified by 
disease stage (T1N1 -3M0 or T2 -4 N0 -3M0).  
Prior to randomization, all patients will have  a physical assessm ent, 
imaging, a blood draw, and a diagnostic biopsy prior to the start of 
treatment.    
T The study doctor will determine if the subject qualified to be enrolled in this 
study. If subjects are enrolled, the duration of their participation is 
expected to be approximately 6 months   
 
Treatment Arm 1  
Patients will receive Ixabepilone 40mg/m P2
P given over approximately  
3-hours on day 1.  
Patients will receive a total of four cycles of this drug with each cycle  
given 21 (+/- 3) days.   
Subjects will be premedicated approximately 1 hour before the ixabepilone  
 infusion with 1) both an oral H1 blocker  (diphenhydramine 50 mg or

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 12 of 83 1.0 Synopsis : 
Ixabepilone  and capecitabine  combination  has demonstrated to be an active 
regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after failing an 
anthracycline and  a taxane regimen. Cetuximab is active in tumors that express 
EGFR with demonstrated activity in head and neck and colorectal tumors. A 
proportion of b reast cancer s are known to express EGFR. Cetuximab's 
mechanism of action suggests the possibility of effica cy in breast cancer patients  
and several studies show that it may be efficacious in Triple Negative Breast 
Cancer (TNBC) . This study seeks to evaluate Ixabepilone alone or in 
combination with cetuximab as a possible way to increase antitumor activity.  
 
This is a randomized open -label phase II trial , one hundred sixteen triple 
negative breast cancer patients will be randomized equally between 1 ) 
Ixabepilone  or 2) Ixabepilone plus Cetuximab . Randomization will be stratified by 
disease stage (T1N1 -3M0 or T2 -4 N0 -3M0).  
At the  baseline all  patients will receive a physical assessment, imaging, a blood 
draw,  and a biopsy  prior to the start of treatment.   
 
 
1.1 Primary Objective(s):  
To determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) (breast and axilla) of   
Ixabepilone versus Ixabepilone when combined with cetuximab in patients with 
invasive breast adenocarcinoma  T1N1 -N3M0 or T2 -4 N0 -3M0 disease who are 
Triple negative and who are candidates for preoperative chemotherapy.  
 
 
1.2 Secondary Objective(s):  
To evaluate overall objective response rate in both treatment groups.  
To assess  safety and toxicity  of each regimen .

BMS -247550                                           Clinical Protocol                                         Version:     8                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 
Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 13 of 83 1.3 Exploratory Objective(s):  
To correlate the expression of biomarkers such as PTEN, EGFR and EGFR -
pathway associated genes ( including, but not limited to TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, 
KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) with the objective 
clinical and pathologic response.  
For all samples available, the following tests will be conducted:  
 Immunohistochemical detection of  EGFR , and the PTEN  expression in 
tumor tissue samples.   For those  EGFR -pathway associated genes 
(including , but not limited to, TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, 
MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) an mRNA -based assay will be used.   
 Additional exploratory biomar ker analysis may be performed on tumor or 
blood samples during or following the study.  Such exploratory analyses 
may include ass essments  of somatic gene mutation, gene/chromosome 
copy number alteration and gene/protein expression for genes/proteins 
relate d to sensitivity or resistance to ixabepilone, other micro -tubule 
agents and cetuximab.  These exploratory biomarkers may include, but 
are not limited to, beta tubulin isoforms, ABC transporters, TACC3, 
HCAPG, GTSE1, Kallikreins and gene models associated with ixabepilone 
response.  
 
These analyses will allow for the correlation of biomarkers  expression and 
response to treatment.   Tumor tissue samples will be obtained from the original 
paraffin blocks or slides  containing tumor tissue from the initial diagno stic work -
up (see section 7.1) .  
 
 In addition to the diagnostic core needle biopsy  for biomarkers at  baseline a  
second search  for the same biomarkers will be done  at the time of  surgery . 
The following tests will be conducted (prioritized in the order below):  
 EGFR expression by IHC  
 PTEN expression by IHC  
 Estrogen receptor expression by IHC (at baseline  only)

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effectiveness of each 
study group of chemotherapy in triple  negative breast cancer patients, and to 
evaluate the pathologic response rate for each group.    We will be collecting 
tissue from the primary  tumor for biomarker testing; the procedure will be done at 
baseline, and at the time of surgery .

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 17 of 83 2.1 Study Procedures by Visit and Treatment Cycle  
Laboratory analyses and clinical examinations are to be repeated for a total 
treatment duration time of 4 to 6 months. Radiologic examinations are to be 
performed before chemotherapy a nd before surgery (from randomization to 
disease progression  or until surgery).  
The maximum number of treatment cycles allowed is 4.  
The sequence of events for up to 4 cycles is described below.  
2.2 Screening/Baseline visit  
Informed consent must be obtaine d before performing any study -related 
procedures. Screenin g procedures may be done up to 4  weeks prior the start of 
neo-adjuvant therapy. Screening evaluation will include blood work, pregnancy 
testing, medical history, physical exam (including tumor measu rements of the 
breast and lymph node,  height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate and 
temperature) electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Tumor measurements will 
be recorded as the largest dimension in centimeters.  Medical history should 
include relevant underlying conditions and concomitant medications. Baseline 
signs and symptoms are to be recorded and followed throughout the trial. A 
mammography and ultrasound will be performed to assess disease status.  
Prior to initiation of neo -adjuvant therapy, a cor e tumor breast biopsy and blood 
sample will be obtained for baseline biomarkers expression studies.  
If a patient entered the study (i.e. signed informed consent) prior to histological 
confirmation of breast cancer, this biopsy may serve the dual purpose of  
confirming the diagnosis and obtaining tissue for biomarkers research.  
Following confirmation of eligibility, a blocked randomization will be used to 
randomize patients to either arm 1 or arm 2.  A master sequence of 
randomization numbers for each arm wil l be generated.  
For those study patients who voluntarily agree to have an optional serum 
samples taken for biomarkers expression; blood samples will be stored and the 
biomarkers expression will be done at later time (see lab manual).  Patients will

Clinical tumor response in the primary site and in the axilla will be assessed after 
each cycle of treatment and prior to the next treatment  by physical exam .  Three 
to four weeks  after the last treatment with the study drugs patients will be 
assessed for disea se status via mammography and ultrasound as well as clinical 
assessment. Disease progression suspected from clinical tumor response 
assessments during any cycle should be confirmed by mammography and 
ultrasound.

4.0 Introduction, Background and Rationale  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It kills 376,000 women a 
year worldwide, and there are abo ut 900,000 new cases annually. Estimates for 
2007 indicate that breast cancer will cause 180,510 cases of new cancers in the 
United States, accounting for 26% of new cancer cases in women and 40,460 
cancer deaths. Approximately 50% of women are diagnosed w ith localized 
disease. Although many of these women will have an initial good response to 
treatment, 50% to 75% of those diagnosed with early disease will eventually 
relapse. Metastatic breast cancer is largely incurable using conventional therapy, 
with a median survival of 2 to 3 years from manifestation of metastases.  P1 
4.0.1 Current Chemotherapy  
Many chemotherapeutic agents have been demonstrated to be active in MBC, 
including alkylating agents, anti -metabolites, anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, 
Ixabepilone                                              CA163 -157                                                         TMHRI  
BMS -247550                                           Clinical Protocol                                         Version:     8

considered the most active cytotoxic drug classes in breast cancer. As a result, 
both classes of agents are commonly used in the metastatic as well as the 
adjuvant setting. Docetaxel a nd paclitaxel, alone or in combination with other 
chemotherapeutic agents, have shown significant response rates in first - or 
second -line treatment of MBC. As second -line monotherapy, taxanes have had  
response rates in the range of 28% to 55%.  Despite hig h activity, however, 
relapse is common and long -term disease control is rare.  Additionally, many 
subjects fail to respond to taxanes and anthracyclines. Options are limited for 
subjects who have failed prior treatment with both an anthracycline and a taxa ne. 
Capecitabine  alone , and in combination with ixabepilone are currently the only 
chemotherapy agent s specifically approved in regions around the world for the 
treatment of metastatic breast cancer in subjects who have failed or are resistant 
to both an anthracycline and a taxane. P2,3,4  
4.0.2 Epothilones  
The epothilone are a new class of non -taxane tubulin polymerization agents 
obtained by  fermentation of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum . P5 
P The 
chief components of the  fermentation process are epothilones A and B. In 1994, 
the National Cancer Institute  discovered that the epothilones possess potent 
cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activities  of the epothilones, like those of the 
taxanes, have been linked to stabilization of  microtubules, which results in mitotic 
arrest at the G2/M transition. P6,7
P  Importantly , the epothilones are active against 
various taxane -resistant cell lines, including those with  overexpression of the 
multidrug resistance  gene  and BIII tubulin isoforms,  or have tubulin mut ations . 
Ixabepilone is a semi -synthetic derivative of the natural product epothilone B 
specifically designed to overcome the metabolic instability of the natural product 
as demonstrated in preclinical models. Similar to paclitaxel, ixabepilone blocks 
cells in the mitotic phase of the cell division cycle and is a highly potent cytotoxic 
agent capable of killing cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations.  
An important feature of ixabepilone is its antitumor activity in a broad range of 
taxane  sensitive and taxane -resistant preclinical human tumor models. Phase 1 
Ixabepilone                                              CA163 -157                                                         TMHRI  
BMS -247550                                           Clinical Protocol                                         Version:     8                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 
Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 28 of 83 studies of  ixabepilone have demonstrated antitumor activity in cancers of the 
ovary, cervix, colon,  stomach, and breast, as well as in melanoma, non -small -cell 
lung carcinoma, and  non-Hodgkin’s lymph oma. Phase 2 studies of monotherapy 
ixabepilone have  demonstrated notable activity in subjects with both taxane -
sensitive and taxane -resistant  breast cancer as well as in other tumor types. A 
Phase 1/2 study of ixabepilone plus  capecitabine has established  that the 
combination is active in subjects who have failed  prior anthracycline and taxane 
and that the two agents can be safely administered  together, each at efficacious 
doses.  Subset analysis from the recently completed CA163046 study showed 
that subjec ts with HER2 ( ErbB2)  positive metastatic breast cancer  previously 
treated with a taxane and an anthracycline benefit from ixabepilone plus 
capecitabine over capecitabine alone.  
Preclinical Metabolism and Potential for Drug Interactions  
In vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 is the CYP isozyme primarily responsible 
for the oxidative metabolism of ixabepilone in humans. Therefore, 
coadministration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the pharmacokinetics of 
ixabepilone. In vitro studies also suggest that ixabe pilone is a weak inhibitor of 
human CYP3A4. Given that ixabepilone is administered on an intermittent 
schedule (q21 days), is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro (IC50 of  
approximately 3700 ng/mL), and typically has peak plasma concentrations  
of less than 400 ng/mL when administered as a 3 -hour infusion, there is a low 
likelihood of a clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
coadministered medications that are dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism.  
Phase 1 Ixabepilone Monotherapy Studies  
To date, app roximately 2700 subjects have been treated with ixabepilone in the  
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) -sponsored Phase 1 , Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies. P8
P 
Ixabepilone is also being independently evaluated in studies conducted by the 
National Cancer Institute Cancer  Therapy Evaluation Program.  
BMS has sponsored two Phase 1 studies of ixabepilone monotherapy, which 
were designed to establish a recommended dose for Phase 2 studies. CA163 -

P (Of note, the National Cancer Institute has also 
sponsored Phase 1 monotherapy stud ies, which evaluated a variety of 
schedules, including a daily x 5 days q21 -day schedule ). CA163 -001 was an 
open -label dose -escalation study of ixabepilone administered once  
every 3 weeks as a 1 -hour infusion in subjects with advanced malignancies.

P, no dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) were 
observed. First -course DLT was experienced by 2 out of 3 subjects at 65 mg/m P2
P

neutropenia) and by all 3 subjects at 57 mg/m P2
P (Grade 3 arthralgia and myalgia 
in 2 subjects; Grade 4 neutropenia with pneumococcal sepsis and death in 1 
subject). After the maximum tolerated dose was established as 50 mg/m P2
P, a 
cohort of 10 additional subjects were treated at this dose. Severe toxicity  
requiring a dose reduction was observed in only 1 of these subjects (febrile 
neutropenia). Other toxicities included fatigue, weakness, constipation, d iarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, rash, alopecia, and low -grade neuropathy. Antitumor activity 
seen among 22 subjects treated at 50 mg/m P2
P included a complete response in 
ovarian cancer and partial responses in non -small -cell lung cancer and 
melanoma. Due to cum ulative neuropathy observed with the 1 -hour schedule, 
this study was expanded at doses of 40 and 50 mg/m P2
P administered as a 3 -hour 
infusion. As of July 2002, data were available for 12 subjects treated at 40 mg/m P2
P 
over 3 hours for a total of 35 cycles.  The most notable toxicity was neutropenia. 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 2 subjects (17%) but no episodes of febrile 
neutropenia were reported. Sensory or painful peripheral neuropathy of any 
grade was reported in 4 (33%) subjects, all Grade 1.    There were no treatment 
discontinuations due to drug toxicity in this dose cohort. H1 and H2 histamine 
blockers were introduced as routine premedication after hypersensitivity

CA163 -009: Phase 2 Study in Taxane -Resistant MBC  
CA163 -009 was an international multi -institution study conducted in subjects with 
MBC who were resistant to paclitaxel or docetaxel. Ixabepilone was administered 
on Day 1 of an every -21-day cycle. To be eligible, subjects must have had tumor 
progression wi thin 4 months of their last dose of a taxane -containing regimen if 
administered in the metastatic setting, or within 6 months of taxane therapy if 
administered in the adjuvant setting. The taxane regimen must have been the 
last regimen received by the subj ect.   Subjects were required to have

Two Phase 3 open -label, randomized, multicenter, multinational studies in MBC 
have completed enrollment. CA163 -046 has enrolled subjects with taxane -
refractory MBC who have received prior treatment with or are refractory to an 
anthracycline. CA163 -048 has enrolled subjects with MBC who have received 
prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane. Both studies have two 
treatment arms: ixabepilone plus capecitabine or capecitabine alone.  
These results supported the use of ixabepilone plus capecitabine  in two Phase  3 
studies in patients with  breast cancer. Studies CA163046 and CA163048 were 
randomized, multicenter, multinational studies comparing ixabepilone plus 
capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in patients with metastatic breast cancer. 
The primary endpoint of CA163046 was progression -free survival in patients 
previously treated with or resistant to an anthracycline and who are taxane 
resistant. The primary endpoint for CA163048 is overall survival in patients 
previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. P15

PParticipants were required 
to have measurable disease with tum ors that progressed rapidly in the adjuvant 
or metastatic setting after receiving both anthracyclines and taxanes. Eight 
percent of patients were receiving first -line treatment, having relapsed within one 
year of prior anthracycline/taxane therapy in the a djuvant setting; treatment for 
the remaining 92% of patients was as either second - or third -line therapy. Of the 
85% of patients with progression in the metastatic setting following prior taxane, 
42% progressed on taxane therapy. A total of 737 patients re ceived ixabepilone 
(40 mg/m P2
P as a 3 -hour intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of a 21 -day cycle) plus 
capecitabine (2000 mg/m P2
P orally administered in two divided doses each on Days 
1 through 14 of a 21 -day cycle) (n=369) or capecitabine alone (2500 mg/m P2
P on 
the same schedule as the same schedule) (n=368). The primary endpoint was 
progression free survival (PFS) evaluated by blinded Independent Radiology 
Review Committee (IRRC). The addition of ixabepilone to capecitabine resulted 
in a clinically meaning ful and statistically robust improvement in PFS in patients 
with MBC resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes. The improvement in PFS by 
the addition of ixabepilone to capecitabine was consistent across subpopulations, 
including patients with visceral metas tases, >2 sites of metastatic disease, ≥65 
years of age, or with HER2+ breast cancer. P14

significance. P15 
Both Phase 3 studies showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in PFS in favor of the combination of ixabepilone and capecitabine 
over capeci tabine alone. Results of these studies showed an improvement in 
median PFS of 1.6 to 1.8 months and a 21 to 25% reduction in the risk of 
progression. The benefit in PFS was supported by significant improvements in 
objective response rate (ORR) in favor of the combination, including a more than 
doubling of the ORR in CA163046 (35% vs 14%) as assessed by the IRRC. The 
analysis of OS in both studies showed a 0.9 hazard ratio (HR) favoring the 
combination that did not reach statistical significance but was cons istent with the 
absence of a detrimental effect. No other Phase 3 studies conducted in patients 
with breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and a taxane have 
demonstrated a survival benefit. P 14

Peripheral Neuropathy  
Some subjects in these s tudies have experienced ixabepilone -related sensory 
neuropathy that is most often cumulative and reversible. Less frequently, severe 
motor neuropathy, usually presenting with lower extremity weakness, has been 
observed. In addition, there have been rare re ports of autonomic neuropathy. 
Neuropathy may be dose - and time  dependent. In the event of severe peripheral 
neuropathy, ixabepilone treatment was to be discontinued and not resumed until 
the neuropathy returned to baseline or to ≤ Grade 1, as defined by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE). If the neuropathy was greater than Grade 1, dose reductions  were 
warranted, provided the subject qualified for additional treatment.   Peripheral 
neuropathy was a do se-limiting toxicity in Phase 1 monotherapy studies of 
ixabepilone at doses above 50 mg/m P2
Pevery 3 weeks, and cumulative neuropathy 
has commonly been reported in the Phase 2 studies. The neuropathy is dose 
dependent and may also be schedule related. The n europathy is cumulative in 
nature and gradually lessens following the discontinuation of therapy. Subjects 
are typically described as presenting with sensory manifestations (dysesthesias

reported, although less frequently  
(Grade 3/4 -related in 3% of 439 subjects treated across all BMS Phase 2 
studies). Motor neuropathy has been reported only as a related Grade 3/4 
adverse event in 1% of all Phase 2 subjects, and it has only rarely b een 
described in the absence of sensory or painful neuropathy. To date, autonomic 
neuropathy has been reported in only two subjects, both enrolled in Phase 2 
breast cancer studies. One subject developed orthostatic hypotension and 
gastroparesis after 5 cyc les of therapy and the other developed gastroparesis 
after 14 cycles of therapy.    When ixabepilone dose reductions were necessary 
due to toxicity, the first reduction was to be to a dose of 32 mg/m P2
P. The use of the 
32 mg/m P2
P dose has been established in at least two other ixabepilone studies: 
the CA163 -011 study of subjects with non -small cell lung cancer and the CA163 -
116 study of subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. A total  
dose per cycle of 30 mg/m P2
P has also been administered in subjects wi th breast 
cancer (6 mg/m2 daily times 5 every 3 weeks) in studies led by the National 
Cancer Institute.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
The diluent used with ixabepilone is a BMS -purified polyoxyethylated castor oil  
(Cremophor®EL) and has the potential for indu cing a hypersensitivity reaction. In  
clinical studies of ixabepilone, anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions  
(dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, hypotension requiring treatment, syncope,  
bradycardia) that were reported as serious adverse events have occurred in less 
than 1% of subjects. Routine premedication, including H1 and H2 antihistamines 
(not corticosteroids) was instituted after 2 subjects developed severe 
hypersensitivity adverse events (dyspnea and bronchospasm) in the weekly 
Phase 1 mon otherapy study. Since premedication was instituted, the incidence of 
the NCI CTCAE term “hypersensitivity” of any grade is < 1% in 439 subjects 
treated in all BMS -sponsored Phase 2 studies. In addition, 17% of subjects had a 
CTCAE term of “allergy/immunolo gy, other” (of any grade) reported; the majority 
of incidents consisted of skin rash.

Cetuximab is a genetically engineered version of a mouse antibody that contains 
both human and mouse components.   It can be produced in large quantities in 
the laboratory. This new monoclonal antibody is believed to work by targeting a 
natural protein called "epidermal growth factor receptor" (EGFR) on the surface 
of cancer cells, interfering with their growth. Cetuxi mab is a chimeric monoclonal 
antibody, an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibitor with 
demonstrated activity in colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer.  
Cetuximab is believed to operate by binding to the extra cellular domain of the 
EGFR of ce lls that express EGFR, which include “cancer cells ”, preventing ligand 
binding and activation of the receptor. This  blocks the downstream signaling of 
EGFR resulting in impaired cell growth and proliferation. Cetuximab has also 
been shown to mediate antibo dy dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  For 
patients with tumors that express EGFR and who no longer responded to 
treatment with irinotecan alone or in combination  with other chemotherapy drugs, 
the combination treatment of cetuximab and irinotecan shrank tumors in 22.9% of 
patients and delayed tumor growth by approximately 4.1 months. For patients 
who received cetuximab alone, the tumor response rate was 10.8% and tumor

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)  
Cetuximab is indicated in combination with radiation therapy for the initial  
treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck, and as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for whom 
prior pla tinumbased therapy has failed.  
Study 1 was a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial of 424 patients with locally 
or regionally advanced SCCHN. Patients with Stage III/IV SCCHN of the 
oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with no prior therapy were randomi zed (1:1) 
to receive either cetuximab  plus radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone. 
Stratification factors were Karnofsky Performance Status (60 –80 versus 90 –100), 
nodal stage (N0 versus N+), tumor stage (T1 –3 versus T4 using American Joint 
Committee on Cancer 1998 staging criteria), and radiation therapy fractionation 
(concomitant boost versus once -daily versus twice -daily). Radiation therapy was 
administered for 6 –7 weeks as once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost. 
Cetuximab  was administered as  a 400 mg/m 2 initial dose beginning one week 
prior to initiation of radiation therapy, followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly 
administered 1 hour prior to radiation therapy for the duration of radiation therapy 
(6–7 weeks).  
 Of the 424 randomized patients, the media n age was 57 years, 80% were male, 
83% were Caucasian, and 90% had baseline Karnofsky Performance Status ≥80. 
There were 258 patients enrolled in US sites (61%). Sixty percent of patients had 
oropharyngeal, 25% laryngeal, and 15% hypopharyngeal primary tum ors; 28% 
had AJCC T4 tumor stage. Fifty -six percent of the patients received radiation 
therapy with concomitant boost, 26% received once -daily regimen, and 18% 
twice -daily regimen.   The main outcome measure of this trial was duration of 
locoregional contr ol. Overall survival was also assessed. Results are presented

Cetuximab Pre -Clinical Data  
Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers have found that four aberrant genes 
work together to promote the growth of primary breast tumors . Cooperation among 
the four genes also enables cancerous cells to escape into the bloodstream and 
penetrate through blood vessels into lung tissues.   Although shutting off these 
genes individually can slow cancer growth and metastasis, the researchers fo und 
that turning off all four together had a far more dramatic effect on halting cancer 
growth and metastasis.   Metastasis occurs when cells from a primary tumor break 
off and invade another organ. It is the deadliest transformation that a cancer can 
unde rgo, and therefore researchers have been looking for specific genes that propel 
metastasis.   Massagué et al at the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center, also 
found that they could reduce the growth and spread of human breast tumors in mice 
by simultaneo usly targeting two of the proteins produced by these genes, using 
drugs already on the market. The researchers are exploring clinical testing of 
combination therapy with the drugs – cetuximab (Erbitux®) and celecoxib 
(Celebrex®) – to treat breast cancer me tastasis.   In an earlier study, Massagué and 
colleagues had identified 18 genes whose abnormal activity is associated with 
breast cancer’s ability to spread to the lungs. In the new study published in Nature, 
they focused on four of these genes. These gen es, which code for proteins called 
epiregulin, COX2, and matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2, were already known to 
help regulate growth and remodeling of blood vessels.   The researchers silenced 
various combinations of the four genes in human breast cancer  cells that had 
metastasised to the lung, and then tested these cells in mice. To silence the four 
genes, the scientists used a technique called RNA interference, in which RNA 
molecules are tailored to suppress expression of target genes.   The aggressive

aggressive tumors in the mouse mammary gland and also the ability to release cells 
from these tumors into the circulation.  “The remarkable thing was that while 
silencing thes e genes individually was effective, silencing the quartet nearly 
completely eliminated tumor growth and spread."   Microscopic analysis of blood 
vessel structure in the tumors revealed that knocking down all four genes greatly 
reduced growth of the tangle of blood vessels typically seen in tumors. Further 
experiments revealed that the tumor blood vessels that did form allowed fewer 
cancer cells to escape into circulation.   The researchers next explored how loss of 
the four abnormal genes affected the metas tatic capability of the cells in the lung. 
They injected cells deficient in the four genes directly into the circulatory system of 
mice. "When these cells reached the lung capillaries, they just got stuck there,"   
Cetuximab is an antibody that blocks the action of epiregulin and is used to treat 
advanced colorectal cancer. Celecoxib is an inhibitor of COX2 that is used as an 
anti-inflammatory, and is being tested in clinical trials against many types of cancer. 
The researchers also tested whether cetuximab  and celecoxib would work effectively 
in concert to reduce metastasis in mice.  The combination of these two inhibitory 
drugs was effective, even though the drugs individually were not very effective.   
The establishment of distant metastases depends on th e capacity of small numbers 
of cancer cells to regenerate a tumor after entering a target tissue. The mechanisms 
that confer this capacity remain to be defined. Here we identify a role for the 
transcriptional inhibitors of differentiation Id1 and Id3 as se lective mediators of lung 
metastatic colonization in the triple negative [TN, i.e., lacking expression of estrogen 
receptor and progesterone receptor, and lacking Her2 (human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2) amplification] subgroup of human breast cance r. Although broad 
expression of Id1 has recently been documented in tumors of the rare metaplastic 
subtype, here we report that rare Id1 -expressing cells are also present in the more 
common TN subset of human breast tumors but not in other subtypes. We als o 
provide evidence that Id1 expression is enriched in clinically obtained hormone 
receptor negative lung metastases. Functional studies demonstrate that Id1 and its 
closely related family member Id3 are required for tumor initiating functions, both in

received a median of 2 cycles (range: 1 -11) of treatment. Confirmed RR was 
11% ( 95% CI: 1 -33%), with 1 PR and 1 CR. One pt had stable disease for 11 
cycles. RR and clinical benefit rate (CBR: RR + stable > 6 months) for Tneg vs 
non- Tneg was 18% vs 0% (p=0.49) and 27% vs 0% (p=0.23). 12 pts progressed 
on therapy within 2 cycles. With low response rate and rapid progression, the 
study closed early. NCI CTC version 3 grade 3 -4 adverse events occurred in 10 
pts; only dermatologic toxicity (derm tox) had a > 5% incidence (26%). Patients 
with grade U> U 2 derm tox had a CBR of 21% (3/14) vs 0% in patients with grade 0 -
1. 18 pts have progressed with a median time to progression of 1.4 mos (95% CI: 
1.1-2.2 mos). 15 pts have died with a median overall survival of 9.4 mos (95% CI: 
3.3-16.1 mos). UGT1A1 results will be presented. Conclusions: Irin otecan and 
cetuximab has minimal activity in this population. Tolerability is acceptable. There 
was a numerically higher CBR in Tneg pts and patients with grade U> U 2 derm tox, 
but small pt numbers limit conclusions. Better predictive factors for response to

Preliminary results of a randomized phase II study of weekly Irinotecan 
/carboplatin with or without cetuximab in patients with metastati c breast 
cancer.  O'Shaughnessy and colleagues also presented data on the use of 
cetuximab in a randomized phase 2 study of weekly irinotecan (90 mg/m P2
P) and 
carboplatin (AUC 2), with or without cetuximab (250 mg/m P2
P). In the overall 
intention -to-treat study population, response rate improved marginally from 28% 
to 33% with the addition of cetuximab. Approximately half of the study population 
(78 patients) had triple -negative tumors. In that subgroup, cetuximab was 
associated with a response rate of 49% compared with 30% when chemotherapy 
was used alone. No significant differences in PFS or overall survival were 
observed in any subgroup, and significant toxicity led to dose reductions in 
starting doses of the chemother apy agents. Based on the available evidence, 
there is little reason to believe that either single -agent cetuximab or a small 
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR will have substantial activity in the

4.0. 4.  Biomarkers Rationale Assessments:  
EGFR  
Epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs) are the prototypic members of a 
family of growth factors derived from membrane -anchored precursors. All 
members of this family are characterized by the presence of at least one EGFR 
structural unit in their extracellular domain. TIncreased expressio n and activation 
of receptor tyrosine kinases P 
Poccurs frequently in  human breast carcinomas.  
Roughly 35% breast cancers express EGFR as ascertained by IHC and its 
expressed with a 2 -fold higher frequency in hormone receptor negative breast 
cancers compared to hormone receptor positive breast cancers .P24,25,26
P  
A wide variety of in vitro  and in vivo biological effects have been ascribed to EGF 
and other members of the EGF family. EGF promotes proliferation and 
differentiation of mesenchymal and epithelial cells.   EGF family ligand -receptor 
signaling is implicated in a wide variety of human carcinoma s.   Several therapies P 
Ptargeting these receptors are currently in clinical trials and therapeutic strategies 
including  blockag e of individual receptors P 
Pwith monoclonal antibodies and 
inhibition of tyrosine kinase P 
Pfunction. P  27, 28, 29    
PInsufficient data exists to suggest a 
link between EGFR protein expression and response to EGFR inhibitors in breast 
cancer .P 30 
PTEN  
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3 kinase pathway, 
which is downstream of EGFR.  Loss of PTEN p rotein expression, attributed to 
loss of heterozygosity and/or post -transcriptional modification, is exhibited in 16 – 
37% of breast cancers P31, 32
P.  PTEN -loss is significantly associated with HR -

PStudies  has been shown to confer resistance to 
EGFR inhibitors in vitro  in breast cancer cells and to predict response to Erbitux 
in metastatic  colorectal cancers P36, 37, 38
P. 
 
 
EGFR -associated signature genes  
Hoadley et al showed that the expression of a number of EGFR -pathway related 
genes are associated with the basal -like subtype, including: TGF -, CRYAB, 
NRAS, KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes.  In addition, this 
group identified three gene signatures that correlated with EGFR activity in vitro 
that could be identified in two breast cancer patient cohorts .  While the genes in 
these si gnatures do not appear to be directly related to the EGFR pathway, they 
may still have predictive value. P 39 
 
Other exploratory biomarkers  
Additional exploratory biomarkers related to ixabepilone, anti -microtubule and 
cetuximab sensitivity and resistance m ay be assessed.  Markers shown to have 
an association with paclitaxel resistance, include beta tubulin isoforms, 
specifically beta III tubulin  P40
P and ABC transporter expression, specifically MDR1 
and MRP7 P41
P.  The capacity of these biomarkers to predict  response to 
ixabepilone has not been established, as yet.   Preliminary analyses  have 
suggested that several gene models , including TACC3, HCAPG, GTSE1, 
Kallikreins and pre -defined gene sets, may be able to differentiate ixabepilone 
activity from paclitaxe l activity.   These models were derived from a comparison of  
gene expression patterns of pathological CR patients in microarray data available 
from two neoadjuvant breast cancer studies, CA163 -080 (ixabepilone 
monotherapy) and MDA -133 (paclitaxel -FAC combin ation therapy)  P42

Patients who experience unacceptable cetuximab toxicity o r who are determined 
to have progressive disease  as defined by RECIST  during any cycle will be 
discontinued from the ixabepilone plus cetuximab arm.   However if the toxicity is 
related with cetuximab only; then ixabepilone will be given on a regular basis until 
the neoadjuvant cycles are completed.  
Patients who are deemed not appropriate for further chemotherapy will proceed 
to local therapy (surgical intervention or radiation therapy).  
 
 
 
7.4 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment:   
Subjects MUST discontinue study treatment (investigational or noninvestigational  
treatment) for any of the following reasons :  
• Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason).  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or  intercurrent illness  
which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in 
the study is not in the best interest of the subject.  
• Pregnancy.  
• Termination of the study by the sponsor, by the local IRB  or by the 
supporting/f unding organization Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)  
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary  
incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious 
disease) illness.  
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol -
specified  follow -up procedures.  The only exception to this requirement is when a

psychiatric or physical illness).  
If a subject was withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal 
must be entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page.  
 
7.5 Surgical  Intervention  
Approxim ately 3-4 weeks  following completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy a 
clinical assessment and repeat mammography and ultrasound will be performed. 
The patient will then proceed to breast and axillary surgery as judged by the 
treating physician . Surgery should  be performed approximately 3 - 4 weeks 
after the last dose of neoadjuvant ixabepilone or Ixabepilone plus 
cetuximab regimen  or at resolution of  possible hematological or infective 
complication. Reasons for delaying surgery in  individual patients must be 
recorded in source documentation.  
 
8.0 CRI TERIA FOR RESPONSE  
8.0.1 PATHOLOGICAL RESP ONSE : The histologic response after treatment will 
be evaluated in the primary tumor and in the axillary lymph nodes removed by 
axillary dissection. In the primary tumor, cellular modifications will be evaluated in 
both the infiltrating tumoral component and in the possible ductal component, if 
applicable:  
− Analysis  of the viable residual infiltrating component (% of total tumoral mass)  
− Analysis  of the residual ductal co mponent (% of total tumoral mass)  
− Determination  of the mitotic index.  
In the axillary lymph nodes: analysis of the viable residual component.  
The criteria of pathological response will be defined according to the Sataloff  
Classification P46

8.0.2 RECIST Criteria  
The main endpoint in this study is t o determine the pathologic complete response 
rate (pCR) (breast and axilla) of  Ixabepilone versus Ixabepilone when combined 
with cetuximab in patients with invasive breast adenocarcinoma  T1N1 -N3M0 or 
T2-4 N0 -3M0 disease who are Triple negative and who are candidates for 
preoperative chemotherapy.  
The clinical t umor response will be assessed usi ng RECIST criteria  at baseline 
and before surgery .  
RECIST criteria offer a simplified, conservative, extraction of imaging data for 
wide application in clinical trials. They presume that linear measures are an 
adequate substitute for 2 -D methods and regis ter four response categories TP47
TP:  
 CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions  
 PR (partial response) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter     
           of target lesions  
 PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest     
           diameter of target lesions  
 SD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet above criteria

Handling and Dispensing of Investigational Product  
The investigational product should be stored in a secure  area according to local 
regulations. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the 
investigational product is dispensed only to study patients. The investigational 
product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized pe rsonnel, 
according to local regulations.  
Storage Requirements/Stability  
Ixabepilone for Injection should be stored refrigerated at 2 C to 8C (36F to 
46F) and protected from light. Vehicle for Constitution should be stored at 2 C to 
25C (36F to 77F). If the vehicle is refrigerated, it must be allowed to warm to 
room temperature before constitution of the lyophile. After initial constitution with 
the accompanying vehicle, the solution may be stored in the vial for a maximum 
of 1 hour at room temperature  and room light. The constituted solution should not 
be stored in the syringe. After final dilution with Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP 
(LRI) to ixabepilone concentrations between 0.2 and 0.6  mg/mL, the solution is 
stable when stored at room temperature and room light for a maximum of 
6 hours. Administration of the entire infusion volume must be completed within 
the 6 -hour time period as noted above.  
Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is specified because it has a pH range of 6 to 
7.5, which is required to  maintain ixabepilone stability. Other diluents should not 
be used with ixabepilone.

ixabepilone kit must be stored in a refrigerator at 2  C - 8 C (36 F - 46 F) in the 
original package to protect from light. Prior to constituting ixab epilone for 
injection, the kit should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to stand at 
room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. When the vials are first removed 
from the refrigerator, a white precipitate may be observed in the diluent vial. T his 
precipitate will dissolve to form a clear solution once the diluent warms to room 
temperature. To allow for withdrawal losses, the vial labeled as 15 mg 
ixabepilone for injection contains 16 mg of ixabepilone and the vial labeled as 45 
mg ixabepilone f or injection contains 47 mg of ixabepilone. The 15 -mg 
ixabepilone kit is supplied with a vial providing 8 mL of the diluent and the 45 -mg 
ixabepilone kit is supplied with a vial providing 23.5 mL of the diluent. After 
constituting with the diluent, the con centration of ixabepilone is 2  mg/mL.  
A. To constitute:  
1) With a suitable syringe, aseptically withdraw the diluent and slowly inject it 
into the ixabepilone for injection vial. The 15 -mg ixabepilone is constituted 
with 8 mL of diluent and the 45 -mg ixabepil one is constituted with 23.5 mL of 
diluent.  
2) Gently swirl and invert the vial until the powder in ixabepilone is completely 
dissolved.  
B. To dilute:  
Before administration, the constituted solution must be further diluted only with 
normal saline (NS) or  Lactated Ringer’s Injection;  USP (LRI) supplied in DEHP 
[di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] free bags. For most doses, a 250 mL bag of LRI is 
sufficient. However, it is necessary to check the final infusion concentration of 
each dose based on the volume of NS or  LRI to be used. The final concentration

infusion concentration, use the following formulas:  
Total Infusion Volume = mL of Constituted Solution + mL of LRI  
Final Infusion Concentra tion = Dose of ixabepilone  (mg)/Total Infusion 
Volume (mL)   
1) Aseptically, withdraw the appropriate volume of constituted solution 
containing 2 mg of ixabepilone per mL.  
2) Aseptically, transfer to an intravenous (IV) bag containing an appropriate 
volume of LRI  to achieve the final desired concentration of ixabepilone.  
3) Thoroughly mix the infusion bag by manual rotation.  
The infusion solution must be administered through an appropriate in -line filter 
with a microporous membrane of 0.2 to 1.2 microns. DEHP -free in fusion 
containers and administration sets must be used. Any remaining solution should 
be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics.  
Incompatibilities  
To minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer di -(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEH P), which may be leached by Cremophor from some brands of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) infusion bags or administration sets, diluted ixabepilone solutions 
should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polyethylene, 
polypropylene, polyolef in, ethylene -vinyl-acetate) and administered either 
through polyethylene -lined administration sets or through PVC sets plasticized 
with TOTM (trioctyl trimellitate). Intravenous infusion sets and components 
typically used to administer paclitaxel have been  found to be compatible with 
infusions of ixabepilone.

10.  Adverse Events  
10.1 Common side effects of ixabepilone:  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the 
adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly 
compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in 
clinical practice.   Unless otherwise specified, assessment of adverse reactions is 
based on one randomized study (Study 0 46) and one single -arm study (Study 
081). In Study 046, 369 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with 
Ixabepilone 40 mg/m P2
P administered intravenously over 3 hours every 21 days, 
combined with capecitabine 1000 mg/m P2
Ptwice daily for 2 week s followed by a 1 -
week rest period. Patients treated with  capecitabine as monotherapy (n=368) in 
this study received 1250 mg/m P2
P twice daily for 2  weeks every 21 days. In Study 
081, 126 patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer were tre ated 
with Ixabepilone 40 mg/m P2
P administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 
weeks.   The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) reported by patients 
receiving Ixabepilone were peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue/asthenia, 
myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia , nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, diarrhea, and 
musculoskeletal pain.   The following additional reactions occurred in ≥20% in 
combination treatment: palmarplantar  erythrodysesthesia (hand -foot) syndrome, 
anorexia, abdominal pain, nail disorder,  and constipation. The most common 
hematologic abnormalities (>40%) include neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia.   NCI CTC grading for febrile neutropenia ranges from Grade 
3 to 5. Three patients (1%) experienced Grade 5 (fatal) febrile ne utropenia. Other 
neutropenia -related deaths (9) occurred in the absence of reported febrile 
neutropenia.  Peripheral sensory neuropathy (graded with the NCI CTC scale) 
was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: areflexia, burning 
sensation, dys esthesia, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, hyporeflexia, neuralgia, 
neuritis, neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral,  neurotoxicity, painful response to 
Ixabepilone                                              CA163 -157                                                         TMHRI

DRUG INTERACTIONS  
Effect of Other Drugs on Ixabepilone Drugs That May Increase Ixabepilone 
Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Co-administration of ixabepilone with 
ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased ixabepilone AUC by 79% 
compared to ixabepilone treatment alone. If alternative treatment c annot be 
administered, a dose adjustment should be considered. The effect of mild or 
moderate inhibitors ( e.g. erythromycin, fluconazole, or verapamil) on exposure to 
ixabepilone has not been studied. Therefore, caution should be used when 
administering mi ld or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with  
Ixabepilone, and alternative therapeutic agents that do not inhibit CYP3A4 should 
be considered. Patients receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with 
Ixabepilone should be monitored closely for acute toxicities (eg, frequent 
monitoring of peripheral blood counts between cycles of ixabepilone). Drugs That 
May Decrease Ixabepilone Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4  Inducers: 
ixabepilone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Strong CYP3A4 inducers  
(eg, dexamethasone, ph enytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifampicin, rifabutin,  
and phenobarbital) may decrease ixabepilone concentrations leading to  
subtherapeutic levels. Therefore, therapeutic agents with low enzyme induction 
potential should be considered for coadministrati on with ixabepilone. St. John's 
Wort may decrease ixabepilone plasma concentrations unpredictably and should 
be avoided.    Effect of Ixabepilone on Other Drugs Ixabepilone does not inhibit 
CYP enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations and is not expecte d to alter the 
plasma concentrations of other drugs.    In patients with cancer who received 
ixabepilone (40 mg/m P2
P) in combination with capecitabine (1000 mg/m P2
P), 
ixabepilone Cmax decreased by 19%, capecitabine Cmax decreased by 27%,

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION  
Pregnancy Category D : Ixabepilone may cause fetal harm when administered to 
pregnant women. There are no adequate and well -controlled studies with 
Ixabepilone in pregnant women. Women should be advised not to become 
pregnant when taking Ixabepilone. If this drug is used durin g pregnancy, or if the 
patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised 
of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
Ixabepilone was studied for effects on embryo -fetal development  in pregnant 
rats and rabbits given IV doses of 0.0 2, 0.08, and 0.3 mg/kg/day and 0.01, 0.03, 
0.11 and 0.3 mg/kg/day, respectively.   There were no teratogenic effects.   In 
rats, an increase in resorptions and post -implantation loss and a decrease in the 
number of live fetuses and fetal weight was observe d at the maternally toxic dose 
of 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately one -tenth the human clinical exposure based on 
AUC). Abnormalities included a reduced ossification of caudal vertebrae, 
sternebrae, and metacarpals. In rabbits, ixabepilone caused maternal toxi city 
(death) and embryo -fetal toxicity (resorptions) at 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 
one-tenth the human clinical dose based on body surface area). No fetuses were 
available at this dose for evaluation.  
Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether ixabepilone is excreted into human 
milk. Following intravenous administration of radiolabeled ixabepilone to rats on 
days 7 to 9 postpartum, concentrations of radioactivity in milk were comparable 
with those in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentra tions. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ixabepilone, a decision must be 
made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue ixabepilone taking into 
account th e importance of the drug to the mother.  
Pediatric Use:  The safety and effectiveness of ixabepilone in pediatric patients 
have not been established.

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 71 of 83 Geriatric Use:  Clinical studies of ixabepilone did not include sufficient numbers 
of subjects aged sixty  five and over to determine whether they respond differently 
from younger subjects. Forty -five of 431 patients treated with ixabepilone in 
combination with capecitabine were ≥65 years of age and 3 patients were ≥75. 
Overall, the incidence of grade 3/4 adve rse reactions were higher in patients ≥65 
years of age versus those <65 years of age (82% versus 68%) including grade 
3/4 stomatitis (9% versus 1%), diarrhea (9% versus 6%), palmar -plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (27% versus 20%), peripheral neuropathy  (24% 
versus 22%), febrile neutropenia (9% versus 3%), fatigue (16% versus 12%), and 
asthenia (11% versus 6%). Toxicity -related deaths occurred in 2 (4.7%) of 43 
patients ≥65 years with normal baseline hepatic function or mild impairment.  
Thirty -two of 24 0 breast cancer patients treated with ixabepilone as monotherapy 
were  ≥65 years of age and 6 patients were ≥75. No overall differences in safety 
were observed in these patients compared to those <65 years of age.  
Hepatic Impairment: Ixabepilone was evalua ted in 56 patients with mild to severe 
hepatic impairment defined by bilirubin levels and AST levels. Compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function (n=17), the area under the curve (AUC0 -
infinity) of ixabepilone increased by:  
• 22% in patients with a)  bilirubin >1 – 1.5 x ULN or b) AST >ULN but bilirubin  
<1.5 x ULN;  
• 30% in patients with bilirubin >1.5 – 3 x ULN and any AST level; and  
• 81% in patients with bilirubin >3 x ULN and any AST level.  
Doses of 10 and 20 mg/m2 as monotherapy were tolerated  in 17 patients with  
severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >3 x ULN).  Ixabepilone in combination with 
capecitabine must not be given to patients with AST or ALT >2.5 x ULN or 
bilirubin >1 x ULN.   
Dose reduction is recommended when administering Ixabepilon e as 
monotherapy to patients with hepatic impairment Because there is a need for 
dosage adjustment based upon hepatic function, assessment of hepatic function 
is recommended before initiation of Ixabepilone and periodically thereafter .

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 72 of 83 Renal Impairment: Ixabepilone is minimally excreted via the kidney. No controlled 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with Ixabepilone in patients with renal 
impairment. Ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine has not been evaluated 
in patients with calculated creati nine clearance of <50 mL/min. ixabepilone as 
monotherapy has not been evaluated in patients with creatinine >1.5 times ULN. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Ixabepilone as monotherapy, there 
was no meaningful effect of mild and moderate renal in sufficiency (CrCL >30 
mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone .  
OVERDOSAGE  
One case of overdose of Ixabepilone has been reported. The patient mistakenly  
received 100 mg/m P2
P (total dose 185 mg) and was admitted to the hospital for 
observation. The  patient experienced myalgia (grade 1) and fatigue (grade 1) 
one day after infusion and was treated with a centrally acting analgesic. The 
patient recovered and was discharged without incident.  There is no known 
antidote for overdosage of Ixabepilone. In case of overdosage, the patient should 
be closely monitored, and supportive treatment should be administered.  
Management of overdose should include supportive medical interventions to treat 
the presenting clinical manifestations. P  43, 44  
10.2 Common side effects of cetuximab:  
Dermatologic toxicities, including acneform rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial inflammation, and infectious sequelae (for example S. aureus sepsis, 
abscess formation, cellulitis, blepharitis, cheilitis) occurred in patients receiving 
cetuximab  therapy. Acneform rash occurred in 76 –88% of 1373 patients 
receiving cetuximab  in clinical trials. Severe acneform rash occurred in 1 –17 % of 
patients.     Acneform rash usually developed within the first two weeks of 
therapy and resolved in a majority of the patients after cessation of treatment, 
although in nearly half, the event continued beyond 28 days. Monitor patients 
receiving cetuximab  for dermato logic toxicities and infectious sequelae. Instruct 
patients to limit sun exposure during cetuximab therapy.   Acne -like rash (88%), 
nausea, vomiting (55%, 41%) tiredness or weakness (73%), diarrhea (72%), 
abdominal pain (55%) more serious side -effects are rarer, but include: infusion

(2%), pulmonary embolism (1%).  
Serious infusion reactions, requiring medical intervention and immediate, 
permanent discontinuation of cetuximab  included rapid onset of airway 
obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, and/or cardiac 
arrest. Severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 and 4) infusion reactions occurred in 2 –5% of 
1373 patients in clinical trials, with fatal outcome in 1 patient.  
Appr oximately 90% of severe infusion reactions occurred with the first infusion 
despite premedication with antihistamines.    In patients evaluated during clinical 
trials, hypomagnesemia occurred in 55% of patients (199/365) receiving 
cetuximab  and was severe (NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4) in 6 –17%. The onset of 
hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities occurred days to 
months after initiation of cetuximab . Periodically monitor patients for 
hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, during and for at least 8 
weeks following the completion of cetuximab .  
The safety of cetuximab  in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin has 
not been established. Death and serious cardiotoxicity were observed in a single -
arm trial with cetuximab , radiation th erapy, and cisplatin (100 mg/m P2
P) in patients 
with locally advanced SCCHN. Two of 21 patients died, one as a result of 
pneumonia and one of an unknown cause. Four patients discontinued treatment 
due to adverse events. Two of these discontinuations were due to cardiac 
events.  
It is not known whether cetuximab , is secreted in human milk since IgG 
antibodies, such as cetuximab , can be excreted in human milk. Because many 
drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious 
adverse react ions in nursing infants from cetuximab , a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother. If nursing is interrupted, based on the 
mean half -life of cetuximab, nursing should not be resumed earlier than 60 days 
following the last dose of cetuximab .  P45, 50, 51

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 74 of 83 Adverse Event (AE) related to the study is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharm aceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this  treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with th e use of ixabepilone whether or not considered 
related to ixabepilone.  
During this clinical trial, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited 
during open -ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order 
to prevent reporti ng bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the 
specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.)  
 
 
A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:   
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the pati ent was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),  
 requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing 
hospitalization,  
 results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
 results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse,  
 is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or r esult in death or hospitalization but, based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient  
or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)  Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency

10.3 Reporting  of SAEs  
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs 
should be collected and reported, including those thought to be associated with 
clinical trial procedures. Following study completion, any SAE thought to be 
related to study drug or clinical trial procedures should also be reported to the 
sponsor: The Methodist Hospital Research Institute and the local IRB.  
SAE terminology and severity grading will be based on (CTCAEv3).  
The following cat egories and definitions of causal relationship to study drug 
should be considered for use for this clinical study.  
 Certain: There is a known causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE. The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge ), and 
recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasible. (>95% certainty)  
 Probable: There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug 
and the SAE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not 
required. (65% -95% probability)  
 Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and 
the SAE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear. (35% -65% probability 
of relatedness)  
 Not likely: There is temporal relationship to study drug administration, but 
there is not a reas onable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE. (5 -35% probability of relatedness)  
 Not related: There is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration 
(too early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is known causal

 Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and 
reporting to the sponsor (TMHRI) and local IRB to comply with regulatory 
requirements.  
 All serious AEs whether related or unrelated to ixabepilone, must be 
immediately reported to the sponsor (TMHRI) by the investigator or 
designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. If only limited 
information is initially availab le, follow -up reports are required.  The 
original SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.

 For studies conducted under an UInvestigator IND U, any event that is both 
serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible 
and, in no event, later than 7 days (death or life -threatening event) or 15 
days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of 
the information.  The Methodist  Hospital Research Institute

 Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely 
important.  Full descriptions of each event will be followed by the 
sponsor. Thus, follow -up information which becomes available as the 
SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospital 
discharge summaries and autopsy reports), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the init ial report, and 
immediately sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.  
 An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion of any 
dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically 
important.  For reporting purpos es, the sponsor considers an 
overdose, regardless of adverse outcome, as an important medical 
event.  
 AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, and reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. This also applies to subjects 
experiencing AEs that cau se interruption or discontinuation of 
ixabepilone, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of 
their participation in the study; such subjects should receive post -
treatment follow -up as appropriate.  
In BMS supported trials, all SAEs must be collected which occur within 30  days 
of discontinuation of dosing or completion of the patient ’s participation in the 
study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  In addition, the Investigator 
should notify BMS of any SAE that may occur after this time period which they 
believe to be certainly, probably or possibly related to ixabepilone. P 48

12.1 Sample size estimate  
The published study CA163 -080 has shown that the pathological complete 
response (pCR) rate is 18% based on a single agent Ixabepilone data, and is the 
same percentage that we assume for patients that will be treated with 
ixabepilone (Treatment Arm 1). With total 108 patients (54 in each arm), we will 
be able to detect 25% difference in pCR rates between the arm with Ixabelpilone 
plus Cetuximab (Treatment Arm 2) and Arm 1 with 81.9% power and a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05. A total of 116 patients will be enrolled to allow for 6.5% 
dropout before randomization of 108 patients. Table 1 provides power estimates 
to detect hypothesized 25%, 27%, 29%, and 31 % difference in pCR rate in the 
treatment am 1 compared to the treatment arm 2 with given sample size of 54 
patients in each arm.

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 79 of 83 will be analyzed according to the treatment arm to which patients were 
randomized, regar dless of compliance to assigned treatment. U USummary statistics 
will be provided for overall response rates and pCR rates by treatment arm. U The 
different rates between treatment arms will be compared by Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test. . Logistic regression models will be used to assess the association 
between expression of biomarkers (such as PTEN, EGFR and EGFR -pathway 
associated genes (including, but not limited to TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, 
AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) from the baseline and th e 
overall objective or pathologic response, controlled by treatment arm, age, and 
disease stage. The unpaired t -test will be applied to compare the difference of 
expression of biomarkers between the baseline and at surgery in the two arms. 
Benjamini and Ho chberg adjustment will be used to adjust multiple comparisons 
in expressions of all marks.  Safety and toxicity of each regimen will be tabulated 
by type and grade at the end of chemotherapy. . Radiographic efficacy 
assessment will be performed on all pati ents at the end of chemotherapy. 
Statistical significance is defined as 2 -tailed p=0.05 level. Stata Version 10 
(College Station, TX) will be used for all statistical analyses.  
12.3 Interim data analysis  
Safety  
Interim data analysis for monitoring safety w ill be conducted at every cycle for the 
two arms. Severity of adverse effects will be reported to the Data Monitoring 
Committee as part of the interim study reports.  
Interim data analysis for monitoring e fficacy  is not applicable for this protocol.

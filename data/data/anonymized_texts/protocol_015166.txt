SUMMARY  OF ADDENDUM  
 
Protocol  Number:  ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol Title:  An Open -Label  Extension  Study  to Assess  the Long -Term  Safety  and 
Efficacy of ISIS 420915 in Patients with Familial Amyloid

Protocol  Amendment:  5 
Addendum  Number:  1 
Addendum  Date:  13 May 2020  
 
 
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic,  patients  participating  in ISIS 420915 -CS3 may be prevented 
from attending study visits at study centers because of the policies of the centers (or the 
institution in which they are located), governmental restrictions on movement, or a patient’s 
desire to minimize risk of infection.  
In ISIS 420915 -CS3,  visits to study  centers  are required  only for the study  visits  in Week  24 and 
Week 52 of Treatment Years 2, 3, 4, and 5 (all current study participants have progressed past 
Year 1).  Therefore, the Sponsor issued guidance, on 17 March 2020, to the study cente rs with 
patients actively participating in ISIS 420915 -CS3 that the Week 24 and Week 52 visits may be 
conducted remotely.  The memorandum is attached as Appendix A . 
Briefly, when patients do not attend on -site Week 26 or Week 52 visits, telephone contact 
between  site staff and patients  is required  to collect  adverse  event  and concomitant  medication 
usage information and to assess the patients’ general well -being.  Collection of specimens for 
serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis is also required.  Where possible, collection of 
specimens for the other laboratory tests specified for the visit are also to be collected.

To: Tegsedi  ISIS 420915 -CS3 ARG  and BRA Study  Investigators  and Site Personnel 
From:  Ionis Clinical Management Team  
RE: Study  Modifications  due to Coronavirus  or COVID -19 
Date:  17 MAR 2020  
 
 
Given the rapid spread of the Coronavirus, or COVID -19, it is critical that we do our best to 
mitigate  the impact  of this outbreak,  prevent  illness,  and ensure  patient  safety  while  patients  are 
participating in ISIS 420915 -CS3.  
Ionis  understands  the need  for flexibility  and modifications  during  this time of heightened 
COVID -19 risk.  For the next month, and continuing on a month by month basis:  
• All study  visits  including  the semi -annual  visits  required  to be on-site (Wk 26 and 52) by 
the protocol may be conducted remotely.  
• In place  of the semi -annual  required  on-site visits  (Wk 26 and 52), 
o We require  a telephone  contact  with the patient(s)  to collect  AE(s)  and conmed 
usage information and to assess the patient’s general well -being.  
o We require  collection  of specimens  for serum  chemistry,  hematology,  and 
urinalysis.  
o Where possible, we ask for collection of specimens for the other laboratory tests 
[thyroid  panel,  the coagulation  panel  (PT, aPTT,  INR),  retinol,  hs-CRP,  PD panel, 
NT-proBNP, immunogenicity, and trough PK] if specified by protocol.  
• For the Wk 13 and 39 visits  and all of the Additional  Visits,  the protocol  specified 
collections should be performed.  
• Should  a patient  report  any symptoms  that are concerning,  the PI can triage  the patient 
accordingly.  
• Protocol  Deviations  will need  to be entered  for any efficacy  measure  not performed  due 
to the COVID -19 outbreak.  
Ionis  will continue  to assess  these  modifications  and will update  this guidance  on a monthly 
basis as we monitor the COVID -19 outbreak.  Please escalate any concerns to the Clinical 
Study Management Team, as we continue to stay in operation.

PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  
 
 
Protocol  Number:  ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  Title:  An Open -Label  Extension  Study  to Assess  the Long -Term  Safety  
and Efficacy  of ISIS 420915  in Patients  with Familial  Amyloid 
Polyneuropathy (FAP)  
Amendment  Number:  5 
Amendment  Date:  22 Feburary  2017  
 
 
The main  purpose  of this amendment  is to provide  the opportunity  for patients  to receive  a fourth 
and fifth year of treatment with a modified assessment schedule if at the end of 3 years of 
treatment ISIS 420915 is not commercially available in the country of the patient.  
Minor changes (not included in the list of changes below) have been made t hroughout the 
protocol  to correct  errors and/or  to improve  the overall  clarity  of the original  protocol  but these 
changes do not impact subject safety, exposure, or the overall study design.  
The following  table  provides  a summary  list of major  changes  to the protocol;  added  text in 
underlined bold, deleted text in strikethrough:

3.1 Study  Design  
3.4.3  Post-Treatment  If at the end of 3 years of  treatment,  
ISIS 420915  is not commercially  available  
in the country of the patient, the patient  
may continue to  receive treatment  in this 
study for up to 2 years more or until  
ISIS 420915 becomes commercially  
available in the patient’s country,  
whichever occurs earlier.  At the end of  
the 5 years of treatment with ISIS 420915  
in this study, if ISIS 420915 is not  
commercially available, patien ts may be  
allowed to continue receiving treatment  
with ISIS 420915 via an early access route  
to be defined by the Sponsor and  
depending on local regulations.  After 
completing the treatment period, patients will 
enter the 3 -month post -treatment evaluation 
period.  If a patient discontinues treatment  
in this study, but is continuing to receive  
treatment with ISIS 420915 via another  
mechanism, the entry of the patient into  
the 3 -month post -treatment evaluation  
period may be omitted.  Alternatively, after  
complet ing the 3 year  treatment  period  (Week  
156 visit), a patient may be offered the  
opportunity to continue to receive ISIS  To provide  the opportunity  for patients  to 
receive a fourth and fifth year of 
treatment if at the end of 3 years of 
treatment, ISIS 420915 is not 
commercially available in the country of

PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol  Title An Open -Label Extension Study to Assess the Long -Term Safety and 
Efficacy  of ISIS 420915  in Patients  with Familial  Amyloid  Polyneuropathy 
(FAP)  
Study  Phase  3 
Indication  Familial  Amyloid  Polyneuropathy  
Primary  Objective  To evaluate  the safety  and tolerability  of extended  dosing  with ISIS 420915  in 
patients with Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy  
Secondary  Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy of extended dosing with ISIS 420915, based on 
change  from baseline  and progression  rates,  if applicable,  in the following 
measures:  
• Modified  Neuropathy  Impairment  Score  +7 (mNIS+7)  
• Norfolk  Quality  of Life-Diabetic  Neuropathy  (Norfo lk QOL -DN) 
questionnaire:  
o total score (all  patients)  
o symptoms  domain  score (Stage  1 patients)  
o physical  functioning/large  fiber neuropathy  domain  score  (Stage  2 
patients)  
• Modified  body  mass  index  (mBMI)  and body  mass  index  (BMI)  
• NIS, heat-pain sensory,  touch -pressure  sensory,  nerve  conduction 
and heart rate to deep breathing tests (components of mNIS+7)  
• Polyneuropathy  disability  score  (PND)  
• Global longitudinal strain (GLS) by echocardiogram (ECHO) in the 
ISIS 420915 -CS2 ECHO  subgroup  and in the Cardiomyopathy -ECHO 
(CM-ECHO) Set  
To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect  of extended  dosing with 
ISIS 420915  based  on change  from baseline  in transthyretin  (TTR)  and 
retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4)  
To evaluate  the plasma  trough  levels  of ISIS 420915  
Exploratory  Objective(s)  To evaluate  the change  from baseline  in the following  measures:  
• ECHO  parameters  (except  GLS)  in the ISIS 420915 -CS2 ECHO 
subgroup and in the Cardiomyopathy -ECHO (CM -ECHO) Set  
• Plasma  N-terminal  prohormone  of brain  natriuretic  peptide 
(NT-proBNP)  
• SF-36 questionnaire  
Study  Design  This is a multicenter open -label study.  Eligible patients who have 
satisfactorily completed ISIS 420915 -CS2 will receive 300 mg ISIS 420915 
once  weekly  for 156 weeks  (3 years).  Patients  will also receive  supplemental 
doses of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.  If at the end of  
3 years  of treatment,  ISIS 420915  is not commercially  available  in the country 
of the patient, the patient may continue to receive treatment in this study for 
up to 2 years more or until ISIS 420915 becomes commercially available in 
the patient’s country, whichev er occurs earlier.  At the end of the 5 years of 
treatment with ISIS 420915 in this study, if ISIS 420915 is not commercially 
available, patients may be allowed to continue receiving treatment with

childbearing potential, patient is using an acceptable 
contraceptive method from the time of signing the informed 
consent form until at least 3 months after the last dose of  
ISIS 420915  
b. Males:  Surgically sterile, abstinent, or if engaged in sexual 
relations with a female  of childbearing  potential,  patient  is utilizing 
an acceptable contraceptive method during and for 3 months  
after the last dose of ISIS 420915  
4. Must  have  given  written  informed  consent  (signed  and dated)  and any 
authorization required by l ocal law and be able to comply with all 
study requirements  
Exclusion  Criteria:  
1. Have  any new condition  or worsening  of existing  condition  that in the 
opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor would make the patient 
unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient 
participating in or completing the study  
Treatment  Groups  All patients will receive 300  mg ISIS 420915 given  once weekly.  Howe ver, 
patients  that had a dose  reduction  or schedule  change  in ISIS 420915 -CS2 
may continue with the same dose or schedule in this study.  
Study  Drug  Dosage  and 
Administration  ISIS 420915  will be administered  as a weekly  subcutaneous  (SC) injection.  
Rationale  for Dose  and Schedule 
Selection  This is the same  dose  and schedule  used  during  Weeks  2 to 65 in the 
ISIS 420915 -CS2 study.  
Study  Visit  Schedule  and 
Procedures  For an individual  patient,  a maximum  period  of 4 weeks  is allowed  between  a 
patient’s last dose in ISIS 420915 -CS2 (CS2  Week 65 Visit) and initiation of 
dosing in this study (CS3 Day 1 visit).  Periods longer than 4 weeks may be 
considered after discussion and approval by the Study Medical Monitor.  
However,  the intention  is to minimize  the treatment  pause  between  the two 
studies.  Ideally, the first  dose  in this  study  should  be administered 1 -week 
after the last dose in ISIS 420915 -CS2.  
The study  for an individual  patient  will generally  consist  of the following 
periods:  
• A ≤ 4-week  screening  period  
• A 3 to 5-year treatment  period  during  which  ISIS 420915  will be 
administered as a once weekly SC injection  
• A 3-month  post-treatment  evaluation  period

Study  Visit  Schedule  and 
Procedures Continued  Screening Period:  
A period of ≤ 4 weeks is allowed to complete the screening procedures 
outlined in the schedule of procedures in Appendix A . Safety clinical 
laboratory parameters and assessments from the ISIS 420915 -CS2 study 
may be used  for screening  evaluation  provided  that they were  taken  within 
4 weeks of Day 1.  Periods longer than 4 weeks may be considered after 
discussion and approval by the Study Medical Monitor.  
Treatment  Period:  
During the treatment period patients will report to the Study Center for 
evaluation  and tests  5 times  in Year  1 (Weeks  1, 7, 13, 26, 52) and 2 times  in 
each subsequent year (26th and 52nd week of each year).  Physical 
examination, collection of blood for me asurement of safety clinical laboratory 
parameters and specialty labs, measurement of vital signs, and collection of 
adverse events and concomitant medication/procedure information will be 
performed according to the schedule of procedures in Appendix A.  The 
following assessments will also be performed at specified visits during the 
study: mNIS+7, NIS, Norfolk QOL -DN questionnaire, SF -36 questionnaire, 
PND score, body weight, ophthalmology examination, electroretinogram 
(ERG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and tr ansthoracic ECHO examination.  
There are 8 non -clinic visits in Year 1 (Weeks 4, 10, 15, 18, 21, 23, 29, 39) 
and 2  in each subsequent year (13th and 39th week  of each year) where labs 
will be collected by the Sponsor appointed home healthcare service or the 
Study Center as arranged by the Study Center personnel or by local 
laboratory  with prior Sponsor  approval.  In addition,  platelets  will be collected 
weekly an d serum creatinine every 2 -3 weeks (Appendices A and C). 
Patients  may also be contacted  by phone  to collect  adverse  events, 
concomitant medication and concomitant procedure information 
(Appendix A).  
Patients  may be provided  with prefilled  syringes,  when  available  in each 
country.  Once available a patient preference questionnaire may be 
conducted.  
ISIS 420915  will be administered  by either  the Study  Center  personnel  or at 
home by the patient/caregiver.  
In order  to ensure  maintenance  of the study  blind  in ISIS 420915 -CS2,  TTR, 
RBP4, retinol, and NT -proBNP from the first 13 weeks of treatment in this 
study will not be available to the Sponsor, Investigators, Study Center 
Personnel, or the patients until the ISIS 420915 -CS2 study is unblinded.  
Post-Treatment  Evaluation  Period:  
After discontinuation of treatment with ISIS 420915 patients will enter a 
3-month  post-treatment  evaluation  period  as outlined  in the Schedule  of 
Procedures  in Appendix  A and C. If a patient  discontinues  treatment  in this 
study, but is continuing to receive treatment with ISIS 420915 via another 
mechanism, the entry of the patient into the 3 -month post -treatment 
evaluation period may be omitted.

2. BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Overview  of Disease  
Transthyretin is synthesized primarily in the liver and is secreted into the plasma as a 55 KD 
protein composed of  4 identical subunits of  14 KD  each.  A major  function of  TTR in the  plasma 
is to transport retinol (vitamin A) to tissues through an association with RBP4.  Transthyretin 
amyloidosis is a rare hereditary disease caused by mutations in the TTR protein.  The disease 
causing  mutations  destabilize  the normal  tetrameric  structure  of TTR  causing  its dissociation  into 
free monomers and subsequent aggregation into insoluble fibril deposits.  These deposits are 
found  in multiple  organs  including  the peripheral  nervous  system,  gastrointestinal  tract and heart. 
They result in local damag e to cells leading to a peripheral polyneuropathy (called Familial 
Amyloid Polyneuropathy or FAP) and a cardiomyopathy (called Familial Amyloid 
Cardiomyopathy or FAC).  FAP can be classified into 3 stages of disease based on ambulatory 
status: Stage 1 – do not require assistance with ambulation; Stage 2 – require assistance with 
ambulation; Stage 3 – wheelchair bound ( Coutinho et al. 1980 ). The total worldwide prevalence 
of FAP has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients ( Coelho et al. 2008 ). 
 
2.2 Therapeutic  Rationale  
ISIS 420915 is an antisense drug targeted to human TTR mRNA and its hybridization to the 
cognate TTR mRNA results in the RNase H -mediated degradation of the TTR mRNA, thus 
preventing production of the TTR protein (see Section 2.3).  The strategy of treating FAP 
patients with ISIS 420915 is to reduce the levels of mutated and wild -type TTR protein secreted 
by the liver.  It should be noted that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are highly charged 
hydrophilic molecules that do not cross th e blood brain barrier ( Levin et al. 2008 ) and thus 
systemic  treatment  with ISIS 420915  is not predicted  to decrease  levels  of TTR  in the brain.  It is 
predicted that decreasing the amount of liver -derived TTR protein circulating in the plasma by 
treatment w ith ISIS 420915 will result in a decrease in the formation of TTR amyloid fibril 
deposits, and thus slow or halt disease progression.  This strategy is a similar strategy to 
orthotopic  liver transplantation,  with the exception  that ISIS  420915  reduces  wild-type protein  in 
addition to the mutated protein.  Given that wild -type TTR can continue to deposit as amyloid 
after liver transplant, this distinction may represent a therapeutic advantage.  
There is a high unmet medical need for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 FAP patients worldwide.  For 
Stage 2 patients, there is currently no approved therapy and these patients are often not 
candidates  for liver transplant  due to advanced  age, health  reasons,  or cardiac  involvement.  For 
Stage 1 patients, Vyndaqel® is currently the only approved therapy.  However, it is only 
approved in some countries and is not yet widely reimbursed or established as the standard of 
care. 
 
2.3 ISIS 420915  
 
2.3.1 Mechanism  of Action  
ISIS 420915  is a second -generation  ASO  drug targeted  to transthyretin.  It is complementary  to a 
region within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the transthyretin mRNA and binds to the 
mRNA by Watson and Crick base pairing.  The hybridization (binding) of ISIS 420 915 to the 
cognate mRNA results in the RNase H -mediated degradation of the transthyretin mRNA, thus  
23 
23  
 ISIS 4209 l 5-CS3 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment5  
22 Februa1 y 2017  
 
 
preventing production of the transthyretin protein. Maximal  antisense -mediated  reduction of 
target mRNA l evels is typically greater than 90% of co ntrnl levels in sensitive tissues 
(Crooke  and Bennett 1996 ; Zhang  et al. 2010). Furth e1more, reduction in target mRNA  levels 
using this approach correlates directly with a subseque nt reduction in target protein levels. 
2.3.2 Chemistry  
Chemica lly, ISIS 420915 is a synthetic oligomer of 20 nucle otides (i.e. , a 20-mer) that are 
connected sequentially by phosphorothioate  linkages.  The nucle otide  sequen ce of ISIS 420915 
(Figure 1) is complementai y to a 20-nucleotide stretch within the 3' UTR r egion of the 
transthyretin protein  mRN A. Strnctura lly, the oligonucleotide has 3 regions.  Two (2)  of them, 
the 5 nucleotides at the 5' end and the 5 nucle otides at the  3' end, ai·e composed of  
2'-0-(2-meth oxyet hyl) (MOE) -modified ribonucle otides . These MOE -modified nucleotides 
confer (1) increased affinity  to the  target  mRNA (Altma nn et al. 1996 ; McKay et al.  1999 ), 
(2) increased  resistance to  exonucleases and  endonucleases (thereby increasing  stability  in tissue) 
(Geary  et al.  2003 ), and (3) ainelioration of some of the hi gh dose  toxicities t hereb y resultin g in 
an improved  safety  profile  compai ·ed to first ge nerati on antisense diugs  containing 
phosphorothioate  modified oligodeoxyn ucleotides ( DNA) (Henry et al.  2000 ). The third  region, 
the central po1tion of the oligonucle otide, is composed of 10 oligodeoxynucleotides . This 
chimeri c design is  called a MOE -Gapmer , and ISIS 420915 employs this chimeric strncture to 
enable  use of the RNase H-mechanism for antisense activ ity. This is beca use while the 2'-MOE 
modifica tion confers increased  stabi lity and affinity , it does  not suppo1t RNase  H catalysis of 
RNA  hybridized to 2'-MOE-modified nucle otides (McKay et al.  1999).  This is caused by 
confonnational changes induced in the heterod uplex by 2'-alkoxy:RNA  hybrids that are not 
recognized by RNase H enzymes  (Inoue et al. 1987 ; Mon ia et al. 1993 ). By limiting  the 2'-MOE 
modifica tion to nucleotides flankin g the phosphorothioate oligodeoxyn ucleotide co re, the 
beneficial attributes of the 2'-MOE c hemi stry ai·e  preserved w hile also retaining RNase H 
recogni tion.

2.3.3 Preclinical  Experience  
Detailed  information  concerning  the preclinical  studies  conducted  with ISIS 420915  can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  A summary is included below.  
The nonclinical  pharmacokinetics  and toxicology  evaluation  of ISIS 420915  includes  repeat  dose 
studies up to 6 and 9 months in the CD -1 mouse and cynomolgus monkey, respectively.  
Nonclin ical findings  following  ISIS 420915  treatment  were,  in general,  non-specific  class  effects 
that are typical for 2′ -MOE ASOs ( Henry  et al. 2008 ) and no findings were considered related to 
pharmacologic inhibition of TTR.  Class effects occurred in a dose - and duration -dependent 
manner.  In the monkey  they included transient effects on acute complement activation (at doses  
≥ 10 mg/kg/wk)  and acute  elevations  in activated partial  thromboplastin  time (aPTT)  (at doses  
≥ 12 mg/kg/wk).  The changes in aPTT were not cumulative over the course of the 9 -month 
monkey study.  In the mice, there was evidence of inflammation that included the presence of 
minimal  to moderate  mononuclear  cell infiltrates  in the sinusoids  of liver,  lymph  nodes  and the 
subcutaneous injection site at doses ≥ 40 mg/kg/wk after 3 and 6 months of treatment.  
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of ISIS 420915 was similar to other second -generation 
ASOs.  The exposure  of ISIS 420915  in plasma  and tissue  was dose-dependent.  The majority  of 
ISIS 420915 was cleared from plasma within hours due mainly to distribution to tissues, with 
kidneys and liver having the highest concentrations.  The half -life in kidney and liver was 
approximately 13.5 days and 18.8 days, respectively, consis tent with the plasma terminal 
elimination half -life of 17.0 days (at 8 mg/kg) after 4 doses.  
 
2.3.4 Clinical Experience  
Two (2) clinical studies have been conducted with ISIS 420915; ISIS 420915 -CS1 which is 
complete and ISIS 420915 -CS2 which is ongoing.  Detailed information concerning the 
ISIS 420915 -CS1 and ISIS 420915 -CS2 studies  can be found  in the Investigator’s  Brochu re. 
A summary of each study is included below.  
ISIS 420915 -CS1 was a Phase 1 double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose escalation study 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single 
and multiple doses of ISIS 42 0915 administered by subcutaneous injection to healthy subjects. 
The study enrolled 65 healthy volunteers (16 in the single dose cohorts and 49 in the multiple 
dose cohorts).  Four  (4) single  dose levels  (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg) and 5  multiple  dose levels  
(50, 100, 200, 400 and 300 mg) were  evaluated  sequentially  in the order  listed.  Subjects  enrolled 
in the multiple -dose cohorts received a total of 6 doses of Study Drug administered by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection: 3 doses on alternate days during th e first week (Days 1, 3, and 5) 
and then once a week for the next 3 weeks (Days 8, 15, and 22).  
ISIS 420915  was well-tolerated  at the dose levels  and dose regimens  tested  in ISIS 420915 -CS1. 
There were no serious adverse advents (SAEs).  Two (2) discontinua tions were considered 
possibly related to ISIS 420915 by the Sponsor, 1 due to constitutional symptoms (400 mg 
subject) and 1 due to injection site reactions (300 mg subject).  The main safety findings 
included; 1) mild injection site reactions characterize d most often by pain and erythema,  
2) transient  C-reactive  protein  elevations,  primarily  associated  with the first injection  and not 
associated with symptoms, and 3) retinol reductions below the lower limit of normal (LLN) 
which were asymptomatic and an expected consequence of transthyretin reduction.

Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5

Plasma transthyretin levels were evaluated in all cohorts and dose -dependent reductions were 
observed after both single and multiple -dose administration.  In the multiple -dose cohorts, the 
mean percent reductio ns in transthyretin were -8%, -22%, -53%, -75% and -76% in the 50, 100, 
200, 300, and 400 mg cohorts, respectively.  The therapeutic goal for ISIS 420915 is to reduce 
transthyretin levels as much as possible at a dose level that will not cause unacceptable toxicity. 
Therefore,  the 300 mg dose level  which gave  similar  transthyretin  reductions  as the 400 mg dose 
level, was selected for the ISIS 420915 -CS2 Phase 2/3 study.  
ISIS 420915 -CS2 is a Phase  2/3 multicenter,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled  study  to assess  the 
efficacy and safety of ISIS 420915 in patients with FAP.  The study plans to enroll 
approximately 135 patients randomized 2:1 (ISIS 420915 to placebo) to receive 300 mg  
ISIS 420915  or placebo.  The Study  Drug  is adminis tered  3 times  during  the Week  1 and once 
weekly during Weeks 2 to 65.  
 
2.4 Rationale  for Dose  and Schedule  of Administration  
The dose level  and schedule  in the present  open  label extension  (OLE)  study  (300 mg 
ISIS 420915 administered once weekly) is the same dose and schedule used during Weeks 2 to 
65 in the preceding ISIS 420915 -CS2 study.  Antisense oligonucleotides of this class have been 
safely administered intravenously and subcutaneously in multiple clinic al studies at doses up to 
1000  mg (Kwoh  2008 ) and treatment  duration’s  ≥ 6 months  (Chi et al 2008 ; Raal et al. 2010 ) and 
> 24 months  (Santos  et al. 2012 ). The patients  randomized  to ISIS 420915  in ISIS 420915 -CS2 
receive 65 weeks (15 months) of treatment in that study followed by up to an additional  
260 weeks  (5 years)  in the present  OLE  study.  The safety  and tolerability  of the proposed 
325-week dosing period is also supported by nonclinical chronic tox icology studies with 
ISIS 420915.  
 
3. EXPERIMENTAL  PLAN  
 
3.1 Study  Design  
This is a multicenter  open -label  study.  Eligible  patients  who have  satisfactorily  completed 
ISIS 420915 -CS2 will receive 300 mg ISIS 420915 once weekly for 156 weeks (3 years). 
Exceptions will be given to patients that had a dose reduction or schedule change in  
ISIS 420915 -CS2 who  may continue  with the same  dose level or  schedule  in thi s study.  
All patients  will receive  supplemental  doses  of the recommended  daily  allowance  (RDA)  of 
vitamin A.  
If at the end of 3 years  of treatment, ISIS  420915  is not commercially  available  in the country  of 
the patient, the patient may continue to receive treatment in this study  for up to 2 years more or 
until ISIS 420915 becomes commercially available in the patient’s country, whichever occurs 
earlier.  At the end of the 5 years of treatment with ISIS 4209 15 in this study, if ISIS 420915 is 
not commercially available, patients may be allowed to continue receiving treatment with  
ISIS 420915  via an early  access  route  to be defined  by the sponsor  and depending  on local 
regulations.  After completing the treatment period, patients will enter the 3 -month  
post-treatment evaluation period.  If a patient discontinues treatment in this study, but is 
continuing  to receive  treatment  with ISIS 420915  via another  mechanism,  the entry  of the 
patient into the 3 -month post -treatment evaluation period may be omitted.

3.2 Number  of Study  Centers  
This is a multicenter,  worldwide  study  to be conducted  at study  centers  that enroll  patients  in 
ISIS 420915 -CS2.  
 
3.3 Number  of Patients  
Approximately  135 patients may  be eligible  to enroll in this  study.  
 
3.4 Overall  Study  Duration  and Follow -up 
The study  will consist of the  following  periods:  
• A ≤ 4-week screening  assessment period  
• A treatment  period  of up to 260 weeks  (Y5-W52)  
• A 3-month  post-treatment  evaluation  period  
3.4.1 Screening  Assessment  
A maximum period of 4 weeks is allowed between a patient’s last dose in ISIS 420915 -CS2 
(CS2  Week  65 visit)  and initiation  of dosing  in this study  (CS3  Day 1 visit).  Periods  longer  than 
4 weeks may be considered after discussion and approval by the Study Medical Monitor.  
However,  the intention  is to minimize  the treatment  pause  between  the 2 studies.  Ideally  the first 
dose in this study should be administered 1 -week after the last do se in ISIS 420915 -CS2.  
 
3.4.2 Treatment  
The treatment  period  is up to 260 weeks  (5 years)  in duration.  ISIS 420915  will be administered 
as a once -weekly SC injection at the Study Center or at home by the patient or caregiver.  
Patients  are to report  to the Study  Center  for evaluations  5 times  in Year  1 (Weeks  1, 7, 13, 26, 
52) and 2 times in each subsequent year (26th and 52nd week of each year).  There are also  
non-clinic  visits  including  weekly  platelet  monitoring  where  patients  will have  blood  collected 
by local laboratory, Sponsor appointed home healthcare service, or the Study Center.  
 
3.4.3 Post-Treatment  
After  completion  of treatment,  patients  will enter  a 3-month  post-treatment  evaluation  period  that 
consists of clinic and non -clinic visits for s afety monitoring.  
If a patient discontinues treatment in this study, but is continuing to receive treatment with 
ISIS-420915  via another  mechanism,  the entry  of the patient  into the 3-month  post-treatment 
evaluation period may be omitted.  
 
3.5 End of Study  
The End-of-Study  is last patient,  last visit.  
 
3.6 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  
The independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for ISIS 420915 -CS2 will review 
the safety  and tolerability  of ISIS 420915 during  this OLE  study  at a frequency  and duration as 
outlined in the Safety Management Plan and DSMB Charter.

6. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Study  Schedule  
All required  study  procedures  are outlined in  Appendix  A. 
 
6.1.1 Screening  Assessment  Period  
Before any  study -specific procedures or evaluations are initiated, patients must sign and date the 
informed consent form.  A maximum period of 4 weeks is allowed between a patient’s last dose 
in ISIS 420915 -CS2 (CS2 Week 65 visit) and initiation of dosing  in this study  (CS3 Day  1 visit). 
Periods longer than 4 weeks may be considered after discussion and approval by the Study 
Medical Monitor.  All screening assessments must be completed during this period.  An 
exception is the 24 -hour urine collection (which includes a serum creatinine blood draw) that 
may be done at any time during the screening period or during Week 1 on treatme nt. Safety 
clinical  laboratory  parameters  and assessments  from  ISIS 420915 -CS2 may be used for screening 
evaluation if they were obtained within 4 weeks of Study Day 1.  A longer period may be 
considered after discussion and approval from the Study Medical Monitor.  
 
6.1.2 Treatment Period  
Patients  will report to  the Study  Center  for evaluations  and tests  5 times during  Year  1 
(Study  Weeks 1, 7, 13, 26, 52) and 2 times in each subsequent year (26th and 52nd week of each 
year).  Physical examination, collection of blood for measurement of safety clinical laboratory 
parameters and specialty labs, measurement of vital signs, and collection of adverse events and 
concomitant medication/procedure information will be performed according  to the Schedule of 
Procedures  in Appendix  A. The following  assessments  will also be performed  at specified  visits 
during the study:  mNIS+7, NIS, Norfolk QOL -DN questionnaire, SF -36 questionnaire, PND 
score, body weight, ophthalmology examination, electror etinogram (ERG), electrocardiogram 
(ECG), and transthoracic ECHO examination.  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
29 
29  
  
Non-clinic  visits  will occur  8 times  during  Year  1 (Weeks  4, 10,  15, 18, 21, 23,  29, 39) and 
2 times in each subsequent year (13th and 39th week of each year), where patients’ labs will be 
collected  by the Sponsor  appointed  home  healthcare  service,  or the Study  Center  as arranged  by 
the Study Center personnel or by local laboratory with prior Sponsor approval.  In addition, 
platelets will be collected weekly and serum creatinine will be collected every 2 -3 weeks  
(see Appendices  A and C). Patients  may also be contacted  by phone  to collect adverse  events, 
concomitant medication, and concomitant procedure information.  
ISIS 420915 can be administered once weekly by Study Center personnel or at home by the 
patient/caregiver.  If ISIS 420915 is administered during a clinic or non -clinic visit, all blood 
samples  should  be drawn  prior  to administration.  Ideally,  blood  draws  should  occur  7 days after 
the previous dose.  Dosing instructions and training will be provided to the patient/caregiver 
where applicable.  It is anticipated that the Study Drug configuration may change during the 
course of the study, from the configuration o f stoppered glass vials to prefilled syringes (PFS). 
During this transition, patients may be requested to complete a short patient preference 
questionnaire.  
Patients  will also take daily  oral supplemental  doses  of the RDA  of vitamin A  (approximately 
3000 I U or closest approximate dose as available in the region where the patient resides).  
Vitamin  A may be provided  as either  a single  vitamin  A supplement  or as part of a multivitamin. 
The vitamin A supplement should be taken throughout the treatment and post -treatment 
evaluation periods.  
To ensure maintenance of the study blind in the ongoing ISIS 420915 -CS2 study, TTR, RBP4, 
retinol,  and NT-proBNP from  the first 13 weeks  of treatment  in this study  will not be available  to 
the Sponsor, Investigators, Study Center Personnel, or the patients until the ISIS 420915 -CS2 
study is unblinded.  
The mNIS+7 assessment will be conducted at Weeks 26, 52, 78, 104, 130, and 156.  The 
NIS assessment will be conducted at Y4 -W52 and Y5 -W52.  The Norfolk QOL -DN 
questionnaire is conducted at Weeks 26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 156, and Y4 -W52 and Y5 -W52. 
The Norfolk  QOL -DN questionnaire  should  be the first assessment  performed  at these  visits.  
If ISIS  420915  administration,  ERG,  or ophthalmology  examinations  are to be performed  on the 
same day as an mNIS+7 or NIS assessment, they should be performed after the mNIS+7 or  
NIS assessment is complete.  For Week 78 and Week 156 visits, 2 mNIS+7 assessments will be 
performed  on separate  days.  A maximum  of 2 weeks  from  the visit (Week 78  or Week  156) will 
be allowed to complete both assessments.  
For Weeks 4 -52 there is a ± 7 -day visit window.  After Week 52 the visit window is ± 10 -day. 
All reasonable attempts should be made to ensure compliance with the visit schedule as outlined 
in the schedule of procedures (Appendix A).  However, if a visit does not occur or is delayed, all 
subsequent  visits  should  be calculated  based  on the time elapsed  since  Day 1 rather  than from  the 
date of the previous visit.  
The Study  Day 1 ECHO  can be  done  any time in the  screening  period or  up to 2 weeks  after 
Day 1. The Day 1 ECHO  is not done  if the Week  65 ECHO  was conducted  in ISIS  420915 -CS2. 
A ± 2 -week window is given for all other ECHOs.

During  the treatment period, an ophthalmology  examination will be performed at Weeks 26, 52, 
78, 104, 130, 156, and 2 times in each subsequent year (26th and 5 2nd week of each year).  An 
ERG examination will be performed at Weeks 78 and 156.  A window of ± 2 weeks is allowed 
for these eye examinations.  Early termination ERG and ophthalmology examinations are only 
done  if the patient  discontinues  treatment  after ≥ 9 months  of dosing  or unless  deemed  necessary 
by Investigator or Study Medical Monitor.  
 
6.1.3 Post-Treatment  Period  
After  discontinuation  of treatme nt with ISIS  420915,  patients  will enter  the 3 -month  
post-treatment evaluation period.  This period consists of clinic and non -clinic visits for safety 
monitoring  as outlined in the  Schedule  of Procedures ( Appendix A  and C). Weekly  platelet and 
every  2-3 week  serum  creatinine  testing  is required  for a minimum  of 6 weeks  after the last dose 
of Study Drug (this includes early termination patients as well as patients that complete the full 
treatment period).  Patients that terminate trea tment early and do not withdraw consent should 
have the post -treatment visit Week 169 conducted 3 months after the last dose of Study Drug.  
The 3 -month post -treatment evaluation period may be omitted if the patient discontinues 
treatment  in this study,  but is continuing  to receive  treatment  with ISIS 420915  via another 
mechanism.  
 
6.2 Additional  Study  Assessments  
 
6.2.1 Laboratory  Assessments  
Laboratory  analyte  samples  will be collected  throughout  the study.  A list of these  analytes  is 
contained in Appendix B . 
 
6.2.2 Congestive  Heart  Failure  
Any patient  who develops  signs,  symptoms,  or test results  suggestive  of new onset  or worsening 
(if pre -existing) congestive heart failure should have the following evaluations performed (in 
addition to any  tests deemed to be necessary  by the attending  physician) as soon as possible and 
the Investigator should consider referral to a cardiol ogist:

6.3 Restriction  on the Lifestyle  of Patients  
 
6.3.1 Contraception  Requirements  
All patients  of childbearing  potential  must  refrain  from  sperm/egg  donation  and practice 
effective  contraception  from  the time of signing  the informed  consent  form until  at least 
3 months after their last dose of ISIS 420915.  
For the purposes  of this study,  a woman  of childbearing  potential  is defined as  any female  who 
has experienced menarche and who does not meet 1 of the following conditions:  
• Postmenopausal:  12 months  of spontaneous  amenorrhea  in females  > 55 years  of age or, 
in females ≤ 55 years, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative 
medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks  after surgical bilateral  oophorectomy  with or without hysterectomy  
• Post hysterectomy  
For the purposes  of the study,  effective  contraception  is defined  as follows: 
For male patients:  
• Effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
follow -up, or the use of condoms together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/  
suppository . Male patients must also encourage their female partner to use effective 
contraception from the time of signing the informed consent until 3 months after the 
patient’s last dose of ISIS 420915.  Effective contraceptive for the female partner 
includes surgica l sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraception, 
intrauterine contraception/device, or barrier methods (female condom*, diaphragm, 
sponge,  cervical  cap) together  with spermicidal  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Male 
patients  with partners  who are pregnant  must  use condoms  to ensure  that the fetus  is not 
exposed to ISIS 420915.

Commercially available vitamin A as a single supplement or as part of a multivitamin will be 
provided  by the Study  Center  or designee,  in accordance  with local  regulatory  requirements  and 
availability.  The vitamin A supplement should be taken thr oughout the treatment and post - 
treatment evaluation periods.  
 
8.3 Other  Protocol -Required  Treatment  Procedures  
There  are no other  protocol -required  treatment  procedures.  
 
8.4 Treatment  Precautions  
No specific  treatment  precautions  are required  for this  study.  
 
8.5 Safety  Monitoring  Rules  
Please  refer  also to the “Guidance  for the Investigator”  section  of the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
In addition  to the standard  monitoring  of clinical  safety  parameters,  the following  guidelines  are 
provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical 
observations.  
Confirmation  Guidance : At any time during  the study  (treatment  or post-treatment  periods),  the 
initial clinical laboratory results meeting the saf ety monitoring or stopping criteria presented 
below must be confirmed by performing measurements (ideally in the same laboratory that 
performed the initial measurement) on new specimens.  All new specimen collections should 
take place as soon as possible (i deally within 3 days of the initial collection).  
Stopping  Rule  Guidance : In the event  of an initial  clinical  laboratory  result  that meets  a stopping 
criterion, patients must not be re -dosed until a confirmatory test result has been reviewed by the 
Study  Medical Monitor.  If any of the stopping criteria described in Section 8.6 are met and are 
confirmed, the patient will be permanently discontin ued from further treatment with  
ISIS 420915, evaluated fully as outlined below and in consultation with the Study Medical 
Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be entered into the post -treatment 
evaluation period of the study (after complet ing the early termination [ET] assessments).  In 
general, patients who do not meet the stopping rules based upon retest may continue dosing. 
However,  the Investigator  and the Study  Medical  Monitor  (or appropriately  qualified  designee) 
should confer as to wh ether additional close monitoring of the patient is appropriate.  
Additional Guidance : If possible, a pharmacokinetic sample should be collected as soon as 
possible  after an SAE  has occurred  (preferably  within  2 weeks).  In addition,  if a patient  is asked  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
35 
35  
  
to return  to the clinic  for additional  evaluations  due to an AE, then a pharmacokinetic  sample 
should be taken at the time of the unscheduled visit.  
For all safety  monitoring  rules  below  “baseline”  will be defined  as the ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Day 1 value.  
 
8.5.1 Safety  Monitoring  Rules  for Liver  Chemistry  Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury:  Premarketing  Clinical  Evaluation,”  issued  by the U.S. Department  of Health  and Human 
Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009.  
In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) (or  
the greater  of 2 x baseline  value  or 3 x ULN  if the baseline  value  was > ULN),  at any time during 
the study  (treatment or post -treatment period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as 
described above.  Similarly, confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or 
AST levels increase to 5 x ULN.  
Frequency  of Repeat  Measurements : Patients  with confirmed  ALT  or AST  levels  > 3 x ULN  (or 
the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN), that are 
continuing to rise should have their liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, ALP, INR, and total 
bilirubin)  retested at  least once -weekly  until levels stabilize  and begin to recover  (ALT  and AST 
levels become ≤ 1.2 x ULN or 1.2 x baseline value if the baseline value was > ULN).  
Further Investigation  into Liver  Chemistry  Elevations : For patients  with confirmed  ALT  or AST 
levels > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was  
> ULN),  the following  evaluations  should  be performed:  
1. Obtain  a more  detailed  history  of symptoms  and prior  and concurrent diseases  
2. Obtain  further  history  for concomitant  drug use (including  nonprescription  medications, 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets  
3. Obtain  a history  for exposure  to environmental  chemical  agents  and travel  
4. Total,  direct,  and indirect  bilirubin  
5. Serology  for viral hepatitis  (HAV  IgM,  HBsAg,  HCV  antibody,  HCV  mRNA,  CMV  IgM, 
and EBV antibody panel)  
6. Serology  for autoimmune  hepatitis  (e.g.,  antinuclear  antibody  (ANA),  antismooth  muscle 
antibody, type 1 anti -liver kidney microsomal a ntibody)  
7. Serum  acetaminophen -protein  adducts  by high pressure  liquid  chromatography  if recent 
acetaminophen usage by patient  
Additional  liver evaluations,  including  gastroenterology/hepatology  consultations,  hepatic  CT or 
MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with the

Study  Medical  Monitor.  Repetition  of the above  evaluations  should  be considered  if a patient’s 
ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 x ULN.  
 
8.5.2 Safety  Monitoring  Rules  for Renal  Function  
In the event  of a confirmed  (as described  in Section  8.5) laboratory  result  meeting  1 or more  of 
the following criteria, urinalysis (see Appendix B ) will be required  approximately every  
2-3 weeks.*  
a. Creatinine  clearance  by CKD -EPI < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
b. Creatinine  clearance  by CKD -EPI decrease  from  baseline** > 25% 
c. Urine  Alb/Cr  ratio > 5 x ULN  
d. Serum  creatinine  increase  from  baseline** > 0.5 mg/dL  
* Urine  collection  should  be performed  at the same  time as the protocol  specified  collection  of 
serum creatinine (see Appendices A and C) 
** Baseline  is the study  CS3 Day  1 value  
In addition, the first confirmed result meeting a criterion (at any time on study) will trigger an 
immediate  evaluation by  a local nephrologist, ideally  within  1-week.  The following  labs should 
be obtained immediately:  fasting serum creatinine, urine culture, 24 -hour urine sample for 
creatinine clearance and urine protein, and urine microscopy sample with nephrologist’s 
inspection of  sediment.  Consideration of  a dose pause  (for example  with a confirmed CKD -EPI 
decrease  > 25%)  should be  discussed  with the Study  Medical  Monitor.  A mandatory  dose pause 
will occur with a 24 -hour urine protein result of > 2.0 g.  
If a patient  remains  stable  over time they may be moved  to less frequent  monitoring  of urinalysis 
at the discretion of the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with a nephrologist and the 
Investigator.  
If a patient meets a renal monitoring rule that is confirmed on repeat testing, the Investigator 
should review the patient’s concomitant med ications for potentially nephrotoxic agents, and 
carefully  consider  discontinuing  non-essential  medications.  Consultation  with the Study  Medical 
Monitor is encouraged.  
 
8.5.3 Safety  Monitoring  Rules  for Ocular  Effects  
All patients should receive an ophthalmology examination by an eye specialist at Weeks 26, 52, 
78, 104, 130, and 156 and twice each subsequent treatment year (26th and 52nd week of each 
year).  An ERG will also be performed at Weeks 78 and 156.  In addition,  any patient who 
complains of persistent ocular symptoms compatible with vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night 
blindness or dry eyes) should be referred for an ophthalmology examination.  If the 
ophthalmologist confirms the patient’s symptoms are consistent wit h vitamin A deficiency 
and/or the examination reveals physical findings that are consistent with vitamin A deficiency 
(but do not reach the stopping rule criteria described in Section 8.6.4 ) then an ERG examination 
should  be conducted  and analyzed  by the central  reader.  In addition,  it is suggested  that a review  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
37 
37  
  
of diet and supplement  use and an evaluation  for factors  which  may contribute  to low vitamin  A 
levels such as infection, alcohol consumption, and zinc and/or iron deficiency be conducted.  
If an ERG is changed from baseline and shows clear signs of vitamin A deficiency as assessed 
by the central  reader  and described  below,  then the patient  should  be monitored  more  frequently. 
Frequency will be determined by the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with the 
Investigator and ophthalmologist.  
Clear  signs of  vitamin A  deficiency  as assessed  by ERG  include:  
a. Change  from  baseline  > 50%,  and 
b. Values  below  normal  range (if  baseline  values  were  within  normal  range),  and 
c. Changes  that are approximately  symmetrical  between  eyes (unless  there  is an alternative 
explanation for asymmetry)  
Dosing  with Study  Drug may  continue  while  these  evaluations are  being  performed.  
 
8.5.4 Safety  Monitoring  Rules  for Platelet  Count  Results  
Platelets  will be monitored  weekly  throughout  the treatment  period and  for a minimum  of 
6 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug (this includes early termination patients  as well as 
patients  that complete  the full treatment  period).  For patients  participating  in the Post-Treatment 
Evaluation Period, frequency of testing after 6 weeks from the last dose of Study Drug will be 
determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  
All platelet  count  results  must  be promptly  reviewed  by the Investi gator  to ensure  that the count 
has not met the stopping rule  
If for any reason there is more than 14 days between platelet values (e.g. lab report of an 
unreadable sample due to clumping, hemolysis, or quantity not sufficient, or a missed lab 
assessment),  the Investigator  will contact  the patient  to hold dosing  until a new platelet  value  is 
obtained and reviewed.  
If a patient’s  platelet  counts  fall below  100,000/mm3, additional  lab tests may be requested  as 
determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  
Due to the 3 to 5-year study  duration  it is anticipated  that patients  may undertake  travel  including 
vacations, which may impede weekly platelet monitoring.  In some situations it may be possible 
to arrange for local laboratory testing or use of the home healthcare service at their temporary 
location.  The intent  is to maintain  weekly  platelet mon itoring  and dosing  where  possible, as  well 
as Investigator site contact with the study patients.  However, if the above options are not 
possible, a temporary interruption of study treatment will be planned with a prompt blood draw 
upon the patient’s return which must be reported and reviewed by the Investigator prior to the 
patient resuming dosing.

8.6 Stopping  Rules  
 
8.6.1 Stopping  Rules  for Liver  Chemistry  Elevations  
In the event of confirmed laboratory results meeting the following criteria, and the event is 
without  an alternative  explanation  as discussed  with  the Study  Medical  Monitor,  dosing  of 
a patient with ISIS 420915 will be stopped permanently:  
1. ALT  or AST  > 8 x ULN  
2. ALT  or AST  > 5 x ULN at 2 consecutive  weekly  measurements (not less than 7  days nor 
more  than 10 days apart)  both of which  are confirmed.  Treatment  with ISIS 420915  may 
continue until the second consecutive weekly  ALT or AST measurement is confirmed to 
be > 5 x ULN  
3. ALT  or AST  > 3 x ULN  and total bilirubin >  2 x ULN  
4. ALT  or AST  > 3 x ULN  with the appearance  of fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  right  upper 
quadrant pain or tend erness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant eosinophilia (> 5%)  
 
8.6.2 Stopping  Rules  for Renal  Function  Test Results  
In the event of an estimated creatinine clearance by CKD -EPI meeting any of the following 
criteria,  a serum  creatinine  and 24-hour urine  sample  for creatinine  clearance  and protein  should 
be obtained:  
• CKD -EPI decrease  of > 50%  from baseline*  
• Value  < 45 mL/min/1.73  m2 (if baseline  CKD -EPI > 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
• Value  < 30 mL/min/1.73  m2 (if baseline  CKD -EPI ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
* baseline  is study  CS3 Day  1 value  
Dosing  of a patient  with ISIS  420915  will be stopped  permanently  if the 24-hour urine  testing 
confirms any of the following values in the absence of an alternative explanation agree by a 
consulting nephrologist:  
• urine  protein  is > 3.5 g 
• creatinine  clearance  < 45 mL/min/1.73  m2 (if baseline  CKD -EPI > 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
• creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min/1.73  m2 (if baseline  CKD -EPI ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
Irrespective of whether the stopping rule is confirmed or not, the follow -up schedule and 
frequency  of renal  function  monitoring  after the initial  event  will be determined  by the Study 
Medical M onitor in consultation with the Investigator and a renal consult will be requested.  
 
8.6.3 Stopping  Rule  for Platelet  Count  Results  
In the event of a confirmed platelet count less than 75,000/mm3, and in the presence of major 
bleeding  or clinically -relevant  non-major  bleeding  (defined  below;  Schulman  et al. 2005 ), dosing 
of a patient with ISIS 420915 will be stopped permanently.  The follow -up schedule for any  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
39 
39  
  
events  meeting  this stopping  criterion  will be determined  by the Investigator  in consultation  with 
the Study Medical Monitor.  
In the event of a confirmed platelet count less than 75,000/mm3, and in the absence of major 
bleeding or clinically -relevant non -major bleeding, further dosing of a patient with ISIS 420915 
must  be held until the platelet  count  returns  to at least 100,000/mm3. Weekly  platelet  monitoring 
should continue during this per iod. In addition, the Investigator should give consideration to 
collecting duplicate platelet samples for study in a local lab in parallel to the central lab if it 
would provide quicker access to the patients platelet count.  If the platelet count was confi rmed 
to be < 50,000/mm3, then monitoring should be increased to daily until two successive values 
show improvement.  The Investigator must notify  the Study  Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
any local lab platelet results that show a level < 50,000/mm3. 
The suitability  of the patient for continued dosing and the need for any  modification to treatment 
schedule  or dose (refer  to Section  8.7) will be determined  by the Investigator  in consultation  with 
the Study  Medical Monitor  and will be  based on factors su ch as the  original rate  of decline  in the 
patient’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by the patient, and the 
speed of recovery of platelet count upon holding of dosing.  
Definition  of major  bleeding  events:  
International  Society  on Thrombosis  and Haemostasis  (ISTH)  Major Bleeding:  
1. Fatal  bleeding,  and/or  
2. Symptomatic  bleeding  in a critical  area or organ,  such as intracranial,  intraspinal, 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramusc ular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or  
3. Bleeding  causing  a fall in hemoglobin  level  of 20 g/L  (1.24  mmol/L)  or more  within 
24 hours, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells  
Definition  of clinically -relevant,  non-major  bleeding  events:  
1. Multiple -source  bleeding  
2. Spontaneous  hematoma  > 25 cm2 
3. Excessive  wound  hematoma  (not injection  site related) 
4. Macroscopic  hematuria  (spontaneous  or lasting  > 24 hours  if associated  with an 
intervention)  
5. Spontaneous  rectal  bleeding;  epitasis,  gingival  bleeding,  hemoptysis,  hematemesis  
6. Bleeding  after venipuncture  for > 5 minutes  
 
8.6.4 Stopping  Rule  for Ocular  Effects  
A patient should be permanently discontinued from Study Drug if an ERG is changed from 
baseline  and shows  clear  signs  of vitamin  A deficiency  (as described  in Section  8.5.3 ) and an 
ISIS 420915 -CS3

54  
  
ophthalmology examination reveals significant changes from baseline in any 1 of certain 
physical  signs  (Bitot’s  spots,  xerophthalmic  ulcers,  keratomalacia,  or other  signs  and symptoms 
of corneal necrosis) and a consultation with the central reader has occu rred. 
 
8.6.5 Stopping  Rule  for QTc Prolongation  
In the event  of an ECG  QTc (average  of triplicates)  above  the thresholds  described  below,  repeat 
triplicate ECGs should be performed approximately 1 -hour later and further dosing should be 
discussed with the Study Medical Monitor:  
• QTc > 500 msec  (if baseline  QTc ≤ 470 msec)  or 
• Increase  in QTc value  > 60 msec  from  baseline  (all patients)  
The suitability of the patient for continued dosing, the need for any modification to treatment 
schedule or dose (refer to Section 8.7), and the most appropriate follow -up schedule, will be 
determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  Suitability of 
continued dosing will be based on factors such as clinical symptoms, width of QRS complex, 
presence  or absence  of paced  rhythm,  and the firing  of a defibrillator  (in the case that the patient 
has an implantable defibri llator).  In addition, consideration should be given to an expert 
cardiology read of the patients’ ECGs and a cardiology consult.  If a patient is deemed suitable 
for continued dosing, more frequent ECGs will be performed, with the frequency to be 
determined  by the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor.  Any additional 
monitoring/investigation will also be determined by the Investigator and Sponsor Medical 
Monitor.  
 
8.7 Adjustment  of Dose  and/or  Treatment  Schedule  
Adjustments of dose and/or treatment schedule should occur only on rare occasions.  Any 
proposed  adjustment  to treatment  schedule  or dose level  must  be discussed  with and approved  by 
the Study Medical Monitor prior to initiation.  If the patient remains stab le after adjustment, 
he/she may be cautiously returned to the original dose/regimen after consultation with the  
Study  Medical  Monitor.  
Patients  may be dose paused  in response  to adverse  events  after consultation  with the 
Study Medical Monitor.  
 
8.8 Discontinuation  of Study  Treatment  
A patient must permanently  discontinue  study  treatment for  any of the following:  
• The patient  becomes  pregnant.  Report  the pregnancy  according  to instructions  in 
Section 9.5.4  
• The patient  withdraws consent  
• The patient  experiences  an AE that necessitates  permanent  discontinuation  of study 
treatment  
• The patient  develops  laboratory  test abnormalities  that meet  any of the stopping  rules 
listed in Section 8.6  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017

55  
  
The reason  for discontinuation  of study  treatment  must  be recorded  in the eCRF  and source 
documentation.  
Patients who discontinue from treatment are encouraged to remain in the study.  Every effort 
should  be made  to complete  the ET visit and the post-treatment  evaluation  visits  which  include 
weekly platelet and every 2 -3 week serum creatinine testing for 6 wee ks after the last dose of 
Study Drug.  If the patient declines to participate in the post -treatment evaluation visit, at a 
minimum the ET visit procedures should be performed at the time of withdrawal  
(See Appendix  A) and ideally  within  14 days from  the last dose of ISIS  420915.  
 
8.9 Withdrawal  of Patients  from  the Study  
Patients  must be  withdrawn from the  study  for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• The patient is unwilling or  unable  to comply  with the  protocol  
• The patient  receives a  liver transplant  
Other  reasons  for withdrawal  of patients  from  the study  might  include:  
• At the discretion  of the Investigator  or Sponsor  for medical  reasons  
• At the discretion  of the Investigator  or Sponsor  for noncompliance  
• Significant  protocol  deviation  
• Administrative  decision  by the Investigator  or Sponsor  
• ISIS 420915  becomes  commercially  available  in the local  country  (patients  in Year  4 or 
Year 5)  
• ISIS 420915  is rejected  by the regulatory  authority  in the  local country  
All efforts  will be made to complete  and report  the observations  as thoroughly  as possible  up to 
the date of withdrawal.  All information, including  the reason for withdrawal from Study, must 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
Any patient who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from further 
treatment  and study  observation  immediately  upon  the date of request.  Patients  withdrawn  for 
any reason should be encouraged to complete the ET visit at the time of withdrawal 
(Appendix A).  
Patients  who receive  a liver transplant  should  be encouraged  to return  to the clinic  to complete 
the ET visit as soon as feasible after the transplant procedures.

8.10 Concomitant  Therapy  and Procedures  
The use of concomitant  therapies  or procedures  defined  below  must  be recorded  in the patient’s 
eCRF.  AEs related  to administration  of these  therapies  or procedures  must  also be documented 
in the appropriate eCRF.  
 
8.10.1  Concomitant  Therapy  
A concomitant  therapy  is any non-protocol -specified  drug or substance  (including  over-the- 
counter medications, herbal medications, and vitamin supplements) administered between 
signing of informed consent and the final post -treatment visit.  
Allowed  Concomitant  Therapy  
Any medications  deemed  necessary  by the Investigator  are allowed  except those  listed  in the 
disallowed concomitant therapy.  
Disallowed  Concomitant  Therapy  
Patients are required to take daily RDA supplemental doses of vitamin A during the treatment 
and post -treatment evaluation periods.  The vitamin A supplements will be provided by the 
Study  Center  or designee.  A patient  may choose  to substitute  the Study  Center -provided  vitamin 
A supplement with his/her own only after consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  
Additional  vitamin  A supp lements  (other  than those  described  above)  are not allowed  at any time 
during the study unless approved by the Study Medical Monitor (this includes multivitamin 
supplements that contain vitamin A).  
Doxycycline  and tauroursodeoxycholic  acid (TUCA)  are not allowed  during  the treatment  period 
unless approved by the Study Medical Monitor.  
Diflunisal  is not allowed  at any time during  the treatment  period.  Vyndaqel® may be allowed 
after 18 months at the discretion of the Study Medical Monitor.  
Due to known poten tial adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) 
on renal  function,  it is recommended  that they should  be used with caution.  Discussion  with the 
Study Medical Monitor prior to initiation of drugs that may affect renal function is 
recommended.  
 
8.10.2  Concomitant  Procedures  
A concomitant  procedure  is any therapeutic  intervention  (e.g.,  surgery/biopsy,  physical  therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
signing of informed consent and the final post -treatment visit.  
 
8.11 Treatment  Compliance  
Compliance  with treatment  dosing  is to be  monitored and  recorded by  Study  Center  staff.  
The Study  Center  staff is required  to document  the receipt,  dispensing,  and return  of ISIS 420915 
supplies.  Patients who self -administer ISIS 420915 at home must record treatment in a provided 
dosing diary that will be revie wed by the Study Center staff and monitor.

9. SERIOUS  AND  NON -SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
 
9.1 Sponsor  Review  of Safety  Information  
Safety  information  will be collected,  reviewed,  and evaluated  by the Sponsor  in accordance  with 
the Safety Management Plan throughout the conduct of the clinical trial.  
 
9.2 Regulatory  Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the Investigators of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines E2A and 
ICH E6. Country -specific  regulatory  requirements  will be followed  in accordance  with local 
country regulations and guidelines.  
IECs/IRBs  will be notified  of any SAE  according  to applicable  regulations.  The DSMB  will be 
notified of any SAE as specified in the DSMB charter.  
The Sponsor  will evaluate  the available  information  and decide  if there  is a reasonable  possibility 
that ISIS 420915 caused the AE and, therefore, meets the definition of a SUSAR.  
For ISIS 420915  “expected”  events,  refer  to the Investigator  Brochure.  
 
9.3 Definitions  
 
9.3.1 Adverse  Event  
An adverse event  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically -significant 
abnormal  laboratory  finding,  for example),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the 
study  or use of investigational drug  product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the 
investigational drug product.  
 
9.3.2 Adverse  Reaction  and Suspected  Adverse  Reaction  
An adverse  reaction  is any adverse event  caused  by ISIS 420915.  
A suspected  adverse  reaction  is any adverse  event for  which  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that 
ISIS 420915 caused the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.  
 
9.3.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
A serious  adverse  event  is any adverse  event  that in the view  of either  the Investigator  or 
Sponsor, meets any of the f ollowing criteria:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life threatening:  that is, poses an  immediate  risk of death at  the time of the event  
• An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either  the Investigator  or Sponsor,  its occurrence  places  the patient at  immediate  risk of 
death.  It does not include  an AE or suspected  adverse  reaction  that, had it occurred  in a 
more severe form, might have caused death  
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
44 
58  
  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation of  existing  hospitalization  
• Hospitalization  is defined  as an admission  of greater  than 24 hours  to a medical  facility 
and does not always qualify as an AE.  
• Results  in a persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to 
conduct normal lif e functions  
• Results  in congenital  anomaly  or birth  defect  in the offspring  of the patient (whether  the 
patient is male or female)  
• Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  are not life-threatening,  or do not 
require hospitalization may also be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the  patient and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of s uch 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
9.4 Monitoring  and Recording  Adverse  Events  
Any pre-existing  conditions  or signs  and/or  symptoms  present  in a patient prior  to the start of the 
study  (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as 
AEs unless the pre -existing condition worsened.  The exception is AEs from the parent study 
(ISIS 420915 -CS2) that are ongoing at the time the patient enters this stud y. These should be 
recorded as ongoing AEs from ISIS 420915 -CS2.  The Investigator should always group signs 
and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a single unifying diagnosis if possible.  
 
9.4.1 Serious  Adverse  Events  
In the interest of patient safety,  and to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs (regardless of 
their relationship  to ISIS 420915)  should  be reported  to the Sponsor  or designee  within  24 hours 
of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the event.  The collection of SAEs will begin after the 
patient signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the patient’s follow -up period, 
which is defined as the final post -treatment visit.  When th e Investigator is reporting by 
telephone, it is important to speak to someone in person versus leaving a message.  An Initial 
Serious Adverse  Event Form should be  completed and a  copy  should be faxed to the  Sponsor  or 
designee.  
Detailed information should b e actively sought and included on Follow -Up Serious Adverse 
Event Forms as soon as additional information becomes available.  All SAEs will be followed 
until resolution.  SAEs that remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified follow -up 
visit will be evaluated  by the Investigator  and Sponsor.  If the Investigator  and Sponsor  agree  the 
patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and Sponsor will determine the  
follow -up requirement.

9.4.2 Non-Serious  Adverse  Events  
The recording  of non-serious  AEs will begin  after the patient  signs  the informed  consent  form 
and will stop at the end of the patient’s follow -up period, which is defined as the final  
post-treatment  visit.  The Investigator  will monitor  each patient  closely  and record  all observed 
or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event CRF.  
 
9.4.3 Evaluation  of Adve rse Events  (Serious  and Non-Serious)  
The Investigator’s  opinion  of the following  should  be documented  in the Adverse  Event  eCRF:  
 
9.4.3.1  Relationship  to ISIS  420915  
The event’s  relationship  to ISIS 420915  is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
• Related:  There  is clear  evidence  that the event  is related  to the use of ISIS 420915, 
e.g., confirmation by positive re -challenge test.  
• Possible:  The event cannot be explained by the patient’s medical condition, 
concomitant  therapy,  or other  causes,  and there  is a plausible  temporal  relationship 
between the event and ISIS 420915 administration.  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely 
(e.g., concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal 
relationship to IS IS 420915 administration and/or exposure suggests that a causal 
relationship  is unlikely  (For reporting  purposes,  Unlikely/Remote  will be grouped 
together with Not Related).  
• Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by the patient’s underlying medical 
condition,  concomitant  therapy,  or other  causes,  and therefore,  the Investigator  believes 
no relationship exists between the event and ISIS 420915.  
 
9.4.3.2  Severity  
The event’s severity  is cha racterized by  1 of the following:  
• Mild:  The event  is easily  tolerated  by the patient and  does not affect  the patient’s  usual 
daily activities.  
• Moderate:  The event  causes  the patient  more  discomfort  and interrupts  the patient’s 
usual daily activities.  
• Severe:  The event  is incapacitating  and causes  considerable  interference  with the 
patient’s usual daily activities.  
 
If the event  is an SAE,  then all applicable  seriousness  criteria  must  be indicated  (criteria  listed  in 
Section 9.3.3 ).

9.4.3.3  Action  Taken  with ISIS  420915  
Action  taken  with ISIS 420915  due to the event  is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
• None:  No changes  were  made  to ISIS  420915 administration  and dose 
• Permanently  Discontinued:  ISIS 420915  was discontinued  and not restarted  
• Temporarily  Interrupted,  restarted:  Dosing  was temporarily  interrupted  or delayed 
due to the AE and restarted  
• Reduced  dose:  Dosing  was reduced  to a lower  dose 
• Reduced  schedule:  Dosing  frequency  was reduced  
9.4.3.4  Treatment  Given  for Adverse  Event  
Any treatment  (e.g.,  medications  or procedures)  given  for the AE should  be recorded  in the 
Adverse Event eCRF (treatment should also be recorded in the concomitant treatment or 
ancillary procedures eCRF as appropriate).  
 
9.4.3.5  Outcome  of the Adverse  Event  
If the event  is a non-serious  AE then the event’s  outcome  is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
• AE Persists:  Patient  terminates  from  the trial and the AE continues  
• Recovered:  Patient  recovered  completely  from  the AE 
• Became  Serious:  The event  became  serious  (the date that the event  became  serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change  in Severity  (if applicable):  AE severity  changed  
If the event is  an SAE  then the event’s outcome  is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
• Ongoing:  SAE  continuing  
• Persists (as non -serious AE):  Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer 
meets  serious  criteria  and should  be captured  as an AE in the non-serious  AE eCRF  (the 
SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:  Patient  recovered  completely  from  the SAE  (the date of recovery  should  be 
entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Fatal:  Patient  died (the date of death  should  be entered  as the SAE  resolution date)  
9.5 Procedures  for Handling  Special  Situations  
 
9.5.1 Abnormalities  of Laboratory  Tests  
Clinically -significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bl eeding due to thrombocytopenia, 
tetany  due to hypocalcemia,  or cardiac  arrhythmias  due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever  possible,  the 
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
47 
58  
  
underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs. 
Clinically -significant a bnormalities will be monitored by the Investigator until the parameter 
returns  to its baseline  value  or until agreement  is reached  between  the Investigator  and the Study 
Medical Monitor.  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically -significant (NCS) by the 
Investigator should not be reported as AEs.  Similarly, laboratory  abnormalities reported as AEs 
by the Investigator should not be deemed NCS on the laboratory sheet.  
The Investigator  is responsible  for reviewing  and signing  all laboratory  reports.  The signed 
clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents.  
 
9.5.2 Prescheduled  or Elective  Procedures  or Routinely  Scheduled  Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE,  even  if the patient  is hospitalized;  the Study  Center  must  document  all of the following:  
• The prescheduled  or elective  procedure  or routinely  scheduled  treatment  was scheduled 
(or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s consent to 
participate in the study  
• The condition  that required  the prescheduled  or elective  procedure  or routinely  scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion of the 
Investigator  between  the patient’s  consent  to participate  in the study  and the timing  of the 
procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled  or elective  procedure  or routin ely scheduled  treatment  is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospital admission  
 
9.5.3 Dosing  Errors  
ISIS 420915  errors  should  be documented  as Protocol  Deviations.  A brief  description  should  be 
provided in the deviation, including whether the patient was symptomatic (list symptoms) or 
asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional.  
Dosing  details  should  be captured  in the Dosing  eCRF.  If the patient  administers  a dose of 
ISIS 420915 tha t exceeds protocol specifications and the patient is symptomatic, then the 
symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section 9.4 . 
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the Guidance for the 
Investigator  section  of the Investigator’s  Brochure  and contact  the Sponsor  or designee  within 
24 hours.  
 
9.5.4 Contraception  and Pregnancy  
Male patients and female patients of childbearing potential must continue to use appropriate 
contraception  with their partners,  or refrain  from  sexual  activity,  as described  in Section  6.3.1 . 
If a patient  becomes  pregnant  or a pregnancy  is suspected,  or if a male  patient  makes  or believes 
that he has made someone pregnant during the study, then the Study Center staff must be 
informed immediately.  An Initial Pregnancy Form should be submitted to the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of firs t learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow -up 
ISIS 420915 -CS3 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  5 
22 February  2017  
48 
58  
  
information  including  delivery  or termination  is reported  on Follow -up Pregnancy  Forms  and 
reported within 24 hours.  
Payment  for all aspects  of obstetrical  care,  child  or related  care will be the patient’s 
responsibility.  
Female patients : If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including follow -up), a 
pregnancy  test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed pregnancy  will be immediately 
withdrawn from treatment with IS IS 420915.  However, the patient will be encouraged to 
complete  the post-treatment  follow -up period  of the study  to the extent  that study  procedures  do 
not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study participation, the study 
physician will  assist  the patient  in getting  obstetrical  care and the progress  of the pregnancy  will 
be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy  is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or 
spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and 
Sponsor may require access to the mother’s and infant’s medical records for an additional  
8 weeks  after birth.  
Male patients : The progress of the pregnancy in a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome  of the pregnancy  is known  (i.e., delivery,  elective  termination,  or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy  results in the birth of a child, additional follow -up information may 
be requested for the mother and infant.  Follow -up will be performed to the extent permitted by 
applicable regulations and privacy considerations.

58  
  
Subgroup in the parent study, plus patients who qualified to participate in the ECHO Subgroup 
(whether  consented  or not). Patients  who did not meet  the criteria  for the ECHO  Subgroup  or the 
CM-ECHO Set in ISIS 420915 -CS2, but who are found to meet those cr iteria upon entry into 
ISIS 420915 -CS3, may  also be included in additional analysis (details will be found in the SAP).  
The Per -Protocol Set will include the subset of the Full Analysis Set that have received at least 
70% of the prescribed  doses  of ISIS 420915  and that have  no significant  protocol  deviations  that 
would be expected to affect efficacy assessments.  
 
10.4 Definition  of Baseline  
Definitions  of baseline  are given below  for the purposes  of the final analysis.  
For safety,  baseline  for patients  on active  treatment  in the parent  study  will be the parent  study 
baseline.  For patients on placebo in the parent study, baseline for safety will be the last  
non-missing  assessment prior  to the first dose of ISIS 420915  in this study  (Study  Day 1) 
(details will be found in the SAP).  
For efficacy, 2 baselines are defined for each patient: the parent study baseline and the baseline 
assessment  in this study  (details  will be found  in the SAP).  Further  details  of which  assessments 
will be considered b aseline for Echo analyses for this study will be included in the SAP.  
The baselines  for additional analyses  can be found  in the SAP.  
 
10.5 Interim  Analysis  
An interim analysis may be conducted when the database of the parent study is locked and 
unblinded.  Both  safety  and efficacy  information  from  this study  may be summarized  during  this 
interim  analysis.  Additional  interim  analyses  may be performed,  with the timing  of the analyses 
coinciding with regulatory requirements or study milestones.  At Week 13 and beyond, TTR, 
RBP4, retinol, and NT -proBNP will be analyzed periodically using descriptive statistics.  
 
10.6 Planned  Methods  of Analysis  
All eCRF  data,  lab data transfers,  mNIS+7  score  data,  as well as any  outcomes  derived  from  the 
data, will be provided in the patient data listings.  Patient data listings will be presented for all 
patients enrolled into the study.

Change from baseline to Week 78 and Week 156 and at Week 52 of each subsequent 
treatment year  will be summarized  by treatment  group  of the parent  study  for the following  
efficacy  measures:  mNIS+7  score;  NIS score;  Norfolk  QOL  DN (total  score,  symptoms  domain 
score for Stage 1 patients, and physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy domain score for 
Stage 2 patients); mBMI and BMI; components of the mNIS+7 (NIS, heat -pain sensory,  
touch -pressure  sensory,  nerve  conduction  and heart  rate to deep  breathing  tests);  and PND  score; 
and the following exploratory measures:  ECHO parameters, NT -proBNP, and  
SF-36 questionnaire.  Changes  from  both the parent  study  baseline  and the extension  study 
baseline will be summarized.  
The change from parent study baseline and extension study baseline for the endpoints listed in 
the paragraph  above  will also be analyzed  using  a Mixed  Effects  Model  with Repeated  Measures 
(MMRM).  Details  of the MMRM  will be described  in the statistical  analysis plan.  The MMRM 
will be used to estimate adjusted means at each visit but no formal hypothesis tests will be 
performed.  
For the mNIS+7  score,  the degree  of progression will  be estimated  for the parent  study  period 
and the extension study  period by  treatment group of the parent study.  Similar summaries of 
progression  will be performed  for the components  of the mNIS+7  scores,  NIS scores,  Norfolk 
QOL -DN and its domain scores.

In accordance  with ICH GCP  and the Sponsor’s  audit  plans,  this study  may be selected  for audit 
by representatives from the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department.  Inspection of 
Study Center facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) and review of  
study -related  records  will occur  to evaluate  the trial conduct  and compliance  with the protocol, 
ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
To ensure the quality  of clinical data a clinical data management review will be performed on 
patient data received by the Sponsor.  During this review, patient data will be checked for 
consistency,  omissions,  and any apparent  discrepancies.  In addition,  the data will be reviewe d 
for adherence  to the protocol  and GCP.  To resolve  any questions  arising  from  the clinical  data 
management review process, data queries and/or Study  Center notifications will be sent to the 
Study Center for completion and return to the Sponsor.  
The Principal  Investigator  will sign and date the indicated  places  on eCRF.  These  signatures  will 
indicate that the principal Investigator inspected or reviewed  the data on the eCRF, the data 
queries, and the Study Center notifications, and agrees with the content.  
 
12.5 Language  
The eCRFs must be completed in English.  Generic names for concomitant medications should 
be recorded  in English  if possible,  unless  it is a combination  drug,  then record  the trade  name  in 
English.  
All written  information  and other  material  to be used by patients  and investigative  staff must  use 
vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  
 
12.6 Compensation  for Injury  
The Sponsor maintains appropriate insurance coverage for clinical trials and will follow 
applicable local compensation laws.  Patients will be treated and/or compensated for a ny study - 
related  illness/injury  in accordance  with the information  provided  in the Compensation  for Injury 
section of the Informed Consent document.

Shaded  columns  represent  non-clinic  visits.  Labs  as indicated  may be collected  by the Sponsor’s  home  healthcare  service  or by a local laboratory  (with  prior 
Sponsor approval).  Patients also have the option to go to clinic for these visits.  
Note:  If not specifically  labeled,  “X” means anytime  
1 For an individual patient, a maximum period of 4 weeks is allowed between a patient’s last dose in ISIS 420915 -CS2 (CS2  Week 65 visit) and initiation  of 
dosing in this  study  (CS3 Day  1 visit).  All screening  assessments must  be completed  during this period.  Longer  periods  may be considered  after discussion 
and approval from the Study Medical Monitor  
2 ISIS 420915  can be administered in  the clinic or  at home  by the patient/caregiver.  It is not  necessary  for ISIS 420915 to  be adminis tered  on site during  clinic 
visits.  Clinic visits should occur on a dosing day, 7 days after the previous dose  
3 Assessments  from ISIS 420915 -CS2 may be used  for screening  evaluation  if they were  obtained  within  4 weeks  of Study  Day 1. A longer  period  may be 
considered after discussion and approval from the Study Medical Monitor  
4 Blood  pressure  should be  taken after  the patient  has been sitting  for ≥ 5 min 
5 A +/- 2-week  window  is given  for ERG  and ophthalmology  examinations.  The early  termination  ERG  and ophthalmology  examinations  are only done  if the 
patient discontinues treatment after ≥ 9 mo of dosing or unless deemed necessary by Investigator or Study Medical Monitor  
6 To collect  AEs,  conmeds,  and the general  wellbeing  of the patient  
7 For females  of childbearing  potential  only,  by serum  βhCG except  on Day 1 by urine  hCG (pre-dose)  
8 To be collected  by either  a local laboratory  (if approved  by Sponsor),  Sponsor  appointed  home  healthcare  service,  or Study  Center  as arranged by  the Study 
Center personnel  
9 The 24-hour urine  collection  can be  done  any time during  the screening  period or  during  Week  1 on treatment.  Serum  creatinine  blood  draw  required  
10 If ISIS 420915 administration, ERG, or ophthalmology examinations are to be performed on the same day as a mNIS+7 assessment,  they should be 
performed  after the mNIS+7  assessment  is complete.  For the Week 78  and Week 156 visits,  2 mNIS+7  assessments will  be performed on separate days.  A 
maximum of 2 weeks from the visit (Week 78 or  Week 156) will be allowed to complete both assessments  
11 Norfolk  QOL -DN should  be the  first assessment  performed  at the visit 
12 Study  Day 1 ECHO  can be done any  time in the  screening period  or up to 2 weeks after  Day 1. The Day  1 ECHO  is not done  if the Week  65 ECHO  was 
conducted in ISIS 420915 -CS2.  A +/- 2-week window is given for all other ECHOs  
13 Weekly  platelet  and every  2-3 week  serum  creatinine  monitoring  is required  throughout  the treatment  period  and for a minimum  of 6 weeks  after the last dose 
of Study Drug (this includes early termination patients as well as patients that complete the full treatment period).  The frequency of monitoring after 6 weeks 
from the last  dose of  Study  Drug will be  determined  by the Study  Medical Monitor.  The visit s required to  collect  platelets  and serum creatinine not  included in 
this table are shown in Appendix C . These visits may be completed in clinic, by home healthcare service, or by a local laboratory  
14 Early  termination  should  be performed  at the time of withdrawal,  ideally  within  14 days  from the last dose  of Study  Drug 
15 Omit  if following Year  4 or Year  5 treatment  
16 Perform  mNIS+7  only if early  termination  is from Year  1-3 treatment  
17 Perform  NIS only if early  termination  is from Year  4-5 treatment

1. Introduction  
This statistical  analysis  plan  describes  the final  reporting  for study  ISIS 420915 -CS3 as per protocol 
amendment #5 (22 Feb 2017).  It also describes the interim analyses to support the interim 
reporting.  Any changes from these planned analyses will be stated in the clinical study report.  
 
1.1 Study  Overv iew 
Transthyretin (TTR) is synthesized primarily in the liver and is secreted into the plasma as a 55 KD 
protein  composed  of four  identical  subunits  of 14 KD each.  A major  function  of TTR in the plasma  is 
to transport retinol (vitamin A) to tissues through an association with Retinol binding protein 4 
(RBP4). Transthyretin amyloidosis is a rare hereditary disease caused by mutations in the TTR 
protein. The disease -causing mutations destabilize the normal  tetrameric structure of TTR causing 
its dissociation into free monomers and subsequent aggregation into insoluble fibril deposits.  
These deposits are found in multiple organs including the peripheral nervous system, 
gastrointestinal tract and heart. They result in local damage to cells leading to a peripheral 
polyneuropathy (called Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy or FAP) and a cardiom yopathy (called 
Familial Amyloid Cardiomyopathy or FAC). FAP can be classified into 3 stages of disease based on 
ambulatory status: Stage 1   do not require assistance with ambulation; Stage 2  require  assistance 
with ambulation; Stage 3  wheelchair  bound  (Coutinho  et al. 1980).  The total  worldwide  prevalence 
of FAP has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients (Coelho et al. 2008).  
ISIS 420915 is  an antisense  drug  targeted  to human  TTR mRNA  and its hybridization  to the cognate 
TTR mRNA results in the RN ase H -mediated degradation of the TTR mRNA, thus preventing 
production of the TTR protein.  
ISIS 420915 -CS2 (the parent study) is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study  to assess  the efficacy  and safety  of ISIS 420915  in patients  with  FAP.  The study  plans  to enroll 
approximately 135 patients randomized 2:1 (90 ISIS 420915 to 45 placebo) to receive 300 mg ISIS 
420915 or placebo.  The study drug is administered 3 times during Week 1 and once weekly during 
Weeks 2 to 65.  
The dose level and schedule in the present open label extension (OLE) study (300 mg ISIS 420915 
administered once weekly) is the same dose and schedule used during Weeks 2 to 65 in the 
preceding parent study.  Therefore, in Week 1, ISIS 420915 was admini stered once instead of the 
three times used in the parent study.  Antisense oligonucleotides of this class have been safely 
administered  intravenously  and subcutaneously  in multiple  clinical  studies  at doses  up to 1000  mg 
(Kwoh 2008) and treatment duration  
(Santos  et al.  2012).  The patients  randomized  to ISIS 420915  in the parent  study  receive  65 weeks 
(15 months) of treatment in that study followed by up to an additional 156 weeks  (3 years) in  the 
present OLE study.  The safety and tolerability of the proposed 221 -week dosing period is also 
supported by nonclinical chronic toxicology studies with I SIS 420915.

2. Procedures  
2.1 General  Overview  of Procedures  
The OLE study  will consist  of the following  periods:  
 
-week  screening  assessment  period 
A treatment period of up to 260 weeks  
A 3-month  post -treatment  evaluation  period  
Screening assessments include safety and specialty labs, physical exam, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram  (ECG),  adverse  event  (AE),  concomitant  medication  and concomitant  procedures. 
A maximum period of 4 weeks is allowed be       the parent study (the 
paren t study Week 65 visit) and initiation of dosing in this present OLE study (the OLE study Day 1 
visit).  Periods longer than 4 weeks may be considered after discussion and approval by the Study 
Medical Monitor.  However, the intention is to minimize the treat ment pause between the two 
studies.  Ideally the first dose in this present OLE study should be administered one week after the 
last dose in the parent study.  
Patients  will report  to the  Study Center  for evaluations  and tests  5 times in  Year  1 (Study Weeks  1, 7, 
13, 26, 52) and 2 times in each subsequent year (26th and 52nd week of each year). Physical 
examination, collection of blood for measurement of safety clinical laboratory parameters and 
specialty labs, measurement of vital signs, and col lection of AEs and concomitant 
medication/procedure  information  will be performed  according  to the schedule  of procedures  in the 
protocol Appendix A. The following assessments will also be performed at specified visits during the 
OLE study: mNIS+7, Norfolk  QOL -DN questionnaire, SF -36 questionnaire, PND score, body weight, 
ophthalmology examination, electroretinogram (ERG), ECG, and transthoracic ECHO examination.  
During  Weeks  4, 10, 15, 18, 21, 23, 29, 39, 65, 91, 117,  143, Y4 -W13,  Y4-W36,  Y5-W13  and Y5-W39  
patients labs will be collected by the Sponsor appointed home healthcare service, or the Study 
Center as arranged by the Study Center personnel or by local laboratory with prior Sponsor 
approval.  In addition,  platelets  will be collected  weekly  and serum  creatinine  will be collected  every 
2-3 weeks (see the protocol Appendices A and C). Patients may also be contacted by phone to 
collect AEs, concomitant medication, and concomitant procedure information.  
The mNIS+7  assessment  is conducted  at Weeks  26, 52, 78, 104,  130,  and 156.  Norfolk  QOL -DN 
questionnaire is conducted at Weeks 26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 156, Y4 -W52, and Y5 -W52. The Norfolk 
QOL -DN questionnaire should be the first assessment performed at these visits. If ISIS 420915 
administration, ERG, or ophthalmology examinations are to be performed on the same day as an 
mNIS+7 assessment, they should be performed after the mNIS+7 assessment is complete. For the 
Week  78 and 156 visits,  two mNIS+7  assessments  will be performed  on separate  days.  A maximum 
of 2 weeks from the visit (Week 78 or Week 156) will be allowed to complete both assessments.  
For Weeks  4-52 there  is a ± 7-day visit window.  For Years  2-3 the visit window  is ± 10 -day.  After  Year 
3 the visit window is ± 14 -day. All reasonable atte mpts should be made to ensure compliance with 
the visit  schedule  as outlined  in the schedule  of procedures  (the protocol  Appendix  A). However,  if a 
18 

212  
 visit does  not occur  or is  delayed,  all subsequent  visits  should  be calculated  based  on the time 
elapsed since Day 1 rather than from the date of the previous visit.  
After completion of the treatment period, patients will enter the 3 -month post -treatment 
evaluation  period.  This period  consists  of clinic  and non-clinic  visits for safety  monitoring  as outlined 
in the schedule of  procedures (the protocol Appendix  A and C). Weekly platelet and every 2 -3 week 
serum creatinine testing are required for a minimum of 6 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug 
(this  includes  early  termination  patients  as well as patients  that complete  the full treatment  period). 
Patients that terminate treatment early and do not withdraw consent should have the post - 
treatment visit  conducted 13 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug.  
Patients  may  be allowed  to take  Vyndaqel®  after  18 months  at the discretion  of the Stud y Medical 
Monitor.  
 
2.2 Randomization  & Treatment  Allocation  
There is  no randomization  in this present  OLE study.  All patients  will receive  ISIS 420915,  including 
patients randomized to either ISIS 420915 or placebo in the parent study.  
All patients  will receive  300 mg ISIS 420915 given  once  weekly.  However,  patients  that had a dose 
reduction  or schedule  change  in the parent study  may  continue  with  the same dose  or schedule  in 
this present OLE study.  
Adjustments of dose and/or treatment schedule in the OLE study should occur only on rare 
occasions. Any proposed adjustment to treatment schedule or dose level must be discussed with 
and approved by the Study Medical Monitor prior to initiation. If the pat ient remains stable after 
adjustment  he/she  may  be cautiously  returned  to the original  dose/regimen  after  consultation  with 
the Study Medical Monitor. Patients may be dose paused in response to adverse events after 
consultation with the Study Medical Monitor.  
 
2.3 Conduct  
The Guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki dated October 2002, the 
applicable  regulations and guidelines of the current Good Clinical Practice, as well as demands of 
national  drug  and data  protection  laws  and other  applicable  regulatory  requirements  will be strictly 
followed.  
 
2.4 Data  Monitoring  
 
2.4.1 Safety  Data  Monitoring  
Ionis Pharmaceu ticals, Inc. (or designee) is responsible for processing all reported AEs. All serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs),  reported  to Ionis  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. (or designee),  are reviewed  according 
to standard operating procedures. The medical monitor reviews all AEs and SAEs on an ongoing 
basis throughout the OLE study. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or designee) prepares and submits 
safety reports to the health authorities worldwide in acco rdance with local requirements. If it  
 
 
19 
213  
 becomes necessary to communicate new safety information, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or 
designee)  will also prepare  a safety  notification  letter  and transmit  it to all applicable  study  sites.  
 
2.4.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  
The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the parent study currently also 
reviews  the safety  and tolerability  of ISIS 420915  during  this present  OLE study  as outlined  in the 
Safety Management Plan and DSMB Charter.  
Data  summaries  and listings are presented by  treatment  group  of the parent  study  in an unblinded 
fashion and for all patients from both CS2 treatment groups together. These summaries are 
prepared by an independent statistician. No statistical comparisons across treatment groups are 
provided, and no hypothesis testing is done.  
Further  detail  on the period  of DSMB  oversight  for this study,  meeting  schedule,  assessments  to be 
reviewed and controlled access to data are outlined in the DSMB Charter.  
 
2.5 Data  Management  
 
2.5.1 Case  Report  Form  Data  
BioClinica was responsible for creating the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) data entry screens, 
database and edit checks using definitions developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. A contract 
research organization (CRO), named TRENNIC Data Services, is respon sible for the review, data 
management querying and locking of the database. Data are single -entered into the EDC system by 
the investigator site staff. Programmed edit checks (computer logic that checks the validity of the 
data entered and also prompts for  missing data that are expected to be entered) are run and 
automatic queries are generated. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reviews all data for accuracy and 
validity and generates additional queries in the EDC system when necessary. Exceptions are the 
mNIS+7,  Norfolk QOL -DN, SF -36, PND, NSC, and body weight information that is entered into the 
EDC but firewalled  from  review  by Ionis  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc until  the parent  study  is unblinded.  The 
data are corrected or an explanation concerning the query is provid ed in the EDC system. For the 
purpose of pre -programming and data cleaning, PAREXEL (the contract research organization (CRO) 
performing the statistical analysis) and a firewalled data manager working at the CRO contracted to 
perform data management (TRENN IC Data Services) will have access to the post -baseline mNIS+7, 
NSC, Norfolk -QOL -DN, SF -36, PND and body weight. After all data are entered, reviewed, and 
queried, the database is closed and sent to the statistics group for review and for identification of  
protocol  deviations.  After  any further queries  that arose  from  this review  are resolved,  the database 
is locked. Database closing and locking will be done at the following milestones:  
1. When the last patient in the parent study has completed their last assessments in the 
Treatment  Period  in the parent study.  The parent  study  will be unblinded at  this milestone. 
Therefore, all treatment information are available for this OLE study;  
2. After  all patients  complete  the OLE study,  referred  to as end of study  (EOS).  
 
 
 
20 
214  
 
Details  can be found  in the Data  Management  Plan.  Additional  closing  and locking  may  be done  to 
support  additional  interim  analyses,  with  the timing  of the database  closing  and locking  coinciding 
with regulatory requirements or study milestones.  
 
2.5.2 Laboratory  Data  
Ionis  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. is responsible  for the format  of the laboratory  electronic  data  transfers 
and the transfer schedule.  Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is responsible for the review of the clinical 
laboratory data.  Central laboratory data is not stored in the EDC system.  Investigator sites have  
portal  (in which  case  Investigators  only  have  access to  data  from  their  site).  To ensure  maintenance 
of the study blind in the ongoing parent study, TTR (also called pre -albumin), RBP4, retinol (also 
called vitamin A), and NT -proBNP from the first 13 weeks of treatment in this present OLE study is 
not available  to the Sponsor, Investigators,  Study Center  Personnel,  or the patients until  the parent 
study is unblinded.  
 
2.5.3 Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  Data  and Immunogenicity  (IM)  Data  
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is responsible for the management and review of the PK and IM data. 
This process  involves  reviewing  the patient  and visit identifiers (i.e.,  patient  demographics)  with  the 
clinical  data  collected  in the EDC system.  The PK and IM data  are not stored  in the EDC system.  Prior 
to the parent study unblinding, any ISIS 420915 concentration data sets and IM data sets provided 
to Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. by the respective bioanalytical labs  do not  include results for samples 
collected prior to Week 13,  nor do they include r esults for Unscheduled or early term (ET)  samples.  
 
2.5.4 Echocardiogram  (ECHO)  Data  
The ECHO  data  is collected,  analyzed  and stored  in a secure  database  by an independent  CRO 
 
Hospital (CICL)). The sites  upload  the ECHO  data on  a secure  web -portal for analysis by CICL.  ECHO 
data  is firewalled  from  review  by Ionis  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc until  the parent  study  is unblinded.  For 
the purpose of pre -programming and data cleaning, PAREXEL and a firewalled data manager 
working  at the CRO  contracte d to perform data  management  (TRENNIC  Data Services)  have  access 
to the post -baseline ECHO data.  
 
2.5.5 Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  Data  
All ECG data  (machine  read)  are entered  into the Bioclinica  EDC by the sites.  The Bioclinica  data will 
be used for ECG summary and analysis.  
All triplicate  ECG waveforms  are collected  and stored  in a secure  database  by an independent  CRO 
(Applied Clinical Intelligence, LLC (ACI)). Selected ECGs are analyzed by ACI and the resulting data 
captured in the ACI database as an ECG over -read database. The ECG over -read data are used to 
support medical monitoring and will not be used for the E CG summary and analysis.  
 
 
 
21 

215  
 2.5.6 Modified  Neuropathy  Impairment  Score  +7 (mNIS+7)  and Neuropathy  Symptoms  and 
Change Score (NSC)  
The efficacy assessment, mNIS+7 scores, will be collected and stored by an independent contract 
research group, Mayo Clinic Polyneuropathy Quality Assurance Core Facility (MC  Core) that is under 
the direction of Dr.  . The Neuropathy Symptoms and Change (NS C) score is obtained 
during the NIS assessment procedure and is also collected and stored by MC Core.  The mNIS+7 
results from each site will be faxed to MC Core for processing and quality assurance.  Faxed copies 
will be maintained in secure rooms within lo cked cabinets.  The NIS and NSC data are stored in the 
RedCap (a database).  The other components of the mNIS+7 (nerve conduction, sensory testing and 
heart rate to deep breathing) are entered  by the MC Core into a firewalled portion of the study EDC 
system.  MC Core  only  has access  to this portion  of the EDC system  and the Sponsor  and clinical  sites 
do not have access to the MC Core portion of the EDC.  The mNIS+7 summated score will not be 
shared with the sites.  Up until the parent study EOT database lock and unblinding, the Sponsor will 
only have access to patient parent study baseline values of the mNIS+7.  
 
2.6 Blinding  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for this OLE study will be finalized prior to the parent study 
unblinding.  An interim analysis specified in section 5 will be performed at the parent study 
unblinding.  At that time,  all unblinded  information  and firewall ed datasets in  the parent  study  for 
this OLE study will be available.  
To ensure maintenance of the study blind in the ongoing parent study, TTR, RBP4, retinol, NT - 
proBNP,  PK and Immunogenicity  data  from  the first 13 weeks  of treatment  in this present  OLE study 
are not made available to the Sponsor, Investigators, Study Center Personnel, or the patients until 
the parent study is unblinded.  
Derived mNIS+7 and the components including NIS, +7 and modified +7, as well as NSC, Norfolk 
QOL -DN, SF-36, PND,  body weight  and ECHO  information  are not made  available  for sponsor  review 
until the parent study is unblinded.  For the purpose of pre -programming and data cleaning, 
PAREXEL and a firewalled data manager working at the CRO contracted to perform data 
manageme nt (TRENNIC  Data  Services)  have  access  to the post -baseline  mNIS+7,  NSC,  Norfolk QOL - 
DN, SF -36, PND, ECHO and body weight. Details are discussed in section 5.2. 
 
3. Analytical  Plan  
3.1 Statistical  Design  Summary  
This SAP specifies  the study  endpoints  to be analyzed,  the study  populations,  and the methods  of 
analysis.  Section 3.2 provides general guidelines to be followed for all analyses, and covers the 
analysis populations, handling of missing data, and other general topics.  Analyses of baseline 
characteris tics are also covered in this section.  Section 3.3 discusses the safety analyses.  
Section  3.4 and 3.5 specifies  the efficacy  and PD endpoints  and methods  of analysis  for these 
endpoints.  Section 3.6 covers PK analyses.  
22 
216  
 Section  4 is for the sample  size justification.  Section 5 presents  details  on the interim  analyses  to be 
conducted for this present OLE study.  
The SAP concludes  with  a references  section  and appendices.  
 
3.2 General  Overview  of Analyses  
This SAP describes  the reporting  of data  at the EOS  for this OLE  study  (unless  specified  otherwise). 
Additionally, some of these data will also be reported for the purposes of the interim analyses.  
 
3.2.1 Analysis  Conventions  
All reporting  will be performed  in SAS versio n 9.3 or higher.  
Efficacy  results  will be summarized  under  the treatment  to which  patients  were  randomized  in the 
parent study. Safety and PK results by treatment group of parent study will be summarized under 
the treatment to which patients received in the parent study. Should there be any cases after the 
parent study unblinding in which a patient received treatm ent other than what was randomized, 
such cases will be discussed in the OLE study report and noted in footnotes where applicable.  
All electronic  case  report  form  data,  lab data  transfers, ECHO,  ECG,  and mNIS+7  score  data,  as well 
as any outcomes derived fr om the data, will be provided in the patient data listings.  Patient data 
listings will be presented for all patients enrolled into the OLE study, will include all data collected 
during  the OLE phase,  and will be sorted  by treatment  group of  parent  study,  patient  ID, visit,  and 
time point (where appropriate).  
Central  laboratory  assessments  will be included  in the summary  tables;  local  laboratory  assessments 
will only be included in listings. Exceptions to the use of local laboratory assessment in summary 
tables are made for platelets, where summary tables will use both local and central laboratory 
results.  
All tables will present the population fr equencies in each treatment group in the parent study 
and/or  subgroup  (where  appropriate)  and will indicate  the number  of patients  with  non-missing 
data and the denominators for percentages.  
Descriptive summary statistics including n, mean, percentiles (e. g., median, 25th percentile [P25], 
and 75th percentile [P75]), standard deviation, and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous 
variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables, will be used to summarize data by 
treatment group of the parent study.  Summaries of PK parameters, if applicable, will also present 
geometric  mean,  standard  deviation  of log-transformed  data,  and coefficient  of variation,  expressed 
as a percent (%CV).  Where appropriate, p -values will be reported.  All statistical tests will be 
conducted using 2 -sided tests with a 5% Type I error rate, unless otherwise specified.  
Age will be presented in years.  Weight will be presented in kg.  Height will be presented in cm. 
Temperature  will be presented  in C. Laboratory  values  will be summarized  using  standard units (SI 
units). Precision for displays will use the following conventions.  Means, percentiles (e.g., median, 
P25,  and P75),  least  squares  means,  difference  in least  squares  means  will be displayed  to one more 
decimal place th an measured values. Standard deviations and standard errors will be displayed to  
 
23 
217  
 two more  decimal  places  than  measured values.  The minimum,  maximum and  confidence  intervals 
(CI) will be displayed using the same number of decimal places as the recorded values.  All raw 
values presented in listings will be displayed to the measured precision.  Percentages will be 
displayed  to one decimal  place.  P-values  will be displaye d to 3 decimal  places.  CI will be presented 
using a comma separator rather than a dash.  
As shown in the schematic below, boxplots will display values from minimum to maximum within 
the upper and lower fences, the likely range of variation from P25 to P75 and the median. A symbol 
inside  the box will indicate  the mean.  A segment  inside  the box  will show  the median  and "whiskers" 
above  and below  the box  will show  the locations  of the minimum  and maximum  observations  within 
the upper and lower fences (see definition below). Individual observations outside the upper or 
lower fences will als o be marked.  
 
All efficacy and PD endpoints, except GLS will be assessed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Per - 
Protocol  Set (PPS).  Refer  to Section  3.2.2  for a description  of the patient  populations.  Safety  analysis 
will be performed on the Safety Set ( SS) or Longitudinal Safety Set (LSS).  PK endpoints will be 
assessed in the Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS) as applicable.  ECHO endpoints including GLS will be 
assessed  for all enrolled  subjects,  the ECHO  subgroups  and in the Cardiomyopathy -ECHO  (CM-ECHO) 
Set. 
An interim analysis of this OLE study will take place at the same time when the parent study 
database  is locked  and unblinded  at EOT.  Other  interim  analyses  may  be performed  with  the timing 
of the analyses coinciding with  regulatory requirements or study milestones. See section 5 for 
details on the interim analyses.  The final EOS analyses will take place after all patients have 
completed the study and the database has been locked.

 3.2.1.1  Definitions  and Computational  Formulas  
3.2.1.1.1  Day 1 of ISIS 420915  and CS3 Study  Day 1: 
Day 1 of ISIS 420915 will refer to the first day ISIS 420915 is administered to the patient. For 
patients on active treatment in the parent study, Day 1 of ISIS 420915 will be the first day ISIS 
420915  is administered  in the parent  study.  For patients  on placebo  in the parent  study,  Day 1 of 
ISIS 420915 will be the first day ISIS 420915 is administered in this OLE study.  
CS3 Study  Day 1 will refer  to the first day ISIS 420915  is administered  to the patient  in this OLE 
study.  
CS2 Study  Day 1 will refer  to the first day study  drug  (ISIS  420915  or Placebo)  is administered  to 
the patient in the parent study.  
3.2.1.1.2  Three  baselines  are defined  as following:  
Parent study baseline will be the baseline of the parent study, which is defined for most 
endpoints, unless specified, as the  last non -missing value prior to the Day 1 of treatment, ISIS 
420915  or Placebo,  in the parent  study.  Considerations  for mNIS+7,  ECG,  NSC,  ERG and laboratory 
assessment are detailed below.  
o For mNIS+7 and its individual components, the parent study baseline will be defined as the 
average  of two assessments  taken within  60 days  prior  to the first  dose  of Study  Drug.  If only 
one assessment has been done, the single assessment will be used in pl ace of the average.  
Rarely,  for patient  convenience,  the parent  study baseline  mNIS+7  assessment(s)  (or a subset  of 
this assessment) will have been completed early in the parent study treatment period rather 
than pre -treatment.  These assessments will be included in the analysis as valid baseline 
assessments  provided  they  are taken  within  one week  after  the first dose . The rationale for  this 
is that the pharmacology of the drug indicates that the drug will have no effect on mNIS+7 this 
early in treatment, and including these values as the baseline assessments will allow these  
ent level  data 
imputation are described in  Section 3.2.1.3 of this document. Note that the NIS screening 
assessment can be used as one of the two assessments provided it was done within 60 days of 
first dose of Study Drug. Further details on  how to handle missing baseline results  are described 
in section 3.2.1.3.  
o For NSC and individual components, the parent study baseline will be defined as the average of 
two assessments taken  within  60 days prior to  the first  dose  of Study Drug in  the parent study.  If 
only one assessment has been done, the single assessment will be used in place of the average. 
Because NSC score is collected during the NIS assessment procedure in the parent study, it is 
possible it could be completed early in the treatment period rat her than pre -treatment.  These 
assessments  will be included  in the analysis  as valid parent  study  baseline assessments  provided 
they are taken within one week after the first dose of the parent study.  
o For ECG,  the parent  study  baseline will be defined  as the average  of the triplicate  taken  on Day 
1 Pre -dose in the parent study. If only one or two assessments are available, the single  
 
 
25 

219  
 
assessment  or average  of the two assessments  will be used.  In the case  that Day 1 Pre-dose  is 
missing, screening visit results of the parent study will be used as baseline.  
o The protocol permitted baseline ERG and ophthalmology examinations can be done up to one 
week  after  CS2 Study  Day 1. Assessments  done  within  one week  of first dose  will be included  in 
the analysis as valid parent study baseline assessments.  
o The parent  study  baseline  laboratory  assessment including  PD will be defined  as the average  of 
all non -missing pre -dose assessments in the parent study.  
OLE study  baseline  will be defined  as the last non-missing  assessment  prior  to the first dose  of ISIS 
420915 in the OLE study ( CS3 Study Day 1 ). However the last assessment must be collected 
within 3 months (90 days) before CS3 Study Day 1 of OLE study in order to be used to derive the 
baseline, i.e. if there is no assessment within 3 months, the OLE study baseline will be missing.  
Depending  on whe n the assessments  are scheduled  to be collected  this may  be derived  from the 
CS3 Study Day 1 or the screening visit  in the OLE study or the last non -missing assessment from 
the parent study. Considerations for mNIS+7, NSC, and ECG are  detailed below:  
o For mNIS+7  (and  its individual  components)  and NSC (and its  individual  components),  if the last 
assessment is the Week 66 assessment in CS2,  the average of the two Week 66 assessments 
will be taken (as defined in the CS2 Statistical analysis plan). If only one assessment has been 
done, the single assessment will be used.  
o For ECG,  the OLE study  baseline will be defined  as the average  of the triplicate  taken  at the 
screening visit of the OLE study. If only one or two assessments are available, the single 
assessment or average of the two assessments will be used.  
screening  visit of the OLE study,  the last visit in the parent  study  collected  within  3 months  (90 
days) before CS3 Study Day 1 of OLE study will be used as baseline.  
ISIS 420915  baseline will be the parent  study  baseline for patients  randomized  to ISIS 420915  in 
the parent study, and will be the OLE study baseline for pat ients randomized to placebo in the 
parent study.  
3.2.1.1.3  Three  baselines  for analyses:  
Efficacy analyses and PD analyses are based on the parent study baseline and the OLE study 
baseline . Details  of separate  analyses  based  on each  baseline  will be specified  in the section  3.4 
and 3.5. 
Safety  analyses  are based  on ISIS 420915  baseline . Details  of separate  analyses based  on each 
baseline will be specified in the section 3.3. 
Further  details  of which  assessments  will be considered  baseline  for ECHO  analyses  for this 
present OLE study are included in a separate SAP for the ECHO data.  
 
 
3.2.1.1.4  On-treatment,  post -treatment  and on-study  in either  the parent  study  or the OLE 
study (Details on the planned summary/analysis at each period are discussed in 
the section 3.2.1.4 ): 
26 
220  
 
For efficacy  endpoints  except  for BMI and mBMI:  
o  The efficacy on -treatment period for the parent study spans the time during which the 
study  treatment  is administered  from  the CS2 Study  Day 1 until  52 days  after  the last dose 
of medication in the parent study.  The efficacy on -treatment period for the OLE study is 
from the CS3 Study Day 1 until 52 days after the last dose of medication in the OLE study  
o For both  studies  the efficacy  post -treatment  period  starts  on the day after  the efficacy  
          within the study.  
For BMI,  mBMI  and PD endpoints:  
o The on -treatment period for the parent study spans the time during which the study 
treatment is administered from the CS2 Study Day 1 until 28 days after the last dose of 
medication  in the parent  study.  The on-treatment  period  for the OLE study  is from  the CS3 
Study Day 1 until 28 days after the last dose of medication in the OLE study.  
o For both  studies  the post -treatment  period  starts  on the day after  the treatment  period  and 
ends on the day of the patie  
For safety  endpoints  except  for ERG:  
o The on -treatment period for the parent study spans the time during which the study 
treatment is administered from the CS2 Study Day 1 until 7 days after the last dose of 
medication  in the parent  study.  The on-treatment  period  for the OLE study  is from the CS3 
Study Day 1 until 7 days after the last dose of medication in the OLE study.  
o For both  studies  the safety  post -treatment  period  starts  on the day after  the safety 
treatment  
o For both  studies  the Safety  on-study  period  spans  the time  drug  is first administered  until  
o The period  for the longitudinal  safety  analysis spans  the time  from  the first dose  of ISIS 
study.  The subject s last contact date is defined as follows:  
(1) for subjects  who  signed  an informed  consent  form in  the OLE study,  it is the last contact 
date within the OLE study;  
(2) for subjects  who  did not sign  an informed  consent  form  in the OLE study  but had  been  
administered ISIS 420915 in the parent study, it is the last contact date within the parent 
study. The details of longitudinal safety analysis for AEs and safety lab results will be 
addressed in section 3.3. 
For ERG:  
o The on -treatment period for the parent study spans the time during which the study 
treatment is administered from the CS2 Study Day 1 until 28 days after the last dose of 
medication  in the parent  study.  The on-treatment  period  for the OLE study  is from the  CS3 
Study Day 1 until 28 days after the last dose of medication in the OLE study.  
27 

221  
 
o For both  studies  the safety  post -treatment  period  starts  on the day after  the safety  
 . 
The PK on-study  period  for the OLE study  spans  the time ISIS420915  is administered  in the OLE 
study ( CS3 Study Day 1 ) OLE study.  
The Immunogenicity  (IM)  on-study  period  for the OLE study spans  the time  the first dose  of 
 
OLE study.  This period  is for defining  patient  IM status  (Details  in section  3.2.1.1.6) . 
3.2.1.1.5  Durations  of study  drug  exposure  and total  dose  of ISIS 420915:  
Durations of overall drug exposure (days) across both studies will be derived as the difference in 
days between the date of the last dose of ISIS 420915  and Day 1 of ISIS 420915 plus one. For 
patients  who  are not enrolled in  the OLE study,  the last dose  of ISIS 420915  is administered  in the 
parent study; for patients who are enrolled in the OLE study, the last dose of ISIS 420915 is 
administered in the OLE study.  
The total dose of study drug during the treatment period for either the parent study or the OLE 
study will be computed for pati ents receiving ISIS 420915 by summing the dose administered 
between  Day 1 of ISIS 420915 and the last dose  date  in the parent  study  for patients  who  are not 
enrolled in the OLE study or the last dose date in the OLE study for patients who are enrolled in 
the OLE study.  Total  dose  will be summarized  in milligrams as  part of longitudinal safety analysis.  
Duration  of drug  exposure  in OLE study  (days)  will be derived  as the difference  in days  between 
the date of the last dose of ISIS 420915 in OLE study and CS3 Study Day 1 plus one.  
The total dose of study drug during the treatment period for the OLE study will be computed for 
patients  receiving  ISIS 420915  in the OLE study  by summing  the dose  assigned  between CS3 Study 
Day 1 and the EOT date or date of early termination in OLE study. Total dose will be summarized 
in milligrams.  
3.2.1.1.6  Immunogenicity  (IM):  
For subjects with negative IM status in the parent study, the onset (T first) of anti -ISIS 420915 
antibodies in OLE study will be derived as difference in days between the date when first 
immunogenicity  sample  becomes  confirmed  positive  (i.e.,  positive  samp le IM status)  in OLE study 
and Day 1 of ISIS 420915 plus one.  
For subjects  with  positive  IM status  in the parent  study,  the onset  (Tfirst) of anti-ISIS 420915 
antibodies in the parent study will be used as the onset of the OLE study.  
3.2.1.1.7  BMI  and mBMI:  
Body mass index ( BMI ) will be computed  using the formula: 
BMI = (weight  in kilograms)  / [height  in cm / 100]2 
Modified  BMI (mBMI ) will be computed  from  BMI and serum  albumin  levels  by: 
mBMI = BMI * serum albumin (g/L).

222  
 
3.2.1.2  Scoring  of Assessment  Instruments  
mNIS+7  
The mNIS+7  consists  of two composite  scores:  the NIS composite  score  (maximum  of 244 points) 
and the modified +7 composite score (maximum of 102.32 points).  
NIS 
The NIS composite  score  consists  of 4 components:  
 
Cranial Nerves (NIS -C), maximum 40 points 
Muscle  Weakness  (NIS-W), maximum  152 points 
Reflexes (NIS -R), maximum 20 points  
Sensation  (NIS-S), maximum  32 points.  
Questions  that make  up each  composite  are listed  in the table  below.  
 
NIS composite  Question  number  
Cranial  Nerves  1-5 
Muscle  Weakness  6-24 
Reflexes  25-29 
Sensation  30-37 
Note  that each  question  is separately  assessed  for the right  and left side of the body,  meaning  that 
questionnaire is comprised of 74 subcomponents (37 for the left side, and 37 for the right side).  
Modified  +7 
The modified  +7 composite  score  consists  of 4 components: 
1 component for autonomic nerve assessment:  
o Heart  Rate  to Deep  Breathing  (HRDB),  minimum -3.72  points,  maximum  3.72  points, 
1 component for the  nerve conduction assessment of the lower and upper limbs:  
o Nerve Conduction Tests (  5 NC), maximum 18.6 points from 5 subcomponents (PMAK, 
TMAK,  UMAE,  USAW,  SSAB)  with  minimum -3.72  points  and maximum  +3.72  points  each,  
2 components  for the sensory  nerve  assessment:  
o Touch -Pressure  (TP),  maximum  40 points  
o Heat -Pain  (HP),  maximum  40 points.  
NOTE: Testing for both TP and HP is done at up to 10 sites on one side of the body. To 
obtain  the full body  score  for TP and HP, the summation  scores  from  all 10 anatomical  sites  
 
29 
223  
 is multiplied by 2 (only one side of the body is tested a s FAP is symmetr ical neur opathy, 
identical results are assumed for the  other side).

Additionally, for Heat Pa in and  Touch  Pressure,  the compos ite scores are  calcu lated by mu ltiplying 
the sum of the  10 averaged subcomponent  scores (defined below) by 2. 
NIS+7 
 
The NIS+7 consists  of two  compos ite scores:  the NIS composite  score  (above) and the +7  compos ite 
score (max imum of  26.04 points). 
+7 
 
The +7 compos ite score  consists  of 3 components:  
 
• 1 component  for autonom ic nerve  assessment:  
 
o Heart  Rate to  Deep B reathing (same as mod ified +7), minimum -3.72 points, maximum 3.72 
points,  
• 1 component  for the peripheral nerve assessment  of the lower  limb: 
 
o Nerve  Conduct ion Tests  (LS NC nds),  maximum 18.6  points from 5 subcomponents  (PMAK, 
PMCVK,  PMLA,  TMLA,  SSAB) w ith minimum -3.72 points and maximum +3.72 points each. 
Please note that 3 of the subcomponents  used  in +7 (PMCVK, PMLA,  TMLA) are different 
from 3 of the subcomponents used in mod ified +7 (TMAK, UMA E, USAW).  
• 1 component  for the sensory  nerve assessment  
 
o Vibration Detection Thresho ld (VDT),  minimum  -3.72 points, maximum  3.72 points.  
 
Due to  the testing  algor ithm and the MC Core  data entry  convent ions, raw+ 7 data need  to unde rgo 
a pre-process ing step before the scores can be derived. The different pre-processing  steps are

quest ions are assessed  for the feet, legs, hands  and arms , with presence of  a symptom  scored  as a 1 
and absence as  a 0. The Quest ion Sco re is ca lculated by  summing  the scores for  the individua l sites 
for the Quest ion, with the Question  Score ranging from  O (no symptoms) to  4 (symptoms in the feet, 
legs, hands, and arms).  The other Quest ions, except Quest ions 31 and  32, are scaled  on a 5 point 
Likert scale, ranging  from O ("Not a prob lem") to  4 ("Severe Prob lem") . In Question 31, "Good"  is 
scored as  0, "Very  Good" is scored as  -1, "Excellent'' is scored as  -2, "Fair" is scored  as 1, and "Poo r"

SF-36 
 
The SF -36 (version: 2) consists of two composite scores, the Physical Component Summary score 
and the Mental  Component  Summary  score,  as well as eight  domain  scores  (physical  function,  role- 
physical,  bodily  pain,  general  health,  vitality,  social  functioning,  role-emotional,  and mental  health). 
The scoring of the SF -36 will be conducted using Quality Metrics Certified Scoring Software v 4.5.  
NSC 
The NSC questionnaire (version: 04Jan2009) consists of one total score and five domains  (muscle 
weakness, sensory (hypo/loss of sensation), sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation), autonomic 
(gastro  intestinal  (GI) and urinary  incontinence),  and autonomic  (non -GI/non -urinary  incontinence). 
The muscle weakness domain is divided into four sub -domains (head and neck, chest, upper limbs, 
and lower limbs). The scoring of the NSC questionnaire is described in the Appendix 2 Scoring of 
Assessment Instruments.  
3.2.1.3  Handling  of Missing  or Replicated  Data,  Unscheduled  Visits,  and Early  Termination 
Visits  
 
Composite  score:  NIS score,  +7 score,  NIS+7 score,  modified  +7 score,  or mNIS+7  score  
Missing  data  imputation  strategies  for missing  visit  level  data  
If a patient  misses  a visit (or the visit is performed  outside  the analysis  visit window),  or the entire 
mNIS+7/NIS+7  assessment  is not conducted at  a visit,  then  the mNIS+7/NIS+7  and the composite, 
components and subcomponents will be considered to be missing at that visit.  
Missing  data  imputation  strategies  for missing  assessment  level  data  
In the parent study, two independent assessments of mNIS+7 are planned at the baseline visit and 
Week 66 visit, and the early termination visit (for patients that terminate treatment early). A single 
mNIS+7  assessment  is also planned  at the Week  35 visit.  In this present  OLE study,  two independent 
assessments  of mNIS+7 are  planned  at the  Week  78 and  156 visit,  and the early termination  visit for 
patients that terminate treatment early during years 1 to 3. A single mNIS+7 assessment is also 
planned at the Week 26, 52, 104 and 130 visit.  The mean of the two replicate assessments within 
visit will be used  for analysis  of the parent  study  baseline, the  parent  study  Week  66 visits  (provided 
both visits fall in the visit window and are within 52 days of the last dose of medication), the OLE 
study Week 78 and 156 visit (provided both visits fall in the visit window and are within 52 days of 
the last dose  of medication).  Subcomponent scores will be averaged first.  These  will be  referred  to 
as the averaged subcomponent scores.  
At the parent study baseline and Week 66 visit, and the OLE study Weeks 78 and 156 visit, in the 
event that only one subcom ponent has been performed, the single subcomponent will be used in 
place of the mean value for that visit for the averaged subcomponent score. If both of the 
subcomponent  values  are missing,  the averaged  subcomponent  score  is missing.  At the parent  study  
 
33 

227  
 
and OLE study  visits where  one assessment is performed,  the single subcomponent will  be used  as 
the averaged subcomponent score for that visit. These values will be used in the summary  of 
averaged  subcomponent  scores.  The component  scores  will be computed  by summing  the averaged 
subcomponent scores and the composite scores will be computed by summ ing the component 
scores.  
For both CS2 and CS3, two independent assessments of mNIS+7 are planned at early termination 
visits. If both assessments are within the same visit window, the mean of the two will be used. At 
early terminations, in the event that only one subcomponent has been performed, the single 
subcomponent  will be used  in place  of the mean  value  for that visit for the averaged  subcomponent 
score.  
Imputation  of missing  averaged  subcomponents  
If a patient  has completed  at least part  of the mNIS+7/NIS+7 at  a visit then  the following  imputation 
method will be used to impute this missing assessment level data for the purposes of determining 
component scores for summary and analysis.  
The following  missing  data  imputation  steps  will be considered  and will be used  as described  below 
for Groups A, B, and C:  
Step  1: If at least  50%  of averaged  subcomponent  scores  within  a component  are available,  the 
 
non-missing  averaged  subcomponent  scores  in that component.  The component  score  is then 
calculated.  
Step 2 ( Parent study baseline ): In the unlikely event that there are more than 50% of the 
averaged subcomponents scores within a component that are missing at baseline, the missing 
averaged subcomponent scores will be set to equal to mean baseline averaged subcomponent 
score  from  the parent study  Randomized  Set (across  treatment  groups).  The component  score  is 
then calculated. This is the same definition as used in the parent study.  
Step  3 (OLE  study  baseline  and CS2 and CS3 post -baseline  visits):  For certain  components,  and 
only under  certain  conditions which  will be listed  below, the  missing  averaged  subcomponent 
scores at that visit within that component only will be set equal to the mean averaged 
subcomponent score among the subjects randomized to placebo in the parent study in the 
Randomized and Enrolled set for CS2 and CS3 respectively.  The component score is then 
calculated.  This is the same definition as used in the  parent study for post -baseline visits.  
If a post -baseline assessment does not fall into the scheduled analysis windows, there is no 
obvious  visit on which  the mean  subcomponent  scores in  the placebo  group  can be derived.  In 
order  to apply  step  3, the following  visits will  be used  to derive  the mean  scores  in the placebo 
group:

*Note:  the Placebo  group  refers  to the group  of patients  randomized  to placebo  in the parent  study  in the 
Enrolled set for CS3.  
The components  of the mNIS+7  and NIS+7  are grouped  into A,  B and C based  on the imputation  step 
used, as follows. A detailed list of components by group can be found in Table 1  Table 3 in 
Appendix 1 Components and Subcomponents of the mNIS+7, and NIS+7:  
Group  A: For components  with  multiple  subcomponents  except  the NCT component  of +7, 
imputati on step 1 and 2 will be applied.  
If, after applying step 1 for post -baseline visits, 6 out of the 7 components of the  mNIS+7 
composite  score  (NIS-C, NIS-R, NIS-S, NIS-W, HP, TP or NCT)  are available  and only one  is missing 
at that visit,  then step 3 will be applied for the missing component.  
If, after applying step 1 for post -baseline visits, 4 out of the 5 components of the  NIS+7 
composite score  (NIS-C, NIS-R, NIS-S, NIS-W, or NCT ) are available  and only  one is missing at 
that visit,  then step 3 will be applied for that the missing component.  
Mean averaged subcomponent score used in the imputation described in step 3 are derived 
from  the averaged  subcomponent  scores  before  step  1 imputation  among  the group  of patien ts 
who were randomized to placebo in the parent study.  
If, after  applying  steps  1-3 as appropriate,  there are  still missing  subcomponent  scores,  the 
component score will be set to missing.  
Group B:  For the NCT component of +7, it should be noted that the following 3 of the 5 
subcomponents  of this  as an additional  category  to missing:  
1) fibular nerve motor conduction velocity (PMCVK), 2) fibular nerve distal latency (PMLA), 3) 
tibial  nerve  distal  latency  (TMLA)  (see Table  3 in Appendix  1 Components  and Subcomponents  of 
the mNIS+7,  and NIS+7 ). These nerve  conduction  attributes  are not evaluable when  the tibial  or 
fibular nerve amplitude is 0, therefore, these  considered informative 
missing results and a slightly different imputation method is applied here.  The following 
imputation rule will be used for Nerve Conduction Tests compone nt score of +7: The normal 
deviate score for PMCVK, PMLA and TMLA will be respectively set to 3.72 (the worse response)  
 
35 

229  
  and 2 will 
be applied.  
If, after applying step 1 for post -baseline visits, 4 out of the 5 compo nents of the  NIS+7 
composite score  (NIS-C, NIS-R, NIS-S, NIS-W, or NCT ) are available  and only  one is missing  at 
that visit,  then step 3 will be applied for that the missing component.  
Mean averaged subcomponent score used in the imputation described in step 3 are derived 
from  the averaged  subcomponent  scores  before  step  1 imputation  among  the group  of patients 
who were randomized to placebo in the parent study.  
Note  that these  component s are not used  in the nerve  conduction  component  of the modified  
+7, therefore  Group  B only  includes  the NCT component  of the NIS+7  and not the NCT 
component of the mNIS+7.  
Group  C: The two components,  HRDB  and vibration  tests,  have  only  one subcomponent. 
Missing data for these averaged subcomponents score will be imputed as follows:  
o For Parent study baseline , the missing averaged subcomponent  scores will be set to equal 
to the mean  baseline  averaged  subcomponent  score  from  the parent  study  Randomized  Set 
(across treatment groups). This is the same definition as used in the parent study.  
o For OLE study baseline and CS2 and CS3 post -baseline visits, the missing averaged 
subcomponent scores at that visit will be set equal to the mean avera ged subcomponent 
score  among  the subjects  randomized  to placebo  in the parent  study  in the Randomized  and 
Enrolled  set for CS2 and CS3 respectively.  If a post -baseline  assessment  does  not fall into the 
scheduled analysis windows, there is no obvious visit on which the mean subcomponent 
scores in the placebo group can be derived. In order to derive the mean scores in the 
placebo group, the following visits will be used:

 Composite  Score  
The composite scores of mNIS+7, NIS+7, modified +7, +7, and NIS will each be calculated by 
summing  the imputed  components scores.  If any of the component  scores after  imputation  is still 
missing within a composite, the composite score will be set as missin g. 
 
Norfolk  QOL -DN Domain  and Total  score  
 
For each patient at a specific visit (defined by the analysis visit window), if at least 50% of the 
questions for a domain (physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy, activities of daily living, 
symptoms,  small  fiber  neuropathy)  are not missing  or if at least  one question  is not missing  for 
autonomic domain, the missing questions are imputed as follows:  
o For the Parent study baseline , if any question is missing at baseline, the mean value for this 
question  at baseline  from  the parent  study  Randomized  Set (across  treatment  groups) will  be 
used to impute the missing baseline question value, i.e., same with the derivation in the 
parent study. For the symptom domain, in the case that a patient responded on a particular 
question (Questions 1 - 7) as not a having  the symptom but also marked presence of the 
symptom in their feet, legs, hands, or arm, the question will be set to missing and the 
imputation rules will be followed.  
o For the OLE study baseline and post -baseline visits: any missing question values will be  
imputed  using  the last observed  or imputed  question  value  (including parent  study  baseline 
value).  For the symptom domain, in the case that a patient responded on a particular 
question (Questions 1 - 7) as not a having the symptom but also marked presence of the 
symptom in their feet, legs, hands, or arm, the question will be set to missing and the 
imputation rules will be followed.  
o Otherwise,  the total  for that domain  will be set to missing.  
The Norfolk  QOL -DN total  score  will be calculated  by summing  the imputed  domain  scores.  If any 
domain score after imputation is still missing, then the Norfolk QOL -DN total score will be set to 
missing.  
The Norfolk  QOL -DN individual  domain  and total  scores will  only  be calculated  for visits  where  the 
patient  had a Norfolk QOL -DN assessment.  The individual domain and total scores are set to be 
missing if a patient misses the visit or does not have a Norfolk QOL -DN assessment at that visit.  
NSC Domain  and Total  score  
In the parent study, two independent assessments of NSC are planned at the baseline visit and the 
Week 66 visit. A single NSC assessment is  planned at the Week 35 visit. In this present OLE study, 
two independent assessments of NSC are planned at the Week 78 and 156 visit. A single NSC 
assessment is  planned at the Week 26, 52, 104 and 130 visit. The mean of the two replicate 
assessments within a visit will be used for analysis of the parent study baseline, the parent study 
Week  66 visits  (provided  both  visits fall in the visit window  and are within  52 days  of the last dose  of 
medication), the OLE study Week 78 and 156 visit (provided both visits fall in the visit window and  
 
37 
231  
 are within  52 days  of the last dose  of medication).  The individual  questions  scores  will be averaged 
first. These will be referred to as the averaged question scores.  
At the parent study baseline and Week 66 visits and the OLE study Weeks 78 and 156 visit, in the 
event that only one question ha s been performed, the single question will be used in place of the 
mean  value  for that visit for the averaged  question  score.  If both  of the questions  are missing,  the 
averaged  question score is missing. At the parent study Week 35 visit, the OLE study Wee k 26, 52, 
104 and 130 visit only one assessment is performed, therefore the single question will be used as 
the averaged question score for that visit. The sub -domain and domain scores will be computed 
using the averaged question scores  
Imputing  Missing  Assessment  averaged  question  Scores  
The following imputation rule will be applied at the domain level for the sensory (hypo / loss of 
sensation),  sensory  (paresthesia,  hyper  sensation),  autonomic  (GI and urinary  incontinence),  and 
autonomic (other than GI/urinary incontinence) domains  
If at least 50% of the averaged question scores in the domain are available, the missing 
questions  will be set to be equal  to the mean  of the non-missing  averaged  question  scores  in the 
domain.  The total  domain  score  is then  calculated  from the  sum  of the non-missing  and imputed 
averaged question scores  in the domain  
Otherwise,  the domain  score  will be considered  to be missing  
Note  for the imputation  of the autonomic  (other  than  GI/urinary  incontinence)  componen t in 
women, questions 35 and 36 are ignored and are not included in the imputation procedure  
The following  imputation  rule will be applied  at the sub-domain  level  for the four  muscle  weakness 
sub-domains (head and neck, chest, upper limb, lower limb):  
If at least 50% the averaged question scores in the sub -domain are available, the missing 
averaged  question  scores  will be set to be equal  to the  mean  of the non-missing  questions  in the 
sub-domain.  The total  sub-domain  score is  then  calculated  from the  sum  of the non -missing  and 
imputed averaged question scores in the sub -domain  
Otherwise,  the sub-domain  score  will be considered  to be missing  
The total value for the muscle weakness domain score is calculated by summing the four sub - 
domain  scores.  If one or more  of the sub-domain  scores  is missing,  the muscle  weakness  domain 
score will be missing.  
The total  NSC score  is calculated  by summing  the 5 domain  scores.  If one or more  of the domain 
scores is missing the total NSC score will be missing.  
Imputation of  Missing/Partial Dates The imputation  of partial  or missing dates for adverse events 
and concomitant medications are detailed in Section 3.3.1. The imputations of partial or missing 
dates for  duration  of disease  from  diagnosis  and duration  from  onset  of symptoms  for FAP/FAC  are 
detailed in Section 3.2.3.  
Replicated  Data,  Unscheduled  Visits,  and Early  Termination  Visits  
 
38 
232  
 When change from baseline is assessed at a post -baseline visit, unless otherwise specified, only 
patients with both baseline and post -baseline measurements will be included in the analyses.  If 
baseline  or post -baseline  value  is missing  for a patient,  then  the change  from  baseline  will be set to 
missing.  
For patients  who  withdraw  from  the OLE study,  all data  will be reported  prior  to the point  of 
withdrawal in line with the population definitions and the specified analysis.  
For data  that are scheduled  to be measured  in duplicate  or triplicate,  the mean  value  of the patient 
will be used in tables and figures, while all measured values will appear in the listings.  
If more  than  the scheduled  number  of measurements  is taken,  the mean  will include  all replicate 
measurements.  
Analysis  Visit  Windows  
 
The efficacy and PD data will be assigned to a visit according to the visit windows in the table 1 
of Appendix  3 Analysis  Visit  Windows . Because  mNIS+7  may be implemented  over  several  days, 
window definitions are based on the study day the assessment was initiated. Efficacy 
assessments (except BMI and mBMI) that occurred more than 52 days after the last dose of 
Study Drug in either parent study or the OLE study will not be included in t he efficacy 
analysis/summaries  during  the efficacy  on-treatment  period,  even  if they  occurred  within  one of 
the visit windows.  PD assessments, as  well as BMI and  mBMI, that  occurred  more  than  28 days 
after the last dose of Study Drug in either parent study  or the OLE study will not be included in 
the PD analyses/summaries during the PD on -treatment period, even if they occurred within 
one of the visit  windows.  For patients  who have  multiple  visits  within  a window the visit  nearest 
the target day will be used unless two visits are equally near,  in which case the average will be 
used. Note that if there are multiple visits within a window with some being from the post - 
treatment evaluation period of either the parent study or the OLE study, the visits from the  
post -treatment  evaluation  period  will not be used.  For mNIS+7 at  baseline  and Week  66 of the 
parent study or at Week 78 and 156 of the OLE study, the two assessments are averaged 
(provided  both  assessments  are within  the visit window  and are within  52 days  of the last dose 
of medication).  
Efficacy and PD data collected during the post -treatment period will be summarized with 
respect to the elapsed time from last dose. Assessments will be slotted into follow -up visit 
windo ws according  to elapsed  time  from  last dose  based  on the scheduled  assessments  during 
the post -treatment  evaluation  period  of the study.  The planned  windows for  this investigation 
are shown in the table 2 of Appendix 3 Analysis Visit Windows.  
Visit  based  safety  assessments  (scheduled  and unscheduled)  will be assigned  to a visit  according 
to analysis visit windows in the table 3 of Appendix 3 Analysis Visit Windows, even if they 
occurred within one of the visi t windows. Except for platelet assessments from the local 
laboratory, local laboratory assessment will  not be assigned to a visit and the nominal visit only 
will be presented in the listings. Safety assessments that occurred during the safety post - 
treatme nt period  (i.e.,  more  than  7 days  after  the last dose  of study  drug)  will not be included  in 
 
39 
233  
 the visit based safety analyses during the  safety treatment  period . If there are mu ltiple visits 
within  a window, the visit nearest the  target da y will be used  unless  two visits are  equa lly near, 
in which case the  average will be used. Note that safety assessments that are  not utilized in the 
visit based summary  tables will appear in listings  and be used in the determ ination of treatment­ 
emergent shifts  or abnormalit ies. 
• To assess the impact  of treatment discont inuation on safety parameters , data from visit based 
safety assessment  in the  post treatment  phase may also be  summar ized with respect to the 
elapsed t ime from last dose. Assessment will be slotted into follow-up visit windows accord ing 
to elapsed t ime from last dose based  on the  scheduled assessments dur ing the  post-treatment 
evaluation period of the  study. The p lanned windows for th is invest igation are shown in the 
table  4 of Append ix 3 Analysis Visit Windows.  
3.2.1.4  Data  Summary  Plan  
 
The table belo w details what data will be included in the  summa ry and ana lysis output by  endpo int 
type.  Data  summar ized or analyzed at each interim ana lysis w ill be based on data  collected  up to the 
data cut date. It is poss ible that on-treatment  data and post-treatment data  available for each 
interim analysis is different from the final  analysis at the end of study because data collected after 
each inter im analys is data cut may slot into different  treatment  period.  Outputs  will be  updated  for 
each  inter im analys is and for the final analysis. In select instance s the data for  a type  of endpoint 
that is summar ized or analyzed may not be cons istent with the  rules in the  table belo w; such 
except ions will be noted in this document.

3.2.3 Patient  Characteristics  
Patients disposition, including reasons for permanent discontinuation from ISIS 420915 or 
withdrawal  from  follow -up, and number  of patients  in each  analysis  population  (FAS,  PPS,  SS, LSS, 
PKS, ECHO Subgroup, CM -ECHO Set), will be summarized by treatment group of the parent study 
and overall for all enrolled patients.  
Patient  allocation  by investigative  site will be tabulated  by parent study  treatment  group  and 
overall for th e all enrolled patients.  
Protocol  deviations  in OLE study  will be listed  and summarized  by deviation  category.  
The following  patient  demographic  characteristics  will be summarized  by treatment  group  of the 
parent study and overall for the SS, FAS, PPS, PKS, CM -ECHO Set and ECHO subgroups:  
Sex, race,  ethnicity,  TTR genotype

 Age at the parent  study  screening  and age at the OLE study screening  
Duration derived from the informed consent form signed date in the OLE study, including 
duration  of disease  from  FAP diagnosis  (months) and  duration  from  onset  of FAP symptoms 
(months)  
Number  and percent  of enrolled  patients  within  each  of the 3 randomization  strata  from  the parent 
study (previous treatment with Vyndaqel® or Diflunisal; disease stage; V30M TTR mutation) will be 
summarized  by treatment  group  of the parent  study and  overall  for the SS, FAS,  PPS,  PKS,  CM-ECHO 
Set and ECHO subgroups.  
The following  will be provided  for both parent  study  baselines and OLE study  baselines defined  in 
section 3.2.1.1 and for the SS, FAS, PPS, PKS, CM -ECHO Set and ECHO subgroups:  
Baseline severity of illness, including the NIS score, NIS+7, mNIS+7, PND score, mBMI, BMI, weight, 
height, and NT -proBNP will be summarized by parent study treatment group and  overall.  Measures 
of quality of life and level of functioning, including the ba seline Norfolk  QOL -DN total score and pre - 
dose  SF-36 will also be  included.  Disease  history  collected  in the parent  study  will be summarized  for 
analysis sets defined above: Information on familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) will be 
summarized, includin g FAC diagnosis (Y/N) at parent study screening, duration of disease from FAC 
diagnosis (months), duration from onset of FAC symptoms (months), and clinical or laboratory 
criteria used to document the diagnosis of TTR cardiomyopathy.  
Missing/partial dates (month and year) for the duration of disease from diagnosis for FAP/FAC and 
duration from onset of symptoms for FAP/FAC will be imputed as follows: since CRF only collects 
year and month for FAP and FAC Diagnosis and onset of symptoms, for calculating the duration, a 
day of 15th  will be used  if only  day is missing.  JUL01 will  be used  if both  day and month  are missing. 
If the imputed date is after the date of informed consented at CS2, use the informed consented at 
CS2 as the imputed date. Calculate as following  
(a) Duration  (month)  = number  of month (date  of informed  consented  at CS3- date  of FAP or FAC 
diagnosis +  1) 
(b) Duration  (month)  = number  of month  (date  of informed  consented  at CS3- date  of onset  of FAP 
or FAC symptoms + 1)  
Exposure  to Study  Drug  in OLE study  will be summarized  by treatment  group  of the parent  study  for 
the SS by durations of drug exposure in OLE study (days), total number of dose received, and total 
dose administered (in milligrams).  Across all visits, number of subjects with dose pauses and 
reasons for dose pause will be tabulated.  A listing present ing for each subject the number of dose 
reductions  (frequency  of administered dose  < protocol defined  dose, i.e.  300 mg) and  missed doses 
(injection not givens) will  be provided.  Doses that were not  given because the patient discontinued 
will not be summarized.  
Overall  drug  exposure  from the  start  of the parent  study to  the end of the OLE study  will be 
summarized for patients who took ISIS 420915 in the parent study, i.e. LSS.  
Medical  history  and base line physical  examination  findings  collected  in the OLE study  will be listed 
depending on the data availability.  
44 
238  
 Medications  will be coded  using  WHO  Drug  Dictionary.  The final  version  used  will be designated  in 
the clinical study report.  Concomitant  medications used  will be summarized by treatment group 
for the SS and the CM -ECHO Set.  
All medications  including  concomitant  medications  will also be listed  in a by patient  listing. In  the 
listing, medications which are started before the CS3 Study Day 1 will be marked.  
Patients  with  any anti-platelet  or anti-coagulant  medication  taken  at any time  during  this study  will 
be presented in a listing.  
A concomitant  medication  is defined  as any medication  taken  whilst  investigational  product  is being 
taken in this study.  
If a partial  date  is recorded  in the case  report  form,  the following  convention  will be used  to assign 
the medication:  
 
if the partial  date  is a start  date,  a '01'  will be used  for the day and 'Jan'  will be used  for the 
month  
if the partial  date  is a stop  date,  a '28/29/30/31'  will be used  for the day (dependent  on the 
month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month.  
The recorded  partial  date  will be displayed  in listings.  
The definitions  for on-treatment  and on-study  concomitant  medication  defined  relative  to use of 
the investigational product are shown schema tically in the diagram below.

 3.3 Safety  Analyses  
All safety endpoints will be summarized for the OLE study SS.  In patient listings, ISIS 420915 
baseline values and information collected in the OLE study will be displayed. In addition, 
longitudinal  safety  analysis  of selected  safety  endpoints  for LSS will be performed  for patients  on 
ISIS 420915 in the parent study.  
Safety  endpoints  include  the following: 
Adverse events  
Vital signs and weight 
Physical examination 
Clinical  laboratory  tests 
ECG 
Ophthalmology  and ERG examinations  
 
3.3.1 Imputation  of Missing/Partial  Dates  
The following imputation rules will be applied to impute AE start dates under c onservative 
principles. If the month, year, and day are missing, the adverse event start date will be imputed as 
the treatment start date. If month and day are missing and year is available and is the same year as 
in treatment  start date,  the month  and day from the  treatment start date  will be used  to impute the 
missing month and day for the adverse event start date. Otherwise, missing month and day will be 
imputed  as January 01. If  day is  missing  and month and  year is available  and the month  and year ar e 
the same  month  and year  in treatment  start  date,  the day from  the treatment  start  date  will be used 
to impute missing day for the adverse event start date. Otherwise, missing day will be imputed as  
01. 
Note: Treatment start date mentioned above is CS3 Study Day 1 in general. In addition, special 
considerations  should  be given  to AEs which  started  in the parent  study  but continued  at the time 
the patient enrolled in the OLE study. If the AE was originally recorded in the CS2 database, the 
treatment start date mentioned above is from CS2 but not CS3 Study Day 1.  
 
3.3.2 Adverse  Events  (AEs)  
Adverse  events  will be coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA).  The final 
version used will be designated in the clinical study report.  For each AE, the severity level of the 
event (mild, moderate, or severe) will be determined by physician opinion.  
TEAEs are defined as adverse events t hat first occurred or worsened after the first dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS 420915 or  Placebo). This is the general definition of TEAEs. A detailed definition of TEAEs 
for safety  analysis  of the OLE study  or for the  longitudinal  safety  analysis  will be discussed  in section  
3.3.2.6  or in section  3.3.2.7,  respectively.  
 
 
46 
240  
 
In this section,  whenever  first dose  of ISIS 420915 is  used,  it refers  to CS3 Study  Day 1 for OLE study 
analysis and Day 1 of ISIS 420915 for longitudinal safety analysis.  
An AE with  a completely  missing  start  date  will be assumed  to be treatment  emergent.  
If the maximum  severity  of the adverse  event  is greater than  the baseline severity,  i.e. severity prior 
to the first dose  of ISIS 420915,  or if the onset  date/time  is the same  as or after  the date/time  of the 
first dose of ISIS 420915, then the event is considered to be treatment emergent.  
In the situation  where  change  in severity  (but no chan ge in seriousness)  occurs  for an adverse  event, 
study sites are instructed to enter an end date and start a new record for the adverse event. In the 
new record, the changed severity is to be  recorded and the start date will be set to be the end date 
of the previous record. Data linking those records are collected in the database. Consider three 
scenarios:  
 
The first AE record  occurs  prior to  the first  dose  of ISIS 420915,  the second  AE record  occurs  on 
or after  the first dose  of ISIS 420915,  and the severity  increases:  Only  the second  record  will be 
counted as treatment -emergent.  
The first AE record  occurs prior to the first dose of ISIS 420915,  the second AE record occurs on 
or after  the first dose  of ISIS 420915,  and the severity  decreases: Neither  record  will be counted 
as treatment -emergent.  
Both  records  occur  on or after  the first dose  of ISIS 420915:  If the AE severity  on the second 
record  is worse  than  the severity  on the first record,  then  count  both  records  as treatment - 
emergent.  But, if the severity improves, then only count the first record as treatment - 
emergent.  
Of note,  when  counting  the total  number  of treatment -emergent  events,  events  linked  through 
change in severity will still be counted as separate events.  
In addition,  special  considerations  should  be given  to AEs which  started  in the parent  study  but 
continued at the time the patient enrolled in the OLE study. These situations may occur if  the 
in the parent study. Records for these 
AEs will be created  in the OLE study  database  with  a different  AE index  number  so that they  can be 
updated with information collected in the OLE study, e.g. stop date and treatment. The following 
rules describe how these AEs will be handled in the OLE study analysis for SS and the longitudinal 
safety analysis for LSS:  
 
For AEs with  the same  Lower  level term  (LLT),  complete start  date  and severity  recorded  in both 
the parent study and the OLE study: keep the record in the OLE Analysis Data Model (ADaM) 
dataset, but this record is not considered treatment  emergent in CS3. In the longitudinal safety 
analysis, this record will be counted once (it is considered treatment emergent in CS2 and 
therefore considered treatment emergent in the longitudinal safety analysis).  
Note  that an event  which  started  during  the gap period  between the  parent  study  and the OLE study 
will not be considered treatment emergent in the CS3 analysis, unless the severity of the event has 
increased after the first dose in CS3. Such events will be regarded as treatment emergent in the  
 
47 
241  
 longitudinal safety ana lysis (see below) conducted  on the LSS.  Since subjects random ized to p lacebo 
in the parent  study  are not included  in the LSS,  if a placebo subject  from  the parent  study 
exper iences  such  an event,  that event  will not be summarized in any of the CS2,  CS3 or longitudina l 
safety analyses. 
A listing will be provided stating which pat ients reported each preferred term. Adverse events in 
the fo llowing categories will be summar ized separately:  
 
• Adverse events  of special  interest  
 
• Other  adverse  events of interest  
 
Summa ry tables of the number and percentage of patients with these adverse events will be 
displayed  split by AEcategory and treatment group.  TEAEs of special  interest and  other  TEAEs  of 
intere st will also be summa rized for  patients in the CM-ECHO Set. 
3.3.2.1  Adverse  Events  of Special  Interest  (AES/)

on the day of inje ction and resolut ion date not on  the da y of injection or  the da y after  the injection , 
will be included . Events with onset  date on the day of inject ion and missing resolution date will also 
be included . AEs with partia l or missing dates will be hand led as follows. First estab lish whether  the 
event is treatment eme rgent (Deta ils ofTE AEdefin ition see section 3.3.2.6 for TEAEoccur red dur ing 
the OLEstudy and section  3.3.2.7  for TEAEfor overall including the parent  study and OLE  study). If 
yes, then establish if the preferred  term s match  the ones listed in the L CRISdefin ition. If yes, check 
whether  the e vent onset dates are within the specified  time frame . If at thi s stage , onset date is 
 
49 
243  
 
missing  or partially  missing,  the event  will be considered  to have  started  within  the required  time 
frame.  
The number  and percent  of patients  in each  treatment  group  of the parent  study  experiencing  LCRIS 
will be tabulated.  
Percentage of injections leading to local cutaneous reactions at the injection site will also be 
summarized.  Percentage  of injections  leading  to local  cutaneous  reactions  will be calculated  for each 
patient as (A/B)*100, where A is the number of injections with a local cutaneous reaction at the 
injection site, and B is the total number of injections.

symptoms:  
o Chills  
o Myalgia  
o Arthralgia  
Only events that start on the day of injection or the day after injection will be included. AEs with 
partial or missing d ates will be handled as follows. First establish whether the event is treatment 
emergent (Details  of TEAE  definition  see section 3.3.2.6 for TEAE  occurred during  the OLE study and 
section  3.3.2.7  for TEAE  for overall  including  the parent  study  and OLE study).  If yes, then  establish  if 
the preferred terms match the ones listed in the flu -like reactions definition. If yes, check whether 
the event onset dates are within the specified time frame. If at this stage, onset date is missing or 
partially missing,  the event will be considered to have started within the required time frame.  
The number  and percentage  of patients  in each  treatment  group  experiencing  flu-like reactions  will 
be tabulated.  
The percentage of injections leading  to flu -like reactions will a lso be summarized.  The percentage  of 
injections  leading  to flu-like reactions  will be calculated  for each  patient  as (A/B)*100,  where  A is the 
number of injections associated with a flu -like reaction, and B is the total number of injections.  
3.3.2.5  Mortality  
Death  that occurs  after  the first dose  of ISIS 420915  will be analyzed  as follows:  
Time  from  Day 1 of ISIS 420915  to the date  of death for  LSS and time  from CS3 Study  Day 1 to the 
date  of death  for SS will be  summarized  for the  patients that  met the  criterion using the following 
descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, median, P25, P75, and minimum and maximum.  
3.3.2.6  OLE Study  Analysis  of TEAEs

The following  categories  of AEs in  the OLE study will  be summarized  by treatment group  from the 
parent  study:  all TEAEs;  TEAEs  leading  to early  discontinuation  from  Study  Drug  or from  the study; 
and serious adverse events.  The percentage of patients reporting the adverse event will be 
summarize d by MedDRA  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  and Preferred  Term (PT),  and will be sorted  by 
SOC alphabetically and then by decreasing frequency of PT within SOC.  
Summaries of drug related TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, TEAEs grouped by duration of 
exposure to t he Study Drug at the start of the event (  
months  to < 24  months  to < 
 
< 1 will also be provided.  Duration  of exposure  and the 
number of doses is calculated from CS3 Study Day 1 to the start date of event.  
All TEAEs  will be summarized  for subgroups  defined  by the following  variables: 
Age at parent study screening (<65 years and >=65 years),  
Sex (Female and Male),

Adverse events summaries including data from the combined study periods of the parent and OLE 
studies  will be provided  for subjects  in the LSS  analysis  population.  These  summaries  will include  all 
TEAEs  which  started  on or after  the first dose  of ISIS 420915 in  the parent  study  and before  the day 
would be the one obtained from the OLE study. For subjects who are not enrolled in the OLE study 
the last contact  date  would  be the one obtained  from  the parent  study.  Note  that AEs which  started 
during the gap period between the completion of the parent study and the first dose of the OLE 
study and are not considered TEAEs in the OLE study will still be included in these summaries. In 
other words, it is  possible that there will be events which are not considered parent study TEAEs or 
OLE study TEAEs, but will be counted towards this analysis.  
These TEAEs will be summarized for subgroups defined by the following variables: Age at parent 
study screening (< 65 years and >=65 years), Sex (Female and Male), Race, Region (North America, 
Europe  and South  America  /Australasia),  and CM-ECHO  Set (Included  and Not Included).  Results  will 
not be provided for a variable if the overwhelming majority of patients are within one level of the 
subgroup.  
Summaries of drug related TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, adverse events leading to early 
withdrawal  from Study  Drug,  TEAEs  duration  of exposure  to Study  Drug  at the start  of event  (< 6 
 60 months)and Number of  doses at the 
start  of event  (   
) will also be provided.  Duration  of exposure  and the number  of doses is  calculated  from  
Day 1 of ISIS 420915  to the start  date  of event.  
TEAEs  in the following  categories  will also be summarized  in tables  and listed  separately: 
Adverse events of special interest (defined in section 3.3.2.1)  
Other  adverse  events  of interest  (defined  in section 3.3.2.2)  
Local  cutaneous  reactions  at injection  site (defined  in section 3.3.2.3) 
Flu-like reactions (defined in section 3.3.2.4 ) 
Summary  tables  of the number  and percentage  of patients  with  these  adverse  events  will be 
displayed split by AE category.  
Mortality  defined  in section  3.3.2.5  on LSS will be summarized.

 3.3.3 Vital  Signs,  Weight,  and Physical  Examination  Findings  
Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood  pressure, pulse, respiratory  rate, and  temperature. 
Weight will also be analyzed.  Absolute value at each visit, change and percent change from ISIS 
420915  baselines  to each  visit in  vital  signs  and weight  will be summarized  by treatment  group  of 
the parent study.  Same summary for weight will al so be presented based on the parent study 
baseline and the OLE study baseline. No statistical comparisons between treatments will be 
performed for this summary.  
All vital  signs  and weight  will be listed.  Physical  examination  findings  will also be listed.  
 
3.3.4 Laboratory  Measurements  
Laboratory tests to ensure patient safety include chemistry panel, complete blood count with 
differential, thyroid panel, coagulation panel, immunogenicity, inflammatory panel, complement, 
and urinalysis.  Absolute value, ch ange and percent change from ISIS 420915 baselines will be 
summarized by visit and treatment group for continuous laboratory tests.  No statistical 
comparisons between treatments will be conducted for these summaries. The mean value (and 
associated standard  error) will be plotted by treatment group in the parent study  or by V30M TTR 
mutation at randomization during the parent study over visits for the following laboratory 
parameters:  platelets,  creatinine  clearance by  CKD-EPI, Albumin,  urine  AC ratio,  and urine PC  ratio.  
Summary  for Albumin  will also be presented  based  on the parent  study  baseline  and the OLE study 
baseline.  
All laboratory test results will be listed. Separate listings will be provided for local and central labs. 
The central  lab listing  will be based  on the ADaM dataset and  will include  all central  lab records.  The 
local lab listing will be based on the SDTM d ataset. A separate  listing for platelets will  be provided 
that includes assessment from both the local and central labs. A separate listing will contain only 
values outside of normal ranges. The number and percent of patients that stopped treatment 
because  met a protocol -defined stopping rule for liver function, renal function, or platelet counts 
will be tabulated by treatment group of the parent study.  
Additional  investigation  of hepatobiliary  laboratory  assessments,  platelet  counts  and renal 
parameters  will be performed, and  are detailed in  the sections  below. In  this investigation 
confirmed laboratory values will also be summarized.  
A confirmed  value  is based  on a consecutive  lab value  performed  on a different  day to, but  within  7 
days of, the initial v alue. If that value is in the same or worse category then the initial value is 
confirmed. If the consecutive value is in a better category then the initial value is confirmed using 
the consecutive  value  category.  If there  is no retest  within  7 days  then  the initial  value  is presumed 
confirmed. If there are multiple results on the same day (no matter from the same lab vendor or 
different lab vendors), then the worst value will be utilized in the analysis.

Confirmed value < 25 x 10^9/L  
Note  that a platelet  value  of 140 x 10^9/L  is the lower  limit  of normal  for the central  laboratory  and 
will be used as the LLN for all platelet assessments. Furthermore, the platelet counts that define 
platelet  count  decrease  grades  are based  on interactions  with  a regulatory  authority,  and align  with 
the definitions  from  the National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events 
version 4.03 (except that the CTCAE does not subdivide Grade 1 into Grade 1a and 1b).

3.4.2 Efficacy  Endpoints:  mNIS+7  Score  and Components,  Norfolk  QOL -DN Total  Score  and 
Domain Scores  
The efficacy  endpoints  that are statistically  analyzed  are the following  
Change  and percent  change  in the mNIS+7  score  from  either  the parent  study  baseline  or the 
OLE study  baseline  to Week  78 and Week  156 
Change  in the Norfolk  QOL -DN questionnaire  total  score  from  either  the parent  study  baseline  
or the OLE study  baseline  to Week  78 and Week  156 
Change in the mNIS+7 components (NIS, heat -pain sensory, touch -pressure sensory, nerve 
conduction  and heart  rate to deep  breathing  tests)  from  either  the parent  study  baseline  or the 
OLE study baseline to Week 78 and Week 156  
Change  in the Norfolk  QOL -DN questionnaire  domain  scores  (symptoms  domain  score  for Stage 
1 patients, and physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy domain score for Stage 2 patients) 
from either the parent study baseline or the OLE study baseline to Week 78 and Week 156  
The maximum  mNIS+7  composite  score  is 346.32  points.  It can be brok en into two components:  the 
NIS component (maximum of 244 points) and the modified +7 component (maximum of 102.32 
points).  It can be further  divided into  the following  8 components: cranial  nerves,  muscle  weakness, 
reflexes, sensory, heart rate deep breat hing, nerve conduction, touch -pressure sensory, and heat - 
pain sensory.  
The normal  deviates  (nds)  from heart  rate deep  breathing and  nerve  conduction  will be used  in 
calculation of mNIS+7.  
The mNIS+7 assessment  is conducted  at the parent  study baseline  (2 times), Week  35, 66 (2 times), 
the OLE study  Week  26, 52, 78 (2 times),  104,  130 and 156 (2  times)  visit.  For visits  where  repeated 
assessments  are done,  the average  will be used  for analysis.  Subcomponent  scores  will be averaged 
first, and the average composite score will be computed by summing the averaged subcomponent 
scores.  
3.4.2.1  Additional  Efficacy  Analysis  on the Change  from  the Parent  Study  Baseline  
The following  additional  analysis  will be done  for mNIS+7  score  and Norf olk QOL -DN total  score:  
59 

253  
 Degree of Progression  The degree of progression in the parent study and this OLE study will 
be summarized using the FAS. The degree of progression is defined as the change in the 
endpoint per one month. The degree of progression and corresponding 95% CI will be derived 
separate ly for each treatment group. A plot of degree of progression over time by treatment 
group assigned in the parent study will also be provided. The degree of progression will be 
derived over the 15 months treatment period of the parent study and then over 12  months 
treatment  intervals  in the OLE study.  The degree  of progression  will be summariezed  described 
in section 3.4.1 as follows:  
o Average  monthly  progression  over  the first 15 months  (i.e. from  the first dose  administered  to 
Week 66 in the parent study) will be derived by dividing the estimated change from parent 
study baseline to Week 66 by 15.  
o Average monthly progression over the first 12 month interval in the OLE study will be 
estimated  by dividing  the estimated  change  from Week  66 in the parent  study  to Week  52 in 
this OLE study by 12.  
o Average monthly progression over the second 12 month interval in the OLE study will be 
estimated  by dividing  the estimated  change  from  Weeks  52 to  Week  104 in this OLE by 12. 
o Average monthly progression over the third 12 month interval in the OLE study will be 
estimated  by dividing  the estimated  change  from Weeks  104 to Week  156 in this OLE by 12. 
 
Responder Analysis for mNIS+7 score  A responder analysis based on the change in mNIS +7 
score will be conducted to examine whether improvement in response is consistent over a 
range of response thresholds using the OLE study FAS.  A responders is defined as a patient 
whose mNIS +7 score chang e from the parent study baseline to the respective post -baseline 
visit in the OLE study, i.e. Weeks 26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 156 from the OLE study, is less than or 
equal  to the threshold  value.  Threshold  values  to be tested  will include 0,  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 
30 points above the baseline values.  For each  response threshold, the response rates at each 
post -baseline visit in the OLE study for both the treated group and the placebo group will be 
calculated and plotted against the response threshold.  Evalua ble patients that terminate  
treatment  early  irrespective  of the reason  or had missing  the respective  post -baseline  visit in the 
OLE study data will be considered a non -responder.  Because a patient may not be followed in 
the OLE long enough to contribute d ata at a visit, the analysis at a visit is limited to  evaluable 
patients,  defined as patients who are in the study longer than the upper bound of analysis visit 
window for that visit (see Table 1 of Appendix 3 Analysis Visit Windows ). For example, the week  
26 window extends up to day 206, and a patient would be considered evaluable at Week 26 if 
(data cut date  first dose date) was more than 206 days.  
The efficacy  analyses  described  in this section  will be repeated  using  the OLE study  PPS. 
3.4.2.2  Additional  Efficacy  Analysis  on the Change  from  the OLE Study  baseline

Note  that the 7 point  change  score  (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3) that is recorded  on the NSC questionnaire 
will be listed but not summarized or analyzed. Similarly for questions 20 -29 the location is only 
listed. Questions 31 -34 are of particular interest and therefore the number and percentage of 
patients responding 0 (No), 1 (slight +), 2 (moder ate ++) or 3 (severe +++) will be presented.  
 
3.5 Pharmacodynamic  (PD)  Analyses  
Descriptive  statistics  as described  in section  3.4.1  (but without  stratification  by subgroup) will  also 
be provided the following PD endpoints:  
61 
255  
 
Change  and percent  change  in TTR level  from  either  the parent  study  baseline or the OLE study 
baseline to Week 78 and Week 156  
Change  and percent  change  in RBP4  level  from  either  the parent  study  baseline  or the OLE 
study baseline to Week 78 and Week 156.  
In addition the proportion  of patients with percentage decrease from either the parent study 
baseline  or the OLE study  baseline in plasma  transthyretin  (TTR)  60%  will be summarized  by 
parent study treatment group at each visit.  
As not all subjects  will get to year  4 and 5 of the study,  data from  year  4 and 5 will be summarized as 
described in section 3.4.1.  
 
3.6 Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and Immunogenicity  (IM)  Analyses  
PK endpoints  include  the following:  
Plasma  trough  and post -treatment  levels  of ISIS 420915  in all evaluable  patients  in the OLE study 
PK set  
IM endpoints  include  the following:  
IM status  [confirmed  positive/negative  or unevaluable  and,  when  applicable,  titer  of anti-ISIS 
420915 antibodies (ADA)] in all patients in the OLE study SS  
 
peak titer,  time  to reach  peak  titer,  etc.)  in the OLE study  SS 
Plasma  samples  will be collected  at protocol  designated times  for ISIS 420915  plasma PK  and IM 
assessments.  
 
3.6.1 Plasma  Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma  concentrations  of ISIS 420915  will be summarized  at interim  analyses  and final  analysis  at 
EOS of the OLE study.  
Plasma concentrations of ISIS 420915, along with the scheduled (nominal) and actual sampling 
times (i.e., time from subcutaneous dosing) will be listed for each evaluable patient by treatment 
group  of the parent  study,  actual  dose,  gender,  patient  immunoge nicity  (IM)  status,  and study  day. 
Percent  differences  between  nominal  and actual  dose,  as well as between  scheduled  and actual 
sampling times will also be listed for all patients.  
ISIS 420915  plasma  trough  (predose)  concentrations  will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics 
by dose, study day, and scheduled time point, without and with stratification by prior treatment in 
the parent study and patient IM status (see Section 3.6.2 ). For the purpose of calculating typical 
summary descripti ve statistics (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, percentiles 
(e.g., median, P25, and P75), minimum, and maximum) for plasma concentrations, all BLQ values 
will be set to zero.  Mean  plasma  concentrations  that are below  the LLOQ will  be presen ted as BLQ, 
and the SD, SE, and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Other stratifications may also be  
62 

256  
 
performed if  deemed warranted  to properly interpret the pharmacokinetic analysis. Samples will be 
excluded from descriptive statistics if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual 
sampling times  (percent difference  between  scheduled and actual sampling time greater  than 3 0%), 
or large  deviations  between  actual  dose  and nominal  dose  (percent  difference  between  nominal  and 
actual dose greater than 30%). Any samples excluded from the summary descriptive statistics, if 
deemed necessary, will be listed separately along with the  reason for exclusion.  
For all evaluable patients, ISIS 420915 plasma trough (predose) concentrations versus time (actual) 
profiles for each individual patient, as well as corresponding mean (±SD) plasma concentration 
versus time (scheduled) profiles will be presented graphically on linear and semilogarithmic scales, 
without and with stratification by prior treatment in the parent study and patient immunogenicity 
status  (see Section  3.6.2) . Other  stratifications  may  also be performed  if deemed  warranted.  At the 
discretion  of the pharmacokineticist  and/or  biostatistician,  samples  may  be excluded  from  the mean 
plots if there are large deviations between scheduled  and actual sampling times, or large deviations 
between actual dose and nominal dose.  
 
3.6.2 Immunogenicity  (IM)  Analyses  
Samples collected during treatment and post -treatment period, including early termination and 
unscheduled samples for IM assessment as specified in the study protocol  will be analyzed for ADA. 
However,  plasma  samples  collected  at other  time  points  (or for PK purposes)  may  also be potentially 
evaluated if deemed of further interest and warranted by the pharmacokinetic scientist. Samples 
that are confirmed IM positive  are subjected for titering, which may include but not limited to the 
samples collected on Days 85, 176, 358, 540, 722 , or 1086 during treatment period.  
 
confirmation  assay  results  (i.e.,  confirmed  positive  result);  otherwise,  the 
 
and when applicable, titer  of anti -ISIS 420915 antibodies) during and  after  treatment  with study 
drug  (ISIS  420915   
study,  dose,  and study  day. 
Patient  IM status:  
positive  sample  result  at any  time  during  the treatment  or post -treatment  evaluation  periods.  Study  
 
and post -treatment  evaluation  periods  are IM negative  and they  have  at least  one evaluable  IM 
 
status.  Subject IM results will be listed by treatment group of the parent study and dose for all 
evaluable  patients,  which  will include  but may  not be limited  to: patient  IM status  (positive,  negative 
or unknown), the day associated with the first positive IM status emerged since receiving ISIS 
420915 treatment (T first, i.e., onset of ADA development as described below), the last positive IM 
status observed (T last), the last evaluable IM sample  collected (T last sampling ), peak titer, and time to 
reach peak titer.  
 
 
 
63 

257  
 
Onset of immunogenicity : The onset (T first) of anti -ISIS 420915 antibodies for OLE study will be 
derived  as the difference  between  the date  when  first immunogenicity  sample  becomes  confirmed 
positive (i.e., positive sample IM status) and Day 1 of ISIS 420915 plus one.  
If a patient  has confirmed  positive  IM samples  detected  on or prior  to Day 1 of ISIS 420915,  e.g., 
pre-existing antibodies cross -react with ISIS 420915, the onset in the OLE study for that patient  
Other immunogenicity data analysis (e.g. classification as persistent or transient status, etc.) may 
be performed  as described  below  (Shankar  et al, 2014) if deemed  warranted  at the discretion  of the 
pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/or biostatistician.  
Transient  ADA  response  will be defined  as: 
Treatment -induced  ADA  detected  only  at one sampling  time  point  during  the treatment  or follow - 
up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, which ought to be considered 
persistent unless shown to be undetectable at a later time) or  
Treatment -induced  ADA  detected  at two or more  sampling  time  points  during  the treatment  
of any 
 
sampling time point is ADA -negative. 
Persistent  ADA  response  will be defined  as: 
Treatment -induced  ADA  detected  at two or more  sampling  time  points  during  the treatment  
(Including follow -     -positive  samples  (irrespective  of any 
negative samples in between) are separated by a period of 16 weeks or longer or  
Treatment -induced  ADA  incidence  only  in the last sampling  time  point  of the treatment  study 
period  or at a sampling  time  point  with  less than  16 weeks  before  an ADA -negative  last sample.  
The sample IM incidence (number)  and incidence rate (percent) at each evaluated study time point, 
and for the overall treatment and post -treatment evaluation period, as well  as subject  IM incidence 
and incidence rate, will be determined and appropriately summarized by treatment group of the 
parent study, as the total number of and percentage of evaluated subjects with IM negative, 
positive,  and unknown  status.  Subjects  with  positive IM status  may  further  be classified  as transient 
or persistent status if applicable, with incidence and incidence rate being transient or persistent 
appropriately  summarized.  Furthermore,  onset,  titer  over  time,  peak  titer  of the ADA  response, and 
time to reach peak titer, if applicable, will be also appropriately summarized (using descriptive 
statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%), and range and presented graphically, if deemed 
appropriate,  by treatment  group  of the parent  study (e.g.,  summarized  at each  evaluated  study  time 
point and overall; summarized by observed peak titer values from the individual IM positive 
patients; etc.).  
 - Day 1 of  ISIS 420915  
+1; 
Time  to reach  peak  titer  in days  = The date  of peak  titer  observed - Day 1 of ISIS 420915 +1; 
64 
(Including  follow - -positive  samples  (irrespective  
258  
 In addition to PK assessments (Section 3.6.1) , selected efficacy (Sections 3.4 to 3.5) and safety 
(Section  3.3) assessments  will also be further  stratified  by patient  IM status  (i.e.,  patient IM  status 
being positive, negative, or unknown) and presented in tables and/or graphically, as deemed 
appropriate or warranted by the designated study pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/or 
biostatistician.  Efficacy  measures  to be strat ified  by patient  IM status  will include,  but may  not be 
limited to, TTR level, mNIS+7, and Norfolk QOL -DN score.  Safety measures to be stratified by 
patient IM status will include, but may not be limited to, AEs, and lab tests for hematology and 
kidney fun ctions.  
Other  stratifications  (e.g.,  based  on antibody  titer,  onset  of ADA,  etc.)  of selected  PK, efficacy  and 
safety assessments may also be performed if deemed warranted at the discretion of the 
pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/or biostatistician.  
 
4. Sample  Size 
No sample size calculations were performed as this is an extension study to the double -blind , 
placebo -controlled  ISIS 420915 -CS2 study.  Approximately  135 patients  were  planned  to be eligible 
to enroll into this present OLE study.  
 
5. Interim  Analyses  
Database  closing  and locking  will be done  at the following  milestones:  
1. When all patients in the parent study have completed the EOT assessments, the OLE study 
database  will be cleaned  and will be unblinded according  to CS2 unblinding  plan.  Therefore, 
all treatment information is available for this OLE study to the team specif ied in the CS2 
unblinding  plan.  This interim  analysis  will be used  to support  the FAP regulatory  file. For  this 
interim analysis the data cut -off date utilized was prior to the last subject completing EOT 
assessments in the parent study CS2 to allow sufficient time for data cleaning prior to 
closing the database for analysis.  
2. After  all patients  complete  the study (at EOS).  This will be considered  the final  analysis  of 
this OLE study.  
Additional  closing  and locking  may  be done  to support  additional  interim  analyses,  with  the timing 
of the database closing and locking coinciding with regulatory requirements or study milestones.  
 
5.1 Interim  Analysis  at EOT of the Parent  Study  
A planned  interim  analysis  of the OLE study based  on cleaned  database  will be performed  after  all 
patients in the parent study have completed EOT assessments and the parent study is unblinded 
according to CS2 unblinded plan.

 6. Study  Conduct to  Minimize  Bias 
The sponsor  recognizes  the importance  of confidentiality  of interim  results before  the parent  study 
is unblinded.  To minimize any potential risk to the integrity of the study, the first interim analysis 
will be conducted only after the database of the parent study is locked and unblinded.  
The ISIS 420915  CS2/CS3  DSMB  will conduct  regular  safety  reviews  throughout  the study.  Until  the 
parent study is unblinded, the outputs will be prepared by an independent statistician who is 
independent from the sponsor.  
The independent statistician who supports DSMB will  be an  employee of a CRO (InVentiv),  one that 
is independent from a second CRO conducting the trial (ICON) and a third CRO (PAREXEL) who will 
be performing the final statistical analysis.  InVentiv will also provide programming support for the 
DSMB,  handle  all DSMB  related  analyses,  independent  of the Sponsor  and independent  of ICON and 
PAREXEL.  The independent statistician from InVentiv will maintain secure custody of blinded and 
unblinded data to ensure the integrity of the data.  Additionally, the independent statistician will 
maintain all unblin ded data in electronic form in a secure area.  All transfer of data/reports by the 
independent statistician to the DSMB, which includes patient data will be by secure, trackable 
courier and/or secure electronic means.  The independent statistician will provi de all of the 
unblinded data to the DSMB as outlined in the DSMB Charter.  
All DSMB members will sign a Confidentiality Agreement with the Sponsor.  In addition, all DSMB 
members will treat as confidential the reports, meeting discussions, minutes and recomm endations 
of the DSMB.  Strict rules for DSMB communication with the Sponsor have been put in place for the 
purpose of minimizing the potential for bias, as outlined in the DSMB Charter.  All written 
communication described in the DSMB Charter will be by sec ure, trackable courier and/or secure 
electronic  means.  This includes dissemination  of DSMB  recommendations,  and review  of minutes  of 
open  and closed  sessions  between  the DSMB  and,  as appropriate,  other  DSMB  members and/or,  the 
Sponsor contacts (primary, CMO and statistics).  
During  the conduct  of this OLE study  and before  unblinding  of the parent  study,  the Sponsor  will not 
have  access  to any efficacy,  PD or exploratory  data,  except  for parent  study  baseline  values  and data 
collected after the Week 13 visit for the following endpoints: plasma retinol, plasma TTR, plasma 
RBP4 and plasma NT -proBNP .  The efficacy data will be collected and stored by independent CROs 
as detailed below.  All CROs will maintain secure custody of their databases.  The CROs will not 
transfer any efficacy data other than baseline data or post -Week 13 data for certain endpoints to 
the Sponsor  until  after  all patients  in the parent  study  have  completed  the treatm ent period  and the 
database of the parent study has been locked and unblinded.  The efficacy or PD data includes the 
following:  mNIS+7, NIS+7, Norfolk QOL -DN, BMI/mBMI, plasma retinol, plasma retinyl palmitate, 
plasma TTR, plasma RBP4,  plasma NT -proBNP, SF -36 questionnaire, ECHO  efficacy parameters,  NSC 
and PND scores. Derived mNIS+7 and the components including NIS,  +7 and modified +7, as well as 
NSC, Norfolk QOL -DN, PND, body weight and ECHO will be available before the parent study is 
unblinded to PAREXEL  who are preparing this SAP and are performing statistical analysis.  
 
 
 
72 
266  
 
For the purpose  of data  cleaning,  an independent  data  manager  at Trennic  Data  Services  will also 
have access to post -baseline data for the following endpoints: mNIS+7, NIS+7, Norfolk QOL -DN, 
BMI/mBMI,  SF-36 questionnaire, ECHO efficacy parameters, NSC and PND scores.  
The primary efficacy assessment, mNIS+7 scores, will be collected and stored by  an independent 
contract  research  group,  Mayo  Clinic  Polyneuropathy  Quality  Assurance  Core  Facility  (MC Core)  that 
is under the direction of Dr.  . The NSC score is obtained during the NIS assessment 
procedure and is also collected and stored by MC Core . The mNIS+7 results from each site will be 
faxed to MC Core for processing and quality assurance.  Faxed copies will be maintained in secure 
rooms within locked cabinets.  The NIS and NSC data are stored in the RedCap (a database). The 
other components of the m NIS+7 (nerve conduction, sensory testing and heart rate to deep 
breathing) are entered by the MC Core into a firewalled portion of the study EDC system.  MC Core 
only has access to this portion of the EDC system and the Sponsor and clinical sites do not hav e 
access  to the  MC Core  portion  of the EDC.  The mNIS+7 summated score will  not be shared  with  the 
sites.  Up until the parent study database lock, the Sponsor  will only have  access to patient  baseline 
values  of the mNIS+7.  Post -baseline  values  will be available  for PAREXEL  who  are preparing this  SAP 
and are performing statistical analysis.  
The Norfolk QOL -DN, body weight (needed to calculate BMI/mBMI), SF -36 questionnaire and PND 
scores will be entered into the EDC system by each site.  The independen t CRO BioClinica is 
contracted  to develop  and maintain  secure  custody  of the EDC database.  During  the conduct  of this 
OLE study  before  unblinding  of the parent  study  the Sponsor  will receive  regular  data  transfers  from 
BioClinica but without the above mentioned efficacy data included (except for baseline values).  
Post -baseline  values  for most  endpoints  mentioned  above  except  for SF-36 derived  scores  will be 
available for PAREXEL who are preparing this SAP and are pe rforming statistical analysis.  
The plasma  retinol,  plasma  TTR,  plasma  RBP4,  and plasma  NT-proBNP  samples  will be assayed  at 
Medpace, the central laboratory contracted for this study.  The results will be maintained in  
  from the 
above  mentioned  tests  (except  for baseline  values)  prior  to week  13. During  the conduct  of this OLE 
study before unblinding of the parent study the Sponsor will  receive  regular lab data transfers from 
Medpace  to perform  safety  assessments.  The above  mentioned  data collected  prior to  Week  13 will 
not be available to PAREXEL or the sponsor.  
The ECHO data will be collected, analyzed and stored in a secure database by CICL.  The sites will 
upload the ECHO data on a secure web -portal for analysis by CICL.  Up until the parent study 
database  lock,  the Sponsor  will only  have  access  to patient  baseline  ECHO  values.  ECHOs  conducted 
for safety assessment purposes will be available to the DSMB, Sponsor, and Investigator.  Post - 
baseline ECHO data will be available for PAREXEL who are preparing this SAP and are performing 
statistical analysis.  
Prior to the parent study unblindi ng, any ISIS 420915 concentration data sets and IM data sets 
provided to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  by the respective bioanalytical labs will not include results 
for samples  collected  prior  to Week  13, nor will they  include  results  for unscheduled  or early term 
(ET) samples to prevent the potential unblinding of the parent study.

 In conclusion,  the unblinding  process  before  the parent  study  unblinding  for periodic  safety  reviews 
has been clearly defined and detailed roles and responsibilities to the independent statistician, 
DSMB, Partner Firewalled Staff and Sponsor, such that the potential for bias to enter into the 
conduct of the study will be minimized.  Additional step s to ensure the data for the primary and 
secondary endpoints remain blinded, such as housing the primary and secondary efficacy data in 
databases to which the Sponsor has no access, further safeguards the potential for Sponsor bias.

Neurop athy Symptom s and Change  (NSC) 
 
The NSC  questionnaire consists of 38 questions asking about  different symp toms. 
 
A symptom is marked as present if in the judgment  of the examin ing neurologist, it occurs more 
frequently o r more seve rely than in healthy persons of the same  age and gender and is due to 
85 
279  
 neuropathy.  If a symptom  is present  its severity  is graded  as 1 (slight  +), 2 (moderate  ++) or 3 
(severe +++).  If the symptom is not present it is given a score of 0.  
Two  questions  (35 and 36) are only  answered  by men.  These  are not included  in the score  for 
women.  
The questions  in the NSC can be divided  into the following  domains  
 
Muscle  weakness:  Questions  1 - 19 
Sensory (hypo / loss of sensation):   Questions 20 - 22 
Sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation):   Questions 23 - 29 
Autonomic (GI/Urinary incontinence):  Questions  31, 32, 33, 34 
Autonomic  (other  than  GI/Urinary  incontinence):  Questions  30, 35 - 38 for men  
Questions  30, 37 - 38 for women 
The Muscle weakness domain is also divided into 4 sub -domains:  
Head  and Neck:  Questions  1 - 6 
Chest:  Questions  7 - 9 
Upper  Limbs:  Questions  10 - 15 
Lower  Limbs:  Questions  16 - 19 
For each sub -domain and domain the total score is obtained by summing the relevant questions.  
The maximum  score  is therefore  57 for muscle  weakness,  9 for Sensory  (hypo  / loss of  sensation),  21 
for Sensory (paresthesia, hyper sensation), 12 for Autonomic ( GI/Urinary incontinence), 15 for 
Autonomic  (other than  GI/Urinary incontinence)  in men  and 9 for Autonomic (other than  GI/Urinary 
incontinence) in women.  The minimum score is zero for each domain.  
The NSC total  score  is the sum  of the scores  across  all 5 domains.  The minimum  NSC total  score  is 
therefore 0 and the maximum NSC total score is 114 for men and 108 for women.  
For questions  20-29 the location  affected  is also collected  on the questionnaire  but this information 
is not used in the calculation of the domain or total scores.  
The NSC questionnaire  also records  a change  score  for the change  in symptoms  compared  to the 
week before study onset. These are scored as follows  
-3 =worse  --- 
-2 = worse  -- 
-1 = worse  - 
0 = no change  
+1 = better  + 
+2 = better  ++ 
 
+3 = better  +++

Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 5 of 157 Efficacy Assessments  
Parts A, B, C, and D  
For Parts A, B, and C, disease response and progression will be assessed using the Revised Response Criteria 
for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007 ). For Part D of the study, disease response will be assessed using the 
Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non -Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (Luga no 
criteria) (Cheson 2014 ) and Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) (Cheson 
2016 ). PD also includes clinical disease progression per investigator.  
Imaging with computed tomography (CT) will be performed  at baseline, at Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, and at end of 
treatment (EOT) approximately 1  month after discontinuation of study treatment. For Parts A, B, and C, 
imaging with PET will be performed at baseline, at Cycles 2 and 8, and at EOT. For Part D, PET scans w ill be 
performed at baseline, at Cycles 4, 8, and 12, and at EOT. Once a patient  achieves a PET CR, PET scan will no 
longer be required. Clinical lymphoma assessments will be performed predose in every treatment cycle.  
In patient s eligible for continued tr eatment with brentuximab vedotin (and/or nivolumab for Part D only) 
beyond 16 cycles, CT (and PET for Part D only) will be performed at Cycle  16. Then for Cycles 17 and beyond, 
CT will be performed per institutional standard of care, or at least every 6 cy cles, and PET scans will be 
performed per institutional standard of care.  
For Parts A, B, and C, visual interpretation will be used for evaluation of interim PET scan results with response 
scored with reference to sites of presumed lymphomatous involvemen t using the 5 -Point Scale per the Deauville 
Criteria (Barrington 2010 ; Meignan 2009 ). 
For patient s on Part D with a response determination of  IR, radiographic assessment (CT/PET) of disease must 
be performed 12  weeks following IR or earlier if clinically indicated. If a patient  has a second determination of 
IR, then subsequent repeat imaging must be performed between 4 and 8 weeks. Follow -up radiographic 
assessment for patient s with IR is not required, if a follow -up biopsy has been performed that confirms 
response.  
After compl etion of therapy, disease status will be assessed by CT imaging per institutional standard of care or 
intervals of at least every 6 months for the first 2  years, an annual assessment for the third year, then per 
institutional standard of care until progres sion.  
Parts E and F  
Disease response will be assessed using modified Lugano criteria; the assessment will be per blinded 
independent central review . 
Imaging with CT and PET will be performed at baseline, at Cycles 2, 6, 11, and at EOT approximately 1  month  
after discontinuation of study treatment. Clinical lymphoma assessments will be performed predose in every 
treatment cycle. Once a patient  achieves a PET CR, PET scans will no longer be required. Patient s 
discontinuing study treatment without progression will be followed until progression or initiation of further 
anti-cancer therapy. Follow -up CT scans will be performed every 4  months for 2  years and then per institutional 
standard of care, and follow -up PET scans will be performed per institutional standa rd of care.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic/Immunogenicity Assessments  
For Parts A, B, C, E, and F, serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) and 
plasma concentrations of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) will be measured. Sam ples will be retained for 
measurement of total antibody, if needed. Antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA) to brentuximab vedotin will also be 
measured. Pharmacodynamic assessments include but are not limited to the measurement of soluble CD30. For 
Part D, serum  concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and nivolumab, and plasma concentrations of 
MMAE will also be measured at selected time points. ATA against brentuximab vedotin, ATA against 
nivolumab, and immunomodulatory effects of treatment will also be assess ed in Part D.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 6 of 157 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will consist of the surveillance and recording of adverse event s (AE)  and measurements of 
physical examination findings, vital signs, and laboratory tests.  
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) monitored patient  safety in Part C of the trial. The SMC reviewed 
safety data after the first 5 patient s in Part C completed 1 cycle of brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine and 
again after the first 5 patient s completed 2 cycles of treatment with brentuximab vedotin  and bendamustine. It 
was noted in the second safety call that 4 of 7 patient s in Part C had experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). 
The starting dose of bendamustine was then reduced from 90  mg/m2 to 70  mg/m2 (Amendment 6). Additional 
key safety observ ations were reported at a subsequent SMC meeting; 12 of 20 patient s enrolled on Part C had 
experienced SAEs and 2 of those patient s died within the 30 -day safety reporting period. Although no safety 
signal was identified, and neither of the deaths were con sidered related to study treatment, the sponsor has 
suspended enrollment of patient s into Part C and has discontinued bendamustine treatment for all patient s 
currently enrolled in Part C as of 7 -Oct-2015 (the date of the Dear Investigator Letter). Single -agent 
brentuximab vedotin may be continued for patient s who tolerate the therapy and have demonstrated clinical 
benefit.  
Safety review of patient s treated with the combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab was conducted by 
the study SMC after the fir st 5 patient s in Part D completed treatment through Cycle 3 Day 1, and will continue 
throughout the study as needed.  
Statistical Methods  
Summaries of patient  disposition, demographics, disease characteristics, safety, disease response, and exposure 
to stud y drug will be provided. All analyses of safety and efficacy endpoints will be descriptive in each study 
part. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE, as well as nivolumab 
(Part D only), will be estimated and summarized  with descriptive statistics. No formal statistical hypotheses 
have been formulated for primary efficacy, secondary or additional endpoints in any study part. However, the 
secondary and additional endpoints will be analyzed and provided as supporting evide nce for the overall clinical 
benefit of brentuximab vedotin.

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 14 of 157 1 INTRODUCTION  
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30 -directed antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 
3 components: 1) the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30; 2) the 
microtubule -disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE); and 3) a protease -cleavable 
linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. The anticancer activity of brentuximab 
vedotin is due to the binding of the ADC to CD30 -expressing cells, followed by 
internalization of the ADC -CD30 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic 
cleavage. B inding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, 
subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cell. Other nonclinical 
studies suggest additional contributory mechanisms of action, including antibody -dependen t 
cellular phagocytosis; bystander effects on nearby cells in the tumor microenvironment due 
to released MMAE; and immunogenic cell death due to endoplasmic reticulum stress which 
drives exposure of immune activating molecules that can promote a T -cell res ponse (Cao 
2016 ; Gardai 2015 ; Kim 2015 ; Li 2014 ; Muller 2014 ; Oflazoglu 2007 ). 
Frontline treatment options are needed for patients who cannot tolerate multi -agent 
chemotherapy regimens. This study will provide data regarding the safety and efficacy of 
brentuximab vedotin used as a single  agent in the frontline treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; i.e., excluding nodular lymphocyte 
predominant HL) or CD30 -expressing peripheral T -cell lymphoma (PTCL) who cannot 
tolerate or have declined multi -agent chem otherapy. In addition, the efficacy and tolerability 
of brentuximab vedotin combined with dacarbazine, bendamustine, or nivolumab will be 
evaluated in the frontline treatment of classical HL.  
1.1 Hodgkin Lymphoma  
HL is a neoplasm of lymphoid tissue that is hi stopathologically defined by the presence of 
malignant Hodgkin Reed -Sternberg (HRS) cells in a background of inflammatory cells. The 
characteristic surface antigen expressed on HRS cells is CD30. It is estimated that 
8110  patients will be diagnosed with HL  in the U S in 2019 and 1000  patients will die of the 
disease (Siegel 2019 ).  
For most patients, treatment of HL has i mproved over the past 30  years with combination 
chemotherapy regimens. The current anthracycline -containing regimen of doxorubicin, 
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine  (ABVD ), given with or without consolidative 
radiotherapy (RT), has proved superior t o alkylator -based regimens and results in long -term 
cure rates on the order of 70% and higher. However, unlike the majority of younger patients 
with HL who have impressive cure rates with standard frontline therapy, patients 60 and over 
and patients with s ignificant comorbidities experience more severe toxicity and higher rates 
of relapse with this combination regimen.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 15 of 157 1.1.1  Hodgkin Lymphoma in Patients Aged 60 Years and Above  
Of newly diagnosed HL patients, population -based studies estimate that up to 20% are age 
60 years and above (Stark 2002 ). Older patients (≥60  years of age) with HL have 
disproportionately inferior outcomes as compared to younger patients with HL (Klimm 
2007 ). Studies cite 5 -year event -free survival (EFS) and freedom from treatment failure rates 
of 30% to 45% in older patients, as compared to rates o f 75% to 80% expected in younger 
patients (Evens 2008 ; Proctor 2009 ). 
The disease differs in histopathologic presentation, more frequently exhibiting an aggressive 
mixed -cellularity subtype and Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV) positivity. Clinically, older HL 
patients are more likely to present with B symptoms, poorer performance status, elevated 
sedimentation rate, and advanced -stage disease, with a lower incidence of bulky disease. In 
addition to differences in biology and disease -related features, poorer overall outcomes in 
older patients with HL can also be attributed to treatment -related factors which compromise 
cure rates.  
There is a  paucity of data concerning outcomes of older patients treated for early stage HL, 
likely due to the preponderance of this patient population presenting with advanced stage 
disease. In 1w review of 67 early stage older HL patients treated with RT alone, 82% 
achieved a complete remission (CR) but 43% w ent on to relapse, and 11 of the 67  patients 
developed secondary malignancies (Landgren 2006 ). 
The majority of older patients with HL  present with advanced stage disease, for which 
systemic combination chemotherapy is typically administered. Several studies have been 
conducted to examine a variety of chemotherapy regimens in this population. In a recent 
retrospective review of outcomes in older patients with HL, the most common treatment 
given was ABVD -based therapy (Evens 2012 ). While the CR rate was reasonable at 73%, the 
5-year overall survival (OS) rate for older patients with advanced HL was 46%. In the 
recently reported ECHELON -1 study that compared ABVD to brentuximab vedotin + 
doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazi ne (A+AVD) for the frontline treatment of patients 
with advanced classical HL, the brentuximab vedotin + cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone (A+CHP) arm showed a significant improvement in modified progression -free 
survival (PFS) (HR=0.77 [0.603,  0.982], p -value=0.035). The A+AVD regimen was 
associated with more myelotoxicity and neurotoxicity, which was managed with growth 
factor support and dose modifications, than ABVD, but less pulmonary toxicity (Connors 
2018 ). 
Other regimens such as escalated bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) have been utilized for younger fit 
patients in some regions including Germany. Variants including standard BEACOPP and  
BACOPP (with etoposide omitted and anthracycline dose increased) have been studied in 
older HL patients and have shown to be too toxic to be recommended in this setting (Ballova 
2005 ; Halbsguth 2010 ). 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 16 of 157 Several studies have evaluated the role of anthracycline -based regimens in older patient s with 
HL. In a study comparing chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (ChlVPP) 
with the hybrid ChlVPP/ABV (ChlVPP plus doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine), a 
subset of 56 patients age ≥60 treated with ChlVPP had a poorer outcome than  those treated 
with ChlVPP/ABV in terms of 5 -year OS (30% versus 67%; p=0.0086) and EFS (24% versus 
52%; p=0.011) (Weekes 2002 ). A recent small Scandinavian study evaluated the CHOP -21 
regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) ±  RT in a 29 patient 
cohort of older patients with early and advanced stage HL, revealing a 3 -year OS and PFS of 
79% and 76%, respectively (Kolstad 2007 ). Other recent non -bleomycin containing strategies 
have included prednisone, vinblasti ne, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine (PVAG), with 
published OS and PFS rates of 66% and 58% when studied in early unfavorable and 
advanced stage HL patients between 60 –75 years of age (Boll 2011 ). The need to reduce 
drug intensity of PVAG remained a challenge, with relative dose intensity of ≥80% delivered 
in only 45 of the 57 evaluable patients mainly due to frequent omissio ns of whole cycles of 
therapy. Additionally, although there is little information regarding frontline treatment with 
bendamustine in HL, results from a phase 2 study in the relapsed or refractory setting 
demonstrated that patients treated with bendamustine  had an objective response rate (ORR) 
of 53% (CR, 33%; partial response [PR], 19%) (Moskowitz 2013a ). Thus far, no agreed upon 
standard treatment approach exists for patients age ≥60 with HL.  
Furthermore, higher rates of t reatment -related toxicities have also been reported in older 
patients with HL. In a comprehensive retrospective analysis of older patients with HL by the 
German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG), severe toxicities (World Health Organization 
[WHO] Grade  4) occurre d more often in patients age 60 and older (42% versus 27%; 
P<0.001) including infectious complications and fatal acute treatment -related events (Engert 
2005 ). Similarly, in a retrospective multicenter analysis of 95 HL patients age ≥60 in the 
Chicago area who most commonly received ABVD for frontline therapy, the incidence of 
bleomycin -associated pulmonary toxicity was 32%, with an associated mortality rate of 25% 
in those affected (Evens 2012 ). 
Older patients with HL remains a population of unmet need with underrepresentation of 
patients aged ≥60 in HL clinical trials and inferior outcomes as compared to younger 
patients.  
1.1.2  Hodgkin Lymphoma in Patients with Significa nt Comorbidities  
The presence of significant comorbidities has a major effect on the treatments received, 
treatment toxicity, dose intensity, and prognosis in the HL population, even though the 
impact of comorbidities has not been studied as extensively as  the impact of age.  
Significant comorbidities have been reported to be present in 13% of patients with newly 
diagnosed HL aged less than 60  years and 56% of patients aged at least 60 (van Spronsen 
1999 ). A review of 45,777 patients with HL in the US National Cancer Database f ound that a 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score ≥1 resulted in a significantly lower OS, 
independently of age, disease stage, or use of RT (Parikh 2015 ). A review of 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 17 of 157 20,600  early -stage HL patients in the US National Cancer Database found th at the presence 
of at least 1  CCI comorbidity was significantly associated with treatment choice 
(chemotherapy alone versus combined modality therapy; odds ratio  0.75 [95%  confidence 
interval {CI}: 0.67, 0.85], p<0.001) (Olszewski 2015 ); lymphoma -specific survival was 
significantly lower in patients with morbidities (HR 3.05 [95% CI 2.14, 4.35], p<0.001 for 
CCI ≥2). Retrospective revi ews of the effect of age above or below 60 years in patients with 
relapsed or refractory HL or non -Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) found CCI to be significantly 
and independently associated with treatment toxicity, treatment -related mortality, PFS, and 
OS, while a ge was not (Martinez 2017 ) (Wildes 2008 ). The effect of comorbidities, measured 
using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale -Geriatric (CIRS -G), on prognosis has also been 
confirmed within the population of older patients (>60 years) with frontline HL (Evens 
2012 ). In the prospective Study of Hodgkin in the Elderly/Lymphoma Database (SHIELD) 
program, no CR were observed in patients det ermined to be “frail” according to a modified 
Adult Comorbidity Evaluation -27 (ACE -27) scale, and comorbidity score was significantly 
associated with CR rate and OS (Proctor 2012 ). National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines recognize that individualized treatment may be 
necessary for patients with comorbidities. There is a need to develop treatments that can be 
used safely and efficaciously in patients with HL who have significant comorbidities, 
irrespective of age.  
1.2 CD30 -Expressing Peripheral  T-Cell Lymphoma  
T-cell lymphomas are a subset of aggressive NHL that comprise approximately 10% to 15% 
of all newly diagnosed cases of NHL in the US. According to the 2008 WHO Classification 
schema, there are 18 subtypes of mature T - and natural killer (NK) -cell neoplasms 
(Swerdlow 2008 ). Various subtypes of T- and NK -cell lymphomas are known to express the 
cell surface marker CD30; most notably, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), 
in which CD30 expression is a hallmark of the diagnosis (Savage 2008 ). The median age of 
patients with the most common PTCL subtypes is approximately 60  years, with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive  PTCL being the exception, having a median age of 
34 years (Armitage 2015 ; Vose 2008 ). 
CD30 -expressing PTCL , including ALK -positive and ALK -negative sALCL, peripheral 
T-cell lymphoma –not otherwise specified (PTCL -NOS), angioimmunoblastic T -cell 
lymphoma (AITL) and others, are aggressive lymph oid neoplasms that often present with 
advanced stage, symptomatic disease. These difficult -to-treat lymphomas are often grouped 
together for enrollment in clinical trials based on their universally dismal outcomes. 
Five-year OS in the over 1,300 -patient In ternational Peripheral T -Cell and Natural 
Killer/T -Cell Lymphoma Study was poor and ranged from 12% to 49% depending on 
histologic subtype (Vose 2008 ). Five -year failure -free survival, defined as time from initial 
diagnosis to progression, relapse after response, or death resulting from any cause, ranged 
from 6% to 36%. Other studies have reported CR rates to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, and prednisone (CHO P) therapy between 40% and 50% (Mercadal 2008 ; Simon 
2010 ).  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 18 of 157 Although no randomi zed studies have been conducted to establish the use of CHOP in 
patients with CD30 -expressing PTCL, it is the most commonly used regimen in the frontline 
treatment of these patients. The International Peripheral T -Cell and Natural Killer/T -Cell 
Lymphoma St udy results indicate that over 85% of patients were treated with an 
anthracycline -based multi -agent chemotherapy regimen (Vose 2008 ). In published studies 
that have comp ared new treatment approaches to an established standard of care, CHOP 
administered every 3 weeks (CHOP -21) has been used as the control arm (Simon 2010 ). A 
post-hoc analysis of pooled data from PTCL patients treated on multiple  phase 2 and 3 
studies suggested that the addition of etoposide to CHOP (CHOEP) resulted in improved 
3-year EFS (time to standard PFS or unplanned therapy) but only in patients ≤60 years old 
with a normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Schmitz 2010 ). CHOEP proved too toxic for 
patients older than 60 (Lunning 2013 ; Schmitz 2010 ). In the recently reported ECHELON -2 
study that compared CHOP to brentuximab vedotin + CHP for the frontline treatment of 
CD30 -expressing PTCL, the brentuxim ab vedotin + CHP arm showed a significant 
improvement in both PFS (hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.93], p=0.0110) and OS (hazard 
ratio 0.66 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.95], p=0.0244). The safety profile of both treatment arms was 
comparable (Horwitz 2018 ). 
Even so, in NCCN guidelines, participation in clinical trials is still the suggested frontline 
treatment for patients with PTCL, other than sALCL and ALK -positive subtypes, for which 
multi -agent chemotherapy with or without RT is recommended. The presence of 
comorbidities can lead to the inability to administer multi -agent chemotherapy, higher rates 
of toxicity, and consequent decreases in dose intensity. In a recent retrospective study of 
patients >60 years of age newly diagnosed with PTCL between 2008 -2014, a multivariate 
analysis demonstrated that a CCI ≥2 and high International Prognostic Index score (3 -5) wer e 
independent risk factors for worse OS and PFS (Zhao 2016 ). Similarly, multivariate analysis 
of registry data from Sweden shows that a CCI ≥2 is independently associated with worse OS 
and PFS outcomes (Ellin 2018 ). 
Frontline treatment regimens for patients with PTCL ineligible for combination 
chemotherapy due to comorbidities have not been defined, necessitating the evaluation of 
alternative strategies.  
1.3 Experience With Brentuximab Vedotin  
A phase 2 pivotal tr ial of single -agent brentuximab vedotin (1.8  mg/kg, every 3 weeks) 
evaluated 102 patient s whose HL had relapsed or was refractory to multiple -agent, high -dose 
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. A 75% ORR and a 34% CR rate were 
observed and c ommon adverse events (AEs) were primarily mild to moderate in severity and 
generally constitutional in nature with the exception of peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(Younes 2012 ). 
The safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin has been evaluated in more  than 
2,700  patient s in company -sponsored clinical trials, and approved by multiple regulatory 
agencies .

Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 20 of 157 1.4 Experience With Brentuximab Vedotin Combined With Dacarbazine  
The combination chemotherapy regimen ABVD (doxorubicin 25  mg/m2, bleomycin 
10 units/m2, vinblastine 6  mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2) is a standard regimen for the 
frontline treatment of HL. Because of the efficacy observed with single -agent brentuximab 
vedotin in patient s with relapsed or refractory HL, a phase 1 study was conducted in 
51 patient s with newly diagnosed HL to e valuate the safety of brentuximab vedotin 
combined with this standard regimen (A+ABVD) or with a modified standard that omitted 
bleomycin (A+AVD). In this study, it was found that concomitant administration of 
brentuximab vedotin with bleomycin was contrai ndicated due to an unacceptable rate of 
pulmonary toxicity; however, brentuximab vedotin 1.2  mg/kg combined with AVD 
administered every 2  weeks was generally well tolerated by patient s and resulted in a CR rate 
of 96% at the end of frontline therapy (Younes 2013 ). 
Brentuximab vedotin was also tested preclinically in combination with chemotherapy. In the 
L450cy  HL tumor model, administration of brentuximab vedotin plus ABVD in 
tumor -bearing mice demonstrated a marked increase in antitumor activity as compared to the 
mice treated with brentuximab vedotin or ABVD alone, suggesting a potential synergistic 
effect. Wh en individual components of ABVD were tested with brentuximab vedotin in the 
tumor model, brentuximab vedotin plus dacarbazine (A+D) was observed to have similarly 
robust combined durable activity as compared to A+ABVD (McEarchern 2010 ). 
1.5 Experience With Brentuximab Vedotin Combined with Bendamustine  
Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine -like 
benzimidazole ring, approved in the US for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and NHL; 
bendamustine is administer ed as an intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 2 for up to six 
28-day cycles in CLL and for up to eight 21 -day cycles in NHL. Though the exact 
mechanisms of action of bendamustine are unknown, mechlorethamine derivatives form 
electrophilic alkyl groups, which then form covalent bonds with electron -rich nucleophilic 
moieties and result in interstrand DNA crosslinks that lead to cell death via several pathways.  
The combination chemotherapy regimen brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine is currently 
being stud ied in a phase 1/2 trial of patient s with relapsed or refractory HL (SGN35 -016). 
Preliminary results showed that after a median of 2 cycles of combination treatment, the 
ORR was 92% (12/13 patient s) and the CR rate was 77% (10/13 patient s); 12 of 13 patien ts 
with a response assessment at the time of interim analysis remained on treatment and all 
13 patient s remained free of progressive disease (PD) (LaCasce 2014 ). Additionally, the 
combination of br entuximab vedotin and bendamustine did not appear to interfere with stem 
cell collection for autologous transplant. AEs seen in ≥20% of patient s included nausea, rash, 
fever, fatigue, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and lymphopenia. 
Infusi on-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) were noted; 6 patient s 
had treatment -related and serious events and 3 patient s discontinued treatment due to IRRs. 
IRRs were considered related to brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine; most o ccurred at 
the Cycle 2 infusion. Symptoms included rash, hives, pruritus, shortness of breath, wheezing, 
throat tightness, fever, chills, and hypotension. The study protocol was amended to require 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 21 of 157 premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines; prem edication has reduced the 
severity of IRRs and HSRs. Based on this information, it is recommended that patient s in this 
study be premedicated with corticosteroids and antihistamines (see Section 5.4.4 ). 
Further study of the combination of brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine on the current 
study (Part C of Study SGN35 -015) showed additional safety observations as detailed in 
Section 3.1. 
1.6 Experience With Brentuximab Vedotin Combined with Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a fully -human monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that targets programmed cell death 
protein -1 (PD -1). In vitro, nivolumab bin ds to PD -1 with high affinity (EC 50 0.39–2.62 nM), 
and inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 (IC 50 ±1 nM). Nivolumab 
binds specifically to PD -1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, 
ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTLA. Nivol umab blocks the PD -1 pathway and results in enhancement 
of both proliferation and IFN -γ release in the mixed lymphocyte reaction, augmentation of 
IFN-γ secretion from cytomegalovirus (CMV) -specific memory T -cells in a dose -dependent 
manner in a CMV re -stimulation assay, and enhancement of the antitumor immune response 
and tumor rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and 
PAN02) using a murine analog of nivolumab (Wolchok 2009 ). 
A recent report from a phase 1 study of nivolumab in patient s with advanced hematological 
malignancies demonstrated a high response rate in patient s with relapsed or refractory HL, 
with an ORR of 87% (20/23) and a CR rate of 22% (5/ 23). The responses obtained have been 
durable with the median PFS not yet reached after a median 101 weeks of follow -up. No 
significant difference in the ORR in the subset of 18 patient s who had previously failed 
brentuximab vedotin was observed (Ansell 2015 ). 
A combination  therapy regimen of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab is currently being 
studied (SGN35 -025) at Seattle Genetics, Inc. The phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study is 
designed to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin treatment 
combined with nivolumab in patient s with relapsed or refractory HL after 1 prior treatment. 
Patient s are being treated for up to four 3 -week cycles with the first dose of brentuximab 
vedotin 1.8  mg/kg being given on Cycle 1 Day 1 and the first dose of nivol umab 3  mg/kg on 
Cycle 1 Day 8. For Cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles, brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg 
followed by nivolumab 3  mg/kg is being given on Day 1. As of 27 May 2016, 17 patient s 
have started treatment and were evaluated for safety on Protocol SGN35 -025. Preliminary 
results have demonstrated no dose -limiting toxicities (6 patient s in dose -limiting toxicity 
evaluation period of study [Part 1]) and no Grade 4 or 5 AEs have occurred. One patient  has 
experienced a treatment -related serious adverse event (SAE) of dehydration, hypercalcemia 
and acute kidney injury after the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. Due to an increased 
incidence of IRRs at Cycle 2 Day 1 during the administration of the first study drug 
brentuximab vedotin (5 of 11 patient s [45%], w ith Grade 1 [2 patient s], Grade 2 [2 patient s], 
and Grade 3 [1 patient ] severity), mandatory premedication was instituted with 
hydrocortisone 100 mg (or other steroid equivalent) and antihistamines prior to start of 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedoti n Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 22 of 157 Cycle  2 infusion and subsequent cycles. Symptoms experienced by patient s included rash, 
pruritus, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, and chest, and throat tightness. Enrollment in 
the second part of this study is ongoing.  
In an ongoing cooperative group trial, brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab  are administered 
sequentially on Day 1 of each 3 -week cycle using premedication with H 1- and H 2-antagonists 
alone. Ten patient s with relapsed/refractory HL have received this treatment regimen thus far 
on the study, and of those patient s, only 1 experienc ed a Grade 1/2 IRR. The patient  was able 
to receive subsequent therapy with additional premedication (Diefenbach 2016 ). Due to the 
lower incidence of IRRs observed in this cooperative group trial, Part D of the  current study 
will mirror the same -day dosing regimen and premedications (see Sections 5.2.2 , 5.5.3 , and 
5.5.4 ). 
1.7 Rationale for the Current Study  
The prognosis of patients with HL and CD30 -expressing PTCL has improved over the years,  
mainly due to advances in intensified chemotherapy and combined modality regimens. 
However, these improvements have not been reflected in patients with significant 
comorbidities or older patients (for the latter perhaps attributable to the frequency of 
comorbidities) (Martinez 2017 ). In these patients , chemotherapy -related toxicities, including 
treatment -related mortality, are believed to be more common than previously recognized. 
Anthracycline -based regimens pose problems for those with cardiovascular comorbidities, 
and other chemotherapy -related toxi cities such as bleomycin -related pulmonary toxicity are 
often considered prohibitive. The risk associated with the administration of dose -intensive 
combination chemotherapy regimens is exacerbated by concomitant cardiac, renal, or other 
organ dysfunctions.  Intensive regimens are typically not well tolerated by these patients, 
while less intensive regimens are not effective; thus, experts agree that challenges remain in 
establishing recommendations for standard treatment of less robust patients.  
Similar to HL, there is no standard treatment regimen for older patients with PTCL, and 
comorbidities, such as depressed cardiac or renal function, limit the ability to use 
combination chemotherapy in many less robust patients. For CD30 -expressing PTCL, 
single -agent brentuximab vedotin is an active and well -tolerated treatment for patients with 
relapsed and refractory disease (Horwitz 2014 ) and the ECHELON -2 study  showed that the 
addition of brentuximab vedotin to combination chemotherapy in the frontline treatment 
improves both PFS and OS (Horwitz 2018 ).  
There is a high unmet need in patients aged >60 years and in patients with significant 
comorbidities with HL and CD30 -expressing PTCL for novel therapeutic approaches that are 
well-tolerated and active; brentuxim ab vedotin has the potential to fill this role. This phase 2 
study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin as frontline 
monotherapy for HL and CD30 -expressing PTCL in older patients and patients with 
significant comorbid ities. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin and dacarbazine, bendamustine, or nivolumab will also be evaluated.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 23 of 157 Monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin  
The ADC brentuximab vedotin has an acceptable toxicity profile in clinical studies, with 
robust activity demonstrated as a single agent in HL patients refractory to several lines of 
chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to discover a tolerable regimen with long -term 
clinical benefit for patients with HL and C D30-expressing PTCL ineligible for multi -agent 
chemotherapy.  
Combination with dacarbazine  
Dacarbazine has proven to be a critical component of the ABVD regimen and has not been 
reported to have prohibitive toxicities, unlike bleomycin and doxorubicin. In the 
GHSG  HD13 trial, a significant loss of efficacy was observed when dacarbazine was omitted 
from the combination (Borchmann 2010 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to evaluate the 
combination of brentuximab vedotin with dacarbazine, a highly active alkylator component 
from the ABVD regimen.  
Combination with bendamustine  
Also of note, current studies suggest that single -agent bendamustine produces CR rates as 
high as 38% in relapsed and refractory HL (Anastasia 2014 ; Moskowitz 2009 ; Moskowitz 
2013b ). As both brentuxima b vedotin and bendamustine have demonstrated efficacy in 
lymphoma and act via independent mechanisms, it is rational to expect the combination is 
likely to be effective as treatment in frontline therapy of HL. The combination of 
brentuximab vedotin and ben damustine has demonstrated an ORR of 92% (CR rate 77%) in 
an ongoing study of patient s with relapsed or refractory HL (SGN35 -016) (LaCasce 2014 ). 
Combination with nivolumab  
Furthermore, recent res ults with the PD -1 blocking agent nivolumab have demonstrated 
efficacy for relapsed or refractory HL of the CD28 family of T -cell co -stimulatory receptors 
(Chen 2013b ; Pardoll 2003 ). PD-1 signaling has  been shown to inhibit T -cell activation, and 
expansion of previously activated cells. Experimental results suggest that PD -1 blockade has 
the potential to activate anti -self T -cell responses, but these responses are variable and 
dependent upon various hos t genetic factors (Sharpe 2007 ). There is evidence that HRS 
cell-mediated PD -1 signalin g to tumor infiltrating T -cells contributes to the tumor ’s ability to 
avoid clearance by the immune system. The PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, are both 
expressed by multiple HL cell lines and PD -1 overexpression is found in tumor -infiltrating 
and periphera l blood T -cells of patients with HL (Yamamoto 2008 ). PD-L1 expression in 
clinical samples, as detected by immunohist ochemical staining, is present in more than 80% 
of HL cases, with similar rates of expression in all HL pathological subtypes (Chen 2013a ). 
Several mechanisms contribute to upregulated expression of PD -L1 and PD -L2 in HRS cells, 
including amplification of chromosome 9p24.1, which contains the genes PD -L1, PD -L2, 
and JAK2, and results in a direct increase in their copy number. The increase in JAK2 copy 
number also indirectly contributes to PD -ligand overexpression through STAT1 mediated 
transcriptional upregulation of the PD -L1 and PD -L2 genes (Green 2010 ). Furthermore, EBV 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 24 of 157 infection of malignant HRS cells, which is found in up to 40% of HL cases, contributes to 
overexpression of PD -L1 through direct and indirect effects of the EBV latent membrane 
protein 1 on PD -L1 promoter and  enhancer elements (Green 2012 ). These data provide a firm 
basis for the use of a PD -1 blocking agent to activate an antitumor immune re sponse against 
HRS cells. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that auristatin -based ADCs like 
brentuximab vedotin may also initiate an antitumor immune response through the induction 
of stress on the endoplasmic reticulum of HRS cells and enhancement of  antigen presentation 
(Muller 2014 ), providing a stro ng scientific rationale for combining brentuximab vedotin 
with an immune stimulatory agent like nivolumab. Together with clinical data demonstrating 
that brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab both have high single -agent response rates in 
patients with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory HL, it is hypothesized that the 
combination therapy will be more effective than administration of either agent alone, 
particularly in the frontline setting. Moreover, both agents are well tolerated, have few 
overlapping to xicities, and can be infused in the outpatient setting, making this a potentially 
attractive treatment option for older and medically fragile patients. This study will evaluate 
the safety and antitumor activity of combination therapy with brentuximab vedot in and 
nivolumab in a population of previously untreated older patients with HL.

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
Part A of this phase 2 open -label study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 
brentuximab vedotin as frontline monotherapy in adults age 60 and above with HL. 
Brentuximab vedotin, 1.8  mg/kg, will be administered IV every 3 w eeks. Patient s enrolling 
on study with estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min will receive 1.2  mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin. Patient s achieving a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) will be allowed to 
continue on treatment for up to 16 cycles. After discussion with the medical monitor, patient s 
who experience clinical benefit per the investigator will be eligible to receive continued 
brentuximab vedotin treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study 
closure.  
Part B of the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brentuximab 
vedotin in combination with dacarbazine as frontline therapy in adults age 60 and above with 
HL. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine 
375 mg/m2 will be given o n Day 1 of Cycles 1 through 12, followed by single -agent 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg on Day 1 of Cycles 13 through 16. Patient s enrolling on 
study with estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min will receive 1.2  mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin in combination wi th a reduced dose of dacarbazine (262  mg/m2; ~30% reduced) 
every 3 weeks. Patient s who have unacceptable toxicity to dacarbazine prior to completion of 
12 cycles may continue to receive brentuximab vedotin as a single agent on Day 1 of each 
cycle for a tot al of 16 cycles or more of treatment. After discussion with the medical monitor, 
patient s who complete 16 cycles of treatment and experience clinical benefit per the 
investigator will be eligible to receive continued single -agent brentuximab vedotin treatm ent 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study closure.  
Part C of this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brentuximab 
vedotin in combination with bendamustine as frontline therapy in adults age 60 and above 
with HL. Treatment with bendamustine 70  mg/m2 will be given in combination with 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg on Day 1 and then as a single agent on Day 2 of each cycle 
for up to 6 cycles, followed by single -agent brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg on Day  1 of the 
remaining cycles for up to 16 cycles. Patient s who have unacceptable toxicity to 
bendamustine, including developing estimated creatinine clearance <40  mL/min, prior to 
completion of up to 6 cycles may continue to receive brentuximab vedotin as a single agen t 
on Day 1 of each cycle for a total of 16 cycles or more of treatment. After discussion with the 
medical monitor, patient s who complete 16 cycles of treatment and experience clinical 
benefit per the investigator will be eligible to receive continued singl e-agent brentuximab 
vedotin treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study closure.  
In Parts A, B, and C, disease response and progression will be assessed using the Revised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007 ). PD also includes clinical disease 
progression per investigator.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuxim ab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 27 of 157 Part D of the study is designed to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of brentuximab 
vedotin in combination with nivolumab as frontline therapy in adults age 60 and above with  
HL. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3  mg/kg 
will be given on Day 1 of each 3 -week cycle. Brentuximab vedotin will be administered at 
least 30 minutes prior to nivolumab. Patient s with PD or patient s with unaccept able toxicity 
at any time will not continue on treatment. Patient s with a response of IR will continue on 
treatment until demonstration of PD via radiographic imaging or biopsy. If patient s have 
unacceptable toxicity that is attributable to only 1 agent, a s determined by the investigator, 
they will be eligible to continue on treatment with the tolerated drug as a single agent. 
Patient s may be treated for up to 16 cycles. Additional cycles may be allowed following 
approval from the sponsor medical monitor. D isease response will be assessed using the 
Lugano criteria (Cheson 2014 ) and LYRIC (Cheson 2016 ). PD also includes clinical disease 
progression per investigator.  
Parts E and F of the study are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of 
brentuximab vedotin as frontline monotherapy in patient s with classical HL or 
CD30 -expressing PTCL, respectively, who are unsuitable or unfit for combination 
chem otherapy. Unsuitability or unfitness for conventional combination chemotherapy will be 
justified by the presence of comorbidity -related factors, as documented by either a) a 
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS ) score ≥10 (according to the criteria specif ied by 
Salvi and colleagues (Salvi 2008 ) excluding current active lymphoma) or b) requiring 
assistance with or dependence on others for any instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
(IADL). Brentuximab vedotin, 1.8  mg/kg, will be administered IV every 3  weeks. Patient s 
achieving a CR,  PR, or SD will be allowed to continue on treatment for up to 16 cycles. 
Disease response will be assessed according to modified Lugano criteria, according to the 
original Lugano criteria, and according to RECIL. The assessment will be per BICR.  
Computed t omography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are required for all 
patient s at baseline. Radiographic imaging for response assessment will be performed as follows:  
● Parts A, B, and C: Restage assessments with CT will be performed at Cycles 2, 4, 8, 
12, and at End of Treatment (EOT). Imaging with PET will be performed at Cycles 2, 
8, and at EOT. CT will be performed at Cycle 16 for patient s eligible for continued 
brentuximab treatment beyond 16 cycles. Response  assessments performed after 
16 cycles of treatment will include CT scans per institutional standard of care or at 
least every 6 cycles and PET scans per institutional standard of care.  
● Part D: Restage assessments will be performed with CT at Cycle 2 and with CT and 
PET at Cycles 4, 8, 12, and EOT. CT and PET are required at Cycle 16 for patient s 
eligible for continued treatment with brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab beyond 
16 cycles. For patient s with a response determination of IR, radiographic assessment 
(CT/PET) of disease must be per formed 12 weeks following IR or earlier if clinically 
indicated. If a patient  has a second determination of IR, then subsequent repeat 
imaging must be performed between 4 and 8 weeks. Follow -up radiographic

● Parts E and F: Restage assessments with CT and PET will be performed at Cycles 2, 
6, 11, and at EOT approximately 1 month after discontinuation of study treatment. 
Following the EOT visit, patient s discontinuing study treatment without progression 
will be followed until progression or initiation of further anti -cancer therapy. 
Follow -up CT scans will be performed every 4  months for 2  years and then per 
institutional standard of care, and fol low-up PET scans will be performed per 
institutional standard of care.  
CT/PET of diagnostic quality may be utilized for CT and PET scanning. Once a patient  
achieves a PET CR, PET scans are no longer required. PET scans performed as part of 
institutional s tandard of care may be collected at any time during the study, as available.  
Patient s who receive any amount of brentuximab vedotin will be followed for survival every 
3 months (Parts A to D) or 4  months (Parts E and F) until withdrawal of consent, death, or 
study closure, whichever comes first. Patient s who have not progressed will have response 
assessments until disease progression (see Section 6.8). Initiation of alternative treatment for 
lymphoma will also be collected.

Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 30 of 157 3.2 Safety Monitoring Committee  
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) consisting of the medical monitor, drug safety and 
risk management representative(s), participating investigators, and study -specific steering 
committee members will be responsible for m onitoring patient  safety of Parts C and D of the 
trial. The roles and responsibilities of the SMC will be detailed in a separate charter.  
3.2.1  Part C  
The initial starting dose of bendamustine was 90  mg/m2. In order to provide a safety 
assessment of acute toxici ties of the combination regimen of brentuximab vedotin with 
bendamustine at the 90  mg/m2 dose, including an assessment of IRRs that were previously 
seen with this combination treatment during Cycle 2 on Study SGN35 -016, the SMC 
reviewed safety data after t he first 5 patient s in Part C completed 1  cycle of brentuximab 
vedotin and bendamustine, and again after the first 5 patient s completed 2 cycles of treatment 
with brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine.  
It was noted in the second safety call that 4 out of 7 patient s in Part C had experienced SAE. 
Two patient s were hospitalized for Grade 3 asthenia, 1  patient  was hospitalized for febrile 
neutropenia, and 1 patient  was hospitalized for a delayed HSR. The SAEs occurred between 
Cycles 2 and 4. Subsequent to the s econd safety call, the protocol was amended 
(Amendment  6) to reduce the starting dose of bendamustine to 70  mg/m2 in order to improve 
the safety and tolerability of this combination regimen.  
Additional key safety observations were reported at a subsequent SMC meeting; 12 of the 
20 patient s enrolled on Part C had experienced SAEs and 2 of those patient s died within the 
30-day safety observation period. Additionally, although the study was not designed to 
compare treatment arms, a higher incidence of specific  treatment -emergent AEs (diarrhea, 
asthenia/fatigue, hypokalemia, dehydration, weight decrease, hypotension, neutropenia, 
candidiasis, and pneumonia) and an overall higher incidence of treatment -emergent AEs 
≥ Grade  3 were observed in Part C compared with Parts A and B. Although no specific safety 
signal was identified, and neither of the deaths were considered related to study treatment, 
the sponsor ’s interpretation of the safety data is that the combination of brentuximab vedotin 
(at 1.8  mg/kg) and bendam ustine at the dose levels evaluated (70 and 90  mg/m2) does not 
represent a low toxicity regimen for this patient  population, which is generally considered 
ineligible for conventional combination chemotherapy. Therefore, as of 7 -Oct-2015 (the date 
of the De ar Investigator Letter), the sponsor has suspended enrollment of patient s into Part C 
and discontinued bendamustine treatment for all patient s enrolled in Part C. Single -agent 
brentuximab vedotin may be continued for patient s who tolerate the therapy and h ave 
demonstrated clinical benefit.  
3.2.2  Part D  
Safety review of patient s treated with the combination of brentuximab vedotin and 
nivolumab will be conducted by the study SMC after the first 5 patient s complete treatment 
through Cycle 3 Day 1, and throughout the  study as needed.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 31 of 157 3.3 Retreatment (Part D Only)  
Retreatment with brentuximab vedotin plus nivolumab is permitted, with medical monitor 
approval, for patient s who achieve a CR or PR on study and experience disease progression 
≥6 months after discontinuing study  treatment. To be eligible for retreatment, patient s must 
meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The retreatment 
regimen will be brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3  mg/kg on 
Day 1 of each 3 -week cycle, unless otherwise specified by the medical monitor or the site  
investigator. Patient s who previously required a brentuximab vedotin dose reduction due to 
AEs will start brentuximab vedotin at a dose of 1.2  mg/kg and will not escalate to 1.8 mg/kg. 
Retreatment can continue for an unlimited number of cycles.  
3.4 End of Study  
The study will be closed  2 years after the last patient  receives their last dose or when the last 
patient  completes the last visit, last contact, discontinues from the study, or when no  patient s 
remain in follow -up, whichever occurs first. In additio n, the sponsor may terminate the study 
at any time (see Section  10.3.2 ). 
3.5 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design  
Part A of this study is designed as an open -label phase 2 study that evaluates the efficacy and 
tolerability of brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy in adults age 60 and above with 
previously untreated HL. As a way to further evaluate efficacy and tolerability of novel 
regimens for older patient s and provid e additional treatment options, Part B of the study is 
designed to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with dacarbazine, Part C of the 
study is designed to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with bendamustine, and 
Part D of the study is de signed to evaluate brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
nivolumab as frontline therapy in these patient s. The endpoints of this study are appropriate 
for evaluating efficacy and safety in this population. The frequency of blood draws for 
evaluation of P K and ATA is appropriate based on prior experience with brentuximab 
vedotin.  
Rationale for Eligibility Criteria in Parts E and F  
Parts E and F of the study are designed to evaluate brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy in 
previously untreated patient s with H L or CD30 -expressing PTCL, respectively, who are 
considered unsuitable or unfit for multiagent chemotherapy treatment of curative intent due 
to coexisting medical conditions. Selection of patient s will be based on the following 
comorbidity -related criteria : 
a. CIRS  score ≥10 (according to the criteria specified by Salvi and colleagues (Salvi 
2008 ) and excluding current active lymphoma ) (see Appendix G), or  
b. requiring assistance with or dependence on others for any IADLs ( Appendix H). 
 
While t here is not a standard definition for such patient s within the c lassical HL and PTCL 
populations, the proposed criteria are based upon the recent approval of venetoclax 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 32 of 157 (VENCLEXTA®) in combination with obinutuzumab as a frontline regimen for CLL, 
available  data in the literature on comorbidities in patient s with c lassical HL and PTCL  
(Evens 2018 ), and communication with key opinion leaders.  
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale  
Originally developed in 1968, CIRS is a widely used tool to quickly but comprehensively 
assess physical impairment (Linn 1968 ). The proposed CIRS criteria, developed by 
Salvi  et al., incorporates conditions typically seen in the elderly and comprehensively 
evaluates 14  organ systems, rating each from 0 to 4 based on increasing severity/impairment 
and yielding a score fo r each organ system and a cumulative score (Salvi 2008 ). A greater 
CIRS score indicates poorer health status and is widely utilized in trials as an assessment of 
comorbidities (Extermann 2000 ), and as a measure of the burden of acute and chronic illness 
in adults as measured by mortality over a 24 -month period (Mistry 2004 ). In CLL, a 
cumulative CIRS ≥6 in combination with creatine clearance is used to determine fitness for 
aggressive treatment as part of a “Go-go,” “Slow -go,” or “No-go” algorithm. CLL14, the 
phase 3 trial that led to the approval of venetoclax  in frontline CLL in May 2019, used the 
CIRS sco re both in the inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify patient s with coexisting 
medical conditions and determine fitness to receive treatment (VENCLEXTA package insert , 
July 2019).  
CIRS Scoring and IADL in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma  
In a recent study by Evens et al., a combination regimen of brentuximab vedotin + AVD was 
evaluated in 48 older patient s (age ≥60 years) with untreated c lassical HL (Evens 2018 ). The 
median CIRS -G score (based on the CIRS by Salvi et al., and with the same scoring criteria) 
at baseline was 7 (range 1 to 20) with 25/48 (52%) patient s having at least 1 Grade 3 or 4 
deficit. Fifteen (31%) patient s had a CIRS -G score ≥10. Patients with CIRS -G score ≥10 only 
tolerated a median of 5 cycles (range 1 to 12) while patient s with CIRS -G <10 received a 
median of 12 cycles (range 6 tp 12) with 68% receiving all 12 intended cycles. The most 
common reason for early discontinuation from t he study was toxicity or AE (35%), which 
was more commonly seen in patient s with CIRS -G scores ≥10. It has been suggested that the 
primary reason for the poorer outcomes observed in patient s with CIRS -G ≥ 0 was the 
presence of significant co -morbidities pr eventing the patient s from tolerating the full regimen 
(personal communication by investigator). Patient s with CIRS -G scores of ≥10 (N=14) had a 
2-year PFS rate of 45% (95% CI: 15, 71) vs. 100% (95% CI: 100, 100) in patient s with 
CIRS -G scores <10 (N=30). In addition, patient s with loss of an IADL at baseline (N=6) had 
2-year PFS rates of 25% (95% CI: 1, 65) vs. 94% (95% CI: 79, 99) in patient s without loss of 
an IADL at baseline (N=36) (Evens 2018 ). Lastly, in patient s with  a CIRS -G score ≥10, 5/15 
(33%) had loss of IADLs and of patient s with loss of IADLs at baseline, 4/6 (67%) had a 
CIRS -G score ≥10.

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 33 of 157 3.5.1  Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
Part A is a single -arm evaluation of 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin administered as a single 
IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle, Part B is a single -arm evaluation of 
combination treatment with 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin and 375  mg/m2 dacarbazine, 
Part C is a single -arm evaluation of combination treatmen t with 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin on Day 1 and 70  mg/m2 bendamustine on Days 1 and 2, Part D is a single -arm 
evaluation of combination treatment with 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin and 3  mg/kg 
nivolumab given on Day 1 of each cycle, and Parts E and F are  each a single -arm evaluation 
of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin administered as a single IV infusion on Day 1 of each 
3-week treatment cycle. Enrollment in Part A will halt once Part B is open for enrollment at a 
site or a total of 30 patient s have been enr olled in Part A. Enrollment in Part B will halt once 
approximately 20 patient s have been enrolled and Part C is open for enrollment at a site. 
Enrollment on Part C was suspended as of 7 -Oct-2015 based on SMC recommendation and 
sponsor decision. Approximate ly 50 evaluable patient s each will be enrolled in Parts E and F. 
In Part F, there will be an enrollment cap of 50% on patient s with sALCL (approximately 
25 patient s). 
Patient s enrolling on study with estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min will receive 
1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin either as a single agent in Part A or in combination with a 
reduced dose of dacarbazine (262  mg/m2; ~30% reduced) in Part B.  
3.5.2  Rationale for Selection of Doses  
In a phase 1 dose -escalation study of brentuximab vedotin (SG035 -0001 ), the 
maximum -tolerated dose was defined as 1.8  mg/kg IV administered every 3 weeks. This dose 
and schedule was further evaluated in 2 pivotal phase 2 studies (SG035 -0003 and 
SG035 -0004) in patient s with CD30 -expressing hematologic malignancies. Based on historic 
brentuximab vedotin PK data from patient s with HL and patient s with anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma, including a limited number of older patient s, age is not a significant covariate for 
drug exposure. Thus, a dose adjustment specifically for age ba sed on PK is not warranted.  
The dose of dacarbazine to be administered in combination with brentuximab vedotin in 
Part B is the standard dose level (375  mg/m2) that is combined with other therapeutic agents 
for frontline treatment of HL. The standard dosin g frequency of dacarbazine is on Days 1 and 
15 of a 28 -day cycle, but dacarbazine administration for this study will be on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle to align with approved brentuximab vedotin dosing. In a phase 1 study of 
brentuximab vedotin + ABVD or + A VD, the maximum -tolerated dose of brentuximab 
vedotin when combined with these chemotherapeutic agents was not exceeded at 1.2  mg/kg 
every 2  weeks (the maximum planned dose). The maximum planned dose of 1.2  mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin was chosen because this  dose administered every 2 weeks was expected 
to achieve the same exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) as the approved single -agent 
dose of 1.8  mg/kg every 3 weeks (Younes 2013 ). Brentuximab vedotin exposures were 
similar to that obtained with the approved monotherapy regimen when administered in 
combination with AVD every 2 weeks.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 34 of 157 The starting dose of bendamu stine that was initially administered in combination with 
brentuximab vedotin in Part C was 90  mg/m2. Although bendamustine is approved for 
clinical use at a starting dose of 100  mg/m2 for CLL and 120  mg/m2 for NHL, a lower 
starting dose of bendamustine wa s used because of the overlapping toxicities of the 2 agents, 
in particular myelosuppression. Additionally, interim results from the SGN35 -016 study 
supported the administration of a lower dose of bendamustine combined with 1.8  mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin. T he 90  mg/m2 dose is within the effective range of bendamustine; 
however, preliminary safety results observed in Study SGN35 -016 suggested that IRRs may 
occur more frequently and at a higher severity with this combination (LaCasce 2014 ). Thus, 
the safety of the combination at this dose level was to be assessed in 5 patient s who 
completed Cycle 1 and again once 5 patient s completed Cycle 2 (see Section 3.1). Lower 
dose levels of bendamustine (70 and 50  mg/m2) were to be recommended in the case of 
unacceptable toxicity at the higher dose. Subsequent to Amendment 6, the starting dose of  
bendamustine has been lowered to 70  mg/m2 (see Section 5.4.5 ). As of 7 -Oct-2015, the 
sponsor suspended enrollment of patient s into Part C and disc ontinued bendamustine 
treatment for all patient s enrolled in Part C based on SMC recommendation. Single -agent 
brentuximab vedotin may be continued for patient s who tolerate the therapy and have 
demonstrated clinical benefit (Section 3.1). 
The dose of nivolumab for this study is 3  mg/kg via IV infusion administered every 3 weeks. 
The approved dose for nivolumab as monotherapy is 3  mg/kg every 2 weeks for the 
treatment of melanoma and metastatic squamous non -small cell lung cancer. However, 
nivolumab has been studied as monotherapy and in combination treatment in several tumor 
types with dosing every 3 weeks. It was recently reported that nivolumab dose levels of 0.3, 
2, and 10  mg/kg every 3 weeks yielded similar ORR, PFS, and OS in a phase 2 trial of 
patient s with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Motzer 2015 ). Moreover, nivolumab dose 
levels of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10  mg/kg every 2 weeks were associated with very similar 
(median 64% –70%) PD -1 receptor occupancy and comparable ORR and PFS in patient s with 
advanced melanoma (Topalian 2012 ). These findings indicate a flat dose -response 
relationship for nivolumab across a wide dose range for both every 2- and 3 -week dosing, 
suggesting that dosing nivolumab at 3  mg/kg every 3 weeks is appropriate in the current 
study. Dosing of 3  mg/kg nivolumab in combination with 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin on 
Day 1 every 3  weeks has also been evaluated in 10 patient s with relapsed/refractory HL in an 
ongoing cooperative group trial. Patient s on that study are premedicated with H 1- and 
H2-antagonists. Only 1 patient  experienced a Grade 1/2 IRR thus far and the patient  was able 
to receive subsequent therapy with additio nal premedication (Diefenbach 2016 ). Due to the 
low incidence of IRRs observed in this cooperative group trial, Part D of the current study 
will mirror the same -day dosing regimen and premedications (see Sectio ns 5.2.2 , 5.5.3 , and 
5.5.4 ). There is no recommended maximum number of cycles for brentuximab vedotin 
monotherapy treatment of HL in the relapsed setting (after failure of autologous stem cell 
transplant or after failure of at least 2 prior multi -agent chemotherapy regimens) nor a 
recommended maximum number of cycles for nivolumab treatment in any of the approved 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 35 of 157 indications; therefore, this study will evaluate 16 cycles or more of treatment combined with 
brentuximab vedotin (refer to the package inserts for nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin).  
Renal excretion is a minor route of free MMAE elimination in patient s, with the major route 
via feces. The potential impact of renal impairment on the PK of brentuximab vedotin and 
free MMAE was evaluated in a special populations study (SGN35 -008B, data on file). No 
meaningful change in brentuximab vedotin PK was observed. An apparent increase in 
MMAE exposure was observed only in the patient s with severe renal impairment (estimated 
creatinine cle arance <30  mL/min, n=2). In an effort to mitigate risk due to increased MMAE 
exposure, dosing will be reduced to 1.2  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin for patient s enrolling on 
Parts A and B of the study with estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min. Renal excret ion 
is a significant route of dacarbazine elimination; therefore, a dose reduction of ~30% is 
recommended for patient s with estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min for patient s 
enrolled in Part B. Although no formal studies evaluating the impact of renal  impairment on 
the PK of bendamustine have been conducted, bendamustine is not recommended for use in 
patient s with creatinine clearance <40  mL/min, according to prescribing information. Patient s 
in Part C will be excluded from the study if they present wi th estimated creatinine clearance 
<40 mL/min. Patient s in Part D will be excluded from the study if they present with 
estimated creatinine clearance <30  mL/min. Patient s enrolling on Parts E and F will be 
excluded from the study if they present with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) 
<30 mL/min/1.73m².

5 TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatments Administered  
All patient s enrolled on study will receive brentuximab vedotin, the investigational agent 
under study in this protocol. Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC consisting of the 
antibody  cAC10, specific for human CD30; the microtubule -disrupting agent MMAE; and a 
prote ase-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10.  
Patient s enrolled in Part B of the study will receive combination treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin and dacarbazine, a commercially -available chemotherapeutic agent. Patient s enrolled 
in Part C of the study will receive combination treatment with brentuximab vedotin and 
bendamustine, a commercially -available chemotherapeutic agent. Patient s enrolled in Part  D 
of the study will receive combination treatment with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, a 
commercially -available monoclonal antibody.  
5.2 Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of brentuximab 
vedotin is located in the Pharmacy Instructions.  
5.2.1  Description  
Brentuximab vedotin is a steri le, preservative -free, white to off -white lyophilized cake or 
powder supplied by Seattle Genetics in single -use vials for reconstitution for IV 
administration. Each vial of the product contains brentuximab vedotin, trehalose, sodium 
citrate, and polysorbat e 80. See the Pharmacy Instructions for further information.  
5.2.2  Dose and Administration  
In all parts of the study, brentuximab vedotin will be administered on Day 1 of each 3 -week 
cycle by IV infusion given over approximately 30  minutes. In the absence of IRR s, the 
infusion rate for all patient s should be calculated in order to achieve a 30 -minute infusion 
period. Brentuximab vedotin must not be administered as an IV push or bolus. Brentuximab 
vedotin should not be mixed with other medications. For Parts B and  C, brentuximab vedotin 
should be administered approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion of 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 41 of 157 dacarbazine or bendamustine, as applicable. For Part D, brentuximab vedotin should be 
administered approximately 30 minutes prior to the sta rt of the infusion of nivolumab.  
Dosing is based on patient  weight according to the institutional standard; however, doses will 
be adjusted for patient s who experience a ≥10% change in weight from baseline. An 
exception to weight -based dosing is made for patient s weighing >100  kg; doses will be based 
on 100  kg for these individuals. Rounding is permissible within 5% of the nominal dose.  
5.2.3  Required Premedication and Postmedication  
In Parts A, B, E, and F, routine premedication should not be administered for th e prevention 
of IRRs prior to the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. However, premedications may be 
administered prior to the first dose of brentuximab vedotin in Parts A, B, E, and F if required 
per institutional standard. Patient s who experience a Grade  1 or Grade  2 IRR may receive 
subsequent brentuximab vedotin infusions with premedication as described in Section  5.7.1 . 
In Part C, patient s are to receive premedication as noted in Section 5.4.4 . In Part D, patient s 
are to receive premedication as noted in Section 5.5.4 . 
Patient s should be individually evaluated to assess the need for tumor lysis prophylaxis prior 
to the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. Patient s should receive prophylaxis as ap propriate 
per the institutional standards.  
5.2.4  Dose Modifications  
Table  1 describes the recommended dose modifications for brentuximab vedotin 
treatment -associated toxicity.  
The start of the next cycle may be delayed for up to 3 weeks if additional time is required for 
the patient  to recover from study treatment -associated toxicity experienced during the current 
cycle. Delays of greater than 3 weeks are proh ibited without approval from the sponsor.  
In addition, doses reduced for treatment -related toxicity should not be re -escalated without 
discussion with the sponsor.  
For patient s receiving 1.2  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin due to renal impairment, those patient s 
who tolerate multiple doses may be administered 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin following 
discussion with the sponsor and provision of documentation demonstrating sufficient renal 
function for this dose. Dose reductions below 1.2  mg/kg are not allowed, and toxicities 
should be managed with dose delays.

Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Patient s will receive 
nivolumab at a dose of 3  mg/kg as a 60 -minute infusion (per the nivolumab prescribing 
information). Nivolumab should be administered at least 30 minutes after completing 
brentuximab vedotin infusion. Nivolumab infusions should be administered through an 
IV line containing a sterile, non -pyrogenic, low protein binding in -line filter (pore size of 
0.2 µm to 1.2  µm). Other drugs should not be co -administered through the same IV  line 
(e.g.,  brentuximab vedotin).  
Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at baseline, then per 
institutional standards. It is not necessary to recalculate subsequent doses if the patient  
weight is within 10% of the weight used to calculate the previous dose. All doses should be 
rounded to the nearest milligram.  
The Pharmacy Binder contains specific instructions for nivolumab dose calculation, dilution, 
preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 47 of 157 5.5.4  Requir ed Premedication and Postmedication  
Prior to combination treatment on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle, prophylactic premedication 
for prevention of IRRs is to be administered. Antihistamines, including both H 1-receptor 
antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine 25 –50 mg IV or equivalent) and H 2-receptor antagonists 
(e.g., ranitidine or cimetidine) should be given approximately 30 to 60  minutes prior to 
infusion of brentuximab vedotin. If an increase of IRRs is observed, the SMC may 
recommend additional premedication, in cluding but not limited to hydrocortisone 100  mg IV 
or equivalent. At the discretion of the investigator, further premedications for symptom 
management (e.g., acetaminophen, and/or ondansetron) may also be given.  
If a patient  does not experience an IRR wit h combination treatment during Cycles 1 
through  4, prophylactic premedication may be reduced or stopped at the discretion of the 
investigator for Cycles 5 and beyond. If treatment with nivolumab or brentuximab vedotin is 
discontinued, premedication may be reduced or stopped at the discretion of the investigator 
during single -agent treatment for subsequent cycles.  
5.5.5  Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications of nivolumab, including escalations or reductions, are not allowed.  
Patient s who discontinue brentuximab ved otin due to an AE may continue treatment with 
nivolumab monotherapy. If nivolumab is held at the time a cycle of brentuximab vedotin is 
given, once the AE causing the delay of nivolumab has resolved, administration of 
nivolumab should resume on the same sc hedule with the next cycle of combination therapy. 
See Section 7.7.1.1  for determining causality.  
5.5.5.1  Dose Delays  
Dose delays of both brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab resulting in interruption of all 
therapy for >6  weeks require that a patient  discontinue from study treatment, with the 
exception of patient s who are receiving protocol -specified consolidative RT (Secti on 5.6.2) 
or other exceptions noted in Section 5.5.5.2 . Patient s who exp erience a dose delay of either 
brentuximab or nivolumab >6  weeks must stop treatment with that component of the 
combination therapy.

purposes or prevention of infusion reactions in Parts B, C, or D of the study.  
Routine prophylaxis with vaccines is permitted; it is recommended that vaccines used do not 
contain live micro -organisms.  
At the investigator ’s discretion, brentuximab vedotin monotherapy dosing in Part A may be 
interrupted or may be followed after completion of treatment, by consolidative RT. RT may 
be given no sooner than 2 weeks after receiving brentu ximab vedotin. If dosing is paused for 
RT, then RT should not be administered starting prior to the Cycle 8 response assessment, 
and brentuximab vedotin may be resumed no sooner than 2 weeks after RT is completed. 
RT-related dosing interruptions longer tha n 10 weeks must be approved by the sponsor.  
In Part B, combination treatment with brentuximab vedotin and dacarbazine may be followed

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 52 of 157 5.6.3  Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Patient s may not receive other investigational drugs, immunosuppressive medications 
(excluding steroids as described in Section 5.6.2 ), or systemic anti -neoplastic therapy during 
the study (with the exception of dacarbazine for patient s enrolled on Part B, bendamustine 
for patient s enrolled on Part C, and nivolumab for patients enrolled on Part D).  
In Part D, complementary medications (e.g., herbal supplements or traditional Chinese 
medicines) intended to treat the disease under study. Such medications are allowed if they are 
used as supportive care. Any live/attenuated vaccine (e.g., varicella, zoster, yellow fever, 
rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella) are not allowed during treatment and until 
100 days post last dose.  
5.7 Management of Adverse Reactions  
5.7.1  Management of Infusion Reactions  
IRRs may occur during th e infusion of study treatment. The infusion should be administered 
at a site properly equipped and staffed to manage anaphylaxis should it occur. All supportive 
measures consistent with optimal patient  care should be given throughout the study according 
to institutional standards. Supportive measures may include extending the infusion time 
and/or administering medications for IRRs.  
Patient s who have experienced a Grade 1 or Grade 2 IRR to brentuximab vedotin should be 
premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an 
antihistamine, and a corticosteroid administered 30 –60 minutes prior to each infusion or 
according to institutional standards. Patient s who experience a Grade 3 IRR to brentuximab 
vedotin may potentially receive additional treatment with brentuximab vedotin at the 
discretion of the investigator after discussion with the sponsor. Treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin should be discontinued for patient s who experience Grade 4 IRRs.  
Infusion reactions related to dacarba zine should be managed according to the package insert 
and/or institutional standard of care.  
With the combination of bendamustine and brentuximab vedotin, IRRs and delayed -type 
HSRs have been observed (LaCasce 2014 ). To reduce the risk of infusion reactions with 
bendamustine, all patient s will be premedicated as described in Section 5.4.4 . Infusion 
reactions related to bendamustine should be managed according to the package insert and 
institutional standard of care.  
With the combination of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin (Part D), required 
premedication is described in Section 5.5.4 . In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity 
symptoms to nivolumab (e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 
1 week after nivolumab treatment), sympto matic treatment may be given (e.g., oral 
antihistamine). Other premedication may be given based on SMC recommendation 
(e.g.,  corticosteroids).  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 53 of 157 If anaphylaxis occurs, brentuximab vedotin administration (and dacarbazine or bendamustine 
or nivolumab, if appli cable) should be immediately and permanently discontinued.  
5.7.2  Management of Suspected PML  
Signs and symptoms of PML may include altered mental status, motor deficits such as 
hemiparesis or ataxia, visual disturbances, or higher cortical dysfunction such as dy sphasia or 
agnosia. See the brentuximab vedotin Investigator ’s Brochure for further details.  
If PML is suspected, hold further brentuximab vedotin dosing (and dacarbazine or 
bendamustine dosing, if applicable), and undertake a diagnostic work -up including (but not 
limited to):  
● Neurologic examinations, as warranted  
● Brain radiologic features by magnetic resonance imaging  
● PCR analysis: John Cunningham virus DNA detectable in cerebrospinal fluid  
 
If PML is confirmed, permanently discontinue treatment with brentuximab vedotin (and 
dacarbazine, bendamustine, or nivolumab, if applicable).  
5.7.3  Management of Overdose  
Weight -based dosing for brentuximab vedotin is based on patient  actual body weight (see 
Section 5.2.2 ), with the exception of patient s weighing greater than 100  kg; doses will be 
based on 100  kg for these individuals. The maximum dose calculated per cycle in this 
study is 180  mg for patient s receiving the 1.8 mg/kg  dose level, and 120 mg for patient s 
receiving 1.2 mg/kg dose level.  
In the event of an overdose of brentuximab vedotin ≥10%, study personnel should:  
● Care for and medically stabilize the patient  until there is no immediate risk of 
complications or death, i f applicable. There is currently no known antidote for an 
overdose of brentuximab vedotin.  
● Notify the Medical Monitor as soon as they become aware of the overdose, to discuss 
details of the overdo se (e.g., exact amount of brentuximab vedotin administered, 
patient  weight) and AEs, if any.  
For the management of overdoses of dacarbazine, bendamustine, or nivolumab, refer to the 
prescribing information of each drug.  
5.8 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug administration is performed by study site staff and documented i n source 
documents and the CRF.

6.8 Follow -up 
After the EOT visit and 30 -day safety period (or 100 -day safety period relative to nivolumab 
dosing on Part D), all patient s who receive at least 1 dose o f brentuximab vedotin will be 
followed until withdrawal of consent, death, or the study closure. Information regarding 
survival, disease status, and additional or alternative therapies used for treatment of their 
lymphoma will be collected.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 60 of 157 Prior to Progression  
For Parts  A, B, C, and D, patient s who have not progressed at EOT will be followed for 
survival status at 3 -month intervals (±2 weeks) which may be conducted with a clinic visit or 
a telephone call. Disease status will be assessed by CT imaging per institutional standard of 
care or at least approximately every 6 months following the most recent prior radiographic 
response evaluation for the first 2 years, an annual assessment for the third year, then per 
institutional standard of care until progr ession.  
For Parts E and F, patient s discontinuing study treatment without progression will be 
followed until progression or initiation of further anti -cancer therapy. Follow -up CT scans 
will be performed every 4  months for 2  years and then per institution al standard of care, and 
follow -up PET scans will be performed per institutional standard of care. Lymphoma 
assessments are to be performed at least approximately every 6 months during follow -up. 
Upon progression, data regarding any subsequent anti -cancer therapies administered will be 
summarized and reported.  
After Progression  
Survival status follow -up will be conducted for patient s who have progressed or started 
further anti -cancer treatment at 3 -month intervals (±2 weeks) in Parts A to D and at 4 -month 
intervals (±2 weeks) in Parts E and F. Survival follow -up contact may be conducted with a 
clinic visit or a telephone call.

7.1 Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Only patient s who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section 4 will be 
enrolled in this study.  
Review of a pathology report from local laboratory will be used to confirm histopathological 
diagnosis of HL when determining eligibility for this study.  For PTCL, tissue from the 
diagnostic biopsy must confirm CD30 express ion by visual assessment using 
immunohistochemistry. Assessment of CD30 expression to determine eligibility for patient s 
with PTCL will be performed by the institutional lab (using the anti -CD30 BerH2 antibody) 
with a requirement that CD30 expression be de tected in ≥1% of neoplastic cells.  
Diagnostic tumor tissue will be sent to a central repository designated by the sponsor and will 
subsequently be sent to a central laboratory for a retrospective analysis of disease -related 
biomarkers , including CD30 . If archived tissue is not available or of insufficient quantity for 
central analysis, fresh tissue should be collected.  
Performance status will be assessed by the ECOG Performance Status scale and the 
Karnofsky score in Parts A to D (Appendix F). 
In Parts A to D, before initiation of protocol therapy, a baseline geriatric assessment will be 
performed using components from a tool developed and evaluated by Hurria et al. (Hurria 
2011 ). Assessment variables may include but not be limited to aspects of function, 
comorbidity, cognition, psychological state, social activity/support, and nutritional sta tus. 
Patient  medical history includes a thorough review of significant past medical history, 
current conditions, any treatment for prior malignancies and response to prior treatment, and 
any concomitant medications.  
For Part D only, pulmonary function test s evaluating spirometry, such as DLCO (hemoglobin 
adjusted), diffusing capacity of the lungs volume adjusted, diffusing capacity of the lungs 
volume and hemoglobin adjusted, total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second, are required for all patient s at screening. DLCO over 50% 
(adjusted for hemoglobin) must be confirmed by a pulmonary function test of lung diffusion 
capacity prior to study enrollment.  
For Parts E and F, the reason(s) for patient s being unsuitab le or unfit to receive multi -agent 
chemotherapy determined at screening (the presence of comorbidity -related factors, as 
documented by a CIRS  score ≥10 [ Appendix G] (according to the criteria specified by Salvi 
and colleagues (Salvi 2008 ) and excluding current active lymphoma)  or requiring assistance 
with or dependence on others for any IADLs [ Appendix H]) will d ocumented on the CRF.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 62 of 157 7.2 Response Assessments  
7.2.1  Parts A, B, and C  
For Parts A, B, and C of the study, treatment response will be assessed by spiral CT scan of 
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (and neck, if clinically indicated) and PET scans performed at 
protocol -specified time points (see Section  6 and Appendix A), and whenever disease 
progression is suspected. A combined CT/PET of diagnostic quality may be obtained to 
satisfy the requirements for CT and PET scanning. With either CT/PET or diagnostic CT,  it 
is preferred that both oral and IV contrast are used, except when contraindicated or not 
feasible.  
The determination of antitumor efficacy will be based on objective response assessments 
made according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lym phoma (Cheson 2007 ) 
and treatment decisions by the Investigator will be based on these assessments. Clinical 
response of PD, SD, PR, or CR will be determined at each assessment. Progressive disease 
also includes clinical disease progressi on per investigator. Selection of up to 6 of the largest 
dominant nodes or nodal masses to follow for response assessment must be PET FDG -avid at 
baseline. Investigator evaluation of baseline radiographic assessment will enable study 
enrollment per Inclusi on Criterion 4. In addition, per the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma, these nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the 
following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; if 
possible, they s hould be from disparate regions of the body; and they should include 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. The nodes 
or masses should have bidimensional measurements of at least 1.5  cm in the longest axis.  
In addition, visual interpretation will be used for exploratory evaluation of interim PET scans 
with response scored with reference to sites of presumed lymphomatous involvement using 
the 5 -Point Scale per the Deauville Criteria in Appendix  I (Barrington 2010 ; Meignan 2009 ). 
For interim PET scans performed while patient s are receiving study therapy, scores of 1, 2, 
and 3 with uptake in sites abnormal on the stagin g scan equal or less than liver uptake will be 
regarded as “negative ” while scores of 4 and 5 with uptake greater than liver will be regarded 
as positive. PET scans performed at the EOT and beyond will be evaluated per the Revised 
Response Criteria for Mal ignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007 ; Juweid 2007 ). PET scans 
performed per institutional standard of care may be collected at any time during the study, as 
available, for this exploratory evaluation.  
Once a CR is documented, no further PET scans are required during the study. After the 
patient  is withdrawn from study drug for any reason, an additional response assess ment will 
be performed at the EOT visit if an assessment has not been performed within the prior 
6 weeks. Patient s with SD or better may continue on study drug for up to 16 cycles or more. 
After discussion with the medical monitor, patient s who complete 16  cycles of treatment and 
experience clinical benefit per the investigator will be eligible to continue receiving 
additional brentuximab vedotin treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
study closure.  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 63 of 157 Patient s’ clinical data must be av ailable for CRF source verification. All imaging studies 
must be copied to CDs and provided to the sponsor. At the end of the study the images may 
either be sent to a central radiology facility for confirmation of disease response or destroyed.  
7.2.2  Part D  
For Part D of the study, the determination of antitumor activity will be based on response 
assessments made according to the Lugano criteria (Cheson 2014 ) and according to  LYRIC 
(Cheson 2016 ) (Appendix J). Treatment decisions by the investigator will be based on these 
assessments. Staging will be performed by PET/CT of diagnostic quality at 
protocol -specified time points (see Section 6 and Appendix B), with disease involvement 
determined by focal FDG uptake in nodal and ext ranodal (including spleen, liver, bone 
marrow, and thyroid) sites that is consistent with lymphoma, according to the pattern of 
uptake and/or CT characteristics. Up to 6 of the largest nodes, nodal masses, or other 
involved lesions that are measurable in 2 diameters should be identified as target lesions at 
baseline; if possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
At Cycle 2 (Days 15 –21), a CT scan of diagnostic quality will be performed to assess for PD; 
a limited scan that includes sites of disease identified at baseline is acceptable. For all other 
response assessments, a clinical response of PD, SD, PR, or CR will be determined unles s 
tumor flare or pseudoprogression is suspected. If tumor flare or pseudoprogression is not 
suspected, PD includes radiological evidence of progression per Lugano criteria. If clinical 
progression is determined by the investigator, radiographic staging sho uld also be performed 
to determine response assessment per Lugano criteria. The PET scan metabolic uptake will 
be graded using the Deauville 5 point scale ( Appendix  I) (Barrington 2010 ; Biggi 2013 ) with 
a score of ≤3 considered to represent a complete metabolic response. Except for the Cycle 2 
response assessment, both PET and CT scanning will be required until disease is PET 
negative; responses will then be followed by CT scan of diagnostic quality  only.  
If tumor flare or pseudoprogression is suspected by the Investigator during treatment with the 
combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, during single -agent nivolumab therapy 
(if brentuximab vedotin discontinued), or during single -agent bren tuximab vedotin therapy 
within 12 weeks of discontinuing nivolumab, then a clinical response of IR will be 
determined until subsequent mandatory evaluation of radiographic imaging or biopsy 
confirms or refutes PD. IR is defined below. See Appendix J for further details and criteria 
for follow -up of a response of IR.  
1) An increase in overall tumor burden (as assessed by the sum of the products of the largest 
diameter [SPD]) of ≥50% of up to 6 measurable lesions in the first 12  weeks of therapy, 
without clinical deterioration;  
2) Appearance of new lesions, or growth of 1 or more existing lesion(s) ≥50% at any time 
during treatment, occurring in the context of lack of overall progres sion (<50% increase) 
of overall tumor burden, as measured by SPD of up to 6 lesions at any time during 
treatment; and  
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 64 of 157 3) An increase in FDG uptake (using the 5 -Point Scale per the Deauville Criteria 
[Appendix  I]) of 1 or more lesion(s) without a concomitant increase in lesion size or 
number.  
Repeat imaging 12 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated) after a response of IR is 
determined by the Investigator is mandatory and PD must be confirmed or refuted based 
LYRIC follow -up criteria for IR (Cheson 2016 ). If a patient  has a second determination of 
IR, then subsequent repeat imaging must be performed between 4 and 8 weeks. Follow -up 
radiographic assessment for patient s with IR is not required if a follow -up biopsy has been 
performed that confirms response.  
Patient s’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification. All imaging studies 
must be copied to CDs and provided to the sponsor. At the end of the study the images may 
either be sent to a central radiology facility for confi rmation of disease response or destroyed.  
7.2.3  Parts E and F  
Treatment response will be assessed by spiral CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (and 
neck, if clinically indicated) and PET scans performed at protocol -specified time points (see 
Section  6 and Appendix C), and whenever disease progression is suspected. A combined 
CT/PET of diagnostic quality may be obtained to satisfy the requirements for CT and PET 
scanning. With either CT/PET or diagnostic CT, it is preferred that both oral and IV contrast 
are used, except when contraindicated or not feasible. If a patient  has an a llergy to the IV CT 
contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium contrast is 
to be used; if, in addition, the patient  cannot tolerate gadolinium, CT without IV contrast 
should be used. Oral contrast should be used whenever p ossible, even if IV contrast is 
contraindicated. After the patient  has discontinued from study drug for any reason, an 
additional response assessment will be performed at the EOT visit if an assessment has not 
been performed within the prior 6  weeks. Patie nts with SD or better may continue on study 
drug for up to 16 cycles. Clinical data will be submitted. If clinical progression is determined 
by the investigator, radiographic imaging  should also be performed to determine response.  If 
new lesions are suspec ted based on the CT/PET assessment, a conformational biopsy may be 
considered.  
All patient s’ clinical data and tumor images must be available for CRF source verification. 
Copies of all imaging studies must be made available for review by the sponsor (or it s 
designee) and the third party imaging core laboratory. Refer to the Study Manual for details 
(instructions on collecting and submitting tumor imaging studies for third -party imaging core 
laboratory review).

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 65 of 157 7.2.3.1  Modified Lugano Criteria  
Although, treatment decisions and response assessment by the Investigator will be based on 
local disease assessments according to Lugano criteria  (Section  7.2.3.2 ), the primary 
determination of antitumor efficacy will be ORR according to modified Lugano criteria: the 
Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal  non-Hodgkin  and Hodgkin 
lymphomas  (Cheson 2014 ) modified to take into account CT response in the event of a PET 
PR (Appendix M). Dise ase response of PD, SD, PR, CR, or not evaluable (NE) will be 
determined at each assessment  by BICR . Selection of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes 
or other tumor lesions to follow for response assessment must be PET FDG -avid at baseline. 
Investigator evaluation of baseline radiographic assessment will enable study enrollment per 
Inclusion Criterion 4. In addition, per Lugano criteria, these nodes or masses should be 
selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at lea st 
2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body; 
and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are involved. The nodes or masses should have bidimensional measurements  with at least 
1.5 cm in the longest axis. For PET scans, Deauville scores of 1, 2, and 3 will be regarded as 
“negative ” while scores of 4 and 5 with uptake greater than background liver uptake will be 
regarded as positive.  
As detailed in the Independent R eview Charter, the integrated response at each disease 
assessment will be determined on the basis of PET and CT responses according to modified 
Lugano criteria, as summarized in  Appendix M.  
For time points where both PET and CT disease assessments are available, the response 
assessment will in general default to the PET assessment; however, when a PR is determined 
by PET but the CT response in neither CR nor PR, the integrat ed response will be SD. Once 
a CR has been determined by PET assessment, the integrated response will continue to be CR 
until PD is detected by PET or CT, even if there are no further PET assessments. When the 
CT response is PD and PET was not evaluated th e integrated response will be PD.  
7.2.3.2  Lugano Criteria  
Both the Investigator and the BICR will assess r esponse according to the unmodified Lugano 
criteria (Cheson 2014 ). Assessment of response will be undertaken in the same manner as for 
modified Lugano criteria (Section 7.2.3.1 ), with the exception that if the PET response i s PR 
the integrated response will be PR, irrespective of CT response ( Table 2).

7.2.3.3  International Working Group Consensus Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Lymphoma  
ORR according to RECIL per BICR assessment will be evaluated as an additional efficacy 
endpoint. See Appendix K for details concerning RECIL assessment.  
7.3 Lymphoma Assessments  
Lymphoma assessments are to be performed at the time points outlined in Section  6.8, 
Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C. Every effort must be made to perform 
lymphoma assessments according to the schedule of events to prevent the introduction of 
bias based on treatment delays.  
An a dequate focused lymphoma assessment consists of:  
● Patient  medical history, including a thorough review of:  
○ The patient ’s current signs and symptoms, including B  symptoms.  
○ Concomitant medica tions.  
● Physical examination, including evaluation of skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, 
lymph nodes, heart, lungs, abdomen, back, extremities, and neurology.

For Parts A, B, and C, serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and plasma 
concentrations of MMAE wil l be measured at selected time points in Cycle 1 and at predose 
and end of infusion in subsequent cycles (see Table  3). ATA to brentuximab vedotin will  also 
be measured predose on Cycles 1, 2, 4, every 4 cycles thereafter, and EOT. Samples will be 
retained for measurement of total antibody, if needed.  
For Part D, serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and nivolumab, and plasma 
concentrations of MMAE will be measured at selected time points (see Table  4). ATA 
against brentuximab vedotin and ATA against nivolumab will also be assessed.  
For Parts E and F, serum  concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and plasma 
concentrations of MMAE will be measured at predose and end of infusion in Cycles 1, 2, and 
3 only. ATA to brentuximab vedotin will also be measured predose on Cycles 1, 2, 4, every 
4 cycles thereafter, and EOT. Samples will be retained for measurement of total antibody, if 
needed.  
PK parameters to be estimated include the AUC, maximum concentration for MMAE (C max) 
and the time C max occurred (T max), concentration at the end of infusion (C eoi) for brentuxi mab 
vedotin ADC (all parts) and nivolumab (Part D only), and trough concentration (C trough). PK, 
demographic, and clinical laboratory data may be incorporated into the brentuximab vedotin 
population PK model for further model refinement and parameter estim ation. The incidence 
of ATA to brentuximab vedotin (all parts) and nivolumab (Part D only) will also be assessed.  
For Parts A, B, C, E, and F, blood samples will be collected (predose at each cycle) for 
measurement of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, such as so luble CD30 (sCD30), cytokines, 
chemokines, or other disease -related biomarkers and brentuximab vedotin -related species.  
Table  3 presents the PK, pharma codynamic, and immunogenicity sample collection time 
points for Parts A, B, and C. Table  4 presents the PK and immunogenicity sample collection 
time points for Part D; see Section  7.5 for pharmacodynamics in Part D. Table  5 presents the 
PK, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity sample collection time points for Parts E and F. 
All sampling times are relative to the start of brentuximab vedotin infusion, except for the 
end of infusion concentrations, which are relative to the end of brentuximab vedotin infusion.

Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protoc ol Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 73 of 157 Baseline biomarker levels will be assessed by a central lab oratory  using tissue blocks or 
unstained slides obtained at screening to evaluate potential sensitivity or resistance to 
brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab (e.g., CD30 expression, PD -L1/L2 amplification and 
expression). For biomarker analyses on optional tumor biopsies obtained aft er disease 
progression or on residual disease at Cycle 8 (see Sections 6.5 and 7.6), samples are to be 
tested for the expression of CD30 and PD -L1/L2 expression and other potential markers to 
understand potential delayed response and/or resistance mechanisms.  
Assessments may include, but are not limited to the following:  
● Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of tumor biopsies for:  
○ Expression of PD -L1/L2, CD30, immune cell markers and expression of other 
immune checkpoint molecules in malignant Reed -Sternberg cells and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes by immunohistochemistr y, as well as amplification 
of 9p24.1  
○ Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, Foxp3+ and ratios thereof)  
○ Expression of CD30 and PD -1 among T, B, macrophage and myeloid cell 
populations including CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, and CD163  
○ Amplification and exp ression of PD -L1 and PD -L2 by malignant Reed -Sternberg 
cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  
○ Expression of other immune checkpoint molecules if an assay becomes available  
○ EBV  infection status, if not previously known  
7.6 Other Study Assessments  
For Parts A,  B, C, E, and F, at the time of study entry, tissue blocks (preferred) or unstained 
slides (if tumor block is unavailable) are required. If archived tissue is not available or of 
insufficient quantity for central analysis, fresh tissue should be collected.  Prior to initiation of 
new therapy, additional tissue blocks or unstained slides are required at the time of 
progression or relapse unless re -biopsy would result in unacceptable risk in the setting of 
potential marginal benefit (Parts A, B, and C only). E xploratory assessments are planned for 
disease -related biomarkers.  
For Part D, tissue blocks (preferred) or unstained slides (if tumor block is unavailable) are to 
be collected at screening. If tumor tissue block is not available, a minimum of approximatel y 
20 unstained charged slides of the tumor tissue will be required. If multiple blocks are 
available, the block  with the highest tumor content is preferred. If any tissue remains, the 
tumor pathology block may be returned to the original site by the Sponso r or designee at the 
end of the study upon request. See the Laboratory Manual for details. If tissue is unavailable, 
then discuss with sponsor medical monitor.  
Also for Part D, efforts should be made to take an additional biopsy in patient s who 
demonstrate  disease progression on study, residual disease at Cycle 8 (biopsy should be taken 
prior to RT if patient  is going to have RT administered on study), or if tumor flare or 
pseudoprogression is suspected unless re -biopsy would result in unacceptable risk in the 
setting of potential marginal benefit.  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 74 of 157 For patient s who provide additional consent on any part of the study, remaining de -identified 
unused blood and/or tissue will be retained by Seattle Genetics and used for future research, 
including but not limited  to the evaluation of targets for novel ADCs, the biology of ADC 
sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and to identify predictive pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers of ADCs. If additional consent is not provided, any remaining biological samples 
will be destroyed  after the study has been completed and applicable regulatory obligations 
have been met.  
For Parts E and F, if the etiology of new lesions on CT/PET is uncertain, biopsy or interval 
scanning should be considered.  
7.7 Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety  during the course of this study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AE including SAE, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of 
protocol -specified physical examination findings and laboratory tests. For Part D only, pulse 
oxime try tests (O 2 saturation) will also be performed.  
Safety will be monitored for patient s in Parts C and D by an SMC as described in 
Section  3.2. 
7.7.1  Adverse Events  
7.7.1.1  Defin itions  
Adverse Event  
According to the International Council for Harmonisation E2A guideline Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32, 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reporting, an AE is any un toward medical 
occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigational patient  administered a medicinal product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or other incident on the AEs and Pre -existing Conditions CRF:  
● From the time of informed consent through the day prior to study Day 1,  only study 
protocol -related AEs should be recorded.  
● All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study Day 1 should be 
recorded.  
● All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from study 
Day 1 (during and postdose) through t he end of the safety reporting period (see 
Section  7.7.1.3 ). Complications that occur in association with any procedure (e.g., 
biopsy) should be rec orded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol 
mandated.  
● Changes in medical conditions and AEs, including changes in severity, frequency, or 
character, during the safety reporting period should be recorded.  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuxim ab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 75 of 157 ● In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not be recorded as an AE unless it is 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an intervention, results in a SAE, 
or results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment . 
When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical 
condition rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia ” 
rather than “low hemoglobin ”). 
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as  an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  AE resulted in death  
Life threatening:  The AEs placed the patient  at immediate risk of death. This 
classification does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might 
cause death if it were more sever e. 
Hospitalization:  The AE required or prolonged an existing in patient  hospitalization. 
Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or 
treatments planned before the signing of informed consent in the 
study or routine check -ups are not SAE  by this criterion. 
Admission to a palliative unit or hospice care facility is not 
considered to be a hospitalization. Hospitalizations or prolonged 
hospitalizations for scheduled therapy of the underlying 
malignancy or study target disease need not be cap tured as SAEs.  
Disabling/  
incapacitating:  Resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the patient ’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Congenital anomaly 
or birth defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient  exposed to the 
molecule or study treatment regimen before conception or during 
pregnancy.  
Medically 
significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have 
jeopardized the patient  and might have required medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an 
infectious agent. Potential DILI also is considered a medically 
significant event (see Section  7.7.1.2  for the definition of potential 
DILI.)  
 
Adverse Event Severity  
AE severity should be graded using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. These criter ia are 
provided in the study manual.  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity ’ characterizes the intensity 
of an AE. ‘Serious ’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obliga tions (see definition for SAEs).  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 76 of 157 Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to brentuximab vedotin, dacarbazine, bendamustine, or 
nivolumab should be evaluated by the investigator using the following criteria:  
Related:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE, such as:  
● an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome)  
● an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but 
is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug 
(e.g., tendon rupture)  
Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying 
disease or occurs commonly in the study population ), or a temporal 
sequence cannot be established with the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible  
 
For Part D, the Investigator ’s Brochures for brentuximab vedotin and nivol umab individually 
describe AEs commonly observed with either agent (i.e., neutropenia or peripheral 
neuropathy with brentuximab vedotin; and immune -mediated AEs with nivolumab), as well 
as less common serious findings. The respective Investigator ’s Brochur es should be 
referenced when attributing causality.  
7.7.1.2  Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during patient  
questioning, discovered during physical examination, lab oratory testing and/or other means 
by recording them on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate.  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
An open -ended or non -directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to 
elicit the reporting of AEs.  
Recording Adver se Events  
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre -existing 
Conditions CRF:  
● Description including onset and resolution dates  
● Whether it met serious criteria  
● Severity  
● Relationship to study treatment or other causality  
● Outcome  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 77 of 157 Diagnosis versus Signs or Symptoms  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual 
symptoms. Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component 
sign and/or symptom is a medically co nfirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by 
standard medical textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic 
pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate AE.  
For Parts A, B, C, E, and F, important exc eptions are adverse reactions associated with the 
infusion of study drug. For IRRs, do not use the NCI CTCAE terms of ‘cytokine release 
syndrome, ’ ‘acute infusion reaction, ’ or ‘allergic or HSR .’ Instead, record each sign or 
symptom as an individual AE. If multiple signs or symptoms occur with a given 
infusion -related event, each sign or symptom should be recorded separately with its level of 
severity.  
For Part D, adverse reactions associated with  the infusion of study drug must be recorded as 
both the NCI CTCAE term for IRR (i.e., cytokine release syndrome, acute infusion reaction, 
or allergic or HSR ) and as each sign or symptom that occurs within a given infusion -related 
event. Level of severity for both the overall IRR term and the individual signs and symptoms 
should also be recorded.  
Recording Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs, record the primary event on both the CRF and an SAE form; events occurring 
secondary to the primary event should be desc ribed on the SAE form in the narrative 
description of the case.  
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:  
● Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported on both an SAE form and CRF.  
● For h ospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
respo nse to the illness.  
Progression of the Underlying Malignancy  
Since progression of underlying malignancy is being assessed as an efficacy variable, it 
should not be reported as an AE or SAE. The terms “Disease Progression ”, “Progression of 
Disease ”, or “Malignant disease progression ” and other similar terms should not be used to 
describe an AE or SAE. However, clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs 
or SAEs if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to progression of the 
underlyin g malignancy or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease 
under study. In addition, complications from progression of the underlying malignancy 
should be reported AEs or SAEs.  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 78 of 157 Pregnancy  
Complete a Pregnancy Report Form for all pregna ncies that occur from the time of first study 
drug dose until 6 months after the last dose of study drug, including brentuximab vedotin, 
dacarbazine, or bendamustine (or 8 months after the last dose of nivolumab), whichever is 
later, including any pregnanc ies that occur in a male patient ’s partner if the estimated date of 
conception is after the male patient ’s first study drug dose. Email or fax to the sponsor ’s 
Drug Safety Department within 48 hours of becoming aware of a pregnancy. On the AE and 
Pre-Exist ing Conditions CRF, record all pregnancies that occur from time of informed 
consent to within 30 days of last study drug dose for Parts A, B, C, E, F or for Part  D, from 
the time of informed consent until 6 months after the last dose of brentuximab vedotin  or 
8 months after the last dose of nivolumab, whichever is later, (i.e., based on the estimated 
date of conception) including any pregnancies that occur in the partner of a male study 
patient . Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, sho uld be reported as an 
SAE. Congenital anomalies or birth defects, as defined by the ‘serious ’ criterion above (see 
definitions Section 7.7.1.1 ) should be reported a s SAEs.  
As part of the study, all pregnancies will be monitored for the full duration and all perinatal 
and neonatal outcomes should be reported. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 
8 weeks.  
Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The observation of th e critical importance of altered liver function has been referred to 
informally as Hy ’s Law (Reuben 2004 ). Hy’s Law can be used to estimate severity and the 
likelihood that a study drug may cause an increased incidence of severe hepatotoxicity.  
The absence of hepatotoxicity in clinical trials provides a limited predictive value for 
potential hepatotoxicity in the clinical setting(s) being studied. However, finding 1 Hy ’s Law 
case in clinical trials is ominous; finding 2 cases is highly predictiv e of a potential for severe 
DILI.  
Definition  
Briefly, potential Hy ’s Law cases include the following 3 components:  
1. Aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) elevation >3 x ULN  
AND  
2. Total bilirubin >2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (i.e., elevated se rum 
alkaline phosphatase),  
AND  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or 
acute liver disease, or the administration of other d rug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 79 of 157 Reporting Requirements  
Any potential Hy ’s Law case should be handled as a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (SUSAR) associated with the use of the drug and reported promptly to 
the Sponsor.  
Reporting should include all available information and should initiate close follow -up until 
complete resolution of the problem and completion of all attempts to obtain supplementary 
data.  
Follow -up for Abnormal Laboratory Results Suggesting Potential DILI  
In general, an i ncrease of serum ALT or AST to >3 x ULN should be followed by repeat 
testing within 48 to 72 hours of serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, 
to confirm the abnormalities and to determine whether they are worsening.  
Appropriate medical a ssessment should be initiated to investigate potential confounding 
factors and alternative causes of hepatotoxicity. During this investigation, consider 
withholding study drug.  
7.7.1.3  Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The safety repo rting period for all AEs and SAEs is from study Day 1 (predose) through the 
EOT visit, or 30  days after the last study treatment (brentuximab vedotin [all parts], 
dacarbazine [Part B], or bendamustine [Part C]), or 100 days after the last nivolumab dose 
(Part D), whichever is later. However, all study protocol -related AEs are to be collected from 
the time of informed consent. All SAEs that occur after the safety reporting period and are 
considered related to any component of study treatment in the opinion o f the investigator 
should also be reported to the sponsor.  
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator, the 
patient  dies or withdraws consent, or study closure. All non -serious AEs will be followed 
through the safety reporting period. Certain non -serious AEs of interest may be followed 
until resolution, return to baseline, or study closure.  
7.7.1.4  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting  
Within 24 hours of observing or learning of an SAE, investigators are to report the event to 
the sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen.  
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to  be recorded on an SAE form. At a 
minimum, the following should be included:  
● Patient  number  
● Date of event onset  
● Description of the event  
● Study treatment, if known  
 
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 80 of 157 The completed SAE form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet are to be emailed or faxed to the 
sponsor ’s Drug Safety Department (see email address or fax number included on the SAE 
report form) within 24 hours.  
Relevant follow -up information is to be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes 
available.  
7.7.1.5  Sponsor Safety Reporting Requirements in the US  
According to the final rule amending the IND safety reporting requirements under 21  CFR 
312.32 and the FDA final guidance Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies (December 2012), endpoints that assess 
disease -related mortality or major morbidity as well other SAEs that are not study endpoints, 
but are known consequences of the underlying disease or condition that are anticipated to 
occur in the study population should not be reported to the FDA as individual IND saf ety 
reports.  
For Parts A, B, C, and D of this study, the SAEs that do not require individual IND safety 
reports are disease progression. For Parts E and F, disease progression is not reported as an 
AE and will be monitored as an efficacy endpoint. Therefor e, disease progression will not be 
reported as an individual IND safety report to the FDA. Other SAEs that are anticipated to 
occur in the study population including Parts A, B, C, D, E, and F will be submitted to the 
FDA as individual IND safety reports p er the IND safety reporting final rule.  
These safety reporting requirements apply only to the process by which the sponsor reports 
SAEs to the FDA. Investigators are required to report all SAEs, including anticipated SAEs, 
to the sponsor. In addition, the  sponsor will report all SAEs to international authorities as 
required per local regulatory reporting requirements.  
7.7.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following laboratory assessments will be performed by local laboratories at scheduled 
time points (see Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C) during the course of the study:  
● The chemistry panel is to include the following tests: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, chloride, potassium, sodium, 
total bilirubin, and glucose . 
○ LDH, phosphorus, and uric acid will also be obtained as part of the chemistry 
panel. Lipase will be obtained for patient s in Parts C and D only. For Part  D only, 
amylase will be obtained as well as TSH, free T3, and free T4.  
● The CBC with differential is to include the following tests: white blood cell  (WBC)  
count with five -part differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
and basophils), red blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin/hematocrit.  
● Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (at baseline only).  
● Hepatitis B and C serologies; if hepatitis C serology is positive, hepatitis C virus 
RNA test by PCR is required to confirm (Parts D, E, and F only).  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 81 of 157 ● For Parts E and F only, the eGFR should be calculated using the MDRD equation as 
applicabl e, with Scr reported in mg/dL:  
○ eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)=175 x (Scr)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x 
(1.212 if African American)  
○ If Scr is reported in µmol/L, the value should be converted to mg/dL using the 
conversion factor 0.011312 µmol/L to mg/dL . 
7.7.3  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations should include assessments of the following body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs, neck, and neurological. Height is to be measured; 
measurements obtained within the prior 12 months may be  utilized. Vital signs should also 
be recorded at each physical examination (Part D only).  
7.8 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007 ) and th e Lugano 
Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non -Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas 
(Cheson 2014 ) will be employed to evaluate tumor lesion size in the determin ation of 
response rate in this study. Tumor imaging at the specified intervals is consistent with 
general oncological practice and appropriately balances measurement of tumor control with 
the expense and patient  inconvenience associated with CT and PET sca nning.  
The safety measures that will be used in this trial are considered standard procedures for 
evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications. AEs and, when applicable, 
clinical laboratory data will be graded using NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  
Immunogenicity is commonly assessed for biologics; therefore, standard tests will be 
performed to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to brentuximab vedotin (all 
parts) and nivolumab (Part D only). PK assessments for drug activity and biom arker 
assessments are also common in clinical studies.

8.1 Site Training and Monitoring Procedures  
A study manual with instructions for study compliance and CRF completion will be 
provided. Prior to the enrollment of patient s at the site, Seattle Genetics or its designated 
clinical and medical personnel will review the following items with the investigator and 
clinic staff:  
● The protocol, study objectives, eligibility requirements, study procedures, registration 
and wit hdrawal processes  
● Current Investigator ’s Brochure/package insert  
● Recording and reporting AE and SAE  
● Enrollment goals and study timelines  
● The CRF completion process and source documentation requirements  
● Monitoring requirements  
● Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) review and 
approval process  
● Informed consent process  
● Good Clinical Practice guidelines and related regulatory documentation requirements  
● Key study team roles and responsibilities

keeping  
● Patient  coding and randomization (if applicable)  
● Study samples/specimen collection, handling and shipping  
● Protocol compliance  
● Clinical study record keeping, document retention, and administrative req uirements  
 
Monitoring visits will occur periodically, with frequency dependent on the rate of enrollment 
and workload at each site. During monitoring visits, the Seattle Genetics representative will 
review regulatory documentation, CRFs, source documentati on, and investigational product 
storage, preparation, and accountability. The CRFs will be reviewed for completeness, 
adherence to the provided guidelines, and accuracy compared to the source documents. The 
investigators must ensure that the monitor is all owed to inspect all source documents 
pertinent to study patient s, and must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
noted in the course of the trial are resolved. The investigator must maintain a comprehensive 
and centralized filing system of  all study -related documentation that is suitable for inspection 
by Seattle Genetics or its designated monitors and by quality assurance auditors, FDA 
representatives, EMA representatives, or representatives of other regulatory agencies.  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 83 of 157 8.2 Data Management Pr ocedures  
Seattle Genetics will provide CRF Completion Guidelines for electronic CRF data entry. 
Study -specific data management procedures will be maintained in the data management plan. 
Queries resulting from edit checks and/or data verification procedures  will be posted 
electronically in the electronic CRF.  
8.3 Access to Source Data  
The investigator will permit the sponsor ’s representatives to monitor the study as frequently 
as the sponsor deems necessary to determine that protocol adherence and data recording  are 
satisfactory. Appropriate measures to protect patient  confidentiality are to be employed 
during monitoring. The CRFs and related source documents will be reviewed in detail by the 
monitor at each site visit. Original source documents or certified copi es are needed for 
review. This review includes inspection of data acquired as a requirement for participation in 
this study and other medical records as required to confirm information contained in the 
CRFs, such as past history, secondary diagnoses, disea se assessment records, AEs, and 
concomitant medications. Other study records, such as correspondence with the sponsor and 
the IRB/IEC and screening and drug accountability logs will also be inspected. All source 
data and study records must also be availabl e for inspection by representatives of regulatory 
authorities . 
8.4 Accuracy and Reliability of Data  
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include:  
● The selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers.  
● Review of prot ocol procedures with the investigators and associated personnel prior 
to the study.  
● Periodic monitoring visits by the designated monitor(s).  
● CRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the designated monitor(s) 
during monitoring visits to the st udy centers. Any discrepancies will be resolved with 
the investigator or designees as appropriate.  
8.5 Quality Assurance Procedures  
The Research and Development Quality group or its designee may conduct audits at the 
clinical site or other study -related facili ties and organizations. Audit reports will be retained 
by the Research and Development Quality group of Seattle Genetics as part of the written 
record.

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 84 of 157 8.6 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.6.1  Data Handling  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure the acc uracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports. Data 
reported on the CRF that is derived from source documents should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. Any change or correction to a 
CRF will be maintained in an audit trail within the electronic data capture system.  
The investigator should retain records of the changes and corrections, written and/or 
electronic.  
Data handling procedure s for this trial have been designed to permit data changes so that they 
are documented by an audit trail. Data changes may only be made by those individuals so 
authorized.

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 85 of 157 9 DATA AN ALYSIS METHODS  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Parts A, B, C and D of this study will evaluate whether the ORR (CR + PR) for single -agent 
brentuximab vedotin or brentuximab vedotin in combination with dacarbazine, 
bendamustine, or nivolumab is >25% using a single -arm study design. The objective of 
Parts  A to D is to be able to detect an ORR of at least 25%, which is considered to show 
minimal clinical benefit given that the patient population may not have other options for 
initial conventional chemotherapy.  
For Parts A, B, and C of the study, disease response and progression will be assessed using 
the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007 ). For Part D of the 
study, disease response will be assessed using the Lugano cri teria (Cheson 2014 ) and LYRIC 
(Cheson 2016 ). For Parts A, B, C, and D, PD also includes clinical disease progression per 
investigator. For Parts E and F of the study, disease response will be assessed using the 
Lugano Classifica tion Revised Staging System for nodal non -Hodgkin and Hodgkin 
lymphomas (Cheson 2014 ). For Parts E and F, the assessment will be per BICR.  
With 30 patient s for Part A  and an overall significance level of 0.1, observing 13 or more 
objective responses (43% ORR [lower limit of exact 90% CI: 27.87%]) would allow us to 
reject the null hypothesis and claim that the true ORR is >25%. Similarly, with a sample size 
of 20  patien ts for Part B and an overall significance level of 0.1, observing 9 or more 
objective responses (45% ORR [lower limit of exact 90% CI: 25.87%]) would allow us to 
reject the null hypothesis and claim that the true ORR is >25%. For Part C, approximately 
30 patient s will be enrolled, with at least 20  patient s treated using the lower starting dose of 
bendamustine (70  mg/m2) combined with 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin. Using this sample 
size of 20  patient s included in the analysis for Part C and an overall significance level of 0.1, 
observing 9 or more objective responses (45% ORR [lower limit of exact 90% CI: 25.87%]) 
in this group would allow us to reject the null hypothesis and claim that the true ORR i s 
>25%. An analysis will also be performed for all 30 patient s in Part C. With the assumption 
of a true ORR of 75%, Parts A, B, and C of the study will have over 90% power (nQuery). 
For Part D, with a sample size of 20 patient s and an overall significance level of 0.1, 
observing 9 or more objective responses (45% ORR [lower limit of exact 90% CI: 25.87%]) 
would allow us to reject the null hypothesis and claim that the true ORR is >25%.  
Part E (the classical HL cohort) is designed to estimate the ORR  at a r easonable level of 
precision. Approximately 50 patient s will be enrolled to ensure adequate data for safety and 
efficacy evaluation. If 35 responses are observed, the estimated ORR and the associated 
2-sided 95%  CI using the Clopper -Pearson method is 70% ( 95% CI: 55.4%, 82.1%) (Clopper 
1934 ). 
Part F (the PTCL cohort) is designed to estimate the ORR  at a reasonable level of precision. 
Approximately 50 patient s will be enrolled to ensure adequate data for safety and efficacy 
evaluation. Enrollment of patient s with sALCL will be capped at 50% of the total enrollment 
in Part F (approximately 25 patient s out of 50). If 25 responses are observed, the estimated 
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 86 of 157 ORR and the associated 2 -sided 95%  CI using the Clopper -Pearson method is 50% (95% CI:

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 88 of 157 9.3 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical and analytical plans presented below summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A change to the data analysis meth ods 
described in the protocol will require a protocol amendment only if it alters a principal 
feature of the protocol. The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock. Any changes to the 
methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified i n the clinical study report.  
9.3.1  General Considerations  
This is a phase 2, open -label study where for each part, the primary endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively . The secondary and additional endpoints will be analyzed and 
provided as supporting evidence  for the overall clinical benefit of brentuximab vedotin (and 
nivolumab for Part D).  
For each part, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum) will be used to describe continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages w ill 
be used to describe categorical variables. Summaries will be displayed separately for 
single -agent brentuximab vedotin and combination treatment.  
9.3.1.1  Randomization and Blinding  
Not applicable.  
9.3.1.2  Adjustments for Covariates  
Covariates such as risk factors will  be considered for adjustment in the association analyses.  
9.3.1.3  Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
With the exception of time -related endpoints, no imputation will be conducted for missing 
data unless otherwise specified in the SAP.  
For time -related endpoint s (e.g., duration of response, PFS, and OS, etc), patient s who have 
no specified event will be censored at the time of the last valid assessment of the endpoint(s).  
Patient s whose disease response cannot be assessed will be counted as non -responders.  
9.3.1.4  Multi center Studies  
Site-to-site variation will not be adjusted in the analyses.  
9.3.1.5  Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No multiple comparisons are planned. For retreatment patient s, the first treatment experience 
will be used in all analyses. Subsequent treatme nt experiences will be summarized 
separately.

For the purposes of this guidance, comp lete abstinence, if consistent with the patient ’s 
preferred lifestyle, is an acceptable form of contraception. Complete abstinence is defined as 
abstinence starting from the time of informed consent and continuing throughout the study 
and until the end of systemic exposure (at least 6 months after the final dose of study drug  or 
8 months following last dose of nivolumab in Part D ; see Section  4.1). 
Acceptable Methods for Highly Effective Birth Control (preventing conception)  
Patient s who are of childbearing potentiala or whose partners are of childbearing potentiala 
and who are sexually active in a way that could lead to pregnancy may choose any TWO of 
the following methods:  
● Hormonal methods of contraception (excluding progestin -only pills; method must be 
associated with inhibition of ovulation), unless contraindicated  
● Intrauterine device with failure rate <1%  
● Tubal ligation  
● Vasectomy (at least 90 day s from the date of surgery with a semen analysis 
documenting azoospermia)  
● Barrier method/s (male or female condom with or without spermicide, cervical cap 
with or without spermicide, diaphragm with or without spermicide)  
 
a A person of childbearing potential is defined as anyone born female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or has not 
completed menopause. Menopause is defined clinically a s 12 months of amenorrhea in a person born female over age 45 
in the absence of other biological, physiological, or pharmacological causes.

Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 126 of 157 APPENDIX J: OVERVIEW OF LYRIC CR ITERIA (PART D ONLY)  
If tumor flare or pseudo -progression is suspected, then a clinical response of IR should be 
reported based on LYRIC (Cheson 2016 ). 
Definition of Indeterminate Response  
• IR1:  An increase in overall tumor burden (as assessed by SPD) of ≥50% of up to 
6 measurable lesions in the first 12 weeks of therapy, without clinical 
deterioration . 
In general, patients should be experiencing clinical stability or improvement and 
must be able to tolerate continued treatment and not at risk of serious 
complication s should tumor growth occur. Symptoms related to tumor growth, 
such as pain at the tumor site or compression of adjacent structure, may not be 
considered as clinical deterioration in this context.  
• IR2:  Appearance of new lesions, or growth of 1 or more exis ting lesion(s) ≥50% at any 
time during treatment, occurring in the context of lack of overall progression 
(<50% increase) of overall tumor burden, as measured by SPD of up to 6 lesions 
at any time during treatment; and  
This may occur early or late in the t reatment course. A biopsy is strongly 
encouraged when a patient experiences this phenomenon. If the biopsy does not 
confirm the presence of viable tumor in the new or enlarging lesion(s), then the 
lesion(s) are not considered active disease and should not be used in subsequent 
SPD assessments.  
• IR3:  An increase in FDG uptake (using the 5 -Point Scale per the Deauville Criteria 
[Appendix  I]) of 1 or more lesion(s) without a con comitant increase in lesion size 
or number.  
Increased immune activity at the site of tumor may manifest as an increase in 
FDG uptake. Therefore, by itself changes in uptake should not trigger an 
assignment of PD. The magnitude of increase in uptake in an i mmune -mediated 
flare compared to that in true tumor progression is not yet known. It is important 
to investigate this finding, especially in conjunction with a biopsy (if possible) of 
the lesion in question, an increase in FDG avidity of 1 or more lesions suggestive 
of lymphoma, without a concomitant increase in size of those lesions meeting PD 
criteria does not constitute PD.  
It is possible that, at a single time point a patient could fulfill criteria for both IR1 or IR2 
AND IR3. For example, there could b e a new FDG -avid lesion in the absence of overall 
progression (IR2), and at the same time, increase in FDG uptake of a separate lesion (IR3). In 
such cases, the designation of IR1 or 2 should take priority (e.g., IR2 in the above example).  
 
Study SGN35 -015 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 13; 05 -May-2020  
Brentuximab vedotin  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 127 of 157 Follow -Up of Ind eterminate Response  
At 12 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated) after a response of IR is determined by the 
Investigator, repeat imaging is mandatory and PD must be confirmed or refuted based 
LYRIC follow -up criteria for IR. PD should be reported if t he SPD of the target lesion has 
increased further, with the considerations below:  
• In the case of IR1, the comparison should be between the first IR1 and the current SPD, 
with an increase of >10% constituting PD. In addition, there should be an increase of 
>5 mm (in either dimension) of at least 1 lesion for lesions <2  cm, and 10  mm for lesions 
>2 cm, to be consistent with the Lugano classification (Cheson 2014 ). If the target SPD 
increase is <10%, the response would still be categorized as IR1, and the patient could 
continue treatment until a subsequent scan shows either PD (>10% increase from first 
IR1 time point and an increase of >5mm in either dimension of a t least 1 lesion) or 
response (>50% decrease from baseline). In this situation, it is reasonable to repeat 
imaging in 4 –8 weeks to ensure absence of significant further increase.  
• In the case of IR2, the new or growing lesion(s) (unless biopsy proven to be benign) 
should be added to the target lesion(s), up to a total of no more than 6 total lesions. If the 
SPD of the newly defined set of target lesions has increased ≥50% from their nadir value 
(which may precede the IR time point), the patient should be con sidered to have PD.  
• In the case of IR3, since inflammatory responses may result in an increase in the 
standardized uptake value of a lesion, the patient will not be considered to have PD 
unless there is evidence of PD by an increase in lesion size or the d evelopment of new 
lesions, as noted above.

Section(s)  Change  Rationale  
Synopsis and 
Section  9.1 Added 10 patients to the number of 
planned patients for a total of 30  evaluable 
patients to be enrolled on this study.  To further characterize the safety and 
efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in this 
patient population.  
Synopsis and 
Section  7.2 Added clinical disease progression per 
investigator to the definition of 
progressive disease.  To specify that disease progression may 
be documented by either radiographic 
(Cheson 2007) or clinical evaluation.  
Sections 6.2, 6.3, 
and Appendix A  Expanded the window for the baseline CT 
and PET  scans.  To provide operational flexibility for sites 
to perform/collect CT and PET scans.  
Sections 6.2.1, 
6.3.1, 6.7, 7.6.2, 
and Appendix A  Specified for clarity that the lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphorus, and 
uric acid tests are to be included in the 
serum chemistry panel.  Clarification  
Sections 6.4, 6.5, 
and Appendix A  Added 2 additional days to the window for 
restage assessments and that restage 
assessments are to be completed prior to 
dosing for the subsequent treatment cycle.  Since each 21 -day cycle has a 2 -day 
window for dosing, adding 2 days to the 
window for restage assessments allows 
patients to be assessed in the appropriate 
time period.  
Section 7.6.1.2  Added reporting period for pregnancies 
occurring in a patient on study or the 
partner  of a male patient on study.  To ensure that all pregnancies occurring 
within 6 months of the last dose of study 
drug are reported.  
Section 9.3.1.2  Clarified that adjustments for covariates 
will be considered in the association 
analyses.  Clarification  
Section 9.3.1.3  Revised definition of patients who will be 
counted as non -responders.  Since the definition of progressive disease 
now includes clinical disease progression 
per investigator, only patients whose 
disease response cannot be assessed will 
be count ed as non -responders instead of 
patients who do not have post -baseline 
response assessments.  
Section 9.3.1.7  Redefined the per -protocol analysis set  To ensure that the per -protocol analysis 
set is defined as a subset of the efficacy -
evaluable analysis set  since the 
per-protocol analysis set will be used for 
efficacy analyses.  
Section 9.3.1.9  Changed ‘final’ analysis to ‘primary ’ 
analysis occurring when the last patient 
completes Cycle 8 restage.  Correction

criterion No. 6 footnote g (eGFR) and Clinical 
Laboratory Tests, as applicable:  
As determined by the Modification of Diet in 
Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation, an 
eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 and 
<50 mL/min/1.73m2 (Parts E and F only). The 
eGFR should be calculated using the MDRD

ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage  I uterine 
cancer.  
Section 7.7.1.2  The following language replaced the current 
language:  
Since progression of underlying malignancy is 
being assessed as an efficacy variable, it 
should not be reported as an AE or SAE. The 
terms “Disease Progression ”, “Progression of 
Disease ”, or “Malignant disease progression ” 
and other similar terms should no t be used to 
describe an AE or SAE. However, clinical 
symptoms of progression may be reported as 
AEs or SAEs if the symptom cannot be 
determined as exclusively due to progression 
of the underlying malignancy or does not fit 
the expected pattern of progress ion for the 
disease under study. In addition, complications 
from progression of the underlying malignancy 
should be reported AEs or SAEs.  FDA feedback that terms directly related 
to the underlying disease progression 
should be excluded from relevant safety  
analyses.  
Sections 9.1 and 
9.3.5.1  Added language to distinguish between the 
primary efficacy hypothesis for Parts A, B, C, 
D, and E versus Part F, including the following 
addition: Part F of this study will evaluate 
whether ORR for single -agent brentuxi mab 
vedotin is >20% using a single -arm study 
design. The hypothesis to be tested is H0: ORR 
≤0.20 versus H1: ORR >0.20.  To define the primary efficacy

size for each part of the study.  
Sections 9.3.1 and 
9.3.5.1  For Pa rts A, B, C, and D, no formal statistical 
hypothesis for primary efficacy endpoints will 
be performed. For Parts E and F, formal 
statistical inference will be conducted and 
include CIs and P values.  To update the formal statistical 
hypotheses to be perform ed for previous

and IADL scores) there is no need to 
limit the population to older patients, as 
all age groups can potentially have 
significant comorbidities.  
Synopsis, Sections 
3.1 and 4.1  Indicated that patients cannot be eligible for 
Parts E and F if they declined combination 
chemotherapy, as opposed to being unsuitable

treatment is initiated.  
Synopsis  Rearranged “Efficacy Assessments ” section.  To increase clarity regarding disease 
assessments in each study part.  
Synopsis, Sections 
9.3.1 and 9.3.5.1  Removed specification that formal statistical 
hypothesis testing and statistical inference will

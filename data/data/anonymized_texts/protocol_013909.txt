Exploratory Objectives  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 6 of 89 Methodology:  
Study EP-262-202 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PD of EP262 over 6 weeks in subjects with AD.  
The study includes a Screening Period of at least a week and up to 30 days to assess subject eligibility 
that includes collection of daily PP -NRS scores; a 6-w eek Double-Blind Trea tment Period; and a 
4-week Follow-Up Period after administration of the last dose of study drug for a total study duration 
of up to approximately 14 weeks for each subject . Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized  in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either a 150 mg dose of EP262 or placebo orally (PO), once daily (QD) during the 
6-week Double-Blind Tre atment Period.  
EP-262-202 Study Design 
 
PO = oral; QD = once daily.  
a Any subject who completes the Double -Blind Treatment Period or discontinues study drug (EP262 or placebo) 
early will have a Follow -Up Visit approxi mately 4 weeks (±3  days) after the last dose of study drug.  
Screening Period 
The Screening Period will consist of one visit (Visit 1). During this period, subjects will undergo assessments to determine study eligibility per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Visit 1 may be conducted over more than 1 day but must be completed between Day -30 and Day -7 (inclusive) to 
allow for collection of a baseline average PP -NRS score. Subjects are to use a protocol -permitted , 
non-urea-containing emollient on lesional and nonlesional skin daily for at least 1 week before Day 1 
and agree to continue using that same emollient daily at the same frequency (ideally once or twice 
daily) throughout the study . Subjects will record emollient use in a  daily diary  throughout the study. 
Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The Double-Blind Tr eatment Period will consist of 3 study visits (Visits 2, 3, and 4 [Day 1, Week 3, 
and Week 6]). During this period, all subjects who meet eligibility requirements will be enrolled into the study and will be randomized  on Visit 2 (Day 1), in a 2:1 ratio, to receive double-blind, PO , QD 
150 mg doses of EP262 or placebo for 6 weeks. Randomization will be conducted centrally via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). QD PO dosing of study drug should occur after at least a 
4 hour fast and administered at approximately the same time o f day. Subjects should refrain from 
eating for at least 2 hours postdose. The time and date of all dose administrations will be recorded in 
a daily  diary. The first dose of study drug will be administered at the clinical site on Visit 2 (Day 1) 
after all basel ine study procedures are completed. Visit 2 (Day 1) will not have a visit window; all 
other visits in the Double -Blind Treatment Perio d will have a visit window of ±3 days. Subjects who Enroll/Randomize

Study Drug Materials and Management:  
Study Drug  
Capsules containing 75 mg  of EP262 or placebo  will be supplied in bottles  in a manner to ensure the 
study blind. Each subject will t ake 2 capsules per  dose , with subjects randomized to EP262 receiving a 
total of 150 mg per day.  
Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug will be packaged into bottles with child -resistant caps, induction sealed,  labeled with a 
unique number, and supplied to clinical sites in a blinded manner.  
Study Drug Storage 
The study drug capsules  should be stored at controlled room temperature, 15°C to 25°C ( 59°F to 
77°F), with excursions up to 30°C (86°F). 
Study Drug Administration  
Each study drug dose is to be administered PO as intact capsules (swallowed whole, not split, opened, 
or chewed) and taken with approx imately  240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of  water  on an empty stomach . 
Subjects will be instructed to take the study drug at approximately the same time of the day after a fast of at least 4 hours. Subjects should refrain from eating for at least 2 hours postdose. On the days of 
clinic visits, the time of study drug administration may differ depending on the scheduled visit time. 
The first dose of study drug will be administered at the clinical site on Visit 2 (Day 1) after all baseline study procedures are completed.  
Study Drug Dispensing and Accountability 
Subjects will record self -administration of study drug daily in a dosing diary, which will be reviewed 
by clinical site staff at each clinic visit during th e Double -Blind Treatment P eriod following Visit 2. 
Subjects should be instructed to retain the study drug, including the study drug bottle, even if empty, 
and to return it and any remaining study drug to the clinical site during their next visit. The site staff 
should perform study drug accountability and, if applicable, follow-up with the subject to retrieve any 
remaining study drug that has not been returned. 
Key Study Procedures and Safety, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Baseline Characterization Assessments:  
At specific visits outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ), subjects will undergo safety, 
pharmacokinetic ( PK), PD, and baseline characterization assessments.  
Key Study Procedures 
Fasting Requirements 
Subjects should fast for at least 8 hours before study visits  that require a blood sample for assessment 
of clinical chemistry. Water is acceptable in the morning of clinic visits to ensure the subject is 
hydrated for laboratory sample collection. Subjects  should fast at least 4 hours before administration of 
each dose of study drug and refrain from eating for at least 2 hours postdose. Each dose of study drug 
is to be taken with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water on an empty stomach. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 11 of 89 Discontinuation of Study Drug  
For subjects who terminate treatment with study drug early , regardless of the reason,  every effort will 
be made to complete the early treatment  termination evaluations as soon as possible after the last dose 
of study drug, ideally within 2 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Whenever possible, subjects should remain in the study and complete the remaining study visits and 
assessments even when study drug has been discontinued. Subjects who discontinue study drug for any 
reason and continue with the study visits as planned thro ugh Visit 4  (Week 6) (participating only in PD 
and safety, but not PK measures) will participate in the Follow- Up Visit if the last dose of study drug 
was administered less than 4 weeks before Visit 4 (Week 6) to ensure that at least 4 weeks  of follow- up 
data are collected for all randomized subjects.  
If a subject discontinues study drug and chooses not to complete all of the remaining study visits, the subject should have the Early Treatment  Termination Visit conducted as soon as possible after the last 
dose of study drug, ideally within 2 days after the last dose of study drug, and a Follow- Up Visit 
approximately 4 weeks (±3  days) after the last dose of study drug if at least 4 weeks of follow -up data 
have not already been collected. If a subject fails to attend the Follow -Up Visit and has not withdrawn 
consent, all r easonable efforts will be made to contact the subject to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory 
health. All contacts and contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Rescue Medications 
New concomitant medications and procedures for treatment of AD  are prohibited during the study. If a 
patient requires treatment with a new medication or procedure due to intolerable AD symptoms, study 
drug should be discontinued. Whenever possible, subjects should remain in the study and complete the 
remaining study visits and assessments even when study drug has been discontinued.  
Safety Assessments
 
Safety evaluations, including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, medical history, vital 
signs, physical examinations, standard 12- lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations of safety will be 
performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessmen ts (Appendix A ).  
Adverse Event Collection  
AEs will be documented from the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) until the end of study participation.  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Skin swabs, skin sample collection via skin tape strip s, skin biopsies ,  
 and photographs of 
AD lesions and sites for skin swabs, skin tape strips application , and biops ies will be performed as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix A ). It is preferred that the skin swab, tape strips, 
and biopsies (if applicable) come from the same lesion, if lesion size permits, or from a similar lesion 
in the same anatomical area.  
Examples  of the patient -reported assessments are provided in the appendices but are not to be 
distributed to subjects for completion. Subjects will be trained on completion of all patient -reported 
assessments using a study- issued electronic device or application (app).  
Skin Swabs 
A cotton swab will be passed along the lesional skin of the area of worst involvement at Screening. 
The skin swab will be placed in aerobic culture and analyzed for the presence of Staphylococcus 
aureus  (S. aureus ). At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Day 1, Week 3, and Week 6), skin swabs will be collected 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 12 of 89 from the same lesional site, even if the lesion has cleared, for assessment of . 
Skin swabs are to be collected before skin tape strips application and biopsies when performed on the 
same day.  
Skin Tape Strips 
Commercially available adhesive sheets will be applied on the surface of the skin at predefined areas. 
This procedure will be repeated up to 20 times sequentially on the same area to collect samples from 
the stratum corneum for  proteomic assessment. Skin tape strips will be applied to AD lesional skin on 
Visits 2, 3, and 4 ( Day 1 , Week 3, and Week 6, same location, even if the lesion has cleared), and at a 
nonlesional site at Visit 2 (Day 1).  
Skin Punch Biopsies  
Two 4.0- mm skin biopsies will be collected on Visit 2 (Day 1), one from lesional skin and one from 
nonlesional skin in the vicinity of the lesional skin, and one 4.0- mm skin biopsy will be collected on 
Visit 4 ( Week 6) from the same lesional skin , at least 1 cm away from the previous scar, even if the 
lesions have cleared. The effect of EP262 on the gene expression signature and skin histology 
(epidermal thickness, immune cell infiltration, markers of epidermal proliferation)  will be evaluated  
via histology, immunohistochemistry , and transcriptomics. The location of the biops ies will be 
1 to 2 cm away from  where the skin tape strips were applied , when both are to be performed on the 
same day . If it is not possible to collect the biopsy sample from the same lesion as the tape strips, it 
should be collected from a similar lesion in the same anatomical area.

ographs of AD Area 
Representative photographs will be taken of the area of worst lesional involvement at Visit 2 (Day 1) 
and of the same area at Visit 3 ( Week 3 ), Visit 4 ( Week 6 ), and Visit 5 (Follow- Up). Photographs will 
also be taken of areas selected  for skin swabs, skin tape strip s application , and biops ies before these 
procedures are conducted.

Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 14 of 89 Baseline Characterization  
A blood sample will be collected at Visit 2 (Day 1) for measurement of  house dust mite  
(HDM) -specific IgE . 
Blood sample s will also be taken at Visit 2 (Day 1) for genotyping to evaluate UGT1A1 and filaggrin  
polymorphisms to  enable pharmacogenomic analyses.   
Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Blood sampling will be collected predose (as applicable)  at Visit 2 ( Day 1 ), and each visit thereafter to 
analyze trough EP262 concentrations. The EP262 metabolite profile may also be analyzed from these 
trough samples. 
Statistical Methods:  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for study outcome measures, as appropriate. Details will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Sample Size Considerations:  
No formal sample size calculation has been made. The sample size has been selected to provide 
adequate information on the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EP262 over 6 weeks.

Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 23 of 89 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Role of the MRGPRX2 Receptor in the Pathogenesis of Atopic 
Dermatitis 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by 
impaired barrier function, eczematous dermatitis, and chronic itch (Magnifico 2020, Yu 2021) . 
Skin thickening, lichenification of the skin from chronic scratching, erythema, and acute lesions may develop over time (Correale 1999 ). Disease symptoms are often exacerbated by external 
factors, including bacterial colonization on the skin, various environmental stimuli including heat 
and sweating, as well as exposure to aeroallergens such as house dust mites (HDM s). In addition 
to these external factors, impaired epidermal skin barrier function  is believed to be an important 
factor in the pathogenesis of AD, including genetic mutations in filaggrin, decreased filaggrin expression, and dysregulation of the immune system leading to cellular infiltrates including 
dendritic cells, type 2 T helper cells (Th2), and eosinophils in the skin. The prevalence of AD in adults has been estimated to be 7% to 10% in the United States ( US) and 4.4% to 7.1% in Europe 
(Eckert 2019, Hadi 2021) . 
The mas -related G  protein-coupled receptor ( MRGPR ) family is comprised of 8 human Class A 
rhodopsin- like G -protein coupled receptors (MRGPRX1-X4 and D-G) that can sense noxious 
stimuli and appear to have a role in innate immunity. MRGPRX2 is predominantly expressed in mast cells and has been shown to induce degranulation upon binding to a wide variety of agonists ( Subramanian 2016, Corbiere 2021) . MRGPRX2 has been shown to mediate 
immunoglobulin E ( IgE)-independent activation of mast cells, including degranulation and 
regulation of inflammatory processes. Activation of MRGPRX2 triggers release of proinflammatory mediators and a multicellular signaling cascade that likely plays a key role in 
multiple human diseases involving clinically relevant mast cell activation  (Babina 2020, 
Thapaliya 2021), including AD. 
Mast cells and MRGPRX2 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD in both clinical 
and preclinical studies. A significant association has been observed between the number of mast 
cells in AD skin lesions and the disease severity (assessed by the Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI] score) ( Simon 2004) . Increased expression of the MRGPRX2 agonist substance P, 
as well as MRGPRX2, has been reported in itchy AD patient skin versus non-itchy skin samples  
(Nattkemper 2018, Youngblood 2020) . In addition to substance P, MRGPRX2 is also activated 
by multiple eosinophil granule proteins, including major basic protein and eosinophil cationic 
protein fragments. Elevated levels of these peptides in serum of patients with AD have been 
reported and are correlated to severity of disease ( Kapp 1991, Morita 1995, Ogasawara 2020 , 
Deeks 2021) . An attenuated phenotype has been shown in Mrgprb2 knockout mice (the murine 
homolog of MGRPRX2) i n a preclinical model of AD induced by treatment with delta -toxin, an 
MRGPRX2 agonist released by Staphylococcus aureus  (S. aureus ), and HDM extract  including a 
reduction in Th2 cytokines, improved epidermal integrity, improved clinical scores, and reduced 
local skin inflammation ( Serhan 2019) . This reduction of phenotype in Mrgprb2 knockout mice 
was also observed in other models of dermatitis ( Green 2019, Meixiong 2019, Corbiere 2021) . 
Collectively, these findings point to a key role of MRGPRX2 in mediating IgE -independent mast 
cell activation  and skin inflammation, mak ing this receptor a promising novel target for AD as 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 24 of 89 well as numerous urticarial, inflammatory , and pain conditions that are precipitated by 
degranulation of mast cells and  not adequately addressed by available treatments.  
5.2. EP262 and Study Rationale  
EP262 is a potent small-molecule antagonist of the human MRGPRX2 receptor under 
development as an orally ( PO) administered therapy for AD and chronic spontaneous urticaria.  
Results from Study EP- 262-101, a first- in-human randomized, Phase 1 clinical study of single 
and multiple daily PO  doses of EP262 or placebo in 64 healthy subjects, have provided 
information on the safety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of EP262. Study EP-262-101 
also included an initial food effect evaluation. Thirty healthy subjects received a single 50, 150, 400, 800, or 1200 mg dose of EP262. Eighteen  subjects received 50, 150, or 300 mg as a 
multiple dose regimen  over 7 days. 
All doses evaluated were well tolerated with no dose- limiting  adverse events ( AEs), early 
terminations due to AEs, moderate or severe AEs, or serious AEs (SAEs) reported  with EP262. 
No adverse trends in safety laboratory measures, vital signs, or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
parameter s have been observed . EP262 concentrations increased with increasing single doses in 
an approximately linear manner and modeling of single dose data predicted multiple dose concentrations.  
 
 
 
 
 
E
P262 was evaluated in MRGPRX2 knock-in mice expressing the human receptor in a 
translational model of AD induced by cutaneous exposure to HDM extracts and S. aureus  
Enterotoxin Type B (SEB). In initial experiments, daily PO administration of EP262 
significantly attenuated the development of AD relative to vehicle controls as measured by visual 
scoring, tissue measurements, and histopathology following exposure to HDM/SEB ( Wollam 
2023) . As a proof-of-concept study, Study EP-262-202 aims to confirm these findings in human 
disease, focusing on mechanistic measures and objective assessments of early changes in lesional AD skin. Study EP -262-202 will evaluate the safety, tolerability , and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
EP262 over 6 weeks of treatment in subjects with AD. The 6 -week treatment duration is 
supported by the 6-week GLP toxicology program and deemed sufficient to demonstrate changes in PD measures and to provide trends in efficacy based  on the anticipated rapid onset of action of 
EP262 to directly block activation of MRGPRX2. 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EP262 in patients with AD, 
which will be measured by type, frequency, and severity of treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), 
and change from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory parameters. In addition to 
evaluations of safety and tolerability, changes in differentially expressed genes from biopsies of 
lesional skin relative to nonlesional skin will be assessed before and after treatment. The effect of EP262 on AD skin lesions will also be assessed via histology, including examinations of 
epidermal thickness, immune cell infiltration, and markers of epidermal proliferation and skin 
barrier integrity. Notably, early transcriptomic and histologic changes in lesional skin have been 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 25 of 89 demonstrated to correspond with improvements in clinical scores (Hamilton 2014, Bissonnette 
2019, Pavel 2019) , potentially serving as initial indicators of treatment response.  
Disease severity will be evaluated  
 Although the 
study is not powered to detect significant changes in these clinical scores versus placebo, they 
are included to assess trends in improvement and enable analyses of the correlation between transcriptomic and clinical changes . Additionally, pruritus, disease control, and quality of life 
will be evaluated through the  
. Other exploratory 
analyses include  
 
  
The study will be randomized to ensure random allocation of subjects to treatment arms and 
reduce bias. Because several of the PD  assessments have a high degree of subjectivity, the study 
will be double-blinded. In addition, a placebo-controlled design will be used to control for 
confounding factors, such as potential Investigator bias, and to ensure that the statistical procedures can be appropriately applied.  
5.3. EP262 Dose Rationale  
The 150 mg EP262 dose level to be evaluated in Study EP-262-202 was selected based on a variety of factors to maximize efficacy without adversely impacting safety , including results 
from nonclinical pharmacology studies, nonclinical toxicology studies, and results from Study EP -262-101, a Ph ase 1 first in human clinical study in healthy subjects.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 26 of 89 5.4. Summary of Benefits and Risks  
5.4.1. Benefit Summary  
While it is currently uncertain whether patients with AD will benefit from treatment in this study, 
nonclinical in vitro and in vivo data, as well as  scientific publications implicating MRGPRX2 as 
a mediator of mast cell degranulation and associated inflammation  (Kapp 1991, Morita 1995, 
Nakamura 2013, Azimi 2017, Nattkemper 2018, Green 2019, Meixiong 2019, Serhan 2019, Ogasawara 2020 , Wang 2020, Youngblood 2020, Corbiere 2021) , provide compelling support 
that EP262 has the potential to be an effective treatment for patients with AD . 
5.4.2. Risk Summary  
The doses evaluated in Study EP -262-101 were well tolerated with no dose- limiting  AEs, early 
terminations due to AEs, moderate or severe AEs, or S AEs reported  with EP262. Additionally, 
no adverse trends in safety laboratory measures, vital signs, or ECGs were observed.  
In conventional nonclinical safety assessments, no adverse toxicological findings were observed 
at plasma concentrations well above those estimated to be required for robust pharmacologic 
activity.

itigation Strategy 
For this initial clinical proof -of-concept study, subjects with clinically significant co -morbidities 
such as hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular disease will be excluded.  
Routine safety measures have been incorporated into the protocol, including AE reviews, vital 
sign and 12-lead ECG assessments, and laboratory evaluations, including monitoring of bilirubin 
and management of liver test abnormalities  (Section  11.10.3).  
5.4.4. Ov
erall Benefit:Risk Conclusion  
Overall, the clinical and  nonclinical experience to date with EP262 suggests minimal risk to 
subjects participating in Study EP-262-202. Importantly, there is a clear unmet need for novel 
treatment options for AD . The first -line therapeutic approach for management of AD includes a 
combination of emollients, antibiotics, anti-pruritic, and topical anti- inflammatory therapies  
(Sahni 2022) . Dupilumab and tralokinumab, injectable monoclonal antibodies  that block receptor 
binding of interleukin ( IL)-4 and/or IL-13 (reducing Th2 response), ha ve been approved for the 
treatment of moderate -to-severe AD as second -line therapy (Tameez Ud Din 2020, Blair 2022) . 
Oral j anus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (abrocitinib and upadacitinib) hav e recently been approved 
for treatment of  AD, but ha ve several serious side effects and are indicated as third -line therapy 
only (in adults with refractory, moderate- to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately 
controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 28 of 89 is inadvisable) ( Mikhaylov 2023) . I f determined to be effective, EP262 may ultimately have the 
potential to offer a much -needed additional treatment option for patients with  AD.

Exploratory Objectives  
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
Study EP -262-202 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, pl acebo -controlled  study to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, and PD of EP262 over 6 weeks in subjects with AD.  
The study includes a Screening Period of at least a week and up to 30 days to assess subject 
eligibility that includes collection of daily PP -NRS scores ; a 6-week Double- Blind Treatment 
Period; and a 4- week Follow -Up Period after administration of the last dose of study drug for a 
total study duration of up to approximately 14 weeks for each subject  (Figure 1). Approximately 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 29 of 89 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a 150 mg dose of EP262 or placebo 
PO, once daily ( QD) during the 6- week Double- Blind Treatme nt Period. 
Figure 1: EP-262-202 Study Design 
 
PO = oral; QD = once daily.  
a Any subject who completes the Double -Blind Treatm ent Period or discontinues study drug (EP262 or placebo) 
early will have a Follow -Up Visit approxim ately 4 weeks (±3 da ys) after the last dose of study drug.  
7.1.1. Screening Period  
The Screening Period will consist of one visit (Visit 1). During this period, subjects will undergo assessments to determine study eligibility per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Visit 1 may be conducted over more than 1 day but must be completed between Day -30 and Day -7 (inclusive) 
to allow for collection of a baseline average PP -NRS score. Subjects are to us e a protocol-
permitted , non- urea-containing emollient on lesional and nonlesional skin daily for at least 
1 week before Day 1 and agree to continue using that same emollient daily at the same frequency (ideally once or twice daily) throughout the study. Subjects will record emollient use in a  daily 
diary  throughout the study. 
7.1.2. Double -Blind Treatment Period  
The Double-Blind Treatment Period will consist of 3 study visits (Visits 2, 3, and 4 [Day 1, 
Week 3, and Week 6]). During this period, all subjects who meet eligibility requirements will be 
enrolled into the study and will be randomized on Visit 2 (Day 1), in a 2:1 ratio, to receive 
double-blind, PO, QD 150 mg doses of EP262 or placebo for 6 weeks. Randomization will be 
conducted centrally via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). QD PO dosing of study 
drug should occur after at least a 4 hour fast and administered at approximately the same time of day. Subjects should refrain from eating for at least 2 hours postdose. The time and date of all 
dose administrations will be recorded in a daily diary. The first dose of study drug will be 
administered at the clinical site on Visit 2 (Day 1) after all baseline study procedures are completed. Visit 2 (Day 1) will not have a visit window; all other visits in the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period will have a visit window of ±3 days. Subjects who discontinue from treatment 
early should have the Early Treatment  Termination Visit conducted as soon as possible after the 
last dose of study drug, ideally within 2 days after the last dose of study drug.  Enroll/Randomize

(CTCAE) Grade 2 or higher in the Cardiac Disorders System Organ Class ( SOC ), Grade 2 or 
higher in  CTCAE terms of Bone marrow hypocellular, Lymphocyte count decreased, 
Lymphocyte count increased, or Myelodysplastic syndrome, or Grade 3 or higher in other SOCs, the study drug must be discontinued. AE grading for severity using CTCAE criteria is described in Section  11.1.2 and determination of AE causality is described in Section  11.1.3.  
For subjects who terminate treatment with study drug early, regardless of the reason, every effort 
will be made to complete the early treatment  termination evaluations as soon as possible after the 
last dose of study drug, ideally within 2 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Whenever possible, subjects should remain in the study and complete the remaining study visits 
and assessments even when study drug has been discontinued. Subjects who discontinue study drug for any reason and continue with the study visits as planned through Visit 4 (Week 6) 
(participating only in PD  and safety , but not PK mea sures) will participate in the Follow -Up 
Visit if the last dose of study drug was administered less than 4 weeks before Visit 4 (Week 6) to 
ensure that at least 4 weeks of follow-up data are co llected for all randomized subjects.  
If a subject discontinues study drug and chooses not to complete all of the remaining study visits, the subject should have the Early Treatment  Termination Visit conducted as soon as possible 
after the last dose of study drug, ideally within 2 days after the last dose of study drug, and a 
Follow-Up Visit approximately 4 weeks (±3  days) after the last dose of study drug if at least 
4 weeks  of follow -up data have not already been collected. If a subject fails to attend the 
Follow- Up Visit and has not withdrawn consent, all reasonable efforts will be made to contact 
the subject to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health. All contacts and contact  attempts must 
be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
8.5.2. Discontinuation from the Study  
Subjects may discontinue from the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
• Death  
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor or at the request of a regulatory agency or an 
IRB or IEC  (Section  7.6) 
• Other  
A subject may elect to discontinue study participation at any time for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. If a subject withdraws 
consent, no further evaluation should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 37 of 89 consent. The Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to document the specific reason why 
consent was withdrawn.  
9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1. Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 30 subjects with AD will be randomized in a 2:1  ratio to receive either  a 150 mg 
dose of EP262 or placebo PO, QD during the 6-week Double-Blind Tr eatment Period . 
9.2. Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator should assess the subject’s compliance with dosing of study drug by counting 
returned study drug capsules  and reviewing the subject’s dosing diary  as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ).  
If the Investigator has concerns about a subject’s dosing compliance, the Investigator should discuss this with the subject, assess the reasons for noncompliance and the likelihood that the 
subject will remain noncompliant, and notify the Sponsor accordingly. 
9.3. Randomization and Blinding  
9.3.1. Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a 150 mg dose of EP262 or placebo PO, QD for 6 weeks during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period beginning at Visit 2 (Day 1). 
Randomization will be conducted centrally via an IWRS. The master randomization list will be kept secured until the study blind is broken at the end of study. 
Subjects who withdraw for any reason without completing all screening evaluations successfully 
will be considered “screening failures”. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from 
regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAEs.  
9.3.2. Blinding  
The Sponsor, Medical Monitor, Contract Research Organization (CRO) staff, Investigators, site 
staff, and subjects will be blinded to subject’s assigned treatment until the database is locked 
except for CRO or vendor staff involved in the analysis of PK samples. Procedures for emergency unblinding and unblinding for regulatory reporting are described in Section  9.3.2.1 
and Section  9.3.2.2, respectively . 
9.3.2.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If an emergency unblinding during the Double- Blind Treat ment Period is required, the subject’s 
treatment assignment may be unblinded through IWRS by the Investigator. If a treatment assignment is unblinded, the subject will be discontinued from randomized treatment.
 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 38 of 89 Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety and 
when knowledge of the treatment assignment will impact the clinical management of the subject. 
Every reasonable attempt should be made to complete the post- treatment evaluation procedures 
prior to unblinding as knowledge of the treatment arm could influence subject assessment.  
In all emergency cases, the reasons and rationale for unblinding will be documented in writing 
and maintained in the study file. 
9.3.2.2. Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting 
Access to randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignment will be made available 
through the IWRS system to the appropriate individual(s) responsible for unblinding suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions for reporting to the Regulatory A uthorities.  
9.4. Study Visits 
Subjects should fast for at least 8 hours before study visits  that require a blood sample for 
assessment of clinical chemistry. Water is acceptable in the morning of clinic visits to ensure the subject is hydrated for laboratory sample collection. Subjects  should fast at least 4 hours before 
administration of each dose of study drug and refrain from eating for at least 2 hours postdose. 
Each dose of study drug is to be taken with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water on 
an empty stomach . 
Study procedures are listed for each visit in the following sections and summarized in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ). Further details regarding safety,  PD, baseline 
characterization , and PK assessments are located in Sections  11, 12, 13, and 14, respectively.

The site  staff will maintain a full record of study drug accountability as described in 
Section  10.5.  
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 44 of 89 Upon completion of the study, used and unused study drug and study drug bottles are to be 
returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or, if prior Sponsor approval is obtained, disposed of in 
accordance with applicable site procedures. Site  staff must maintain documentation of any 
missing or unreturned study drug. The final disposition of all study drug received at the site is to be documented. 
10.7. Product Quality Complaints  
A product quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspicion of a product defect or deficiency related to manufacturing, labeling, or packaging (ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product, including its 
labeling or package integrity). A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection  of subjects.
 
All initial PQCs must be reported to the Sponsor or CRO by clinical -site personnel within 
24 hours after being made aware of the potential defect. Whenever possible, the associated 
product should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pending further guidance 
from the Sponsor.  
11. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety evaluations, including AEs, concomitant medications, medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, standard 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations of safety will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ). 
11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a cli nically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
Medical conditions present at baseline that worsen in severity or frequency after exposure to study drug are considered TEAEs. A TEAE is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with the study drug but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and 
then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated). Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an 
illness or a disease that existed before administration of study drug, and for which the condition 
has not worsened since starting study drug, are not to be considered TEAEs/treatment- emergent 
SAEs. Events with emergency room visits that are less than 24 hours will also not be considered SAEs unless they meet one of the criteria listed in Section  11.2.1. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 45 of 89 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG assessments, or vital sign results 
may constitute an AE if they meet one of the criteria listed in Section  11.1.4.1. However, 
whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in lieu of associated abnormal 
results. Abnormalities deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator should not be reported as A Es. 
11.1.2. Determining Severity of Adverse Events  
AEs must be graded for severity (ie, intensity) using CTCAE, version 5.0 ( HHS 2017) . A 
severity category of mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death, as defined in Appendix B , 
must be entered on the AE eCRF. The criteria below are to  be used for determining the severity 
of AEs where there is no actual CTCAE  term for the specific reported AE found in the CTCAE, 
version 5.0 guideline ( Appendix B ). It should be noted that the term “severe” used to grade 
intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious”. The assessment of severity is made regardless of the relationship to study drug or of the seriousness of the AE. When reporting AEs, reference should be made to the CTCAE manual for guidance on appropriate grading.  
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
(eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money). 
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling, limiting selfcare activities of daily life (eg, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, not bedridden). 
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
11.1.3. Determining Causality of Adverse Events  
Causality refers to the relationship of the event to the study drug (EP262 or placebo) . The 
Investigator will assess the causality of the event according to the following criteria: 
• Not related – A reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the study drug. 
• Related  – A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
study drug, which may or may not reasonably have been produced by a number of 
other factors including underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatments; and/or that could not be reasonably explained by other factors 
such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent 
treatments; and/or disappears or d ecreases on cessation or reduction in study drug 
dose; and/or reappears or worsens when the study drug is administered. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 46 of 89 11.1.4. Recording Adverse Events  
All A Es must be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs provided by the Sponsor 
from the signing of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) until the end of study participation. AE s 
will be assessed for likelihood of causal relationship to the study drug (EP262 or placebo) and 
severity.  
The new onset of signs, symptoms, or other findings that occur before signing of the ICF will be 
captured as medical history (Section  11.3).  
11.1.4.1. Special Instructions for Recording Adverse Events in the eCRF  
Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the individual signs and symptoms (eg, record only hepatitis rather than elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and jaundice). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an SAE or AE on the eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up and should replace the individual signs and/or symptoms as the event term on the eCRF, unless the signs/symptoms are clinically significant. 
Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, A Es occurring secondary to other events (eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as an SAE or AE on the eCRF. However, medically significant A Es occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time 
should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe vomiting leads to acute renal failure, both events should be recorded on the eCRF. 
Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation 
timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the eCRF. If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded as a new AE on the eCRF.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation timepoints, and 
subsequently recurs. Each reoccurrence of an AE should be recorded on the eCRF. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values or Vital Signs 
Protocol defined laboratory values and vital signs will be reported as AEs if the abnormal 
laboratory or vital sign result: 
• Requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment;  
• Requires additional testing, excluding repeat testing of the lab in question, or surgical intervention;  
• Is associated with accompanying signs/symptoms that are not considered part of a preexisting diagnosis or syndrome; or 
• Is considered clinically significant by the Investigator 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 47 of 89 If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is the result of an evaluation of clinical signs, 
symptoms, or suspected diagnosis during the conduct of the study, the signs/symptoms or 
diagnosis should be reported as an AE (or if appropriate, an SAE) only i f clinically significant, 
and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF.  
11.2. Serious Adverse Events  
11.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, that at any dose:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening, ie, the subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred, (it does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death);  
• Requires hospital admission or prolongs hospitalization. Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or a disease that existed before administration of 
study drug, and for which the condition has not worsened since starting study drug, 
are not to be considered SAEs. Emergency room visits that are less than 24 hours will also not be considered SAEs unless any of the other serious criteria is fulfilled; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
• Is a medically significant event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Note: A distinction should be drawn between SAEs and severe AE s. Severity is a measure of the 
intensity of an AE, while the criteria for seriousness are indications of adverse subject outcomes 
for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE is not necessarily considered an SAE. For 
example, a headache that persists fo r several hours may be considered a severe AE but not an 
SAE. Conversely, a wound infection that may be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged hospitalization. 
11.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator and the Sponsor will monitor safety for this study. A Serious Adverse Event 
Report (SAER) Form is to be completed for each SAE occurring after signing of the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of study drug, regardless of causality.  
All SAE reports must be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s knowledge of the 
event  to . If requested  by the Sponsor, any supporting 
documentation (eg, medical records) sent to  with the 
SAER Form must have subject identifying information (eg, subject names, subject addresses, 
medical records number) redacted by the site. Follow-up information to all SAEs should be submitted to the Sponsor, or designee, in the same timeframe as initial reports.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 48 of 89 All SAEs will be followed until resolution or medical stabilization (in cases where resolution 
would not be expected). 
In accordance with applicable regulations and local laws, the Sponsor or designee will report all 
serious and unexpected AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator and/or Sponsor, 
to the regulatory authorities within the required timeframe. The Investigator will be responsible 
for reporting this safety information to his or her IRB/IEC.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE any time after study completion and determines it is 
related to the study drug, the SAE must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s knowledge of the SAE. 
11.2.3. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in and of itself is not an AE, although pregnancies occurring in subjects or partners of 
male subjects are considered immediately reportable events. If a pregnancy occurs in a subject, 
study drug must be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy must be reported to  Drug Safety via email at  within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnant woman until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the Sponsor, or designee, of the outcome within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the pregnancy outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy 
Reporting Form. This notification includes pregnancies resulting in live, “normal” births. 
If the pregnant subject experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs 
(ie, report the event to the Sponsor via email at  
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
causality) should be reported as SAEs to the Sponsor or designee. In addition, any infant death or 
congenital anomaly occurring after study completion that the Investigator suspects is related to the in -utero  exposure to the study drug should also be reported to the Sponsor or designee. 
11.3. Medical History  
The Investigator or designee will collect and review the subject’s medical history , including AD 
disease history, to evaluate the subject’s eligibility for study participation. The new onset of signs, symptoms, or other findings that occur from before signing of the ICF will be captured as medical history.  
11.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including sitting  systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, 
and respiratory rate, will be measured predose (as applicable) after at least 5  minutes of rest. 
Vital signs are to be performed predose if the dose is administered at the site . 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 49 of 89 11.5. Body Weight  and Height  
Body weight should be measured with no shoes and heavy clothing (outdoor clothing such as 
coats) on and using a calibrated scale throughout the study. Height should be measured using a 
stadiometer with no shoes. 
11.6. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations will include but are not limited to an assessment of general appearance, 
skin, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, throat), musculoskeletal, thyroid/endocrine, cardiovascular, chest/lung, neurologic, abdomen, and extremities/general body systems.  
Abbreviated, symptom directed physical examinations to assess clinically significant changes 
from Screening or any new signs or symptoms will be conducted at Visit 3 (Week 3), Visit 5 
(Week 10), and the Early Treatment Termination Visit, and may be conducted at other visits as 
determined by the Investigator based on subject complaint. 
Clinically significant abnormalities from before signing of the ICF will be recorded as medical 
history, and clinically significant changes after signing the ICF will be recorded as A Es. 
11.7. Standard 12 -Lead Electrocardiograms  
Twelve- lead ECGs are to be performed predose (as applicable) with subjects in a supine position 
after at least 5  minutes of rest. An ECG is to be performed predose if the dose is administered at 
the site . 
11.8. Laboratory Evaluations of Safety  
Samples for the following laboratory tests should be collected after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours): 
• Chemistry: sodium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), bicarbonate, calcium, 
corrected calcium, chloride, bilirubin ( total, indirect, and direct ), AST, ALT, blood 
urea nitrogen, urea, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, creatine phosphokinase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma -
glutamyltransferase , and total protein 
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count (total and differential), red blood cell count, platelet count, and platelet volume 
• Urinalysis: leukocyte esterase, nitrites,  pH, protein, specific gravity, glucose, occult 
blood, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen; microscopic analysis is to be performed only if protein, leukocyte esterase, blood or nitrite is positive  
• Coagulation: activated partial thromboplastin time , international normalized ratio  
(INR) , and prothrombin time  
• Pregnancy testing: required  for all females; serum test at Screening (Visit 1) and urine 
test for all other visits where pregnancy testing is required  
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 50 of 89 The urine pregnancy test for female subjects will be conducted locally; all other planned 
laboratory evaluations of safety will be conducted at a central laboratory. Details for sample 
collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
11.9. Other Laboratory Evaluations  
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be collected:  
• Serology: HIV I/II, HBV ( hepatitis B surface antigen ), HCV  
These planned laboratory evaluations will be conducted at a central laboratory. See the Laboratory Manual for additional details. 
11.10.  Subject Safety Guidelines  
11.10.1. Potential Side Effects  
Refer to Section  5.4.2 and the Investigator’s Brochure for additional EP262 information 
regarding potential side effects. 
11.10.2. Overdose  
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of EP262. Additionally, there is 
no specific antidote to EP 262. In a case of overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be 
employed and the case documented  as a protocol deviation (Section  17.1). An overdose does not 
constitute an AE; however, the subject should be closely monitored for any potential AEs. 
The overdose must be reported to  Drug Safety via email at 
 within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
overdose using the Overdose Reporting Form. 
11.10.3. Management of Liver Test Abnormalities  
Subjects with an increase in ALT or AST to >3× ULN OR  total bilirubin >2× ULN should be 
followed by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours of the initial serum chemistry results , if possible, 
to monitor for suspected drug-induced liver injury. Test results from local laborator ies and the 
associated normal ranges are to be captured in the database.  In conjunction with this, a physical 
examination should be performed and AE information should be collected. If symptoms persist 
or repeat testing shows ALT or AST >3× ULN or total bilirubin >2× ULN, subjects should be 
closely monitored as defined below to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. Frequency of retesting  can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or study 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 51 of 89 • Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, INR, direct bilirubin).  
If close observation is not possible, study drug should be interrupted until further investigation can be performed.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is identified and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. 
The Investigator and Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor must discuss and agree with any 
decision to rechallenge. Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered possibly drug-induced. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if the following abnormality or group of 
abnormalities occur:  
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN AND total bilirubin >2 × ULN OR  INR >1.5  
• ALT or AST >3 × 
 ULN with the appearance of new onset  fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
12. PHARMACODYNAMIC ASSESSMENTS  
Ex
amples  of the patient-reported assessments are provided in the appendices but are not to be 
distributed to subjects for completion. Subjects will be trained on completion of all  patient -
reported assessments using a study- issued electronic device or application (app).  
All subjects who were given a study-issued device, including those who fail Screening, will be required to return it to the site once their participation in the study is complete.  
12.1. Skin Swabs  
A cotton swab will be passed along the lesional skin of the area of worst involvement at 
Screening. The skin swab will be placed in aerobic culture and analyzed for the presence of 
S. aureus . At  skin swabs will be collected from 

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 52 of 89 the same lesional site, even if the lesion has cleared, for assessment of . 
Skin swabs are to be collected before skin tape strip s application and biopsies when performed 
on the same day. 
12.2. Skin Tape Strip s 
Commercially available adhesive sheets will be applied on the surface of the skin at predefined 
areas. This procedure will be repeated up to 20 times sequentially on the same area to collect 
samples from the stratum corneum for proteomic assessment. Skin tape strips will be applied to AD lesional skin on Visits 2, 3, and 4 ( Day 1 , Week 3, and Week 6, same location, even if the 
lesion has cleared), and at a nonlesional site at Visit 2 (Day 1). 
12.3. Skin Punch Biopsies  
Two 4.0-mm skin biopsies will be collected on Visit 2 (Day 1), one from lesional skin and one from nonlesional skin in the vicinity of the lesional skin, and one 4.0-mm skin biopsy will be collected on Visit 4 (Week 6) from the same lesional skin, at least 1 cm away from the previous 
scar, even if the lesions have cleared. 
 
 The location of the 
biopsies will be 1 to 2 cm away from where the skin tape strips were applied , when  both are to 
be performed on the same day . If it is not possible to collect the biopsy sample from the same 
lesion as the tape st rips, it should be collected from a similar lesion in the same anatomical area.

Representative photographs will be taken of the area of worst lesional involvement at Visit 2 
(Day 1) and of the same area at Visit 3 (Week 3) , Visit 4 (Week 6) , and Visit 5 (Follow- Up). 
Photographs will also be taken of areas selected for skin swabs, skin tape strip s application , and 
biops ies before these procedures are conducted . 
13. BASELINE CHARACTERIZATION  
A blood sample will be collected at Visit 2 (Day 1) for measurement of HDM -specific IgE.  
Blood samples will also be taken at Visit 2 (Day 1) for genotyping to evaluate UGT1A1 and filaggrin  polymorphisms to  enable pharmacogenomic analyses.  
14. PHARMACOKINETICS ASSESSMENT  
Blood sampling will be collected predose (as applicable)  at Visit 2 ( Day 1 ), and each visit 
thereafter  to analyze trough EP262 concentrations. The EP262 metabolite profile may also be 
analyzed from these trough samples. 
15. STATISTICS  
Data summaries will use descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables. Unless otherwise specified, endpoints will use the last pre -treatment value 
prior to the first dose of study drug as baseline. All data collected will be included in subject data listings.  
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock. Additional statistical analysis details will be included in the SAP.  

EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 55 of 89 15.1. Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets  will be considered: 
• Full Analysis Set : All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
randomized study drug will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Subjects in 
the FAS will be analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment. All PD 
analyses will be based on the FAS.  
• Per Protocol  Set: The Per Protocol (PP) Set is a subset of the FAS  containing 
subjects who meet study eligibility requirements  and had no protocol deviations that 
might impact the assessment of PD measurements. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment. The PP Set will be used for sensitivity analyses relating to PD. The type of protocol deviations governing 
exclusion from the PP Set will be determined prior to database lock and will be 
detailed in the SAP.  
• Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of randomized study drug will be included in the Safety Analysis Set. Safety analyses will be based upon treatment actually received.  
• PK Set : All subjects who  receive at least 1 dose of EP262 and provide adequate 
blood samples for bioanalysis will be included in the PK Set.  
15.2. Sample Size Considerations  
No formal sample size calculation has been made. The sample size has been selected to provide adequate information on the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EP262 over 6 weeks.  
15.3. Subject Disposition  
Disposition of subjects will be summarized by treatment group and overall. Completion status and reasons for discontinuation will also be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis set will be summarized.  
15.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data and baseline characteristics for each analysis set will be summarized by treatment group and overall using descriptive statistics.  
15.5. Study Drug Usage and Compliance  
Compliance rate will be computed for each subject and will be summarized for the Safety Analysis Set using summary statistics by treatment group and overall. 
Duration of treatment will also be summarized.  
15.6. Safety Analysis 
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for the summaries of the safety data. Safety data will be 
summarized by treatment group and overall.  
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 56 of 89 The safety and tolerability of EP262 will be assessed by comparing the frequency, causality, and 
severity of AEs as well as treatment discontinuations due to AEs. AEs will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by SOC  and P referred T erm. AEs that 
begin after the first administration of study drug, or existing AEs that worsen after the first dose 
of study drug, are considered treatment emergent. All AE summaries will include TEAEs, and all 
AEs will be presented in data listings. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary and summarized descriptively by Anatomic Therapeutic Chemistry (ATC) class using 
counts and percentages.  Medications started prior to the first dose of study drug will be indicated 
in the data listings. Use of protocol- permitted emollient will also be summarized descriptively.  
Changes in vital signs, standard 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations will be summarized descriptively.  
15.7. Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
PD analyses will be based on the FAS. Select  secondary and exploratory PD endpoint analyses 
may also be repeated in the PP Set , if sufficiently different to the FAS,  as supportive analyses. 
PD analyses will compare placebo and EP262 descriptively . No formal statistical testing will be 
performed. For select PD endpoints, the 90% confidence interval and/or nominal p- values will be 
presented . 
For select endpoints, absolute, percent change, and/or fold-change from baseline will be 
summarized. Correlation analysis between responses in disease severity scores and changes in select PD parameters may be explored. Additional information will be provided in the SAP. 
15.8. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK Set will be used for the summaries of plasma concentration s of EP262. A descriptive 
summary of the observed plasma concentrations will be displayed by time. 
15.9. Subgroup Analyses  
Given the small sample size, no formal subgroup analyses are planned for this study.  
15.10.  Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity  
No adjustment for multiplicity will be performed  due to the hypothesis generating nature of this 
study.  
15.11.  Planned Interim Analysis  
Given the hypothesis-generating nature of this study, an interim analysis may be conducted. The interim analysis would evaluate the effects of EP262 on s elect PD endpoints and safety. 
The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the study file s prior to conduct of the interim analysis. Additional details about 
the interim analysis, if applicable, will be provided in the SAP, which is to be finalized before 
the database lock and unblinding of the study data, as applicable. The SAP will be amended if 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 57 of 89 emerging data from the completed interim analysis leads to substantial change in the study 
protocol that has significant impact on the statistical analyses.  
16. QUALITY CONTROL AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
16.1. Data Quality Assurance  
The following measures will be implemented to ensure accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability of data: 
• Investigator discussions 
• Site initiation training  
• Early site visits following enrollment 
• Routine site management  
• Ongoing site communication and training 
• Periodic site monitoring  
• Review of the eCRF against source data for all subjects  
• Data management quality control (QC) checks  
• Statistical QC checks  
16.2. Data Management  
A database will be designed and built based on the final eCRF s. A Data Management Plan will 
be written specifying the procedures that will be used for medical coding, SAE reconciliation, QC, laboratory data, and data cleaning that will occur for the study. A Data Validation Specifications document will be written and edit checks will be programmed and validated.  
16.3. Monitoring  
Monitoring visits will be conducted by representatives of the Sponsor according to the International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Guideline for GCP, and applicable regional 
regulations and guidelines.  
A monitor (or monitors) will review and verify protocol compliance with a focus on AE/SAE 
reporting, eCRF data, source documentation, ICFs, and any other study-related documentation, 
including review of site pharmacy procedures, drug accountability documentation, and drug 
storage facilities and records. 
Monitoring will be on an ongoing basis. Before database lock, 100% eCRF data verification will 
be performed against the source documents. The Investigator will agree to the monitor(s) making 
periodic site visits during the study. The monitor(s) and the site  staff will agree upon the timing 
of these visits.  
Centralized monitoring, which consists of remote review of accumulating data from all sites, will be performed as detailed in the Centralized Monitoring Plan. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 58 of 89 16.4. Confidentiality and Auditing  
The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s representatives will preserve the confidentiality 
of all subjects participating in this study, in accordance with ICH GCP, local regulations, and 
institutional requirements. Only year of birth, age at Screening, and study subject number will be 
used to identify subjects on the eCRFs and other study- related documents submitted to the 
Sponsor (or designee). Documents that are not submitted to the Sponsor (eg, ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the investigative staff.  
In compliance with ICH GCP, it is required that the Investigator and institution permit 
authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ), and other appropriate regulatory authority or health authority inspectors’ direct access to 
all study -related sites, source data, documents, and reports for verification of study records and 
data. Direct access is the permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study. The Investigator is obligated to inform and obtain consent from the subject to permit these representatives to have access to their 
study-related records for this verification. Any party (eg,  domestic and foreign regulatory 
authorities, Sponsors, auditors) with direct access should take all reasonable precautions within 
the constraints of the applicable regulatory requirement(s) to maintain the confidentiality of subjects.  
In case of data security breach, measures to mitigate possible adverse effects for subjects will be 
applied as per the CRO’s standard operating procedure ( SOP). 
16.5. Case Report Forms  
eCRFs will be used for this study. Site personnel will receive training on eCRF completion. Each eCRF is to be reviewed and approved by the Investigator.  
During periodic monitoring visits, the eCRFs will be made available to the study monitor so that 
he or she may verify the data entries with the source documentation. 
16.6. Source Documents  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents (eg,  medical 
records, 12-lead ECG results, raw data collection forms) to record all observations and other 
pertinent data for each subject enrolled into the study. The data r ecorded on the eCRFs will be 
derived from these source documents. The Investigator will ensure that data on the eCRFs and completed queries are accurate, consistent with source documentation, and submitted to the Sponsor in a timely manner. The Investigator will also ensure that all data on required study logs are accurate and kept up to date.  
16.7. Records Retention  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and amendments, completed eCRFs, source documentation, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence and approvals, and all other supporting documentation) until notified by the Sponsor. Subject identification codes (subject 
names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for this same period and stored 
separately. Custody of the records may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to the Sponsor, which agrees to abide by the r etention policies. Written notice of transfer must be 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 59 of 89 submitted to the Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor before disposing of any 
study records. 
Records retention will follow the data protection requirements in each country. 
16.8. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study- related procedures 
are performed. The Investigator has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure each subject 
being considered for inclusion in the study is given a full explanation of the study. The Investigator, or his/her designee, shall inform each subject, in writing, of all aspects pertaining to 
participation in the study, including (but not limited to) aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential risks. Subjects will have the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether to participate. Subjects should understand that they are free to refuse to 
participate in, or to withdraw from, the study at any time without prejudice or loss of medical 
care to which they are otherwise entitled. Each subject must personally sign and date a study-specific ICF to be a subject in the study. The ICF must be countersigned by the site Investigator 
(or designee) who conducted the informed consent discussion. This will be documented on a 
written ICF. Each ICF will include the elements required by US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) 50 and ICH E6, Section 4.8. The Investigator agrees to obtain approval from the Sponsor 
of any written informed consent for use in the study before submission to the IRB/IEC. 
Each subject who provides written informed consent for the study (by signing and dating the 
ICF), will be given a copy of the signed ICF. The original will be kept in the subject’s medical 
record or study chart as permitted by the institution. The Investigator will inform subjects of new 
information that may be relevant to the subjects’ willingness to continue participation in the study according to local ethics requirements. 
It is important to obtain complete follow -up for all subjects. Every attempt should be made to 
undertake all protocol- specified assessments and complete the eCRFs except for those subjects 
who specifically withdraw consent for release of such information. 
16.9. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCP, ICH guidelines, other applicable 
regulatory requirements (eg, local requirements), the study protocol, and where applicable, Sponsor and/or CRO SOPs . 
16.10.  Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigator will not begin the study until the protocol and ICF have been approved by the appropriate independent IRB/IEC. Any amendments to the protocol must also be approved in writing by the Sponsor and IRB/IEC, before implementation by the Investigator, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects.  
All IRB/IEC correspondence, including progress reports, will be retained on file at the site. 
EP-262-202 Protocol, Amendment 4.0 (05 April 2024) 
Escient Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential Page 60 of 89 17. STUDY MANAGEMENT  
17.1. Protocol Deviations 
The Investigator is not permitted to deviate from the protocol in any major way without proper 
notification to the Sponsor (or designee). Only the Sponsor may revise the protocol. Any change 
in study conduct considered necessary by the Investigator will be made only after consultation 
with the Sponsor, who will then issue a formal protocol revision to implement the change and obtain regulatory and ethic approval. The only exception is when the Investigator considers a subject’s safety to be compromised if i mmediate action is not taken.  
In the event of an important deviation from the protocol, the Investigator or designee must contact the Sponsor or representative at the earliest possible time. This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study.  
Examples of important deviations include: 
• Subject did not give appropriate informed consent 
• Inclusion or exclusion criteria not satisfied 
• Non-permitted concomitant medications that may meaningfully impact PD  or safety 
outcomes 
• Meaningful dosing error 
• Randomization error 
The Investigator and Sponsor will both document this decision. The IRB/IEC will be informed of 
all important protocol deviations by the Investigator in accordance with established procedures. 
17.2. Publications  
No publication of the results shall take place without the Sponsor’s written consent. All 
publication or presentation rights for the findings of the clinical investigation under this protocol 
shall be governed by the appropriate terms of the clinical research  agreement between the 
Investigator, the investigational site, and the Sponsor. 
The study will be registered on a publicly accessible website, in accordance with the applicable 
local laws and regulations.   
A summary of the results of the clinical study, together with a summary that is understandable to a layperson, will be made available within 1 year from the end of the clinical study.  
17.3. Change in Clinical  Site Staff  
In the event that the Principal Investigator at a site is unable to continue the study, another suitable person will be designated as the Investigator, and documentation testifying to this will 
be submitted to the Sponsor or its designee within 10 days, who must approve the change along 
with the IRB/IEC before the study can be continued at that investigative site.

Summary of Changes for Amendment 4.0 Date d 05 April  2024 
Protocol EP-262-202 was amended to extend (from 60 days to 84 days [12 weeks]) the duration after the last dose of study drug 
during which subjects with reproductive capability are restricted from egg/sperm donation and are to use acceptable forms of contraception. This modification is based on preliminary trends in emerging EP262 pharmacokinetic data from the ongoing clini cal 
studies. The extension will remain in effect as a safety precaution until results f rom definitive reproductive and development toxicity 
studies of EP262 are available.  
This protocol amendment also includes an update regarding excluded medications and clarifies that only female subjects with a negative serum pregnancy test at S creening are eligible for participation in the study. 
Notable changes are included below in the summary table. Revised text in Amendment 4.0 is bolded, and text deleted from Amendment 3.0 is crossed out in the table below. Italicized text is used to describe a change.  Minor/editorial changes are not listed 
individually in the summary table.

Protocol EP-262-202 was amended to address the following changes, including:  
• Remove the eligibility requirement for positive colonization of Staphylococcus aureus  at Screening  
• Provide guidance regarding confirmed indeterminant pregnancy test results at Screening   
• Updates to the excluded concomitant medications  
• Reword the precautions regarding sun exposure 
Notable changes are included below in the summary table. Revised text in Amendment 3.0 is bolded, and text deleted from

8.1 Subject Inclusion 
Criteria  5. I f female, must  have a negative serum 
pregnancy test at Screening and  be willing 
to not donate eggs from Screening until 
60 days after the last dose of study drug 
and: 4. I f female, have a negative serum 
pregnancy test at Screening4, be willing to 
not donate eggs from Screening until 
60 days after the last dose of study drug,  
and: 
4 In instances when a serum pregnancy 
test result is confirmed to be 
indeterminate, the result should be discussed with the Escient medical team 
and interpreted by the Investigator using 
clinical judgment; it should not automatically result in screen failure.  Guidance was provided to  
potentially  allow women with a  
confirmed  indeterminate result the 
opportunity to participate  in the 
study, based on the Investigator’s 
clinical judgement.
 For instance, 
an indeterminant pregnancy test result in a surgically sterile or postmenopausal subject would not 
necessarily result in her inability to 
participate in the study.

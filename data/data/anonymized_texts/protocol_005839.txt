Study Design:
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS -986205 administered as a monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab (Parts 1 and 2), and in combination with nivol umab and ipilimumab (Part 3) in subjects with advanced 
malignant tumors.
The study will be conducted in 3 parts. A clin ical pharmacology QTc substudy will also be performed. 
Parts 1 and 2: Dose escalation (Part 1) will start with a lead-in Cycle 0 whereby BMS-986205 is administered as 
monotherapy for 2 weeks duration in each dose escalation cohort. Decision to proceed to combination treatment with 
nivolumab (Cycle 1) for each cohort in dose escalation will be determined after tolerability of the monotherapy lead-in is established in the 2-week Cycle 0 at each dose, as described in Section 3.1.5 in the protocol body. When the 
decision is made to proceed to Cycle 1, BMS-986205 will be administer ed concomitantly with nivolumab. The starting 
dose of BMS-986205 is 25 mg orally daily. Nivolumab will be  administered at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
for the dose escalation (Part 1) and for the dose expans ion (Part 2) cohorts that predated Amendment 06 (cervical, 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL],  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [SCCHN], bladder, and 
pancreatic cancer). Nivolumab will be ad ministered at a dose 480 mg intravenous ly every 4 weeks (Q4W) for the dose 
expansion cohorts added with Amendment 06 (melanoma, NSCLC, and additional signal seeking tumors) and the clinical pharmacology substudy).
Dose expansion (Part 2) will include 8 disease-restr icted expansion cohorts (cervical cancer, DLBCL, SCCHN, 
bladder cancer, NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell car cinoma, and pancreatic cancer). Various subpopulations of 
melanoma and NSCLC will be included in separate c ohorts to further understand the role of indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibition in these specific popul ations. The BRAF mutated, post-BRAF regimen melanoma 
subjects will be ra ndomized to receive either nivolumab or BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in order to 
order to generate a robust, prospective dataset with nivolumab monotherapy to serve as a basis for understanding the 
potential added benefit of combination therapy. An additi onal cohort will be dedicated to tumor types from the 
escalation inclusion criteria that do not currently have a dedicated expansi on cohort or plans for evaluation in other 
studies.  
In addition, a clinical pha rmacology substudy will be conducted to characterize the effect of BMS-986205 on QTc 
intervals. The starting dose of BMS-986205 is 25 mg orally daily. Ni volumab will be administered at a dose of 240 mg Q2W 
for the dose escalation (Part 1) and for the dose expansion (Part 2) cohorts that predated Amendment 06. Nivolumab 
will be administered at a dose 480 mg intravenously Q4W for the dose e xpansion cohorts added with and after
Amendment 06 (melanoma, NSCLC, and additional signal- seeking tumors; renal cell carcinoma) and the clinical 
pharmacology substudy.

Part 3: Part 3 will include the initial safety evaluation a nd cohorts of the combinati on of BMS-986205, nivolumab, 
and ipilimumab in melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer. Subjects with each tumor type will receive BMS 986205 
in combination with a different regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab based on safety and efficacy data observed in previous trials of nivolumab and ipilimumab in that tumor type (see Section 1.1 of the protocol). 
For the safety cohorts, the initial dose level of BMS-986205 for each cohort will be based on the available of safety, PK, and PD data for BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab and any available data from the combination with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab. The starting dose will not exceed 100 mg in any cohort. 
The regimens will consist of:Melanoma (Ipi 1Q8): BMS 986205 in combination with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W, all 
given continuously.
NSCLC (Ipi 1Q6): BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ip ilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W, all 
given continuously.  Bladder (Ipi 3Q3): BMS-986205 given continuously, first in  combination with nivolumab 80 mg and ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg both given Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg Q4W continuously Evaluation of each regimen will begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the triplet combination therapy 
in a limited number of subjects, including a sentinel subject, in a safety evaluation cohort. The melanoma and NSCLC safety cohorts will begin safety enrollment simultaneously since the dose of ipilimumab is similar between the cohorts. Furthermore, for nivolumab dosing, the 480 mg Q4W a nd 360 mg Q3W are expected to achieve similar average 
exposure. The safety evaluation for the bladder regimen  will begin enrolling subjects  once either the melanoma or 
NSCLC regimen has been found to be safe and tolerable, as the bladder regimen uses a higher dose (3 mg/kg Q3W) of ipilimumab relative to the melanoma and NSCLC cohort s (1 mg/kg Q6W and Q8W of ipilimumab) during the DLT 
evaluation period.
Once the initial safety and tolerability have been establishe d independently for each regimen with a given tumor type, 
subjects will begin e nrolling in expansion cohorts for that tumor type Addition ally, subjects may be enrolled into a 
mixed tumor type cohort using the Ipi 1Q8 regimen (nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W) for 
further evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as pr eliminary evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy once the safety 
of Ipi 1Q8 is established in the melanoma cohort. The study design schematic for Part 3 is presented in Figure 2.

Study Periods: 
Subjects will complete up to 4 periods of the st udy: Screening, Treatment, Clinical/Safety Follow- up, and 
Survival/Long-term follow-up, as described below:
Screening (up to 28 days): Subjects will sign consent and be evaluated for study eligibility.
Treatment Phase:
Parts 1 and 2:
Each treatment cycle consists of up to twelve 4-week treatment cycles. For subjects receiving nivolumab on the Q2W 
regimen, each treatment cycle is composed of a daily oral dose of BMS -986205 and 2 doses of nivolumab administered 
intravenously Q2W on Days 1 and 15. For subjects receiving nivolumab on the Q4W regimen, each cycle is composed 
of a daily oral dose of BMS-986205 and 1 dose of nivolumab  on Day 1. In addition, Part  1 (dose esca lation) and the 
QTc substudy will start with Cycle 0, a lead-in period of 2 weeks duration, during which monotherapy with BMS-
986205 is administered. 
Following every 2 treatment cycles (8 weeks), the decision to treat a subject with additional cycles of study drug will 
be based on radiological tumor assessments (initial evaluation performed at baseline, end of Cycle 2, and every 8 weeks). Assessment of partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) must be confirmed at least 4 weeks 
following initial assessment. Tumor progression or response endpoints will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors or International Working Gr oup [IWG] 
criteria for Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Part 3:
For subjects receiving the melanoma/Ipi 1Q8 regimen containing nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q8W, 1 cycle will consist of 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab (ie, 8 weeks). 
For subjects receiving the NSCLC/Ipi  1Q6 regimen containing nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ip ilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q6W, 1 cycle will consist of 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab (ie, 6 weeks). For subjects receiving the bladder/Ipi 3Q3 regimen, during nivolumab and ipilimumab combination dosing, the first 
2 cycles will each consist of 2 doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab (each cy cle is 6 weeks); after the first 2 cy cles, 
each subsequent cycle will be comprised of 1 dose of nivolumab (ie, 4 weeks). For subjects r eceiving the mixed tumor type regimen con taining nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q8W, 1 cycle will consist of 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab (ie, 8 weeks)Timing of imaging assessments will be based on the regimen the subject is receiving:
Melanoma/Ipi 1Q8: The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 12 ( ±1 week); subsequent imaging will be every 
8 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter throughout the treatment period.
NSCLC/Ipi 1Q6: The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 6 ( ±1 week), and then every 6 weeks ( ±1 week) 
throughout the treatment period.
Bladder/Ipi 3Q3: The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 6 ( ±1 week), and then every 6 weeks ( ±1 week) 
during the treatment period up to 24 weeks, after which they will occur every 12 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter 
throughout the treatment period.
Mixed tumor type/Ipi 1Q8 cohort: The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 8 (± 1 week); subsequent imaging 
will be every 8 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter throughout the treatment period.
The decision to treat a subject with additional cycles of study drug will be based on the most recent radiological tumor 
assessment preceding that dose. Assessments of PR and CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the initial assessment. Tumor progression or response endpoints will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria
Treatment beyond progression in all study Parts may be allowed in select subjects with initial RECIST v1.1 or IWG-
defined progressive disease (PD) if the benefit/risk assessment favors continued administration of study therapy (eg, 
subjects are continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, tolerating treatment, and do not meet treatment discontinuation criteria as specified in Section 3.5  in the protocol body).

Treatment with Additional Cycles beyond 48 weeks : Subjects completing approximately 48 weeks of study therapy 
in all st udy Parts with ongoing disease control (CR, PR or stable disease [SD]) may be eligible for an additional 48 
weeks of study therapy at the originally assigned dose regimen in all study Parts be yond the initial 48 weeks, on a 
case-by case basis, after careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether the 
benefit/risk ratio supports administration of further st udy therapy. Sub jects whose last assessment of the in itial 48-
week period shows PD will also be eligible to continue to additional cycles (up to a maximum of 2 years from first 
dose) if they are still deriving clinical benefit,  as per the guidance of treatment beyond progression (Section 3.5.1  in 
the protocol body). For subjects in the bla dder triplet combination regimen, ipilimumab w ill not be re-administered 
during additional treatment; only BMS-986205 and nivolumab (480 mg Q4W) will continue. Upon completion of 48 weeks of study therapy (or up to a maximum of 96 weeks if  applicable), all s ubjects w ill enter the Clinical/Safety 
Follow-up period.
Clinical/Safety Follow-up period: Upon completion of 48 weeks of study therapy (or up to a maximum of 96 weeks 
if applicable), all subjects will enter the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period once the decision is made to discontinue the 
subject from treatment (eg, at end of treatment [EOT]). 
For subjects who complete all scheduled  cycles of therapy, the EOT visit will be the same as the last scheduled and 
completed on-treatment visit, and the s tart of the Week 1 Clinical/Safety Follow -up visit. For s ubjects who do not 
complete all scheduled cycles of therapy, the EOT vis it will be the most recent on-treatment visit (with all available 
safety and response data) and does not need to be  repeated, and will be considered the start of the Week 1 
Clinical/Safety Follow-up visit.Subjects who discontinue the treatment phase will enter the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period. S ubjects must be 
followed for at least 100 days (representing approximately 5 half-lives for nivolumab) after the last dose of st udy drug. 
Follow-up visits should occur at Days 30, 60, and 100 (±10 days) after the last dose of study drug or should coincide 
with the date of discontinuation (±10 days) if date of discontinuation is greater than 30 days after the last dose of study drug to monitor for AEs. A ll subjects will be re quired to complete 3 Clinical/Safety Follow-up visits regardless of 
whether they start new anti-cancer therapy, except those subjects who withdraw consent for study participation.
Survival/Long-term/Response Follow-up : After completion of the Clinical/Saf ety Follow-up period, all subjects 
will then enter the Survival/Long-term Follow-up period. Duri ng this period, clinic visits or telephone contact every 
3 months will be performed to assess survival status. The duration of the Survival/Long -term Follow -up period will 
be approximately 2 years following the first dose of study drug, and a minimum of 12 months following the last dose 
of study drug.
After completion of the Safety Follow-up period, subjects who discontinue study with ongoing SD, PR, or CR at the 
EOT visit will enter the Response Follow-up period. This period will occur simultaneously with the Survival Follow-up period for these subjects. These subjects will continue to  have tumor radiological and clinical tumor assessments 
every 3 months (every 12 weeks) during the Respons e Follow-up period or until disease progression or withdrawal of 
study. Radiological tumor assessments for subjects who have ongoing clinical benefit may continue to be collected 
after subject complete the survival phase of the study.
Subjects in the Survival/Long-term Follow-up period who have progression of disease will be allowed to receive 
tumor-directed therapy as required.Data from imaging assessments for subjects who have ongoi ng clinical benefit may continue to be collected after 
subjects complete the survival phase of the study.Re-treatment during Survival/Long-term Follow-up with the origin ally assigned study therapy regimen (eg, same 
dose and dose schedule) or modified dose regimen may be permitted within 12 months of last dose of study therapy 
for subjects who enter Safety/Survival/L ong-term Follow-up with ongoing diseas e control (CR, PR, or SD) for reasons 
other than drug-related toxicity after discussion and a greement with the BMS Medical M onitor that the benefit/risk 
assessment favors re-treatment, and the subject continue s to meet eligibility criteria for treatment with study therapy 
as outlined in Section 3.5.1 of the protocol. Subjects mee ting criteria for re-treatment will be treated for a maximum 
of 2 years from the first dose of nivolumab, at the same dose and schedule administered during their initial treatment, 
unless that dose and scheduled was subsequently found to exceed the MTD, in which case the subject will be treated at the next lower, or alternate dose and schedule ( Table 1 in Synopsis). Subjects entering this phase will follow the 
Time and Events schedule as outlined in Section
 5 of the protocol.

Part 1: Dose Escalation: 
The Part 1 dose escalation phase of the st udy will ev aluate the MTD/MAD/altern ate dose of BMS-986205 in 
combination with nivolumab based on DLTs using a Bayesian Logistic Regression Method (BLRM) model (for BMS-
986205 monotherapy lead-in) and BLRM-copula model (for BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab). The 
Bayesian models will be used for recommendation of the next dose to be investigated. BLRM (combined with copula) framework with an escalation with overdose control princip le will be employed to ensure that safety is not 
compromised during dose escalation.
The initial dose level of BM S-986205 w ill be 25 mg administered orally d aily. Once in itial lead-in monotherapy 
(Cycle 0) is deemed tolerable, combination with 240 mg f lat dose nivolumab at the s ame dose level with the same 
subject (Cycle 1) will be initiated. Dose levels to be consider ed for the next  combination c ohort (with monotherapy l ead-in) will be based on 
recommended monotherapy dose from BLRM and recomme nded combination dose from BLRM-copula. The lower 
dose from these 2 recommendations will be considered. Potential dose levels for dose escalation are provided in Table  
1 in the synopsis. The maximum allowable increase in dose will be 100%. Final dose selecti on for the next cohort/dose 
level will be made in conjunction with all data av ailable from PK, and pharmacodynamic assessments, and will be 
made after discussion and agreement between investigators and BMS Medical Monitor. Accordingly, intermediate or 
lower doses, or less frequent dosing of BMS-986205 may be tested if none of the pla nned doses/schedules are found 
to be tolerated as lead-in phase or in combination with nivolumab.
Approximately 30 subjects will be treated in the dose escalation phase. Depending on the dose recommendation, more 
than 3 subjects can be treated at each dose level. Increments of approximately 3 subjects will be added to each dose level depending on model recommendation and clinical judgmen t. Once the safety of any dose level has been 
established, up to 12 additional subjects may be added to better characterize the PK and pharmacodynamic profile.
Cohort-tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendation will occur when 2 DLT-evaluable subjects 
within a subject c ohort have completed the 6-week DLT observation period (see Section 4.5.1  of the protocol for 
criteria for DLTs). DLTs occurring within the 2 week s of the lead-in period (D LT observation period for m onotherapy) 
will be used to fit BLRM model for monotherapy. DLTs  occurring within the 4 weeks of combination period (DLT 
observation period for combination) will be used to fit BLRM-copula model.  The lower recommended dose from both 
models will be considered for next dose escalation. Subjects who received ≥ 75% of BMS- 986205 doses and 2 doses 
of nivolumab, and have been followed at least 5 days after second nivolumab dose in the 6-week DLT observation 
period will be considered as DLT-evaluable subjects. Continuous re-assessment of dose recommendation by BLRM 
will be carried out at each dose level after each cohort of subjects with consideration of all available DLT information.
The MTD/MAD/alternate dose of BMS-986205 in combin ation with nivolumab selected cohort will be based on 
evaluating the recommendation from BLRM-copula and a synthesis of all available data, including clinical and 
laboratory safety assessments, PK, pharmacodynamic, a nd efficacy data, from all treated subjects at each dose level 
up to the MTD/MAD.No intra-subject dose escalation is allowed, although dose modifications may be permitted (see Section 4.5.3).
Sentinel Subject: During dose escalation, a staggered dosing (sentinel sub ject) a pproach will be used for the first 
subject in the first dose level of both lead-in and combination. The first subject in both lead-in and combination will QTc Substudy

Part 2: Dose Expansion: 
The purpose of dose expansion is to gather additi onal safety, tolerability, pr eliminary efficacy, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic information regarding BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab.
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort e xpansions will be performed throughout enrollment in the 
expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment-related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% 
across all subjects treated in cohort expansions, the fi ndings will be discussed and further enrollment may be 
interrupted. At that time, depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a 
new dose(s) of BMS-986205 for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level 
intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels. Additi onally, at the discretion of the Sponsor, and in agreement 
with the investigators, the 480 mg Q4W nivolumab dosing regimen in the designated expansion cohorts and clinical 
pharmacology substudy may revert back to 240 mg Q2W based on emerging PK, pharmacodynamic, and/or tolerability data from the cohort expansion portion of the study.
Eight disease-restricted populations w ill be included in cohort expansion. These include cervical cancer, DLBCL, 
SCCHN, bladder cancer, melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Various subpopulations of 
melanoma and NSCLC will be included in separate cohorts to further understand the role of IDO1 inhibition in these 
specific populations (see Table 3.1.5-1  in the protocol body). The BRAF mutated, post-BRAF regimen melanoma 
subjects will be ra ndomized to receive either nivolumab or BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in order to 
generate a robust, prospective dataset with nivolumab monotherapy to serve as a basis for understanding potential 
added benefit of combination therapy.  An additional cohort will be dedicated to tumor types from the escalation 
inclusion criteria, which do not currently have a dedicated expansion cohort or plans for evaluation in other studies. The eligible tumor types will be triple negative breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, epithelial cancer of the ovary, and sarcoma. During dose expansion, the S imon 2-stage (optimal) design will be used as a guide for 
some of the tumor-specific expansion cohorts. Those indica tions will be classified into 3 categories according to 
different sample size modeling settings: SCCHN and bladder cancer in a group; cervical cancer, DLBCL, melanoma with prior anti- programmed death receptor-(ligand) 1 (PD-[L ]1) therapy, NSCLC with pr ior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy,

and pancreatic cancer in a different group; and melanoma with prior anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-
associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy in another group will be analyzed using a Simon 2-stage design.
Part 3 BMS-986205, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab Combination
Part 3 of the study w ill include an initial safety evaluation cohorts of 3 regimens of nivolumab and ipilimumab in 
combination with BMS-986205 in melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer.  Expansion cohorts for each regimen will 
then be conducted in the tumor type evaluated in the safety cohorts. The Ipi 1Q8W regimen will also be evaluated in a mixed cohort of other tumor types evaluated in Part  1. Each tumor type will r eceive BMS-986205 in combination 
with a specific nivolumab and ipilimumab regimen (see Section 3.1.1.2 ). 
For the safety cohorts, the initial dose level of BMS-986205 for each cohort will be based on the available of safety, 
PK, and PD data for B MS-986205 in combination with nivolumab a nd any available from the combination with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab.  The starting dose will not ex ceed 100 mg in any safety c ohort. Lower dose levels of 
BMS-986205 (if required) to be evaluated in each safety cohort will be based on Table 3.1.5-1 . Intermediate or lower 
doses, or less frequent dosing of BMS-986205 may be tested if  none of the planned doses/schedules are found to be 
tolerated. In addition, alternative lower doses and more intermittent schedules of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab may 
be evaluated if the specified regimen used in each tumor type safety cohort is not found to be tolerable with any of the 
doses of BMS-986205 outlined in Table 3.1.5-1. Safety will be evaluated independently for each tumor type/regimen combination and treatment regimen based on DLTs using a BLRM-copula model.
All safety cohorts will begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the triplet combination regimen in a 
limited number of subjects. As describe d in Section 3.1.1.2, the NSCLC/Ipi 1Q6 and melanoma/Ipi 1Q8 regimen 
cohorts will begin enrollment first, followed by the bladder/Ipi 3Q3 regimen cohort once safety and tolerability have 
been established in either NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6 or melano ma/Ipi 1Q8. Initially, approximately 3 subjects will be treated 
at the selected dose combination of BMS -986205 with nivolumab  and ipilimumab. The first subject in each safety 
cohort will be a sentinel subject who will be observed for 5 days after administration of the first combination dose to ensure safety and tolerability before other subjects can receive treatment within that cohort.
Due to the potential for early discontinuation, an additional sub ject(s) may be enrolled to ensure approximately 
3 DLT-evaluable subjects. Initial safety assessment to allo w enrollment in the bladder/  Ipi 3Q3 safety cohort w ill 
occur when at least 2 evaluab le subjects in either the NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6 or melanoma/ Ipi 1Q8 safety cohorts have 
completed a 6-week DLT evaluation period (see Section 4.5.1 for cr iteria for DLTs). In the melanoma and NSCLC 
safety evaluation cohorts, if a potential DLT occurring in any third evaluable subject in the specific dose combination 
does not influence the recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) to open enrollment in the bladder safety cohort, then the bladder safety cohort may proceed with enrollment without waiting for the third subject to complete the corresponding 
DLT observation period.
DLT-evaluable subjects will be defined as subjects who in the 6-week DLT evaluation period received ≥75% of 
BMS-986205 doses and the following nivolumab and ipilimumab doses for each regimen:
•Melanoma/ Ipi 1Q8: 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 days after the 
second dose of nivolumab
•NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6: 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 days after the 
second dose of nivolumab
•Bladder/ Ipi 3Q3: 2 doses of nivolumab and 2 doses of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 days after the 
second dose of each drug
After the initial subjects in each treatment regimen are evaluated, add itional increments of approximately 3 to 6 
subjects will be treated in the same safety cohort as per the BLRM-copula model recommendation that the dose 
combination is safe. At least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects will be treated and assessed for a particular BMS-986205 dose 
in that tumor type/regimen cohort before enrollment in the expansion cohorts for that regimen will begin enrollment. Up to 12 DLT-evaluable subjects in total may be treated  in each safety evaluation cohort at the BMS-986205 dose 
chosen for expansion reg imens for further evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamic/PK parameters as required. 
BLRM (-copula) will be used to monitor the safety of each triplet dose combination on an ongoing basis.

Once the initial safety and tolerability have been establishe d independently  for each regimen based on the safety 
cohorts, enrollment will then begin in expansion cohorts for further evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as 
preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy. In the expansion cohorts, BMS-986205 will be administered at a dose 
determined to be tolerable in combination with each  nivolumab and ipilimumab regimen. Each BMS-986205 and 
nivolumab/ipilimumab combination regimen will be evaluated  in tumor-specific cohorts based on the tumor type 
evaluated in the safety cohorts.  The Ipi 1Q8 regimen will also be evaluated in a mixed tumor-type cohort which may 
incorporate tumor types evaluated in Part 2 Dose Escalation. 
The 3 tumor types for tumor-restrict ed cohorts will be melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder. As all subjects in these 
disease-specific cohorts will be receiving agents (nivolumab and ipilimumab) with known anti-tumor activity in those 
tumor types, a single-stage design will be utilized for e ach of these tumor types. Approximately 40 subjects will be 
treated in each of the following expansion cohorts: melanoma PD-L1 positive, melanoma PD-L1 negative, NSCLC 
PD-L1 positive, NSCLC PD-L1 negative, and bladder; this is to allow for the exploration of early efficacy signals of BMS-986205 in combin ation with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in relevant subpopulations. In each NSCLC 
expansion cohort, approximately 10 subjects will be IO-treatment naive, 25 will be treatment-naive, and 5 IO-therapy 
experienced. In the melanoma cohorts, approximately 35 will be treatment naïve in the advanced setting and 5 will be IO-therapy experienced in each cohort. In the bladder expa nsion cohort in Part 3, at least 30 subjects will be I-O 
therapy naive. 
A mixed tumor type expansion cohort will also be evaluated, using the same regimen as in the melanoma safety cohort, 
Ipi 1Q8W. The purpose of this cohort is to obtain preliminary safety, tolerability, and eff icacy data in tumor types 
besides melanoma using the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W/Ipilimu mab 1 mg/kg Q8W backbone in combination with BMS-
986205 at the dose selected for melanoma expansion cohort. Up to forty subjects may be treated in this cohort. Tumor types included in this cohort may be a ny previously evaluated in Part 2. All subjects in this cohort will be IO-treatment 
naive. Selection of tumor types and number of subjects per tumor type will be at the discretion of the Sponsor and 
based on emerging data from Part 2 of this st udy as well as othe r external data (e.g. from studies of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in a particular tumor type). For each tumor type enrolled in to this cohort, approx imately 6 subjects will 
be initially evaluated for safety and tolerability for 6 weeks each for toxicities meeting the definition of DLT exceeding 
the threshold defined below prior to enrollment of any other subjects with that tumor type.
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the expansi on cohorts will be performed throughout enrollment in the 
expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of tr eatment-related t oxicities meeting DLT criteria within an 
individual tumor type/treatment regimen exceeds 33% across all sub jects tr eated in the safety evaluation and dose 
expansion cohorts, the findings will be discussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. At that time, depending 
on the nature and grade of the toxicities and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) of BMS-986205 for subjects within that cohort may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level evaluated in Part 1or at a dose level 
intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels in Part 1.
Duration of Study: The total duration of time for any individual subject is expected to be approximately 2.5 years. 
The total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years from the onset of the first vis it of the first subject to the 
required Survival/Long-term Follow-up of the last subject enrolled.Study Population: Male and/or female subjects who are at least 18 years old and satisfy eligibility by medical history, 
physical examination (PE), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory evaluations will be included to

Study Assessments:
•Safety Outcome Measures: Safety assessments will be based on medical review of AE reports and the results of 
vital sign measurements, ECGs, PEs, and clinical laboratory tes ts. AEs will be coded using the most current 
version of Medical Dictionary for Regu latory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of observed AEs will be 
tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clin ical importance. AEs will be assessed continuously 
during the study and for 100 days after the last dose of nivolumab. Both AEs and laboratory tests will be graded 
using the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
•Pharmacokinetic Measures: Serial plasma and urinary samples for BMS-986205  will be 
collected from all subjects at specified time points during BMS-986205 monotherapy. PK parameters to be assessed following multiple- and single-dose administration are listed in Section 5.5 of the protocol body. Plasma 
samples of BMS-986205 will be collected during combinati on treatment. Plasma concentration data will be 
tabulated using summary statistics.  
 
•Efficacy Measure: Disease assessment with compu ted tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, as 
appropriate, will be performed at baseline, end of Cycle 2 and every 8 weeks until end of treatment or until subjects withdraw from the study in Part 2, and using th e schedules detailed above for Part 3 until end of treatment 
or until subjects withdraw from the study..  In all Parts, disease assessment will continue every 12 weeks for the first year after the EOT visit, and then every 6 mont hs thereafter, up to 2 years following the EOT visit. until 
disease progression, at the completion of follow-up, or until subjects withdraw from the study. For subjects with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin’s lym phoma (NHL), positron emission tomography will be 
performed at baseline and in order to confirm a CR. Disease assessments at other time points may be performed 
as clinically indicated. In all st udy parts, scans will be co llected centrally and may be reviewed by a blinded 
independent central review (BICR) at a later date, or at any time during the study per Sponsor request. Changes 
in tumor measurements and tumor responses will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST or IWG criteria. Investigators will also report the number and size of new le sions that appear while on study. The tumor assessment 
time points will be reported on the case report form based on investigators’ assessment using RECIST or IWG 
criteria. Please refer to Appendix 3 for specifics of RECIST v1.1 and Appendix 4 for specifics of the IWG criteria 
to be utilized in this study.

•Biomarker Measures: Blood and tumor s amples will be col lected at the times indicated in Section 5.6  of the 
protocol for the measurement of biomarkers relevant to dose selection  
. Further details of blood and tumor collection and processing will be provided to the s ite in the

•Immunogenicity Measures: Serum samples to evaluate th e development of anti-drug antibody (ADA) response 
to nivolumab and ipilimumab (where applicable) in combination with BMS-986205 will be collected at specified 
time points.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Determination:
Part 1 Dose Escalation: As a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial, the sample size at each dos e in these arms depends on observed toxicity and 
posterior inference. For BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab (with BMS-986205 lead-in), approximately 
30 subjects are expected to be treated during the dose escalation phase. Initially, approximately 3 sub jects will be 
treated at the starting dose levels of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab. Due to the potential for early 
discontinuation, additional subject(s) may be enrolled to ensure approx imately 3 evaluable subjects at each dose level. 
Additional increments of approximately 3 evaluable subjects  will be treated in recommended dose levels per 
BLRM(-Copula) model during the dose escalation phase. At  least 6 DLT-evaluable sub jects will be treated in the 
selected dose cohort(s) chosen for expansion. Due to th e BMS-986205 lead-in period, more than 3 subjects per cohort 
may be treated per BMS-986205 dose level considering potential DLTs that may happen within the lead-in period.
Part 2 Dose Expansion: 
Eight disease-restricted populations and 1 cohort for various tumors will be included in cohort expansion. These are 
cervical cancer, DLBCL, SCCHN, bladder cancer, NSCL C, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. 
An additional cohort will be dedicated to tumor types from the escalation inclu sion criteria, which do not currently 
have a dedicated expansion cohort or plans for evaluation in  other studies. The eligible tumor types will be triple 
negative breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, epithelial cancer of the ovary, and sarcoma. 
A Simon 2-stage (optimal) design will be used as a gui de for many of the tumor-specific cohorts (see below for 
exceptions). The 2-stage design with a reasonable false positiv e rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), based on 
assumptions of true (target) and historic objective response rate (ORR) for each indication, will provide guidance for 
the total sample size for each cohort. The sample sizes are provided in  Table 3  although not used for hypothesis testing. 
Enrollment will be continued during initial efficacy evaluation (i e, with the indicated number of subjects at Stage 1) 
to ensure that additional subjects are enrolled to account for unexpected trial impact, such as response non-evaluable 
subjects due to early drop out, design parameter change (eg, historical rate update), and so on.

For an expansion cohort of approximately 35 subjects in  the cervical, melanoma: prior anti-PD-(L)1, pancreatic, 
NSCLC: prior anti-PD-(L)1, and DLBCL c ohorts, and an assumed true response rate of 30%, there is a 94% chance 
of observing at least 7 responses (in other words, the FNR is 6%). If the true response rate is only 10% rather than 
30%, then there is a 6% chance that there will be at least 7 responses in 35 subjects (in other words, FPR is 6%). Also, 
if 7 responses are observed (eg, 20% observed response rate), the lower bound of the 80% confidence interval (CI) for 
the ORR is 11% (higher than historical ORR of 10%). The CI is calculated using Clopper-Pearson method.
For an expansion cohort of approximately 27 subjects in the bladder and SCCHN tumors and assumed true response 
rate is 50%, there is a 88% chance of observing at least 11 re sponses (in other words, the FNR is 12%). If the true 
response rate is only 25% rather than 50%, then there is a 5% chance that there will be at least 11 responses in 
27 subjects (in other words, FPR is 5%). If 11 responses are observed (eg, 40% observed res ponse rate), the lower 
limit of the 80% CI for the ORR is 28% (higher than historical ORR of 25%). The CI is calculated using Clopper 
Pearson method.
For an expansion cohort of approximately 37 subjects with  melanoma with prior anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 
therapy, and an assumed true response rate of 20%, there is a 85% chance of observing at least 5 responses (in other 
words, the FNR is 15%). If the true response rate is only 5% rather than 20%, then there is a 14% chance that there will be at least 5 responses in 37 s ubjects (in other words, FPR is 14%). Also, if 5 res ponses are observed (eg, 14% 
observed response rate), the lower bound of the 80% CI for the ORR is 7% (higher than historical ORR of 5%). The CI is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
The Simon 2-stage design will not be used for the mix ed cohort of additional signal seeking tumor types. 
Approximately 35 to 40 subjects will be enrolled to allow for the exploration of early efficacy signals seen during the 
dose escalation portion of the trial as well as potential signals arising from ongoing trials of other IDO1 inhibitors in combination with anti-PD-(L)1. A 2-stage design will als o not be utilized for the I-O naive Melanoma, NSCLC, and 
renal cell carcinoma cohorts, as nivolumab is already an established standard of care. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in each of these cohorts to allow for the exploration of early ef ficacy signals of BMS-986205 in

Approximately 16 Mela noma IO-naive BRAF mutant subjects post-BRAF regimen therapy will be randomized into 
two cohorts and w ill either be treated with nivolumab or nivol umab in combination with BMS 986205, though will 
not be used for formal statistical comparison.
If there is preliminary evidence of the treatment effect that may represent substantial improvement over available 
therapies, the protocol may be amended to include sufficient additional subjects who will be treated to demonstrate a 
substantial and clinically meaningful effect in ORR that is supported by duration of the effect. The total sample size 
at this stage will be determined based on the ability to  produce a CI which would exclude an ORR of the historic 
response and to provide sufficient information for a reliable understanding of the safety profile.
Part 3 Combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
The combination of BMS-986205 with nivolumab  and ipilimumab in Part 3 will be evaluated in 2 parts, the safety 
evaluation phase and the cohort expansion phase of the combination in melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer as 
well as a mixed tumor type cohort.
All safety cohorts will begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the triplet combination regimen in a 
limited number of subjects, including a sentinel subject. As described in Section 3.1.1.2, the NSCLC and melanoma 
regimen cohorts will begin enrollment firs t, followed by the bladder regimen c ohort once safety and tolerability has 
been established in either NSCLC or melanoma. Initially, approximately 3 subjects will be treated at the selected dose 
combination of BMS-986205 with nivolu mab and ipilimumab. Due to the poten tial for early discontinuation, an 
additional subject(s) may be enrolled to ensure approximately 3 DLT evaluable subjects. Initial safety assessment to allow enrollment in the bladder safety cohort will occur when at least 2 evaluable subjects in either the NSCLC or 
melanoma safety cohorts have completed  a 6-week DLT evaluation period (see Section 4.5.1  for criteria for DLTs). 
In the melanoma and NSCLC safety evaluation cohorts, if the potential DLT occurring in any third evaluable subject regarding the specific dose combination does not influe nce the recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) to open 
enrollment in the bladder safety cohort, then the bladder safety cohort may proceed with enrollment without waiting for the third subject to complete the corresponding DLT obser vation period. After the initial subjects in each treatment 
regimen are evaluated, additional increments of approximately 3 to 6 subjects will be treated in the same safety cohort 
as per BLRM-copula model recommendation that the dose co mbination is safe. At least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects 
will be treated and assessed in the selected dosing regimen safety cohort before starting enrollment in the expansion 
cohort for that tumor type/regimen. Up to 12 DLT-evaluable sub jects in total may be treated in the safety evaluation 
cohort for each tumor type at the dose selected for expansion cohorts for evaluation of safety and 
pharmacodynamic/PK parameters as required. BLRM (-copula) will be  used to monitor the safety of the triplet dose 
combination on an ongoing basis. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment related toxicities meeting DLT criteria within an individual treatment tumor type/regimen exceeds 33% across all subjects treated in the safety evaluation 
and dose expansion cohorts, the findings will be discusse d and further enrollment may be interrupted. At that time, 
depending on the nature and grade of the toxicities and afte r assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) of BMS 
986205 for subjects within that dosing regimen may be in itiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose 
level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.
Once the initial safety and tolerability has been establishe d independently for each regimen based on safety cohort 
evaluations, enrollment will begin of subjects into expansion cohorts for further evaluation of safety and tolerability, 
as well as preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor eff icacy. In the expansion phase, each BMS-986205 and 
nivolumab/ipilimumab combination regimen will be evaluated  in tumor-specific cohorts based on the tumor type 
evaluated in the safety cohorts (melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer). The Ipi 1Q8 regimen will also be evaluated in a mixed tumor-type cohorts, which may incorporate tum or types evaluated in Part 2 Dose Expansion. This 40 
subject cohort is used to obtain preliminary safety, PK, and PD data for the triplet combination in other tumor types.
As all sub jects in th e melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder disease-specific c ohorts w ill be receiving agents (nivolumab 
and ipilimumab) with known efficacy, a single-stage de sign will be u tilized for each of these tumor types. 
Approximately 40 subjects will be enro lled in each of the following cohorts: melanoma PD-L1 positive, melanoma 
PD-L1 negative, NSCLC PD-L1 positive, NSCLC PD-L1 negative bladder, and mixed tumor type to allow for the 
exploration of early efficacy signals of BMS-986205 in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in relevant subpopulations In each NSCLC expansion cohort, approx imately 10 subjects will be IO-tr eatment naive, 25 will be

treatment-naive, and 5 IO-therapy experienced. In the melanoma cohorts, approximately 35 will be treatment naïve in 
the advanced setting and 5 will be IO-therapy experienced  in each cohort. In the bladder expansion cohort in Part 3, 
at least 30 subjects will be I O therapy naive.
The anti-tumor activity of the expansion cohorts will be continuously monitored in all subjects who are evaluable for 
response using the measurements described in Section 8.3.1 . In the NSCLC cohort, 16 of 25 responses for the 
treatment naïve subjects would result in 80% CIs for an ORR that is strictly higher than the historical rate of 45.3%.
1In the melanoma cohort, 22 of 35 responses for the treatment naïve subjects would result in 80% CIs for ORRs that 
are strictly higher than the historical rates of 580.0%).2In the bladder cohort, 16 of 30 responses would result in 80% 
CI for ORR that is strictly higher than the historical rate of 38.5%.3The CIs are calculated using the Clopper-Pearson 
method.
Endpoints:
Primary Endpoints:
The primary objective of this  study is to establish the safety, tolerab ility, and the MTD/MAD/alternate dose of 
BMS-986205 as monotherapy, and in combination with nivolumab and with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The 
assessment of safety will be based on the incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and deaths. In 
addition, clinical laboratory test abnormalities will be examined. AEs and laboratory values will be graded according 
to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
The co-primary objective, anti-tumor activity of BMS -986205 in combin ation with nivolumab in Part 2 (dose 
expansion) and BMS-986205 in combination with both nivol umab and ipilimumab in Part 3, will be measured by 
ORR, DoR, and PFSR based on RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors or IWG for blood tum or. For Parts 1 and 2, disease 
assessment with CT and/or MRI as appropriate will be performed at baseline, end of Cycle 2, and every 8 weeks. For 
Part 3, in the melanoma cohorts, the first tumor assessment will occur at Week 12; subsequent imaging will be every 8 weeks thereafter during the treatment period; for NSCLC, imaging assessments will occur every 6 weeks during the treatment period; for bladder, imaging assessments will occur every 6 weeks during the treatment period up to 24 
weeks, and then occur every 12 weeks thereafter during the treatment period. For all study parts, assessments continue every 12 weeks for the first year after the EOT visit, and then every 6 months thereafter, up to 2 years following the 
EOT visit until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or IWG,  or until confirmed disease progression for subjects 
treated beyond progression (defined as an add itional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of 
initial progression including all target lesions and new measurable lesions), at the co mpletion of follow-up, or until 
subjects withdraw from the study.
1) Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation over the st udy as a whole, rec orded 
between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to subsequent therapy. CR or PR 
determinations included in the BOR a ssessment must be confirmed by a s econd scan performed no less than 4 
weeks after the criteria for response are first met. For those subjects who have surgical resection, only presurgical 
tumor assessments will be considered in the determination of BOR.
2) ORR is defined as the proportion of all treated subjects whose BOR is either a CR or PR.
3) DoR, computed for all treated subjects with a BOR of CR or PR, is defined as the time between the date of first 
response and the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.
4) PFSR at 24 weeks, 1 year, a nd 2 years: The proportion of tr eated subjects remaining progression free and 
surviving at 24 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years if sufficient data are available. The proportion will be calculated by the 
Kaplan-Meier estimate, which takes into account censored data.
Secondary endpoints:
Pharmacokinetics: Selected BMS-986205 parameters, such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC(TAU), Ctrough, CLT/F, CLR/F, 
Vss/F, AI, %UR24,

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
This is a dose escalation and cohort expansion study of BMS-986205, an inhibitor of the 
indol eamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme, in combination with nivolumab 
(anti-programmed cell death-1 [PD-1]) and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
(anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4]) in humans with advanced malignant tumors. This study will be conducted in  3 parts. Part 1 (Dose Escalation) will evaluate 
the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of escalating oral doses of BMS-986205 in combinat ion with a flat dose of nivolumab in order to identify the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose(s) of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab to be used in Part 2. Part 2 ( Dose Expansion) will assess the preliminary efficacy 
of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in specific malignant disease populations and will also serve to generate further data to support dose optimization of the combination. Part 3 will evaluate the safety profile, tolera bility, and preliminary efficacy of BMS-986205 in 
combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in specific malignant disease populations. The 
study also includes a clinical pharmacology substudy designed to evaluate the potential eff ect of 
BMS-986205 on the QTc interval.
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Background and Rationale for Inhibition of IDO
Immunomodulation-based therapies for cancer have become established in recent years and are 
now one of the most successful and important st rategies for treating subjects with hematological 
malignancies and solid tumors.
1It is now clear that an anti-cancer antigen-specific immune 
response is the result of a complex dynamic interplay between antigen-presenting cells (APCs), 
T lymphocyte cells, and the target cancer cells.2The most extensively studied targets of 
immunotherapy in cancer are the negative regulatory receptors, CTLA-4 and PD-1.3Inhibition of 
these negative regulatory receptors, referred to as immune checkpoint blockade, results in the 
enhanced activation of T-cell responses and potent anti-tum or activity in preclinical models. 
Trials with CTLA-4 blocka de provide d the first clinical evidence of improvement in overall 
survival with immune modulatory anti-can cer therapy in subjects with metastatic melanoma.4,5
Following that, Topalian et al showed that anti-PD-1 anti body produced objective responses in 
subjects with non-small cell l ung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal cell cancer (RCC).6
Following on the success of CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 pathway-targeted agents, the f ield of tumor 
immunotherapy is rapidly expanding. In addition to blocking co-inhibitory pathways, targeting 
the immunosuppressive properties of the cancer cells  themselves is considered a promising 
approach especially in combination with antibody-based immunotherapy. It is possible that 
combination therapies could potentially lead to greater depth of res ponse and overall survival as 
has been noted with the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 in advanced melanoma 
subjects.7,8Subjects with m etastatic or refractory tumors have a very poor prognosis, and despite 
advances in multimodal therapy, increases in overall survival in this subject population have 
been limited.

BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
IDO1 catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine, which is the first and 
rate-limiting step leading to the production of kynurenine and downstream metabolites. The 
activity of IDO1 causes immune tolerance by inhibiting T-cell function through local depletion 
of the essential amino acid tryptophan and through generation of inhibitory kynurenine pathway 
metabolites.9In healthy humans, IDO1 is expressed in the pl acenta, the mucosa of the female 
genital tract, the lungs, and the lymphoid organs.10IDO1 expression in the placenta is believed 
to play a role in maternal tolerance to allogeneic fetuses11; however, its functional roles in the 
lungs and female genital tract are not as clear, but it may be involved in combating infections or 
play a role in immune tolerance in those tissu es. In the immune system, IDO1 is expressed in 
dendritic cells and macrophages. It is strongly induced by pro -inflammatory mediators such as 
interferon-gamma (IFN γ) and endotoxins during the late phase of inflammatory reactions, in 
which its immunosuppressive role contributes to the physiologic feedback control of the immune response.
12
IDO1 is highly expressed in several types of human malignancies. High levels or frequencies of 
IDO1 expression are detected in endometri al, cervical, head a nd neck, non -small cell lung, 
kidney, colorectal, bl adder/urothelial, and ovarian carcinomas  as well as in renal cell carcinoma, 
melanoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).10,13IDO1 expression in tumors is 
believed to induce immune tolerance as evident by a decrease in tumor infiltration of immune 
cells and an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytic populations. Increased IDO1 is also corr elated with diverse tumor progression 
parameters and shorter patient-survival time in many cancer indications.14In melanoma, IDO1
has been shown to be significantly up-regulated  together with the programmed death receptor-
ligand 1 (PD-L1).15The enzyme is also reported to be a critical resistance mechanism in anti-
tumor T-cell immunotherapy targeting CTLA-4.16Furthermore, tumor IDO1 transcript is 
increased in subjects with advanced melan oma and metastatic RCC after treatment with the 
anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab.17,18These findings suggest that IDO1 is an important regulator 
of the immunosuppressive mechanisms respons ible for tumor escape  from host immune 
surveillance. Inhibition of IDO1 using pharmaceut ical agents may alleviate the 
immunosuppressive properties of the tum or microenvironment and achieve more durable 
responses and greater subject survival benefits, part icularly when used in combination with other 
cancer immunotherapy agents, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab.
1.1.2 Rationale for BMS-986205 Monotherapy Lead-in Cycle
The totality of the preclinical data with BMS-986205 as well as published clinical data from 
another IDO1 inhibitor (epacadostat, Incyte corporation) showi ng no objective responses in 
approximately 50 subjects with advanced maligna ncies treated in a monotherapy trial19, strongly 
suggest that BMS-986205 w ill not provi de benefit to sub jects as a monotherapy. It is, however, 
expected to broaden and deepen the responses  that have been seen with other immune-
modulating anti-cancer agents. Thus, this first-in -human Phase 1/2a study  has been designed in 
such a way as to balance the need for sufficient assessment of the short-term clinical profile of BMS-986205 monotherapy prior to allowing the same subjects to receive tr eatment in

combination with nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody). In Part 1 of this study, subjects will 
receive 1 monotherapy lead-in cycle with daily oral administration of BMS-986205 for 2 weeks duration in order to characterize the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic profile of BMS-986205 
monotherapy. Based on the predicted human half-life of BMS-986205 of 23 hours, this 2-week interval is expected to cover the anticipate d time frame for the occ urrence of clinically 
significant early-onset adverse events (AEs) related to BMS-986205 monotherapy.
1.1.3 Rationale for Combination of BMS-986205 with Nivolumab
PD-1 is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, 
and APCs.
20Binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L2 has been shown to down-regulate T-cell 
activation in both murine and human systems.21,22,23,24PD-1/PD-L1 interactions may also 
indirectly modulate the response to tumor anti gens through T- cell/APC interactio ns. Therefore, 
PD-1 engagement may represent one means by which tumors evade immunosurveillance and clearance.
25Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab has been studied in a variety of 
preclinical in vitro assays, and anti-tumor activity using a murine analog of nivolumab has been 
shown in a number of immunocompetent mouse cancer models.26Nivolumab has been approved 
as treatment for melanoma, NSCLC (both non-squamous and squamous histologies), head and 
neck cancer, RCC, bladder cancer, and H odgkin’s lymphoma (HL) in the United States (US),
and is being evaluated extensively across a wide range of other solid tumors and hematologi cal 
malignancies.
PD-1-blockade enhances T-cell migration to tumors by elevating IFNγ inducible chemokines. 
IDO1 expression is also known to be strongly regulated by IFN γ. In fact, in clinical trials of 
subjects with advanced  melanoma a nd metastatic RCC tr eated with nivolumab, IDO1 gene 
expression was increased in subjects on treatment17,18. These post-treatment increases in the 
expression of IDO1 are indicative of potential adaptive mechanisms of resistance to counteract 
the increased anti-tumor immune cell activity potentiated by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. These data support the hypothesis that combination treatment coul d result in enhanced anti-tumor activity by 
providing a second mechanism of alleviating tumor mediated immunosuppression.
1.1.4 Rationale for Combination of BMS-986205 with Both Nivolumab and 
Ipilimumab
Immunosuppression within tumors is the result of a complex interaction of multiple signaling pathways. Signaling may be accomplished through cell surface-bound proteins such as PD-1 and 
CTLA-4, as well as through soluble mediators such as kynurenine (produced via IDO1) and 
others. Therefore, there are multiple points at which immune -directed therapies could act to 
relieve tumor-induced immune suppression.
Support for the synergistic effects of combin ing individual immuno-oncology agents with 
non-overlapping mechanisms of action has been provided by both preclinical and clinical 
studies. The most well-studied combination to  date has been PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor 
blockade in improving anti-tumor activity. Pr eclinically, in vitro combinations of nivolumab and
ipilimumab increase IFN γ production 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte

reaction. Increased anti-tumor activity of the co mbination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic 
murine cancer models. In a murine MEL vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4 or PD-1 
antibodies increased the proportion of CTLA-4 and PD-1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating 
T effector cells, and dual blockade increas ed tumor infiltration of T effector cells and decreased 
intratumoral Tregs, as compared to either agent alone.
Clinical evidence supporting the combination of immune-modulating therapies has been 
observed across multiple tumor types in the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, as well 
as other agents targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. See Section 1.1.5.2 for a discussion of the 
synergistic clinical effects of combining these agents in specific tumor types. In addition,
expression of IDO1 has been found to correlate with that of PD-L1 in tissue from patients with melanoma. C linically, tr eatment with anti-PD1 is associated with increases in IDO1 transcript 
levels in melanoma and RCC
17,18. Preclinically, there is also evidence that treatment with anti-
CTLA-4 therapy leads to an increase in IDO1 transcripts16.These findings suggest that a 
combination of therapies targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, and IDO1 may be synergistic and provide 
additional benefit over therapies targeting only on e or two of these immune-regulatory pathways.
This in turn may lead to improved clinical ou tcomes by increasing the number of patients who 
response to nivolumab and ipilimu mab therapies, while also potentially increasing the depth and 
duration of responses to those therapies.  
1.1.5 Rationale for Tumor Selection
IDO1 is overexpressed in several types of human malignancies and is often correl ated with poor 
prognosis. Examination of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database reveals that IDO1
exhibits a broad range of gene expression across these various tumor types. In order to address 
the question of which tumor types will be most likely to respond to IDO1 inhibition, tumors with varying levels of IDO1 expression we re selected for furt her study during c ohort expansion in 
Part 2, including cervical cancer and DLBCL at the high end and pancreatic cancer at the lower end. Published data describing IDO1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) across 
multiple tumor types were used to confirm presence of IDO1 in the tumor indications suggested 
by the TCGA analysis. Human tumor samples from priority indications were obtained and analyzed for kynurenine levels to confirm that elevated IDO1 expressi on levels also correlate 
with elevated IDO1 activity. 
1.1.5.1 BMS-986205 and Nivolumab Combination
Given the hypothesis that IDO1 inhibition will increase both the depth and breadth of anti-PD-1 
therapy, tumor selection for Parts 1 and 2 was further prioritized based on tumors in which PD-1 
blockade has shown activity (ie, melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma [RCC], and squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck [SCCHN]), as  well as tumors that to date have shown 
insensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment (ie, pancreatic cancer). 
As of Nov-2016, there are external data from another IDO1 inhibitor/anti-PD-1 combination 
(epacadostat/pembrolizumab), show ing clinical p roof of concept in treatment-naïve advanced 
melanoma subjects. There  was an objective response rate (ORR) of 58% in 19 evaluable 
advanced melanoma patients, as compared to an ORR of 34% reported for pembrolizumab

monotherapy as per the European Union ( EU) Summary of Product Characteristics27and the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information.28
In order to gain understanding of which specific subset(s) of patients with melanoma will benefit 
from IDO1 inhibition in combination with nivolumab, distinct cohorts of melanoma subjects will be studied during dose expansion in Part 2:
•Immuno-oncology (I-O) naïve, PD-L1 positive and negative: Nivolumab is approved for the 
treatment of first-line advanced melanoma across PD-L1 status. These c ohorts (40 s ubjects 
each) are added in order to assess potential synergistic activity of adding IDO1 inhibition to a known standard of care. 
•I-O naïve, BRAF mutated, post-BRAF-targeted therapy: Nivolumab is also approved for the treatment of first-line adva nced melanoma across BRAF mutation status. Many of the BRAF 
mutated subjects who were treated in nivolu mab trials had received prior BRAF-targeted 
therapy and still demonstr ated clinical benefit with nivolumab. In addition, there is evidence 
of an increase in tumor infiltrating lymphoc ytes and an upregulation of PD-L1 following 
BRAF inhibition,
29which suggests that the combination of an anti-PD-1 agent with an IDO1 
inhibitor may be particularly beneficial in this subset of patients. However, there are not 
sufficient prospective data on the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy (40 subjects per arm)
in this population. T hus, these subjects w ill be randomized to receive either BMS-986205 in 
combination with nivolumab or nivolumab monotherapy in order to generate a robust, 
prospective d ataset with nivolumab monotherapy to serve as a basis for understanding the 
potential added benefit of combination therapy. 
•Prior anti-PD-(L)1 and prior anti-PD-(L)1 + anti-CTLA-4 combination regimen therapy: Recurrent or progressive melanoma following tr eatment with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy or 
the anti-PD-(L)1 + anti-CTLA-4 combination represents areas of high unmet medical need. These cohort s (approximately 35 subjects each) are added in order to assess whether IDO1 
inhibition can act as a mechanism to restore anti-tumor activity in these subjects (refer to 
Section 1.1.1 for supporting data).
NSCLC will also be evaluated in distinct settings:
•I-O naïve, PD-L1 positive and negative: Nivo lumab is an approved therapy for the treatment 
of advanced NSCLC across PD-L1 status. Th ese cohorts (40 subjects) are added in order to 
assess potential synergistic activity of adding I DO1 inhibition to a known standard of care.
•I-O experienced: Recurrent or progressive NSCLC following anti-PD-(L)1 therapy 
represents an area of high unmet medical need. This cohort (35 subjects) is added in order to 
assess if IDO1 inhibition can act as a mechanism to restore anti-tumor activity in these 
patients.
Decisions regarding tumor selection were made so that novel combination therapies could 
potentially bring benefit to sub jects with high unmet medical need, as is the case with these 
subjects with advanced malignancy. Additionally, consideration was given to the inclusion of other tumor types from the dose escalation portion of the trial that do not currently have plans for 
evaluation in other studies, which will  be based on emerging clinical data.

1.1.5.2 BMS-986205, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab Combinations 
The tumors selected for the evaluation of triplet combination in Part 3 are NSCLC, melanoma, 
and bladder cancer. Selection was based on evidence of high levels of IDO1 expression (see 
Section 1.1.1 ); the potential to evaluate BMS-986205 with varying doses and schedules of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab in tumor types with established safety and tolerability profiles for those regimens (see Section 1.1.6.2 ); and evidence of increasing clinical benefit with 
combination immuno-therapy over monotherapy  with either agent, described below.
Melanoma
Ipilimumab and nivolumab were both initially evaluated and approved as single agents in metastatic melanoma before being approved in combination.
Ipilimumab was initially approved as monotherapy based on the Phase 3 MDX010-020 study. In 
this study, compared to melanoma peptide vaccine (gp100), ipilimumab improved OS (10 versus 
6 months) and ORR (6 and 11% for ipilimumab-con taining arms versus 2% in the gp100 arm).
30
Subsequent to this, nivolumab was approved for th e treatment of metastatic melanoma based on 
the CA209037 and CA209066 studies. In CA209037, compared to investigator’s cho ice of 
chemotherapy, nivolumab administered at 3 m g/kg every 2 weeks improved both objective 
response (32% versus 11%) and CR rates (3% versus 0%).31
The synergistic combination of the 2 agents was evaluated in the CA209067 and CA209069 
studies. In both studies, the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab improved outcomes
compared to ipilimumab. In CA20906732, the combination demonstrated a response rate of 58%, 
numerically higher than either single agent (44% for nivolumab, 19% for ipilimumab). In 
CA209069, the same combination doses achieved a response rate of 61%, si gnificantly greater 
than that of ip ilimumab al one (11%).33PD-L1 status appeared to affect response rates in 
CA209067, as subjects treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab with PD-L1 positive tumors had 
a response rate of 72.1% versus 54.8% in PD-L1 negative tumors.  Based on those init ial results, 
the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was approved as therapy in the first-line treatment 
of metastatic melanoma and became the first combination immuno-oncol ogy reg imen approved 
in any tumor type.
NSCLC
Nivolumab has been approved as monotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC with 
progression on or after platinum-based chemothera py. The approval was based on the results of 
CA209017, a randomized trial of nivolumab versus docetaxel. The median overall survival (OS) for patients in the nivolumab arm was 9.2 months versus 6 months for those in the docetaxel arm 
(HR = 0.59). Improvement in survival was observed for nivolumab.
34A second Phase 3 study, 
CA209057, lead to the approval in non-squamous histologies with a 27% reduction in risk of 
death (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). Nivolumab also significantly improved ORR versus docetaxel (P
= 0.0246), with ORR as high as 36% in subjects with PD-L1 expressing tumors. OS
approximately doubled with nivolumab versus docetaxel.35

Ipilimumab has been shown to have activity in lung cancer. A Phase 2 study (CA184041) in 
subjects with NSC LC or small cell l ung cancer (SCLC) investigated  the addition of ipilimumab
to carboplatin and paclitaxel using 2 different  schedules (concurrent and phased). The phased
schedule demonstrated a significant improvemen t of immune-related progression-free survival as
well as progression-free survival by modified WHO criteria compared to chemotherapy alone, in
both NSCLC and SCLC.32
Based on data in melanoma, which led to the approval of ipilimumab and nivolumab 
combination therapy, as well as the activity observed with nivolumab and ipilimumab
individually in NSCLC, the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination has been also evaluated as 
first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. In the CA209012 trial, various schedules of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab were evaluated in tr eatment-naïve subjects with stage IV or 
metastatic NSCLC. Promising clinical activity was observed, with response rates for the 
combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab (38% to 47%) at least similar if not improved 
relative to those observed with platinum-based chemotherapy. Response rates appeared greater in 
subjects when PD-L1 status was taken into account, with ORR reaching 90% in those subjects 
with PD-L1 expression greater than 50%.36
These data provided proof of con cept of combinatorial activity of immunotherapy agents in 
NSCLC and led to the initiation of CA209227, a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial evaluating 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolu mab plus ipilimumab versus plat inum doublet chemotherapy in 
subjects with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC.
Bladder Cancer 
High levels of programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression have been noted in 
bladder/urothelial carcinoma (UC), suggesting tumor-associated immune tolerance and escape 
from immune surveillance. PD-L1 expression has been reported in approximately 20% (5% 
cutoff) and 30% (1% cutoff) of tumor tissue sample.37,38,39PD-1 and PD-L1 immune checkpoint 
inhibitors appear to show benefit in patients with disease progression on platinum-based therapy.
37In an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 expansion cohort in patients with metastatic 
UC, nivolumab elicited a response rate of 24.4% with acceptable safety, regardless of tumor PD-
L1 expression, in patients who had received 1 or more prior lines of chemotherapy 
(CA209032).38In a larger study in unresectable or metastatic UC, CA209275, nivolumab had 
clinically meaningful efficacy and a manageable safety profile.39At 7 months of median follow-
up, 24.4% of patients remain on therapy. Confi rmed overall respons e rate (ORR) was 19.6% 
(95% CI: 15.0, 24.9). Nivolumab was granted accel erated approval in 2017 as monotherapy in 
bladder cancer based on these results.
Ipilimumab has been explored precystectomy in a pilot trial of patients with clinically localized 
bladder cancer. In this trial, 12 patients were treated with 2 doses of ipilimumab (n = 6 treated 
with 3 mg/kg and n = 6 treated with 10 mg/kg).40Most drug-related adverse events (AEs) were 
Grade 1 or 2, all patients demonstrated an increase in CD4+ ICOShi T cells in tumor tissue and 
systemic circulation, and 8/12 patients had down-staging of their disease on final pathology

review. The efficacy and safety of first-lin e gemcitabine, cisplatin  plus ipilimumab for metastatic 
UC is being investigated in a Phase 2 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
The CA209032 study has ev aluated the combination of nivo lumab and ipilimumab in bladder 
cancer after first-line chemotherapy. Preliminary results from that study revealed overall 
response rates of 36% to 38.5% for a nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations in this patient 
population.41To evaluate this further, a Phase 3 trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab in recurrent 
or platinum refractory bladder cancer has been initiated. The potential for increasing clinical 
activity with the combination of immunotherapy agents in bladder cancer supports the evaluation 
of the combination of BMS-986205, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.
1.1.6 Rationale for Dose and Schedule
1.1.6.1 Dose and Schedule for BMS-986205
Selection of FIH Starting Dose
The selection of BMS-986205 starting dose and sc hedule is based on the pivotal 1-month 
toxicology studies in rats and dogs and the extrapolation of in vivo data from preclinical efficacy 
models in mice.
In the pivotal 1-month oral repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, the dose of 20 mg/kg once daily 
(QD) was established as the MTD and the dose th at produces severe toxicity to 10% (STD10) of 
rats. A dose of 5 mg/kg/day was considered to be the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) 
in the 1-month rat study. In the 1-month dog st udy, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day was the highest 
nonseverely toxic dose (HNSTD) and also the NOAEL. Using body surf ace area c onversion, a 
human equivalent dose (HED) of 3.2 mg/kg wa s determined based on the rat STD10, one-tenth 
of which will suggest a starting dose of 0 .32 mg/kg in humans. Si milarly, base d on the dog 
HNSTD and scaled by body surface area, a HED of 16.2 mg/kg can be calculated, one-sixth of 
which would suggest a starting dose of 2.7 mg/kg. The rat was considered the most appr opriate 
species to determine the maximum recommended starting dose because, although the toxicity 
profiles were generally similar in both rats and dogs , the rat was the most sensitive species with a 
lower projected starting dose. The maximum starting dose of 0.32 mg/kg (25 mg based on a 
median body weight of 80 kg) was therefore selected for this study. Based on the observed 
exposure in rats and predicted human PK, the starting dose of 25 mg would project an exposure 
(area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose [AUC(0-24h)])margin of 65 relative to the MTD/STD10 and 15 relative to the NOAEL. At the 
HNSTD/NOAEL in dogs, the exposure margin was 33 relative to the projected AUC at the 
starting dose of 25 mg in humans.
In preclinical models in mice (M109), administration of BMS-986205 QD resulted in significant 
reduction in kynurenine levels in both serum and in tumor tissues in a dose-dependent manner. 
Given the projected human half-life of ~23 hours, a QD dosing schedule was s elected for this 
initial study.

In preclinical studies in dogs, approximately 2- to 3-fold higher exposures were observed when 
dosing with food compared to under fasting condition (see Section 1.4.3 ). BMS-986205 will be 
administered after a light meal (see Section 4.2) in order to optimize the systemic exposure. 
Selection of Dose for Dose Expansion (Part 2), Combination with Nivolumab and 
Ipilimumab (Part 3)
Based on the preliminary clinical safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data observed to date, cohort expansion in Part 2 was opene d using both 100 and 200 mg doses in combination 
with nivolumab.  This in itial s election of two doses for cohort expansion in Part 2 allowed for the 
continued accrual of data at both doses to support a fi nal dose decision. After review of safety, 
PK, and PD data, 100 mg was selected as the dose to be used for remaining subject enrollment in Part 2. See Section 1.4.4.4 , for the description of clinical safety and tolerability of 100 and 
200 mg and Section 1.4.4.1 for a discussion of the preliminary pharmacokinetic profile.
For Part 3 of this study, the maximum in itial dose of BMS-986205 ev aluated will be 100 mg 
daily. The selection of 100 mg was based on the a ggregate safety and PK data in combination 
with nivolumab across doses of BMS-986205 found to be safe and tolerable, as well as to 
provide an additional safety margin since the safety profile of BMS-986205 at 200 mg is 
acceptable in combination with nivolumab.  Lower doses may be evaluated based on emerging safety, PK, and PD data.
1.1.6.2 Dose and Schedule for Nivolumab in Combination with BMS-986205
Nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) has been approved for use as monotherapy in patients 
with melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC, and will be administered in combination with BMS-986205
for the dose escalation portion of the study (P art 1), as well as for the dose expansion cohorts that 
were included in the protocol prior to Amendment 06. Nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)will be administered in combination with  BMS-986205 for the dose expansion cohorts that are 
added with Amendment 06 (Part 2) [melanoma, NSCLC, and additional signal-seeking tumors]and the clinical pharmacology substudy (Part 3). This change in dosing interval as of 
Amendment 06 will provide a more convenient regimen for the patients. The expansion c ohorts 
that predated Amendment 06 will continue with the nivolumab 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen in 
order to ensure consistent dosing within each cohort.
The safety and efficacy of the 480 mg Q4W flat dose of nivolumab are expected to be similar to 
the approved nivolumab dose of 240 mg flat doses or 3 mg/kg Q2W. The nivolumab dose of 
480 mg Q4W was selected based on clinical data and modeling and simulation approaches using population PK (PPK) and exposure-response analyses of d ata from studies in multiple tumor 
types (melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC) where body weight norm alized dosing (mg/kg) has been 
used. The PPK analyses have shown that expos ure to nivolumab incr eased dose proportionally 
over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered Q2W, and no clinically meaningful 
differences in PK across ethnicities and tu mor types were observed. Nivolumab clearance and 
volume of distribution were found to increase as the body weight increases, but less than 
proportionally with increasing w eight, indicating that milligram pe r kilogram dosing represents 
an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. Using the PPK model, the

overall distributions of nivolumab average steady-state exposures are comparable after treatment 
with either nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or nivolumab  480 mg Q4W, although the flat dose regimen 
of 480 mg Q4W is predicted to result in approximately 40% higher steady-state peak 
concentration (Cmaxss) and approximately 20% lower steady-state trough concentrationscompared to the reference regimen of 3 mg/kg Q2W. Across the various tumor types in the clinical program, nivolumab has been shown to be safe  and well tolerated up to a dose level of 
10 mg/kg, and the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy 
and safety has been found to be relatively flat. Although nivolumab Cmaxss is predicted to be 
higher following 480 mg Q4W, these exposures are predicted to be lower than or within the exposure ranges observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program and are not considered to put subjects at in creased risk. The exposures predicted following 
administration of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W are on the flat part of the exposure-response curves 
for previously investigated tumors (melanoma and NSCLC) and are not predicted to affect 
efficacy. Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.
Of note, as an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody, nivolumab does not interact 
directly with cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzyme systems. Sys temic cytokine modulation data 
indicated that there were no meaningful changes in cytokines known to have indirect effects on 
CYP enzymes across all dose levels of nivolumab (0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg) during the course of 
treatment. Therefore, it is unlikely that nivolumab administered at either 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W will affect the systemic exposures of BMS-986205.
At the discretion of the Sponsor, and in agreement with the investigators, the 480 mg Q4W 
nivolumab dosing regimen in the designated expansion cohorts and clinical pharmacology 
substudy may revert back to 240 mg Q2W based on emerging PK, pharmacodynamic, and/or 
tolerability data from the cohort expansion portion of the trial.
1.1.6.3 Doses and Schedules for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Combination 
with BMS-986205
The safety profile of nivolumab and ipilimumab is well characterized from a large safety 
database at different dose and schedules as monotherapy or in combination in different tumor indications. Consistent with the mechanism of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab, the most 
frequently reported drug-r elated AEs observed in clinical trials  are those associated with 
activation of the immune system. The most common types of immune-mediated AEs include 
endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneum onitis, nephritis, and rash. In combination 
regimens, the frequency and intensity of these events vary and appear to depend on the specific dose and schedule used as well as the patient population/tumor type being treated. As described below, while the overall pattern of AEs observed with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab remains relatively consis tent across doses and schedules evaluated, the incidence and
severity of immune-mediated AEs varies across tumor types. Therefore, evaluation of safety and tolerability of specific dose/schedule combinations of nivolumab and ipilimumab with BMS-986205 in Part 3 will be evaluated in tumor types in which that nivolumab/ipilimumab regimenhas evidence of both tolerability and efficacy (see Section 1.1.5.2 ).

Melanoma
The regimen selected for evaluation of triplet therap y in melanoma is BMS-986205 in 
combination with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W.
The currently approved combination of nivolu mab and ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma is 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (N1I3) for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W ongoing. Two large randomized trials (CA209069 and CA209067) utilized this same dose regimen N1I3. In CA209067, Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were: nivolumab alone 
43.5%, ip ilimumab alone 55.6%, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab (N1I3) 68.7%. Discontinuation 
as a result of treatment was also highest in the combination group, 3 6.4%, as compared to 7.7% 
with nivolumab alone group and 14.8% of  those in the ipilimumab alone group.
33While the 
safety of N1I3 ratio was considered acceptable and majority of the AEs were managed with 
recommended treatment al gorithms, there is rationale that lowering the dose of ip ilimumab from 
3 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg could potentially reduce the incidence of high grade AEs. This led to the 
initiation of the CA209511 study, which is comparing N1I3 to a nivolumab 3 mg/kg and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (N3I1) regimen. In additi on, a separate cohort consisting ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg Q8W together with nivolumab 6 mg/kg (alternating with 480-mg flat dose) Q4W, all continuing until unacceptable toxicity is being evaluated.
The rationale for a regimen with Q8W ipilimumab dosing is to potentially optimize safety and 
efficacy while also extending the dosing interv als for the convenience of patients and h ealth care 
providers. From a safety perspective, this exte nded schedule of ipilimumab is predicted to lead to 
reduced incidence of high grade adverse events compared to regimens utilizing more frequent 
and/or higher doses of ipilimumab, while simultaneously allowing for an increase in the dose of nivolumab used in combination with ipilimumab.
Regarding PK, nivolumab dosing at 480 mg Q4W is expected to result in similar time averaged 
concentrations at steady s tate (Cavgss) as nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. In addition, nivolumab 
exposures following 480 mg are predicted to be below the those observed at doses up to 10 
mg/kg Q2W (used in the Phase 1 nivolumab clinical program) that have been shown to be safe 
and well tolerated
26.
Efficacy may also be improved through the addition of BMS-986205 to the use nivolumab 
480 mg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg regimen.  Combination regimens in which ipilimumab is continued beyond 4 doses until progression or intolerability have not been assessed in patients 
with advanced melanoma. Furthermore, it is  possible that patients receiving lower and less 
frequent ipilimumab doses will stay on the comb ination longer by reducing high grade AEs and 
thereby increasing the number of combination doses administered. This may result in improved 
efficacy.
Lastly, the proposed regimen may provide convenience to patients and health care providers, due 
to the increased interval between doses ( i.e. every 4 weeks instead of every 3 weeks).

NSCLC
The regimen selected for evaluation of triplet therapy in NSCLC is BMS-986205 in combination 
with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W.
Previous evaluations of nivolumab and ipilimu mab combinations in NSCLC were based on the 
success of combination therapy in melanoma as well as the evidence of monotherapy activity of 
nivolumab in NSCLC. Data from these cohorts d emonstrate nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W given with 
ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg Q6W is tolerable. Of particular note, the rate of discontinuation for this 
combination due to drug-related AEs  was 11% compared to 10% in the nivolumab monotherapy 
arm; fatigue was the most commonly reported AE related to st udy therapy in the combination 
arm (23.1%).36This combination regimen is being evaluated currently in the CA209227 study in 
first-line treatment of NSCLC.
A flat dose of nivolumab has b een selected for the current study. From a PK perspective, using 
the PPK model, the overall distributions of nivolumab average s teady-state exposures (Cavgss)
are predicted to be comparable after treatment with either nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or 360 mg 
Q3W. Although nivolumab Cmaxss is predic ted to be higher (23%) following 360 mg Q3W, 
these exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects at increased 
risk. The exposures predicted following administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are on the 
flat part of the exposure-response curves fo r previously investigated tumors, melanoma and 
NSCLC, and are not predicted to affect efficacy. Based on these data, nivolumab 360 mg Q3W is 
expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. Therefore the 
combination dosing schedule selected for this study (nivolumab 360 mg Q3W plus ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg Q6W) provides a combinat ion regimen where the immune-mediated AEs were mostly 
low grade and manageable with prompt use of corticosteroids.
Bladder Cancer
The regimen selected for evaluation of triplet therapy in bladder cancer is BMS-986205 in 
combination with nivolumab 80 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W for four doses, 
followed by nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations have been evaluated in advanced bladder cancer in the 
CA209032 trial. Subjects were tr eated with either nivolumab  1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
(N1I3) or nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (N3I1), both given Q3W for 4 cycles and 
then followed by nivolumab monotherapy. In contrast to the experience with nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations evaluated in other tumor types such as melanoma and NSCLC, 
treatment with higher doses of ipilimumab in bladder cancer were not associated with increased toxicity. Preliminary analysis of 24 subjects in the N1I3 (median follo w-up: 7.8 months) and 104 
subjects in N3I1 (median follow-up: 16.7 months ) showed that discontinuations due to study 
drug toxicity were approximately equal betw een the groups (8% for N1I3, 14% for N3I1) as 
were the rates of Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (30.8% for N1I3 and 31.7% for N3I1).

of ipilimumab may provide additional clinical activity, and taking into consideration the equal

1.1.7 Rationale for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab 30-minute Infusion
Long infusion times place a burden on sub jects and treatment centers. Establishing that 
nivolumab can be safely administered using shorter infusion times of 30 minutes duration in 
subjects will diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Both nivolumab and 
ipilimumab have been administered safely at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over these treatment 
durations. Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity r eactions have been 
uncommon across multiple clinical studies, and all have been managed by following the safety 
algorithms. Infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 
10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns compared with the prior experience at 
10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over the 60-minute duration. Similarly, shortened i nfusion 
duration of 30 minutes for ipilimumab is not expected to present additional safety concerns.42
1.1.8 Rationale for the Use of Tablet Formulation
A capsule formulation was used in the dose escalation (Part 1) and in patients participating the 
dose expansion (Part 2) of the study prior to Amendment 8. A tablet formulation has been developed to help reduce the pill burden and with  its smaller size,  provide ease of adminis tration. 
The tablet formulation became available for us e for sub jects in Part 2 (after implementation of 
Amendment 7), Part 3 and in the QTc clinical pharmacology substudy.
Biopharmaceutics studies (in vitro biorelevant dissolution and non-clinical pharmacokinetic 
studies) were conducted to investigate the in vitro and in vivo performance of the two dosage forms.
Biorelevant dissolution of the two dosage forms were compared in a non-sink, 2-stage USP-II 
apparatus (fed state gastric fluid, pH 5 → fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF), pH 5, 
transitioned at 20 min).  At a representative human dose of 100 mg, the dissolution profiles 
showed that both dosage forms disintegrate and dissolve rapidly, reaching a solub ility ind icative 
of complete drug release and dissolution in the intestinal fluid.  To confirm the finding, a pharmacokinetic study was conducted in the dog model using 4 male dogs, pentagastrin-treated, 
as a cross-over between the tablet and capsule dosage form (50 mg) in the fed-state. The 50 mg 
dog dose is equivalent to roughly 150 mg human effective dose based on body surface area dose adjustment.  The mean PK profiles for the two dosage forms were similar. The tablet was 80% 
bioavailable relative to the capsule formulation. The Cmax was 85% of the capsule, while the 
Tmax was the same
43.The mean values for Cmax and AUC were not statistically different 
(p>0.05, Student’s t-test).  The comparative PK parameters are listed in Table 1.1.8-1 .

Preliminary results from the dose escalation cohorts ind icated potentially significant biomarker

the significant overlap in the in vitro and in vivo performance of the dose forms, the tablet is 
expected to perform similarly compared to the capsule while improving subject convenience and compliance.
1.1.9 Rationale for Clinical Pharmacology Substudy
1.1.9.1 QTc SubstudyIn this substudy, the effect of BMS-986205 on the QTc interval will be evaluated. Preclinical 
evaluations did not identify a signal indicating that BMS-986205 may increase the QTc interval or have an adverse effect on cardiac conduction ( Section 1.4.2 ). Despite the low risk, such 
evaluation is required during the development of a therapeutic agent and the design of this study 
(treating subjects across a wide range of doses, the inclusion of a 2-week BMS-986205 
monotherapy leading-in period) is well suited for the evaluation of QTc risk, in particular, the characterization of the impact of BMS-986205 exposure on QTc changes. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs; reviewed by a core laboratory) will be collected with matching PK 
samples during the BMS-986205 monotherapy at steady state in subjects participating in the 
substudy. To minimize the potential effects of intr insic factors such as food ingestion and 
circadian patterns on QTc intervals, time-match ed baseline ECGs will be collected prior to the 
start of BMS-986205 treatment.
As nivolumab is known not to affect the QTc interval, only routine ECG monitoring will be 
collected during combination tr eatment in both dose es calation and dose expansion phase of the 
study.
1.1.10 Rationale for Use of Blood and Tumor Tissue in Biomarker Studies
Biomarkers are increasingly playing a key role in the development of cancer therapeutics. By 
tracking treatment-induced changes in molecular ma rkers measured in tissue and body fluids, the 
activity of experimental agents may be assessed and the details of their mechanisms of action may be elucidated. Such pharmacodynamic measures may be instrumental also for identifying 
appropriate doses and treatment sc hedules and may provide s upporting information for future 
regimens.
This study includes fresh pre- and on-treatment biopsies as well as co llection of archival tissue.  
Fresh biopsies will allow for assessment of key biomarker c orrelates which require 
contemporaneous tissue and specific processing (eg tumor kynurenine). Age limits on archival

tissues from subjects not providing fresh biopsies are required to allow for accurate interpretation 
of key biomarkers (eg PDL1) which may become compromised with age of sample.
The evaluation of pre- and on-treatment biopsies in this study is particularly critical for 
understanding biological consequences and clinical effects of combining therapies targeting 
multiple mechanisms simultaneously.  The co llection of both pre-treatment tumor biopsies and 
archival tumor tissue will provide important insight into questions related to mechanism of 
action and response to therapy.  
 
Identification and validation of critical markers  in archival tissue will potentially enable 
diagnostic test development for future selection of  patients most likely to respond to therapy
based on archival tissue alone and obviate the need for fresh biopsies in larger groups of patients.  
Blood and tumor tissue samples w ill be collected in this study at baseline and on tr eatment to 
identify molecular markers associated with clinical activity and mechanism of action of 
BMS-986205 in the lead-in phase or in combination with nivolumab ± ipilimumab. This 
information will be used to identify appropriate doses and treatment schedules of BMS-986205 
in combination with nivolumab and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
Additionally, examination of biomarkers in samples obtained prior to treatment may provide 
information that allows identification of subjects with specific characteristics that will respond best to these agents. Information gained from tumor samples will not be used to make individual 
subject treatment decisions, but may inform pursuit of a validated marker to inform optimized 
treatment decisions in future protocol amendments or separate studies.

1.4 Product Development Background
1.4.1 PharmacologyBMS-986205
BMS-986205 is a small molecule inhibitor of IDO1 with half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) biochemical potency of 13.3 ±1.8 nM and inhibitory constant (Ki) value of 21 ±3n M .  
Cellular potency as measured by the IC50 inhibition of kynurenine production was determined to 
be 1.11 ± 0.93 nM in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transiently expressing IDO1
and 1.71 ±0.07 nM in HeLa cells stimulated with IFN γ. In addition, BMS-986205 inhibited 
kynurenine production in human whole bloo d (hWB) stimulated with IFN γand LPS with an 
IC50 value of 33 ±4.2nM. In an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) using IDO1
expressing dendritic cells, BMS-986205 restored T- cell proliferation with a half max imal 
effective concentration (EC50) value of 1.2 ±0.4 nM.
BMS-986205 also exhibited significant pharmacodyn amic effects in reducing tumor and serum 
kynurenine levels in at least 2 different muri ne syngeneic tumor models. The maximal reduction 
in tumor kynurenine levels was observed between 6 and 7 hours after dosing and the effects were 
sustained for 24 hours.
More detailed information can be found in the current version of the BMS-986205 Investigator 
Brochure (IB).

Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotyp e monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 with 
nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant [K d], 3.06 nM) and a high degree of specificity. 
Nivolumab blocks binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nonclinical in vitro testing 
of nivolumab demonstrated that binding to PD-1 results in enhanced T- cell proliferation and 
release of IFN Jin vitro in MLR and cytomegalovirus assays. Additional details are provided in 
the current version of the nivolumab IB.
Ipilimumab
Ipilimumab is a fully human IgG1 (kappa) monoclonal antibody that has specificity and a high 
affinity for human CTLA-4. The calculated dissociation constant value from an average of 
several studies was 5.25 nM. Binding of ipilimumab to purified, recombinant human CTLA-4 
antigen was also demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with half-maximal 
binding at 15 ng/mL, whereas saturation was observed at approximately 0.1 Pg/mL. No cross-
reactivity was observed against human CD 28. Ipilimumab completely blocked bi nding of B7.1 
and B7.2 to human CTLA-4 at concentrations higher than 6 and 1 Pg/mL, respectively.
Additional details are provided in the current version of the ipilimumab IB.
1.4.2 Toxicity
The safety profile of BMS-986205 was evaluated in single- and repeat-dose oral toxicity studies 
up to 3 months in duration (rats and dogs) and in genetic toxicity, phototoxicity, and safety pharmacology assessments. Rats and dogs were used as the main species for toxicologic 
evaluation and unless otherwise stated, all animal studies were dosed daily by the oral route. 
Dogs were considered an appropriate nonrodent  species for nonclinical evaluation because of 
greater oral bioavailability (39%) compared to m onkeys (10%) and consequently higher systemic 
exposure to BMS-986205. The rat data was used to calculate the maximum recommended starting dose because the rat was more sensitive to BMS-986205 toxicity on a mg/m
2 basis, 
although the tox icity profiles in the rat and dog were generally s imilar. Animal-to-human 
exposure multiples were calculated relative to either the preliminary mean Cmax or AUC in 
humans at the clinical dose of 100 mg (Cmax 0.476 ȣg/mL, AUC [0-24h] 4.85 ȣg•h/mL).
BMS-986205 is not phototoxic or genotoxic in vitro, and demonstrated no significant in vitro 
interactions with a broad spectrum of pharmacologic receptors, transporters, ion channels, 
nuclear hormones, or enzymes at t30M except for moderate inhibition at the Į7 nicotinic 
cholinergic receptor (IC50 of 0.7 P0 to 0.9M). In patch-clamp ion channel assays, 
BMS-986205 produced low to moderate inhibitory effects on the cardiac human 
ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) rapid delayed rectifier (IKr) potassium channel current (75% inhibition at 3 M and IC50 1.1 M), on the cardiac SCN5A sodium channel 
(d13% inhibition at 10 M), and on the L-type calcium channel (83% inhibition at 10 M). In 
addition, similar testing of BMT-238450, a pharmacologically inactive metabolite of BMS-986205, demonstrated no significant off target receptor, ion channel, or transporter 
interactions (including cardiac ion channels) at t10M. The in vitro concentrations tested

above (≥0.7μM) are substantially higher ( ≥580× ) than the preliminary free Cmax (1.2 nM or 
0.5 ng/mL) at the current Phase 3 dose of 100 mg. Additionally, there were no clinically 
significant effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system (CNS) endpoints 
evaluated in the 1- and 3-month pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. In particular, no BMS-986205-related hemodynamic or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were 
observed in dogs at doses up to 100 mg/kg with associated Cmax values up to 3.6 μg/mL 
(8.8μM; safety multiple of 8× relative to preliminary Cmax of 0.476 μg/mL at the clinical dose 
of 100 mg).
The results from the pivotal 1-month toxicity studies in rats and dogs were generally similar to 
those from the pivotal 3-month studies and are detailed in Section 4.3of the Investigator 
Brochure. However, as higher doses were administered in the 1-month studies, there were some 
adverse findings highlighted below that were not observed in the 3-month studies. In the 1-month rat study, doses were 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg/day. BMS-986205 was not tolerated at 
80 mg/kg/day with signs of overt toxicity that included decreased activity, coolness to touch, 
hunched posture, piloerection, partially closed ey elids, recumbency, abnormal gait, 
aggressiveness, chromorhinorrhea, dehydratio n, body weight loss, and/or reduced food 
consumption resulting in death or early euthanasia; at ≥20 mg/kg/day, adverse findings included
minimal hepatocellular necrosis wi th correlative increases in se rum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT: ∼2× control) and minimal bile duct hyperplasia/fi broplasia in the liver. The severely toxic 
dose in 10% of animals (STD10) in rats was 20 mg/kg/ day (mean combined-sex AUC 
≤11.1μg•h/mL) and the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 5 mg/kg/day 
(AUC: 2.5 μg•h/mL). Relative to the preliminary human AUC values at the 100 mg clinical 
dose, the corresponding AUC exposure multiples are 2.3 ×and 0.5 ×at the STD10 and NOAEL, 
respectively. In the 1-month dog study, doses were 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day. At 
100 mg/kg/day, BMS-986205 was not tolerated (body weight loss) , and there were adverse 
findings in the liver (hepatocellular necrosis, centrilobular rarefaction, and bile stasis) with 
associated increases in se rum transaminases (up to 18 ×) and total bilirubin (TBIL) (up to 4.3 ×). 
The dose of 30 mg/kg/day (mean combined-sex AUC: 5.6 μg•h/mL) was considered the highest 
non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) and also the NOAEL for this study. At the current Phase 3 dose of 100 mg the dose multiple is 24 ×and, relative to preliminary human AUC values, the 
corresponding AUC exposure multiple is 1 ×at the HNSTD/NOAEL.
In the 3-month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) oral toxicity study in rats doses were 0 (vehicle 
control), 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/ day (0, 6, 18, and 60 mg/m
2), respectively. BMS-986205 was well 
tolerated at doses ≤10 mg/kg/day (mean AUC ≤9.66μg•h/mL). At ≥1 mg/kg/day, 
BMS-986205-related findings included dose-depende nt increases in minimal to marked tubular 
regeneration in the kidney of male rats that lack ed increased cellular stratification and nuclear or 
cellular pleomorphism seen with atypical hyperplasia. This finding was considered adverse at 
≥3 mg/kg/day due to the extensive change th at was accompanied by circumferential basement 
thickening and/or mononuclear infiltrates in the adjacent interstitium. At ≥3 mg/kg/day, there 
were additional generally dose-related changes th at reflected oxidative injury to erythrocytes by

the BMS-986205 metabolite, p-chloroaniline,44,45with subsequent accelerated re d blood cell 
(RBC) turnover and active hematopoiesis. These included minimal to mild increases in 
methemoglobin (metHb) concentrations (1.41 ×to 8.81 ×control); minimal d ecreases in RBC 
count (0.88 ×to 0.93 ×), hemoglobin (0.90 ×to 0.95 ×), and hematocrit in females (0.91 ×to 
0.96×); minimal to moderate increased hematopoies is and pigment accumulation in the spleen 
that correlated with increases in absolute and/or r elative (to body and/or to brain) spleen weights 
(13% to 32%); minimal to moderate increases  in reticulocyte counts in females (1.16 ×to 2.00 ×); 
transient and minimal increase in red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in females (1.05 ×to 
1.06×); and increased incidence of females showing minimal degree of acanthocytes and/or 
echinocytes; and at 10 mg/kg/day, minimal increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (1.05 ×
to 1.06 ×); in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (1.04 ×to 1.07 ×); increases in 
absolute and/or relative (to body and/or to brai n) spleen weights that correlated microscopically 
with minimal to moderate pigm ent accumulation and increased hematopoiesis in the spleen; and 
presence of RBCs with crystallized hemoglobin-like structures in 1 female. In females at 
10 mg/kg/day, the magnitude of increases in  metHb and changes in RBC par ameters (including 
morphology) together were cons idered adverse as these changes are expected to co llectively 
result in decreased total functional oxyge n-carrying capacity, paralleling the occurrence of 
clinical symptoms in humans (cyanosis, headache, and dizziness) with low-grade 
methemoglobinemia ( ∼8%) and concurrent anemia. Although a recovery period was not included 
in this study, there was evidence of a regenerative process in the kidney that was likely a 
response to previous BMS-986205-related renal tubular injury in male rats and would be 
expected to recover once the insult was remove d. In addition, the changes associated with 
p-chloroaniline formation would be expected to recover once the insult was removed. The 
NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day (mean sex-combined AUC ≤0.666μg•h/mL) and the 
STD10 was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day (mean sex combined AUC ≥ 9.66μg•h/mL). 
Relative to the preliminary human AUC values at the 100 mg clinical dose, the corresponding AUC exposure multiples are 2 ×and 0.14 ×at the STD10 and NOAEL, respectively. Dose 
multiples are 8 ×and 0.8× at the STD10 and NOAEL, respectively.
In the 3-month GLP oral toxicity study in dogs doses were 0 (vehicle control) 10, 30, or 
60 mg/kg/day (0, 60, 180, and 360 mg/m
2), respectively. BMS-986205 was well tolerated at 
doses ≤60 mg/kg/day (mean AUC ≤18.6μg•h/mL). At all doses, there was a spectrum of 
generally dose-related changes that reflected  oxidative injury to erythrocytes by the 
p-chloroaniline metabolite,44,45with subsequent accelerated RBC turnover and active 
hematopoiesis. These changes included the following: 1) minimal to mild, reversible increases in 
metHb concentration at ≥10 mg/kg/day (1.63 ×to 6.3 ×pretest); 2) minimal decr eases in red cell 
mass at ≥30 mg/kg/day in females only (0.94 ×to 0.86 ×) and 60 mg/kg/day in both sexes (0.97 ×

(0.94 ×to 0.98 ×) at 60 mg/kg/day; 5) in the liver, minimal to mild increased hematopoiesis and
increased incidence and/or severity of minimal to mild pigment (likely hemosiderin) 
accumulation in Kupffer cells, cons istent with hemolysis (extrava scular), and minimal bile stasis 
at ≥30 mg/kg/day; 6) in the kidney, increased incid ence and/or severity of  minimal to  moderate 
pigment accumulation in kidney tubules (likely hemosiderin [a breakdown pigment of 
hemoglobin]); and 7) minimal to mild increased h ematopoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen at 
all doses. The magnitude of increases in metHb and decreases in  red cell mass together were 
considered adverse at 60 mg/kg/day as these changes are expected to co llectively result in 
decreased total functional oxygen-carrying capacity, paralleling the occurrence of clinical symptoms in humans (cyanosis, headache, and dizziness) with low-grade methemoglobinemia 
(∼8%) and concurrent anemia. All other findings were considered nonadverse, adaptive, or 
regenerative changes. Although a recovery period was not included in this study, the changes 
associated with p-chloroaniline formation woul d be expected to recover once the insult was 
removed. The NOAEL was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day (mean sex-combined AUC 
≤8.47μg•h/mL), and the HNSTD was considered to be 60 mg/kg/day (mean sex-combined 
AUC ≤18.6μg•h/mL). Relative to preliminary human AUC values at the current Phase 3 
clinical dose of 100 mg QD, the corresponding AUC multiples are 2 ×and 4 ×at the NOAEL and 
HNSTD, respectively. Dose multiples are 24 ×and 48 ×at the NOAEL and HNSTD, respectively.
BMS-986205 was associated with fetal loss and fetal malformations in an embryofetal 
development study in rats. In this study, oral doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day (only doses tested) 
were administered over the relevant period of o rganogenesis in rats and were associated with 
exposure multiples of 5 ×and 14 ×, respectively, compared to the exposures at the current Phase 3 
clinical dose of 100 mg. There was a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of f etal loss and 
fetal malformations. Thus, exposure to BMS-986205 poses a potential risk to human pregnancy. BMS-986205 should not be administered to pregnant women.
Overall, the nonclinical toxicology profile of BMS-986205 has been well characterized, 
supporting clinical use in oncology subjects.
1.4.3 Preclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics
The PK and metabolism of BMS-986205 were characterized in a series of in vitro studies in 
animal species and human models and in vivo studies that were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, 
and monkeys.
46,47After IV administration, the apparent  elimination half-life (T-HALF) of 
BMS-986205 ranged from 1.8 hours to 6.6 hours and total plasma clearance (CLTp) was 
equivalent to ≤48% of the respective reported liver blood fl ows in animals48, suggesting that the 
compound has low to moderate systemic clearance. The volume of distribution at steady-state 
(Vss) indicated that BMS-986205 is distributed extravascularly, with low brain distribution 
observed in rats following IV dosing. BMS-986205 (10 μ M, 4.1 μg/mL)was > 99.9% bound to 
serum proteins in humans and in the animal species studied.
After oral administration of BMS-986205, the time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax) 
ranged from 0.5 hours to 1.7 hours and absolute oral bioavailability (F) of BMS-986205 given as

a solution or suspension formulat ion was 29% to 55%, 64%, 39%, and 10% in mice, rats, dogs, 
and monkeys, respectively. Preliminary data showed that following a single 5 mg/kg and 25 
mg/kg oral dose of BMS-986205 in pentagastrin-treated dogs, BMS-986205 AUC(0-24h) 
increased by approximately 2.2× and 3.0×, respectively, under fed conditions compared to 
fasting conditions, ind icating that there was a food effect, but the observed food effect was not 
dose related. Following a single oral dose of BMS-986205 (5 mg/kg oral dose) to famotidine 
pretreated dogs under fasted condition, there was no reduction in AUC(0-24h) or maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) and the values were  within PK experimental variability, compared 
to pentagastrin pretreated dogs.
The biotransformation of BMS-986205 was characterized by the production of numerous 
metabolites; biotransformation reactions included mono- and di-oxidation to form various 
oxidative metabolites including BMT-269044 (hydroxylation) and BMT- 303671 (N-oxide), 
oxidation followed by glutathione (GSH) c onjugation, and amide hydrolysis to an acid 
metabolite, M9  (BMT-238450) and p-chloroaniline. In vitro incubations of [14C]BMS-986205 in
rat, dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes  demo nstrated  that  p-ch loroaniline was further 
metabolized to form an an iline sulfate (M1, BM T-242377) and 4-chloro acetanilide (M3, BMS-
215753). The rank order of the extent of hydrolysis was rat (21%) > dog (13%) > human (4%) ~monkey (4%). In addition, GSH adducts of oxidativ e metabolites were detected in hepatocyte 
incubations from rat, dog, and monkey, but were not observed in humans. No unique human 
metabolite was observed in  hepatocytes. The primary in vivo biotransformation pathways in 
intact rats and dogs, and in bile duct-cannulated (BDC) rats administered [
14C]BMS-986205 
were mono- and di-oxidation and hydrolysis of BMS-986205 to form BMT-238450 and p-chloroaniline. Subsequent metabolism of p-chloroaniline formed BMT-242377 and BMS-
215753. Unchanged parent drug was a promin ent circulating component in int act rat and dog. 
Other circulating drug-related materials incl uded aniline-derived metabolites (BMT-242377 and 
BMS-215753), acid metabolite M9 (BMT-238450), and oxi dative metabo lites (BMT-269044 
and BMT-303671). Preliminary r eaction phenotyping studies in  human liver microsomes 
demonstrated that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 was the major enzyme responsible for the 
oxidative metabolism of BMS-986205.
Preliminary data suggest that BMT-303671 blocke d kynurenine production in hWB, with an 
IC50 value comparable to BMS-986205. BMT-269044 was also active in inhibiting kynurenine 
production in hWB, but was ~ 5-fold less potent than BMS-986205, while BMT-238450 was 
pharmacologically inactive under the same conditions.
A few selected metabolites including BMT-269044, BMT-303671, BMT-238450, and those 
derived from p-chloroaniline are being monitored in the ongoing, first-in-human (FIH), 
Phase1/2a Study CA017-003. Preliminary results s uggest that plasma con centrations of BMT-
269044 and BMT-303671 were approximately 30% to 40% of BMS-986205 levels. In the 3-
month rat oral toxicity study, the AUC(0-24h) exposures of BMT-303671, BMT-269044, and 
BMT-238450 measured at the STD10 dose of 10 mg/kg/day were 11.2 μg•h/mL, -8.26 μg•h /mL 
and 18.4 μ g•h /mL, respectively. At these exposures, the multiples over the AUC(0-24h) for 
BMT-303671 (2.10 μg•h /mL), BMT-269044 (1.88 μg•h /mL), and BMT-238450 (0.498 μg•h

/mL) at the 100 mg clinical dose are 5×, 4×, a nd 37×, respectively. In th e 3-month dog oral 
toxicity study, the AUC(0-24h) exposures of BMT-303671, BMT-269044, and BMT-238450 
measured at the HNSTD of 60 mg/kg/day were 0.728 μ g•h /mL, 0.483 μ g•h /mL, and 17.4 μ g•h 
/mL, respectively, with associated exposure multiples at the 100 mg clinical dose of 0.35×, 
0.26×, and 35×, respectively.
In human liver microsomes, BMS-986205 inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19 with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 μM to 26.5 μM. BMS-986205 also inhibited 
CYP3A4 with IC50s of 13.3 μM and 7.5 μ M using midazolam and testosterone as the probe 
substrates, respectively. Additionally, BMS-986205 a ppeared to be a time-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, which had a 5× shift in IC50 values. However, the inhibitor concentration corresponding to the half-maximal rate of inactivation (KI) was determined to be greater than 20 
μM, indicating that time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by BMS-986205 is not anticipated. 
BMS-986205 also inhibited recombinant human uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase(UGT) 1A1 (IC50 = 3.5 μM). BMT-269044 and BMT-303671 exhibited 
inhibition of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. BMT-238450 was not a 
CYP or UGT1A1 inhibitor. BMS-986205 inhibited digoxin and cladribine transport, as w ell as 
organic anion transporting polypept ide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, bile salt e xport pump (BSEP), 
organic cation transporter (OCT)1, and multi drug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) (IC50 
= 2.1 μ M to 19.0 μ M). In human hepatocytes, BMS-986205 did not cause any meaningful 
increase in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity, but did show some increase in 
corresponding CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels, indicating a potential for drug-drug interaction (DDI) with substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 through CYP induction.
Based on the preliminary human Cmax concentration (1.2 μM [0.5 μg/mL) at the current Phase 3 
clinical dose (100 mg), using a 1% free fraction, the potential for BMS-986205 and its 
metabolites to cause DDIs by inhibition of CYP enzymes or UGT1A1 is low. However, drugs 
that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may alter the plasma concentrations of BMS-986205. The potential to inhibit the human drug tran sporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1, and 
OCT1 is low, but BMS-986205 has been shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), s uggesting that BMS-986205 could affect the absorption and 
distribution of compounds that ar e P-gp/BCRP substrates. Additional details can be found in the 
IB for BMS-986205.
1.4.4 Clinical Pharmacology and Safety
1.4.4.1 Pharmacokinetics of BMS-986205Preliminary PK for BMS-986205 are evaluated based on results from the dose escalation cohorts. 
Following BMS 986205 administration with a light meal, the e xposures of BMS-986205 appear 
to increase in a dose proportional manner when th e dose was increased from 50 mg to 400 mg. 
The time to reach peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) varied in a wide range with median about 
3 hours to 5 hours. Following 100 mg QD doses, the geometric mean (CV%) accumulation ratio based on AUC(0 24h) between Day 1 and Day 14 was estimated to be 2 (79%), which corresponded to an estimated effective half-life of 37 hours, supportive of QD dosing of BMS-

986205. The geometric mean BMS-986205 concentration at the end of the dosing interval on 
Day 14 exceeded the in vitro hWB IC50 value (7.4 ng/mL) for all dose levels and exceeded the 
in vitro hWB IC90 (92 ng/mL) at dose levels of 100 mg and above. Main circulating metabolites 
(> 10% metabolite to parent AUC ratio base d on AUC[0-24h] on Day 14) following the 100 mg 
QD doses were 12% for BMT-238450, 34% for BMS- 269044, and 39% for BMS 303671. 
Preliminary results indicated BMT-303671 bloc ked kynurenine production in hWB with s imilar 
IC50 as BMS-986205 whereas BMS-269044 was~5-fold less potent and BMT-238450 was pharmacologically inactive ( Section 1.4.3 ). Thus, it is possible that BMT-303671 contributes to 
the overall pharmacological activity. Addition ally, preliminary data from an ADME study (Study 
CA017-052A) in healthy subjects suggest that unlike non-clinical toxicology species (rats and 
dogs), the hydrolysis pathway, which forms th e p chloroaniline metabolite, represents a minor 
pathway in humans, accounting for ~7% of the total clearance.
Effect of f ood on the PK of BMS-986205 was evalu ated in healthy subjects in 
Study CA017-053. Preliminary PK data indicate that following a single 100 mg dose, 
BMS-986205 geometric mean Cmax and AUC(0-168h) are 114% (90% CI 75.4% to 161.1%) 
and 52.8% (37.2% to 70.3%) higher, respectively , when dosed after a high fat m eal compared to 
under fasting condition. BMS-986205 Cmax and AUC(0-168h) are 96.5% (71.7% to 124.8%) and 42.6% (28.0% to 58.8%) higher respectively, when dosed af ter a light meal compared to 
under fasting condition. Tmax ranged from 2 hours to 4 hours when dosing fasted and from 
2 hours to 5 hours when dosed af ter a meal. PK variabilities are ge nerally smaller when dosed 
after a meal. The terminal half-life averaged from 52 hours to 62 hours across the tr eatment 
groups.
1.4.4.2 Pharmacokinetics of Nivolumab
Single-dose PK of nivolumab was evaluated in 39 subjects with multiple tumor types in 
CA209001 in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The median Tmax across dose levels ranged from 1.6 to 3.1 hours with individual values ranging from 0.9 to 7 hours. The PK of nivolumab 
was linear in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg with dose-proportional increase in Cmax and 
AUC(INF). Geometric mean clearance after a single IV dose ranged from 0.13 to 0.19 mL/h/kg, 
while mean volume of distribution of terminal phase (Vz) varied between 83 to 113 mL/kg 
across doses. The mean terminal T-HALF of nivoluma b was 17 to 25 days, c onsistent with half-
life of endogenous IgG4, indicating that the elimination mechanism of nivolumab may be similar to IgG4. Both elimination and distribution of nivolumab appeared to be independent of dose within the dose range studied.
The multiple dose PK of nivolumab given Q2W in subjects with multiple tumor types was 
determined from the CA209003 study as well as PPK analyses using data from 909 subjects 
across nivolumab studies. Multiple-dose PK of nivolumab following Q2W dosing was linear with dose-proportional increase in Cmax and AUC(TAU) in the studied range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. The geometric mean of terminal T-HALF was 26.7 days and the typical clearance was 
8.7 mL/h, which are consistent with those of full human immunoglobulin antibodies.

Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is currently under active clinical evaluation across multiple tumor 
types. Using a PPK model, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide average steady-state concentrations (Cavgss) similar to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is 
predicted to provide greater (approximately 40%) Cmaxss and lo wer (approximately 20%) 
trough steady-state concentrations (Cminss). Nivolu mab has been shown to  be safe and well 
tolerated up to doses of 10 mg/kg Q2W and has not demonstrated a clear dose response or 
exposure-response safety relationship. Based on these safety findings, the predicted Cmaxss at 
480 mg Q4W is not considered to put subjects at increased risk for AEs. The approved dose of 
3 mg/kg Q2W has shown survival benefit across multiple tumor types compared to respective standards of care. Nivolumab exposure was not a predictor of survival in exposure-response 
efficacy analyses conducted for multiple tumor types. The Cminss values following nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W are predicted to be in the range of  those on the flat part of the exposure-response 
efficacy curves and are not expected to impact efficacy. 
As of Nov-2016, approximately 50 subjects in the nivolumab clinical development programs 
have received at least 1 dose of nivolumab 480 mg  Q4W, either as the starting therapy or as 
maintenance treatment following nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) has a 
clinical safety p rogram that monitors  symptoms potentially related to i nfusion-related r eactions 
reported on the day of infusion and the following day. For the approx imately 50 sub jects treated 
with 30-minute infusions of nivolumab 480 mg, ther e have been no reports of any symptoms that 
may potentially be linked to infusion reactions on the day of infusion or the following day. There have been no new safety signals identified during routine clinical and pharmacovigilance monitoring of these studies. Clinical evaluation of this dose regimen is ongoing; as such, summaries of safety information, PK, and immunogenicity are not currently available.
Additional details are provided in the current version of the nivolumab IB.1.4.4.3 Pharmacokinetics of Ipilimumab
The PK of ipilimumab has been extensively studied in subjects with melanoma at the 3- and 
10-mg/kg doses administered as a 1.5-hour IV infusion. The PK of ipilimumab was characterized 
by population PK (PPK) analysis and determined to be linear and time invariant in the dose 
range of 0.3 to 10 mg /kg. The mean CL ( ±standard deviation) value after IV administration of 
10 mg/kg was 18.3 ± 5.88 mL/h, and the mean Vss ( ±standard deviation) value was 5.75 ±1.69 
L. The PPK of ipilimumab was studied in 785 sub jects (3,200 serum concentrations) with 
advanced MEL in 4 Phase 2 studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022),36 1 
Phase 3 study (CA184024), and 1 Phase 1 study (CA184078). The PPK analysis demonstrated 
that the PK of ipilimumab is linear, the exposures are dose proportional across the tested dose 
range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, and the model parameters are t ime invariant, s imilar to that determined 
by non-compartmental analyses. Volume of central compartment (Vc) and peripheral compartment were found to be  4.35 and 3.28 L, respectively, suggesting that ipilimumab first 
distributes into plasma volume and, subsequently, into extracellular fluid space. CL of ipilimumab and Vc were found to increase with increase in body weight. However, there was no 
significant increase in exposure with increase in body weight when dosed on a milligram per 
kilogram basis, supporting dosing of ipilimumab  based on a weight-normalized regimen. The PK

1.4.4.4 Clinical Safety 
The information provided below is a gener al summary of safety.  P lease refer to the BMS-
986205 Investigator Brochure for full safety information. 
Safety of BMS-986205 as Monotherapy and in Combination with Nivolumab 
The overall safety experien ce with BMS-986205 is based on treatment of 477 subjects as of a 15-
Nov-2017 database lock, the majority of w hom have been treated  with BMS-986205 and 
nivolumab in this study.
As monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab, BMS-986205 overall has been well 
tolerated in both subjects with malignancies and h ealthy volunteers in other studies, with
treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) that were generally low grade and manageable. The 
safety profile of combination therapy with nivolumab and BMS-986205 has been largely comparable to that of nivolumab given as monotherapy. The most commonly reported TRAEs (in > 10% of subjects) during combination ther apy with nivolumab were fatigue (14.1%) and 
nausea (11.1%). Grade 3 TRAEs have been reported in approximately 11% of subjects receiving 
the combination and treatment- related SAEs in approximately 7%. There has been 1 treatment-
related death due to myocarditis prior to the clinical data cutoff date (15-Nov-2017), which 
occurred during combination with nivolumab. In addition, there was one tr eatment- related death 
due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and one treatmen t-related death due to  hepatic failure which 
occurred after the clinical data cutoff date. 
With regard to p-chloroaniline, there have b een no clinically significant metHb events at the 
100 mg dose level, and the highest reported metHb value was 16% in a subject receiving 200 mg 
of BMS-986205; no other subjects had reported metHb levels over 10%, none have required 
specific tr eatment for methemoglobinemia, and there have been no treatment discontinuations 
due to methemoglobinemia. Anemia and hemolyt ic anemia have also occurred infrequently 
(2.5% and 0.3% of subjects receivi ng combination therapy with nivolumab, respectively) and 
responded to dose holding, reductions, and other standard clinical measures.
Based on the available safety data,100 and 200 mg dos e levels were opened in cohort expansion 
to allow for further evaluation of safety, PK, and PD data in order to ulti mately allow for a final 
selection of dose for cohort expansion.Safety of BMS-986205 in Combination with both Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Preliminary safety information for the combin ation of BMS-986205, nivo lumab, and ipilimumab 
is available as of 3-May-2018 for the 13 subjects  treated in Part 3 to date. This data is 
preliminary and subject to change.

In melanoma, 8 subjects have b een treated: 4 at 100 mg BMS-986205 and 4 at 50 mg.  In the 
100 mg group, 2 DLTs (G3 autoimmune hepatitis in both) were reported out of 4 DLT evaluable 
subjects.  While further enrollment was permitted at this dose per BLRM, given the observed 
DLTs in melanoma subjects as well as those in  NSCLC (see below), the dose was reduced to 
50 mg.  With 50 mg, there have been no DLTs reported in 3 DLT-evaluable subjects.  Enrollment at 50 mg is ongoing.
In NSCLC, 3 subjects were treated at 100 mg. Two discontinued due to disease progression and 
were not evaluable for DLTs. The third subject experienced a DLT of Grade 3 transaminase 
elevations. In consideration of the DLTs obs erved in melanoma at 100 mg de scribed above, 
further enrollment at 100 mg in NSCLC was held and subjects were then treated with 50 mg.  In 
the 50 mg cohort, both DLT-evaluable subjects e xperienced DLTs (Gr 3 transaminase elevations 
in both).  Per the BLRM analysis, further enrollment at 50 mg was held and enrollment at 25 mg opened.
As described above, among all sub jects in Part 3, hepatic events have been the most commonly 
observed toxicities. These events have resolved with interruption or discontinuation of study 
drugs and administration of immunosuppressive treatments. No d eaths have been  reported in 
either cohort.
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
1.5.1 Risk/Benefit for BMS-986205 
As of 15-Nov-2017, 90 subjects have been treated with BMS-986205 monotherapy in this and 
other studies.  TRAEs have been infrequent and generally mild.  As BMS-986205 is not 
anticipated to have monotherapy antitumor activity, it is being developed as a combination agent,
primarily with other immune-modulatory agents.  Monotherapy treatment peri ods in this protocol 
are used primarily to provide preliminary safety and PK information..
Metabolism of BMS-986205 produces a p-chloroanilin e (PCA) metabolite, which is associated 
with the formation of methemoglobin as well as with hemolytic anemia, as was observed in 
animal studies using BMS-986205. As of 15-Nov- 2017, the peak metHb reported was 16% in a 
subject receiving BMS-986205 at 200 mg  this study, below the commonly accepted threshold for 
the development of clinically  significant symptoms (20%).
49. This level was not associated with 
clinical sequelae, and the subject continued therapy at 100 mg of BMS-986205 with resolution of the methemoglobinemia. No other subjects ha d a metHb v alue of > 10% reported. No subject on 
study has required specific tr eatment for methemoglobinemia or had BMS-986205 discontinued 
due to methemoglobinemia. Drug-related Grade 3 anemia was reported in  approximately 1% of 
subjects and hemolytic anemia in 0.3% during combination therapy with nivolumab.
Based on the findings from animal studies, entry criteria and monitoring parameters were 
developed in an attempt to reduce the risk of methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia. 
Subjects with cytochrome b5 reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiencies are excluded due to the increased risk of methemoglobinemia and hemolysis, 
respectively. Guidance for detection a nd management of methemoglobinemia as well as 
guidelines for dose interruptions, reductions, and discontinuation are provided in Section 4.5.7

for the management of treatment- related hematological adverse events. In addition, complete 
physical examinations (PEs) will be conducted on Day 1 of each cycle, with symptom-dir ected 
PEs weekly during monotherapy and Q2W during combination. With regard to animal findings 
of hepatocyte damage, subjects with viral hepatitis or other liver disease, such as nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease ( NAFLD), will be excluded to minimize the potential for hepatotoxicity; 
frequent monitoring of liver function tests and guidance for dose modification and tr eatment 
interruptions have also been implemented. Similarly, subjects with inadequate renal function will 
be excluded to minimize the po tential for nephrotoxicity due to renal findings in animals. While 
there was an in vitro hERG inhibition (IC50 at ~1.2 uM), high (> 99%) serum protein binding, 
projected human free C max of 0.018 uM at the highest dose planned, and lack of in vivo ECG 
findings in dogs suggest low cardiovascular risk to human subjects. Nevertheless, subjects with 
QTc prol ongation at bas eline will be excluded, medications known to cause prolonged QT will 
be restricted, and ECGs will be monitored during the study. 
Continuous safety assessments will be  utilized by th e investigators and S ponsor to determine 
whether dose modification, additional safety measures, or termination of the study is required at 
any time. In addition, AEs and SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor and Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology representatives to monitor 
for any safety signals or trends. 
The International Agency for Research on Ca ncer classifies p-chloroaniline as Group 2B, or 
possibly carcinogenic to humans (1993),50but the human relevance of this classification is 
questionable since it does not take into account dose/exposure multiples, mechanism, and species 
differences. The secondary mechanism of carci nogenicity (following hematologic toxicity) in 
rats is not considered a significant issue for patients. This conclusion is further supported by the 
dose multiple of 52 ×when considering the NOEL for rat tumors and the daily exposure of 
patients to p-chloroaniline at the 100 mg clinical dose. Using ICH M7 principles, the less-than-
lifetime e xposures are calculated for p-chloroaniline, then  the associated, theoretical cancer risks 
are the following: For 1 year of p-chloroaniline exposure associated with the 100 mg BMS-986205 dose, the risk is < 1 in  100,000; for 2 y ears of exposure, the risk is 1.83 in 100,000, both 
of which approximate the acceptable risk of 1 in 100,000 (per ICH M7) for drugs of any therapeutic class that may provide clinical benefit.
Since BMS-986205 is an experimental agent, it is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or 
unanticipated reactions may occur. However, the safety profile has been manageable thus far at 
doses of up to 200 mg. 
1.5.2 Risk/Benefit for Combination with Nivolumab
As of 15-Nov-2017, 397 subjects have received BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab 
(n=303 BMS-986205 100 mg + nivolumab 240 mg Q2W; n = 92 BMS-986205 100 mg + 480 
mg Q4W) in this study. The MTD of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab was 
established at 200 mg based on the safety and tolerability profile and incidence of dose- limiting 
toxicities. Full information regarding the clinical sa fety information available as of the 15-Nov-
2017 cut off can be found in the most recent version of the BMS-986205 Investigator Brochure

BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
Nivolumab has demonstrated a manageable safety profile. The overall safety experience, when 
used either as a monotherapy or in combination with another therapeutic, is based on experience in approximately 12,300 subjects treated to date. There is no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. The mo st common AEs include fatigue, rash, pruritus, 
diarrhea, and nausea. Side effects of nivolumab  therapy may include those associated with 
immune-mediated activation, such as pneumonitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Most of these 
events resolved with immune-modulating medication. To mitigate risk from serious immune-
mediated AEs, subject managemen t algorithms for nivolumab -related AEs from prior collective 
nivolumab experience have been included. 
There is potential for overlapping toxicity between the preclinical toxicology findings of 
BMS-986205 involving the liver and nivolumab-related hepatotoxicity. However, the incidence 
of nivolumab-related hepatitis is quite low (~ 1%) and thus the liver-related exclusion criteria 
and the monitoring of liver function specified in the protocol w ill help to  minimize the risk of 
hepatotoxicity.  The immuno-oncology AE management al gorithms also provide guidance for 
management of hepatic events.  
The overall safety profile of BMS-986205 and nivolumab observed to date in Study CA017-003 
has shown that the safety of the combination is largely consistent with that of nivolumab monotherapy and that the combination is well to lerated. The most common TRAEs (occurring in 
> 5% of subjects) occurring during treatment with this combination were fatigue (14.1%),nausea 
(11.1%), decreased appetite (9.1%), AST increased  (7.6%), and ALT increased (7.1%). Grade 3 
TRAEs have been reported in approximately 11% and Grade 4 TRAEs in 1.5% of subjects 
receiving the combination (n=397 in CA017-003), with treatment-related SAEs in approximately 
7% and TRAEs leading to discontinuation in  approximately 4%. Three treatment-related deaths 
have been reported: myocarditis, Stevens-J ohnson syndrome, and hepat ic failure; th e latter two 
occurred after the data cut-off date (15-Nov-2017).
Nivolumab has demonstrated  clinical activity in subjects with advanced NSCLC, RCC, 
melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lymphomas, as well as in subjects with other tumors. As 
outlined in Section 1.1.3 , there is a mechanistic rationale that combination of an IDO1 inhibitor 
with checkpoint blockade will bring enhanced benefit to patients. Preliminary evidence of 
clinical activity for BMS-986205 plus nivolumab has b een observed in the current study in both 
cervical and bladder cancers.
51
1.5.3 Risk/Benefit for Combination with Both Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations have a well-defined tox icity profile based on a safety 
database of patients treated with the combinat ion across multiple tumor types. Multiple dosing 
regimens have been evaluated. While the patte rn and immune-mediated nature of toxicities 
remains relatively consistent, the severity and incidence of the toxicities does appear to differ by 
tumor type in each regimen evaluated. Therefore , within this protocol, the selection of each 
tumor type to be evaluated in safety lead-in Part 3 has been linked to a particular nivolumab and 
ipilimumab combination regimen known to have acceptable tolerability within that tumor type.

This should help to minimize the impact that the addition of BMS-986205 will have on the safety 
and tolerability of the nivolumab and ipilimumab regimens being evaluated.  
As described in Section 1.5.2, preliminary data from the combination of BMS-986205 with 
nivolumab have not revealed any unforeseen toxicities to date. BMS-986205 has not been 
previously evaluated in combination with ipilimumab. Preliminary safety data are available from 11 subjects treated in Part 3 of this study. In thos e subjects, treatment-related hepatic events have 
been the most commonly observed TRAEs/DLTs. These events have been manageable with 
treatment interruption or discontinuation as well as ad ministration of immunosuppressive 
therapies. While preliminary, these data also suggest that the dose of BMS-986205 may be related to the observed hepatic toxicities in this  combination regimen, as 0/3 DLTs have been 
observed in melanoma at 50 mg versus 2/4 at 100 mg.  
Similar to this, the IDO1 inhibitor epaca dostat has been previously  evaluated with ip ilimumab in 
patients with metastati c melanoma. Initial doses of 300 mg BI D in combination with ipilimumab 
3 mg/kg Q3W led to unacceptable rates of Grade 3 to 4 ALT elevations, although these were 
reversible with treatment discontinuation and cor ticosteroid administration.
52When lower doses 
of epacadostat up to 50 mg BID were evaluated with the same ipilimumab regimen, tr eatment-
related toxicity rates were acceptable. 
To address the potential for hepatotoxicity with trip let combinations of BMS-986205, 
nivolumab, and ipilimumab, initial safety of the triplet combination will be evaluated in NSCLC 
and melanoma c ohorts using an ipilimumab dose of 1 mg/ kg Q6-8W; only after safety is 
established with the 1 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab will the higher dose of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab
Q3W be evaluated in a bladder cohort (see Section 1.1.6.3 ). Careful safety monitoring will be 
undertaken with frequent assessmen t of liver chemistries in addition to other safety laboratories 
and physical exams. During the first 6 weeks of the D LT evaluation period for the safety cohorts, 
liver chemistries will be checked on a more freque nt, weekly basis. Rules for dose modification 
and discontinuation have been created to allow for rapid identification of toxicities requiring 
intervention, and investigat ors will be  provided with al gorithms for management of immune 
related adverse events that have been developed to address toxicity associated with 
immuno-oncology therapies, including combination regimens .
Nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations have demonstrated clinical activity in melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer that exceed the clinical activity of each agent alone. Subjects receiving the triplet therapy regimens will therefor e be receiving active combinations for their 
individual tumor types, with the addition of BMS-986205, which may lead to increasing benefit. 
Furthermore, the combinations of IDO1 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab separately
have been shown to have clinical activity and are actively being investigated in other trials.  
1.5.4 Summary
Despite innovations in cancer tr eatment, alternative therapies are needed for subjects with 
advanced cancer. The emerging role of combin ation immune-modulating therapies in producing 
deep and durable responses in a variety of tumor types, as well as emerging clinical data from 
trials studying the combination of an IDO1 inhibitor with PD-(L)1-targeted therapies, suggest

that there may be a potential benefit of IDO1 inhibition with BMS-986205 when used in 
combination with nivolumab. Furthermore, ther e are preliminary clinical data showing possibly 
clinical activity of th e combination of BMS-986205 with ni volumab in cervical and bladder 
cancers .51This together with the known improvement in clinical activity of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab combinations over monotherapy treatme nts support the evaluation of combination 
therapies with BMS-986205, nivolumab, and ipilimumab. Overall, the safety profile of BMS-986205 has been manageable both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. It is expected that the addition of BMS-986205 (in doses already shown to be safe in combination with nivolumab) to nivolumab and ipilimumab backbone regimens with known tolerability in 
specific tumor types will be safe. The incidence of immune -related events w ill continue to be 
monitored across all combinations in the study as more subjects are treated in order to assess the 
impact of IDO1 inhibition on the known toxicity of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab combination regimens. The benefit/ris k ratio supports continue d evaluation of BMS-
986205 as monotherapy, in combination with nivolumab, and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in subjects with advanced cancer.

3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS-986205 administered as a monotherapy, in 
combination with nivolumab (Parts 1 and 2), and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab (Part 3) in subjects with advanced malignant tumors. A clinical pharmacology QTc 
substudy will also be conducted.
3.1.1 Screening and Treatment
3.1.1.1 Parts 1 and 2 (BMS-986205 Monotherapy and Combination with 
Nivolumab)
Dose escalation (Part 1) will start with a lead-in Cycle 0 whereby BMS-986205 is administered
as monotherapy of 2 weeks duration in each dose escalation subject. D ecision to proceed to 
combination treatment with  nivolumab (Cycle 1) for each subject in dose escalation will be 
determined after tolerability of the monotherapy lead-in is established in the 2-week Cycle 0 (see 
Section 3.1.4 ). The starting dose of BMS-986205 is 25 mg orally daily. Nivolumab will be 
administered at a dose of 240 mg Q2W for the dose escalation (Part 1) and for the dose expansion (Part 2) cohorts that predated Ame ndment 06 (cervical, DLBCL, SCCHN, bladder, 
and pancreatic cancer). Nivolumab will be administered at a dose 480 mg intravenously Q4W for the dose expansion cohorts in Part 2 added with Amendment 06 (melanoma, NSCLC, and 
additional signal-seeking tumors) and Amendment 08 (RCC), as w ell as for the clinical 
pharmacology substudy. In the event the 25 mg dose of BMS-986205 is determined to exceed the MTD in monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, a lower BMS-986205 dose (DL-1) may be explored based on available safety, PK, and biomarker information. Please refer to 
Appendix 1 . At no point will the dose of BMS- 986205 administered in combination with 
nivolumab exceed doses of BMS-986205 that have been demonstrated previously to be safe in 
the monotherapy lead-in Cycle 0 (Section 3.1.4 ). Subjects with select malignant tumor types w ill 
be enrolled per the inclusion criteria in Section 3.3.1 .

Each Part 1 dose escalation subject will start with Cycle 0, which is a 2-week BMS-986205 
monotherapy lead-in. If there are no DLTs (see Section 4.5.1 ), subjects will proceed to receive 
the combination of nivolumab and BMS-986205 (Cycle 1). In addition to the defined DLTs, the 
following AEs will also prohibit a subject from proceeding to combination with nivolumab:
•Grade 2 or higher immune-related AEs considered related to BMS-986205 (eg, 
immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, and renal dysfunction) with the 
exception of immune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism
•Grade 2 AST and ALT elevations that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within 1 week
Dose expansion (Part 2) will be carried out at the combination dose of BMS- 986205 selected 
from dose escalation in combination with nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (cohorts 1 to 5) or 480 mg
Q4W (cohorts 6 to 9), and may represent the MTD, MAD, or an altern ate dose for the 
combination. 
Study drug consisting of BMS-986205 daily and nivolumab will be administered in 4-week 
cycles, for up to 12 cy cles. Subjects in 8 d isease-restricted populations and subjects in 1 mixed 
signal-seeking cohort of additional tumors w ill be enrolled as follows: SCCHN, RCC, bladder

signal-seeking cohort w ill include triple-neg ative breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the 
endometrium, epithelial cancer of the ovary, and sarcoma. The doses selected for dose expansion will not exceed the MTD or MAD determined in dose escalation. 
Clinical Pharmacology Substudy: 
QTc SubstudyA clinical pharmacology substudy w ill be c onducted in parallel with dose expansion to 
characterize the effect of BMS-986205 on the QTc intervals.To minimize the influence of intrinsic factors su ch as food ingestion and circadian patterns on 
the QTc evaluation, time-matched baseline ECGs follo wing a light meal w ill be collected prior 
to the start of BMS-986205 treatment cycles. During Cycle 0, subjects will receive BMS-986205 
QD monotherapy with a light meal on Days 1 to 14 (see Table 5.1-14 ). Serial ECG samples in 
addition to the matched PK samples will be collected on Day 14 ( Table 5.5.4.3-1 ). Subjects will 
then receive BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will follow all 
assessments as per Table 5.1-15. 
The inclusion criteria ( Section 3.3.1 ) used in the dose escalation pha se will apply to subjects 
participating in the QTc substudy. At least 3 dose levels (below, at , and above the expected 
clinical dose) will be evaluated in at least 6 subjects per dose level in the substudy. Additional doses at supratherapeutic level may be evaluated in the substudy if warranted to allow for 
characterization of concentrations/QTc relationship at exposures that may exceed expected therapeutic levels due to extrinsic or intrinsic factors such as drug interactions, food effect, or organ dysfunction. The doses to be evaluated in the substudy w ill be d etermined based on 
available safety, PK, and biomarker data.

Subjects will complete up to 4 phases of the study: Screening, Treatment, Clinical/Safety 
Follow-up and Survival/Long-term Follow-up, as described below:
Screening :
The screening phase will last for up to 28 days. The screening phase begins by establishing the 
subject’s initial eligibility and signing of the ICF. Subjects will be enrolled using the Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS).
Treatment Phase :
The treatment phase consists of up to twelve 4-week treatment cycles. For subjects receiving 
nivolumab on the Q2W regimen, each treatment cy cle is composed of a daily oral dose of 
BMS-986205 and 2 doses of nivolumab administered  intravenously Q2W on Days 1 and 15. For 
subjects receiving nivolumab on the Q4W regimen, each cycle is composed of a daily oral dose 
of BMS-986205 and 1 dose of nivolumab on Day 1. In addition, the dose escalation (Part 1) and 
the QTc substudy will start with Cycle 0, a lead-in period of 2 weeks duration, during which 
monotherapy with BMS-986205 is administered. 
Following every 2 treatment cycles (8 weeks), th e decision to treat a s ubject with additional 
cycles of study drug will be based on radi ological tumor assessments (initial evaluation 
performed at baseline, end of Cycle 2, and every 8 weeks). Assessments of partial response (PR) 
and complete response (CR) must be confirmed at least 4 weeks followi ng initial as sessment. 
Tumor progression or response endpoints will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for solid tumors and International Working Group (IWG) criteria 
for HL and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL; Appendices 3  and 4 ). 
Treatment beyond progression may be allowed in select subjects with initial RECIST v1.1 or 
IWG-defined progressive disease (PD) if the benefit/risk assessment favors continued 
administration of study drug (eg, subjects are continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, tolerating treatment, and meeting other criteria specified in Section
3.5.1 ).
Subjects with a response of stable disease ( SD), PR, or CR at the end of a given cycle will 
continue to the next treatment cy cle. Subjects will generally be allowed to continue study d rug 
until the first occurrence of either 1) comple tion of the maximum number of cycles, 2) PD, 3) 
clinical d eterioration sugge sting that no further bene fit from tr eatment is likely, 4) intolerab ility 
to therapy, or 5) the subject meets criteria for discontinuation  of study drug as outlined in 
Section 4.5.3 . Individual subjects with confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue 
study drug on a case-by-case basis after specific consultation and agreement between the investigator and BMS Medical Monitor in settings where benefit/risk justifies the discontinuation of study drug. 
3.1.1.2 Part 3 (Combination with Both Nivolumab and Ipilimumab)
Part 3 is the safety evaluation and cohort  expansion of the combination of BMS-986205, 
nivolumab, and ipilimumab. Initial safety evaluations will be performed in subjects with
melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer. Subjects with each tumor type will receive

BMS-986205 in combination with a different regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab based on 
safety and efficacy data observed in previous trials of nivolumab and ipilimumab in that tumor type (see Section 1.1 ).  After this initial safety evaluati on, dosing regimens will then be evaluated 
in expansion cohorts, which may include subjects with other types of malignancies.  
Subjects in safety evaluation cohorts will r eceive BMS-986205 at a dose which was shown to be 
tolerable in combination with nivolumab (from Parts 1 and 2) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab
(from Part 3), as applicable.  The dos e of BMS-986205 will not exceed 100 mg daily. 
The regimens will consist of:
•Melanoma (Ipi 1Q8 regimen) : BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W 
and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W, all given continuously.
•NSCLC (Ipi 1Q6 regimen) : BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W, all given continuously.  
•Bladder (Ipi 3Q3 regimen) : BMS-986205 given continuously, first in combination with 
nivolumab 80 mg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg both given Q3W for 4 doses, followed by 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W continuously 
Evaluation of each regimen will begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the triplet
combination therapy in a limited number of subjects, including a sentinel subject (see Section 
3.1.7 ), in a safety evaluation cohort. The melanoma and NSCLC safety cohorts will begin safety 
enrollment simultaneously since the dose of ipilimumab is similar between the cohorts. 
Furthermore, for nivolumab dosing, the 480 mg  Q4W and 360 mg Q3W are expected to achieve 
similar average exposure. The safety evaluation for the bladder regimen will begin enrolling 
subjects once either the melanoma or NSCLC regimen has been found to be safe and tolerable, 
as the bladder regimen uses a higher dose (3 mg/kg Q3W) of ipilimumab relative to the 
melanoma and NSCLC cohorts (1 mg/kg Q6W and Q8W of ipilimumab) during the DLT 
evaluation period.
Once the initial safety and tolerability have b een established independently for each regimen (see 
Section 3.1.7 ) within a given tumor type, subjects will begin enrolling in expansion cohorts for 
that tumor type. 
Additionally, subjects may be enrolled into a mix ed tumor type cohort using the Ipi 1Q8 regimen
for further evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor 
efficacy once the safety of Ipi 1Q8 is established in the melanoma cohort.

Screening :
The screening phase will last for up to 28 days. The screening phase begins by establishing the 
subject’s initial eligibility and signing of the ICF . Subjects will be enrolled using the Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS).
Treatment Phase :
For subjects receiving the melanoma/Ipi 1Q8regimen containing nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W, 1 cycle will consist of 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of 
ipilimumab (ie, 8 weeks). For subjects recei ving the NSCLC/Ipi 1Q6 regimen containing 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6 W, 1 cycle will consist of 2 doses of 
nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab (ie, 6 weeks ). For subjects receiving the bladder/Ipi 3Q3
regimen, during the nivolumab and ipilimumab lead-i n, the first 2 cycles will each consist of 2 
doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab (each cycle is  6 weeks); after the first 2 cy cles, each 
subsequent cycle will be comprised of 1 dose of nivolumab (ie, 4 weeks). 
Timing of imaging assessments will be based on the regimen the subject is receiving:
•Melanoma/ Ipi 1Q8 : The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 12 ( ±1 week); 
subsequent imaging w ill be every 8 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter throughout the treatment 
period.
•NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6 : The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 6 ( ±1 week), and then

•Bladder/ Ipi 3Q3 : The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 6 ( ±1 week), and then 
every 6 weeks ( ±1 week) during the tr eatment period up to 24 weeks, after which they will 
occur every 12 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter throughout the treatment period.

•Mixed tumor type/ Ipi 1Q8 : The first imaging assessment will occur at Week 8 ( ±1 week); 
subsequent imaging will be every 8 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter throughout the treatment 
period.
The decision to treat a subject with additional cy cles of study drug will be based on the most 
recent radiological tumor assessment preceding that dose. Assessments of PR and CR must be 
confirmed at least 4 weeks after the initial assessment. Tumor progression or response endpoints 
will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Treatment beyond progression may be allowed in select subjects with initial RECIST v1.1 or 
IWG-defined progressive disease (PD) if th e benefit/risk assessment favors continued 
administration of study drug (eg, subjects are continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, tolerating treatment, and meeting other cr iteria other criteria

Subjects with a response of stable disease (SD), PR, or CR at the most recent imaging 
assessment w ill continue to receive study treatment. S ubjects will ge nerally be allowed to 
continue study drug until the first occurrence of either 1) completion of the maximum duration of 
study therapy (2 years from first dose), 2) PD,  3) clinical deterioration suggesting that no further 
benefit from treatment is likely, 4) intolerab ility to therapy, or 5) the subject meets criteria for 
discontinuation of study drug as outlined in Section 4.5.3 . Individual subjects with confirmed CR 
will be given the option to discontinue study drug on a case-by-case basis after specific 
consultation and agreement between the inve stigator and BMS Medical Monitor in s ettings 
where benefit/risk justifies discontinuation of study drug. 
3.1.2 Treatment with Additional Cycles Beyond 48 Weeks
In all Parts of this study, all subjects will be treated for 48 weeks of BMS-986205 in combination 
with nivolumab or both nivolumab and ipilimumab un less criteria for study drug discontinuation 
are met earlier (Section 3.4.3 ). All subjects completing approximately 48 weeks of study therapy
with ongoing disease control (CR, PR, or SD) may be eligible for up to an additional 48 weeks (a maximum of 2 years from first dose of study therapy) of treatment at the originally assigned dose regimen (except for the bladde r triplet regimen) beyond the init ial 48 weeks, on a case-by-case 
basis, after careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether the benefit/risk ratio supports administr ation of further study drug. For the bladder 
triplet combination, the additional 48 weeks of study treatment w ill include nivolumab and 
BMS-986205 but not ipilimumab; nivolumab will be given as 480 mg Q4W starting with the 
first cycle of additional treatment. Subjects whose last assessment of the init ial 48-week period 
shows PD will also be eligible to continue to additional cycles  if they are still deriving clinical 
benefit, as per the guidance of treatment beyond progression (Section 3.5.1 ). Upon completion of 
48 weeks of study drug (or up to a maximum of 96 weeks [2 years] if applicable), all sub jects 
will enter the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period.

3.1.3 Follow-up
3.1.3.1 Clinical/Safety Follow-upUpon completion of 48 weeks of study drug (or up to a maximum of 96 weeks if applicable), all 
subjects will enter the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period once the decision is made to discontinue 
the subject from treatment (e g, at end of treatment [EOT]). 
For subjects who complete all scheduled cycles of ther apy, the EOT visit will be the same as the 
last scheduled and completed on-treatment visit, and the start of the Week 1 Clin ical/Safety 
Follow-up visit. For subjects who do not complete all scheduled cycles of therapy, the EOT visit
will be the most recent on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data) and does 
not need to be repeated, and will be considered the start of the Week 1 Clinical/Safety Follow-up 
visit.
Subjects who discontinue the treatment phase will enter the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period. 
Subjects must be followed for at least 100 days (representing approximately 5 half-lives for 
nivolumab) after the last dose of study drug. Follow-up visits should occur at Days 30, 60, and 
100 (±10 days) after the last dose of study drug or should coincide with the date of discontinuation (±10 days) if date of discontinuation is greater than 30 days after the last dose of study drug to monitor for AEs. All subjects w ill be required to complete 3 Clinical/Safety 
Follow-up visits regardless of whether they start a new anti-cancer therapy, except those subjects who withdraw consent for study participation.
3.1.3.2 Survival/Long-term/Response Follow-up
After completion of the Clinical/Safety Follow-up period, all sub jects w ill then enter the 
Survival/Long-term Follow-up period. During this pe riod, clinic visits or telephone contact every 
3 months will be performed to assess survival status. The duration of the Survival/Long-term
Follow-up period will be a pproximately 2 years following the fi rst dose of study drug, and a 
minimum of 12 months following the last dose of study drug. 
After completion of the Safety Follow-up period, subjects who discontinue study with ongoing 
SD, PR, or CR at the EOT visit will enter the Response Follow-up period. This period will occur simultaneously with the Survival Follow-up pe riod for these subjects. These subjects will 
continue to have radiological and clinical tumor assessments every 3 months (12 weeks) during the Response Follow-up period or until disease progression or withdrawal of study. Radiological 
tumor assessments for subjects who have ongoing clinical benefit may continue to be collected after subjects complete the survival phase of the study.
Subjects in the Survival/Long-term Follow-up pe riod who have progression of disease will be 
allowed to receive tumor-directed therapy as required.
Data from imagi ng assessments for subjects who have ongoing clinical benefit may continue to 
be collected after sub jects complete the survival phase of the study.

3.1.4 Re-treatment during Safe ty/Survival/Long -term Follow-up
Re-treatment may be allowed in this study  with disease progression during follow-up. Subjects 
completing approximately 48 week s of study treatment or who discontinue therapy due to a CR, 
who enter Safety/Survival/Long-term Follow-up with ongoing disease control (CR, PR, or SD) 
for reasons other than drug-related toxicity, may be eligible for re-treatment upon subsequent confirmed disease progression within 12 months of the last dose of study drug, on a case-by-case 
basis, after careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether the benefit/risk ratio supports administr ation of further st udy drug. Subjects meeting 
criteria for re-treatment will be  treated for a maximu m duration of 2 years from first dose of 
nivolumab, with the originally assigned dose regimen (eg, same dose and dose schedule 
administered during the initial tr eatment period) or modified dose regimen, unless that dose and 
schedule were subsequently found to exceed the MTD, in which case th e subject will be treated 
at the next lower or alternate dose and schedule (see Table 4.5.3-1 ). Subjects entering this phase 
will follow the same Time and Events schedule as outlined in Section 5 . Samples for PK will be 
collected less frequently. During re -treatment, pharmacodynamic biomarker samples obtained 
from blood will be collected as outlined in Section 5.7.

3.1.5 Part 1: Dose Escalation
The dose escalation phase of the study will evaluate the MTD/MAD/alternate dose of 
BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab based on DLTs using a BLRM model (for 
BMS-986205 monotherapy lead-i n) and BLRM-copula model (f or BMS-986205 in combination 
with nivolumab). The Bayesian models will be used for recommendation of the next dose to be investigated. A BLRM (combined with copula) fr amework with an escalation with overdose 
control principle will be employed to ensure that safety is not compromised during dose escalation.
The initial dose level of BMS- 986205 will be 25 mg administered orally daily. Once initial 
lead-in monotherapy (Cycle 0) is  deemed tolerable, combination with a 240-mg flat dose of 
nivolumab at the same dose level with the same subject (Cycle 1) will be initiated. Dose levels to be considered for the next combination cohort of the subject (with monotherapy 
lead-in) will be based on recommended monotherapy dose from the BLRM and recommended 
combination dose from the BLRM-copula. The lower dose from these 2 recommendations will 
be considered. Potential dose levels for dose escalation are provided in Table 3.1.5-1 .T h e  
maximum allowable increase in dose will be 100%. Final dose selection for the next cohort/dose 
level will be made in conjunction with all data available from PK and pharmacodynamic assessments, and will be made after discussion and agreement between investigators and the 
BMS Medical Monitor. Accordingly, intermediate or lower doses, or less frequent dosing of 
BMS-986205 may be tested if none of the planned dos es/schedules are found to be tolerated as 
lead-in phase or in combination with nivolumab.
Approximately 30 subjects will be treated in the dose escalation phase. Depending on the dose 
recommendation, more than 3 subjects can be treated at each dos e level. Increments of 
approximately 3 subjects will be added to each dose level depending on model reco mmendation 
and clinical judgment. Once the safety of any dose level has been established, up to 12 additional 
subjects may be added to better characterize the PK and pharmacodynamic profile.
Cohort-tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendation will occur when 
2 DLT-evaluable subjects within a subject cohort have completed the 6-week DLT observation period (see Section 4.5.1 for criteria for DLTs). DLTs occurri ng within the 2 weeks of the lead-
in period (DLT observation period for monotherapy) will be used to fit the BLRM model for 
monotherapy. DLTs occurring within the 4 weeks of combination period (DLT observation 
period for combination) will be used to fit the BLRM-c opula model. The lower reco mmended 
dose from both models will be considered for next dose escalation. Subjects who received ≥75% 
of BMS-986205 doses and 2 doses of nivolumab, and have been followed at least 5 days after the 
second nivolumab dose, in the 6-week DLT observation period will be considered as 
DLT-evaluable subjects. Continuous re-assessment of dose recommendation by BLRM will be 
carried out at each dose level after each c ohort of subjects with consideration of all available 
DLT information.
The MTD/MAD/alternate dose of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab selected for the 
cohort w ill be based on evaluating the recommendation from the BLRM-c opula and a synthesis

of all available data, including clinical and laboratory safety assessments, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data, from all tr eated sub jects at each dose level up to the 
MTD/MAD.
Up to 12 additional subjects may be added per selected dose levels to provide additional safety, 
tolerability, and PK data. This information will be incorporated into the final reco mmendation 
for the MAD/MTD/alternate dose of BMS-986205.
No intra-subject dose escalation is allowed, although dose modifications may be permitted (see 
Table 4.5.3-1 ).
Sentinel Subject: During dose escalation, a staggered dosing (sentinel subject) approach will be 
used for the first subject in the first dose level of both lead-in and combination. The first subject 
in both lead-in a nd combination w ill receive Cycle 0 Day 1 dose of study drugs and will be 
observed for 5 days before additional subjects (ie, subject 2 onward) in that cohort receive study 
drug. The first subjects to be dosed in subsequent  cohorts will not be required to observe the 5-
day interval between treatment start dates.

3.1.6 Part 2: Dose Expansion
The purpose of dose expansion is to gather a dditional safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, 
PK, and pharmacodynamic information regarding BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab.
Eight disease-restricted populati ons will be included in dose expansion. These include cervical 
cancer, DLBCL, SCCHN, bladder cancer, melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, and pancreatic cancer. 
Various subpopulations of  melanoma and NSCLC will be included in separate cohorts to further

understand the role of IDO1 inhibition in these specific populations as described in Section 1.1.5
and Table 3.1.6-1 ). An additional cohort w ill be dedicated to tumor types from the escalation 
inclusion criteria that do not curre ntly have a dedicated expansion c ohort or plans for evaluation 
in other studies. The eligible tumor types will be triple negative breast cancer, adenocarcinoma 
of the endometrium, epithelial cancer of the ovary, and sarcoma. Enrollment to this additional cohort w ill not exceed a pproximately 35 to 40 subjects. It w ill allo w for the exploration of early 
efficacy signals seen during the dose escalation portion of the trial as w ell as potential signals 
arising from ongoing trials of other IDO1 inhibitors in combination with anti-PD-(L)1. 
During dose expansion, the Simon 2-stage (optimal) design will be used as a guide for some of 
the tumor-specific expansion c ohorts , although not used for hypothesis testing. Enrollment will 
continue for these tumor-s pecific expans ion cohorts wh ile evaluation of eff icacy at stage 1 is 
ongoing. The 2-stage design with a reasonable fals e-positive rate (FPR) and false-negative rate 
(FNR) will provide guidance for the total sample s ize for these cohorts based on assumptions of

the cohort expansion portion of the study.
3.1.7 Part 3: BMS-986205, Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab Combination
Part 3 of the study will include a init ial safety evaluation c ohorts of 3 regimens of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in combination with BMS-986205 in melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer.  
Expansion cohorts for each regimen will then be  conducted in the tumor type evaluated in the 
safety cohorts. The Ipi 1Q 8W regimen w ill also be evalu ated in a mixed cohort of other tumor 
types evaluated in Part 2. Each tumor type will receive BMS-986205 in combination with a 
specific nivolumab and ipilimumab regimen (see Section 3.1.1.2).
For the safety cohorts, the init ial dose level of BMS- 986205 for each cohort will be based on the 
available of safety, PK, and PD data for BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab and any available from the combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab.  The starting dose will not exceed 100 mg in any safety cohort.  Lowe r dose levels of BMS-986205 (if required) to be
evaluated in each safety c ohort w ill be based on Table 3.1.5-1 . Intermediate or lower doses, or 
less frequent dosing of BMS-986205 may be tested if none of the planned doses/schedules are found to be tolerated. In addition, alternative lower doses and more intermittent schedules of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab may be evaluated if  the specified regimen us ed in each tumor type
safety cohort is not found to be tolerable wi th any of the doses of BMS-986205 outlined in Table 
3.1.5-1 . Safety will be evaluated independently for each tumor type/regimen combination and 
treatment regimen based on DLTs using a BLRM-copula model.
All safety cohorts w ill begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the trip let 
combination regimen in a limited number of subjects. As described in Section 3.1.1.2 , the 
NSCLC/Ipi 1Q6 and melanoma/Ipi 1Q8 regimen cohorts will begin enrollment first, followed by 
the bladder/Ipi 3Q3 regimen cohort once safety and tolerability have been established in either NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6 or melanoma/Ipi 1Q8. Initially, approximately 3 subjects w ill be tr eated at the 
selected dose combination of BMS-986205 with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The first subject in each safety cohort will be a sentinel subject w ho will be observed for 5 days after administration 
of the first combination dose to ensure safety a nd tolerability before other subjects can receive
treatment within that cohort.
Due to the potential for early discontinuation, an additional subject(s) may be enrolled to ensure 
approximately 3 DLT-evaluable subjects. Initial safety assessment to allow enro llment in the 
bladder/ Ipi 3Q3 safety cohort will occur when at least 2 evaluable subjects in either the NSCLC/
Ipi 1Q6 or melanoma/ Ipi 1Q8 safety cohorts have completed a 6-week DLT evaluation period
(see Section 4.5.1 for criteria for DLTs). In the melanoma and NSCLC safety evaluation cohorts, 
if a potential DLT occurring in any third evaluable subject in the specific dose combination does 
not influence the recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) to open enrollment in the bladder safety cohort, then the bladder safety cohort may proceed with enrollment without waiting for the third
subject to complete the corresponding DLT observation period.

DLT-evaluable subjects will be defined as subjects who in the 6-week DLT evaluation period 
received ≥75% of BMS-986205 doses and the following nivolumab and ipilimumab doses for 
each regimen:
•Melanoma/ Ipi 1Q8: 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at 
least 5 days after the second dose of nivolumab
•NSCLC/ Ipi 1Q6: 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 days after the second dose of nivolumab
•Bladder/ Ipi 3Q3: 2 doses of nivolumab and 2 doses of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 days after the second dose of each drug
After the initial sub jects in each tr eatment reg imen are evaluated, addi tional increments of 
approximately 3 to 6 subjects will be treated in the same safety  cohort as per the BLRM-c opula 
model recommendation that the dose combination is  safe. At least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects will 
be treated and assessed for a particular BMS-986205 dose in that tumor type/regimen cohort
before enrollment in the expansion cohorts for th at regimen will begin. Up to 12 DLT-evaluable 
subjects in total may be treated in each safe ty evaluation cohort at the BMS-986205 dose chosen 
for expansion regimens for further evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamic/PK parameters as 
required. BLRM (-copula) will be used to moni tor the safety of each triplet dose combination on 
an ongoing basis.
Once the initial safety and tolerability have been established independently for each regimen
based on the safety cohorts, enrollment will then begin in expansion c ohorts for further 
evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy. In 
the expansion cohorts, BM S-986205 w ill be ad ministered at a dose determined to be tolerable in 
combination with each nivolumab and ipilimumab regimen. Each BMS-986205 and 
nivolumab/ipilimumab combination regimen will be evaluated in tumo r-specific cohorts based 
on the tumor type evaluated in the safety cohorts.   The Ipi 1Q8 regimen will also be evaluated in 
a mixed tumor-type cohorts which may incorporate tumor types evaluated in Part 2.
The 3 tumor types for tumor-restricted cohorts w ill be melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder. As all 
subjects in these di sease-specific cohorts w ill be receiving agents (nivolumab and ip ilimumab) 
with known anti-tumor activity in those tumor types, a single-stage design will be ut ilized for 
each of these tumor types. Approximately 40 sub jects will be treated in each of the following
expansion cohorts: melanoma PD-L1 positive,  melanoma PD-L1 negative, NSCLC PD-L1 
positive, NSCLC PD-L1 negative, and bladder; this is to allow for the exploration of early 
efficacy signals of BMS-986205 in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in relevant 
subpopulations. In each NSCLC expansion cohort, approximately 10 subjects w ill be IO-
treatment naive, 25 will be treatment-naive,  and 5 IO-therapy experienced. In the melanoma 
cohorts, a pproximately 35 will be treatment naïve in the advanced s etting and 5 w ill be IO-
therapy experienced in each cohort. In the bladder e xpansion cohort in Part 3, at least 30 subjects 
will be I-O therapy naive.
A mixed tumor type expansion cohort w ill also be evalu ated, using the same regimen as in the 
melanoma safety cohort, Ipi 1Q8W. The purpose of this cohort is to obtain preliminary safety,

Q4W/Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q8W backbone in combination with BMS-986205 at the dose selected for the melanoma expansion cohort. Up to forty subjects may be treated in this cohort. 
Tumor types included in this cohort may be any previously evaluated in Part 2. All subjects in 
this cohort will be IO-tr eatment naive. Selection of tumor types and number of subjects per 
tumor type will be at the discretion of the S ponsor and based on emerging data from Part 2 of 
this study as well as other external data (e.g. from studies of nivolumab and ipilimumab in a particular tumor type). For each tumor type enrolled into this c ohort, a pproximately 6 s ubjects 
will be initially evalu ated for safety and tolerability for 6 weeks each for toxicities meeting DLT 
criteria exceeding the threshold defined below pri or to enrollment of any ot her subjects with that 
tumor type.
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the expansion cohorts w ill be performed th roughout 
enrollment in the expansion c ohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of tr eatment-related 
toxicities meeting DLT criteria within an individual tumor type/tr eatment reg imen exceeds 33% 
across all subjects treated in the safety evaluation and dose expansion cohorts, the findings w ill 
be discussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. At that time, depending on the nature 
and grade of the toxicities and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) of BMS-986205 and/or dose and schedule of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab (as described above) for subjects within that cohort may be initiated.
3.2 Post Study Access to Therapy

eligibility criteria.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche, who has not undergone 
surgical sterilization (hysterect omy or bilateral oophorectomy), and who is not postmenopausal. 
Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 in the absence of 
other biological or physiolog ical causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must 
have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause.
Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durations of 
the washout periods below are suggested guidelines, and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (eg, rings, creams, gels)
•4 weeks minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products

level is > 40 mlU/mL at any time during the washout pe riod, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
Prohibited and/or restricted medications taken prior to and during study d rug administration in 
the study are described below. Medications taken within 2 weeks prior to st udy drug 
administration must be recorded on the case report form (CRF).
The following medications are prohibited during the study:
•Prior exposure to BMS-986205 or other IDO inhibitor.
•Concurrent administration of any anti-cancer th erapies (investigationa l or approved) with the 
exception of subjects in the follow up and survival period of the study. 
•Concomitant use of strong inhi bitors of CYP3A4 and/or CYP1A2 or strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP1A2 (see Appendix 7 ).
•Immunosuppressive agents (except as stated in Section 3.4.3 ), unless they are utilized to treat 
an AE.
•Use of any medicinal herbal preparations within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug and 
during study tr eatment unless prescribed by a treating physician. Please see restrictions on 
the use of marijuana in Section 3.4.2 .
•Palliative radiotherapy is permitted only under certain conditions as described in 
Section 3.3.1 .
Any concomitant therapies must be recorded on the CRF.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Restricted therapies are not prohibited but are not recommended; consult BMS medical monitor 
if the following are clearly medically indicated:
1) Grapefruit and Seville oranges and their ju ices can inhibit CYP3A4  and should not be 
consumed while on study.
2) Concurrent use of moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or CYP1A2 may affect 
the systemic exposure of BMS-986205. See Appendix 7 for a list of CYP3A4 and/or 
CYP1A2 modulators.
3) Concurrent smoking (tobacco, marijuana, etc.) may induce CYP1A2 and decrease the 
systemic exposure of BMS-986205. 
4) Caution is warranted when consuming marijuana by means other than smoking as it may lead 
to increased exposure of BMS-986205 through interaction with metabolic enzymes. 
5) Caution is warranted when administering BMS-986205 to subjects taking drugs that are
highly dependent on CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 for metabolism. See Appendix 7 for a list of sensitive CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates.
6) Caution is warranted when administering BMS-986205 to subjects taking drugs that may be 
associated with QT prol ongation. Drugs th at may prolong QT intervals are prohibited during

Cycle 0 of the QTc substudy. See Appendix 8  for a list of common medications associated 
with QT prolongation.
7) Caution is warranted when administering BMS-986205 to subjects taking drugs that are 
subject to extensive intestinal efflux by P-gp/BCRP. See Appendix 9 for a list of common 
P-gp/BCRP substrates.
8) In vitro solubility data i ndicate that BMS-986205 has decreased solubility with increasing 
pH. Until further data are available, sub jects should try to avoid taking proton pump 
inhibitors. H 2antagonists and short-acting antacid agents, such as M aalox®or TUMS®, may 
be taken, but it is recommended that these not be taken 4 hours before or 4 hours after dosing 
of BMS-986205.
9) Caution is warranted when using other agents known to cause methemoglobinemia (see 
Appendix 10 ). Dapsone, topical anesthetics, and antimalarial drugs are the most likely 
agents, and thus these drugs should only be used after discussion with the Study 
Director/Medical Monitor.
10) Preclinical studies suggest potential effect of food on BMS-986205 absorption (see 
Section 1.4.3 ). BMS-986205 should be administered following a light meal (see Table 4-2
for a sample light meal). Subjects should avoid heavy meals with high fat content 4 hours 
prior until 4 hours post BMS-986205 dose.
The development of serotonin syndrome has been associated with exposure to another 
investigational agent that inhibits the IDO1 enzyme. No case of serotonin syndrome has been 
observed with administration of BMS-986205. Given the possibility of a class effect, there is a 
theoretical risk that BMS-986205 could cause an increase in serotonin levels in the brain that 
might trigger serotonin syndrome when administered in combination with serotonergic agents or tryptophan supplements. Use caution and monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome in 
subjects receiving concurrent serotonergic psyc hiatric medications and/or tryptophan 
supplements.
3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
•Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Treatment with a short course of steroids 
(< 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating study drug is permitted. A brief course of 
corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye  allergy) or for treatment of nonautoimmune 
conditions (eg, delayed-t ype hypersensitivity r eaction caused by a contact allergen) is 
permitted.
•Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with mi nimal systemic absorption may be continued if 
the subject is on a stable dose) and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in th e absence of active autoimmune disease. 
Nonabsorbed intra-articular steroid injections will be permitted.
•Immunosuppressive agents and the use of systemic corticosteroids are permitted in the 
context of treating AEs. Subject s receiving corticosteroids for treatment of drug-related AEs 
must be at < 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent prior to re-initiation of study drug. Subjects 
may continue to receive HRT.

•Subjects receiving RANK-L inhibitors or bisphosphonates are permitted as clinically 
indicated but should be avoided, if possible, prior to completion of Cycle 1.
3.4.3.1 Palliative Local Therapy
Palliative and supportive care for disease-rel ated symptoms may be offered to all subjects on the 
trial; however, investigators should consult with the BMS Medical Monitor prior to initiating 
palliative radiation in subjects who have not yet completed the DLT evaluation period. Limited radiation therapy or surgery to control isolated lesions is permitted for subjects who have investigator-assessed clinical benefit following consultation with the BMS Medical Monitor.
Subjects should not receive study drug during radiation as the potential for overlapping toxicities 
with radiotherapy and BMS-986205 or with radiotherapy and the combination of BMS-986205 and nivolumab is currently not known. Anecdotal da ta suggest that radiotherapy administered to 
subjects while receiving nivolumab therapy is tolerable. However, because concurrent 
radiotherapy and immunotherapies in cancer have  not been formally evaluated, in cases where 
palliative radiotherapy is required for a tumor lesion, then BMS-986205 alone or BMS-986205
in combination with nivolumab (and ipilimumab, where applicable) should be withheld for at 
least 1 week before, during, and 1 week after radi ation. Subjects should be closely monitored for 
any potential toxicity during and after receivi ng radiotherapy, and AEs related to radiotherapy 
should resolve to Grade 1 prior to resuming study drug.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects Following any Treatment with Study Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment and/or participation in the study
•Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the 
investigator indicates that continued participation in  the study is not in the best interest of the 
subject
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent thro ugh imprisonment or i nvoluntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness
•Inability to comply with protocol
•Discretion of the investigator
•Pregnancy
•Completion of study-required procedures. 
•Documented and confirmed disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 or IWG (see Appendix 3 and 4) unless subject meets criteria for treatment beyond progression 
(Section 3.5.1 )
•Clinical deterioration while receiving active study d rug that in the opinion of the investigator 
indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject
•Protocol-defined reasons for discontinuation (see Sections 3.5.1 and 4.5.6).

In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately, within 24 hours of the event, notify 
the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this ev ent. In most cases, the study drug will be 
permanently discontinued in an appropriate ma nner. If the investigator determines a possible 
favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants conti nuation of study drug, a discussion between the 
investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue investigational product s hould comply with protocol-specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 5 . The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-tr eatment study follow-up or 
loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in th e subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
3.5.1 Treatment Beyond Progression
A subset of subjects with solid tumors treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit 
despite initial evidence of PD. Subjects will be perm itted to continue on treatment beyond initial 
RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3 ) or IWG-defined PD, as long as they meet the following criteria:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and not having rapid disease progression;
•Continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria;
•Tolerance of study drug;
•Stable performance status;
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases);
•Subject provides written informed consent pri or to receiving any additional nivolumab, 
ipilimumab, or BMS-986205 treatment using an IC F describing any reasonably foreseeable 
risks, discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.
The assessment of clinical bene fit should take into account whether the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely  to receive further benefit from continued tr eatment. All d ecisions to 
continue treatment beyond init ial progression must be documented in the study records. Subjects 
will be re-consented to explain the rationale for this ongoing treatment.
3.5.2 Discontinuation Due to Further Progression (Confirmed Progression)
Subjects should discontinue st udy drug upon further evidence of further progression, defined as 
an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression s hould be used as the reference 
baseline for comparison with the postprogression assessment.

Approved 7.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
Any new lesion considered nonmeasurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and therefore must be included in the tumor burden measurement as follows:
For solid tumors: New lesions are considered  measurable at the time of initial progression if the 
longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a 
short axis of at least 15 mm).
For statist ical analyses that include the investigator-assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment beyond init ial investigator-assessed, RECIST v1.1 or IWG-defined 
progression will be considered to have invest igator-assessed PD at the time of the initial 
progression event.
3.5.3 Assessment Schedule for Subjects with Postprogression Treatment
Subjects should continue to receive monitoring according to the On-Treatment Assessments in 
Section 5.4 . Radiographic assessment by computed tomography (CT; preferred) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) described in Section 5 is required when subjects continue 
postprogression treatment. For sub jects who discontinue postprogression tr eatment with study 
drug, no additional radiographic assessments will be required.
3.6 Post Study Drug Follow-up
 Post study follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject sa fety and the integrity of the study. Subjects 
who discontinue study drug must continue to be followed for collection of outcome and/or 
Survival Follow-up data as required and in line with Section 3.1.3 until death or the conclusion 
of the study.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug will remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by the sub ject to provide th is information. Subjects s hould notify the investigator of 
the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as 
to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to lo cate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject as noted a bove. Lost to 
follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of 3 documented phone 
calls, faxes, texts, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to 1 registered mail letter. All

attempts should be documented in the subject’ s medical rec ords. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study 
has been included in the subject’s informed cons ent, then the investigator may use a sponsor-
retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information 
or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up portion of the study. The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public h ealth registries 
and databases, in order to obtain updated contact i nformation. If after all attempts, the subject 
remains lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

Study Drug Administration:
BMS-986205
At scheduled PK sample collection as w ell as on laboratory evaluat ion days, BMS-986205 will 
be administered to the subject in the clinical facility. At all other times  throughout the study, 
BMS-986205 will be administered on an out-subject basi s, except when subjects are seen in the 
clinic for administration of nivolumab, assessment of AEs, and laboratory evaluation.Restrictions related to food and fluid intake are described in  Section 3.4.2.
Dose Escalation (Part 1)
BMS-986205 should be administered using the capsule formulation in Part 1.
BMS-986205 should be admin istered in the morning following a light meal a pproximately 
24 hours apart. On the morning of Days 1 and 14 when serial PK samples are collected, after 
fasting for at least 10 hours, each subject will receive a single oral dose of BMS-986205 within 
approximately 5 minutes of completing a light meal. At the time of dosing, approximately 240 
mL of water w ill be administered to the subject along with BMS-986205. The time of BMS-

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or pl acebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, in cluding products already with a marketing authorization but that 
are used or assembled (formulated or packaged) diffe rently than the authorized form, used for an 
unauthorized indication, or used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product s hould be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investig ational product must be dispensed only from offic ial study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.In this protocol, investigational products  are BMS-986205, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as s upport or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons as components of the st andard of care for a given diagnosis may be
considered noninvestigational products.
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, the st udy drug should not be 
dispensed and BMS contacted immediately.
Study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Investigational product documen tation (whether supplied by B MS or not) must be maintained 
and include all processes required to ensure  drug is accurately administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage; administration; a nd, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).Storage facilities for controlled substances must be securely locked and substantially constructed, 
with restricted access to prevent theft or diversion, as applicable by local regulations.4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
During the Screening visit, the investigative s ite will call into the enrollment option of the IVRS
designated by BMS for assignment of a 5-digi t subject number that w ill be uni que across all 
sites. Enrolled subjects, including thos e not dosed, will be assi gned sequen tial subject numbers 
starting with 00001 (eg, 00001, 00002, 00003... 00010). The subject identification number (PID) 
will ultimately be composed of the site number and subject number. For example, the first 
subject screened (ie,  enrolled) at site number 1, will ha ve a PID of 0001 00001. Once it is 
determined that the subject meets the eligibility criteria following the Screening visit, the 
investigator site will call the IVRS with in 3 days prior to the first study d rug administration for 
the subject to be assigned treatment groups.

If the clinical pharmacology substudy and dose escalation cohort are open at the same time,
subjects will be assigned to the dose escalation cohort first. If no escalation c ohort is open, 
subjects will be assigned to the clinical phar macology substudy. If the clinical pharmacology
substudy and dose expansion are open at the same time, subjects with the specific tumor type for dose expansion will be assigned to the dose expansion. All other sub jects w ill be assigned to the 
clinical pharmacology substudy.
For the QTc substudy, subjects will be assigned to one of the 3 doses within the substudy. The 
doses or assignments may be adjusted based on future findings. Subjects who did not finish 
Day 14 of the QTc substudy will be replaced.
During dose escalation in Part 1 a nd safety cohort evalu ation in Part 3, subjects who are not 
evaluable for DLT determination ma y be replaced. Replacement subjects w ill be assigned to the 
same treatment but will be assigned a new subject number.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
BMS-986205 will be administered orally daily at the doses listed in Section 3.1.5
Each subject will be assigned to a specific dose level as listed in Section 4 in sequential order 
during dose escalation Part 1. Subjects in dose expansion Part 2 w ill be tr eated at the MTD, the 
MAD, or at an alternate dose determined from Part 1, if agreed upon by the investigators and the 
Sponsor. Subjects treated in Part 3 w ill receive BMS-986205 at 100 mg daily and will receive
doses and schedules of nivolumab and ipilimu mab selected for each tumor-specific expansion 
cohort as detailed in Section 3.1.7 .
In Parts 1 and 2, Nivolumab will be administered intravenously as flat doses; either 240 mg Q2W for the Part 1 dose escalation and for th e Part 2 dose expans ion cohorts that predated
Amendment 06, or 480 mg Q4W for the Part 2 dose expansion cohorts added with or after
Amendment 06 (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, and additional signal-seeking tumors) and the clinical pharmacol ogy substudy. In Part 3, nivolumab will also be administered in flat doses for 
all cohorts at the specified doses for those cohorts.
There will be no dose escalations or reductions  of nivolumab allowed once assigned. Subjects
receiving nivolumab Q2W will be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous dose and no more than 3 days from the scheduled dose. S ubjects receiving nivolumab Q3W may be dosed 21 
days (± 3 days) from the previous dose. Subjects receiving nivolumab Q4W may be dosed 
28 days (± 3 days) from the previous dose.
For subjects receiving ipilimumab, the dosing calcu lations should be based on the body weight. 
If the subject’s weight on the day of the dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used to 
calculate the dose, the dose must be recalculated. All doses should be rounded up or to the 
nearest milligram per instituti onal standard. There will be no dose modifications of ipilimumab 
allowed. Subjects receiving ipilimumab Q3W may be dosed no less than 19 days from the 
previous dose and no more than 3 days from th e scheduled dose. Subjects receiving ipilimumab 
Q6W may be dosed every 42 days ( ±3 days). Subjects receiving ipilimumab Q8W may be dosed 
every 56 days ( ±3 days).

When nivolumab and ipilimumab are scheduled to be dosed on the same day, if dosing is 
delayed, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be delayed together. If dosing is resumed after a 
dose delay, both nivolumab and ipilimumab must be resumed on the same day if the next 
scheduled day includes both nivolumab and ipilimumab administration.
There are no premedications recommended for nivolumab or ipilimumab (where applicable) on 
the first cycle. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, the subjects should be managed according to Section 4.7.1 .
4.5.1 Dose-limiting Toxicities
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be defined based on the incidence and 
grade of AEs for which no alternate cause can be identified.
Part 1: Cycle 0 (BMS-986205 monotherapy lead-in) will have a 2-week DLT evaluation period 
(DLT 1). The comb ination regimen will have 4-week DLT evaluation period (DLT 2). 
Therefore, the total DLT assessment period is 6 weeks in Part 1. Subjects may proceed from 
Cycle 0 to Cycle 1 at each c ohort unless any of the following events are observed: any DLT, 
Grade 2 or higher immune-related AEs considered related to BMS-986205 (eg,immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, he patitis, nephriti s, renal dysfuncti on) with the exception 
of immune-mediated hypothyroidi sm and hyperthyroidism, or Grade 2 AST or ALT elevation 
that does not resolve to Grade 1 within 1 week. For Grade 2 AST or ALT elevations that resolve 
to Grade 1 or baseline within 1 week, subjects can be rechallenged with BMS-986205 
monotherapy for a minimum of 5 days before proceeding to combination with nivolumab provided there is not a r ecurrence of Grade 2 event.
The DLT-evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatment and continues for 6 weeks. The
DLT 1 period is 14 days, and subjects must receive 75% of the BMS-986205 monotherapy doses to be considered evaluable for combination with nivolumab. The DLT 2 period is 4 weeks during which subjects will receive daily dosing of BMS-986205 and 2 doses of nivolumab. The total DLT period is 6 weeks, and subjects must ha ve received at least 75% of BMS-986205 doses and 
2 doses of nivolumab with observation for a minimum of 5 days following the second combination therapy dose to be considered ev aluable for dose escalation decisions. Based on the 
predicted human half-life of BMS-986205 of 23 hours, this interval is expected to cover the anticipated time frame for the occurrence of clinically significant immediate and early onset AEs 
related to BMS-986205 monotherapy during Cycle 0 and repeat dosing of BMS-986205 in 
combination with nivolumab in Cycle 1. 
Part 3: The DLT-assessment period is 6 weeks in Part 3 for all tr eatment re gimens evaluated. 
The DLT-evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatment and continues for 6 weeks. 
DLT-evaluable subjects will be defined as sub jects who in the 6 week DLT evaluation period 
received ≥ 75% of BMS-986205 doses and the following nivolumab and ipilimumab doses for 
each regimen:
•Melanoma/Ipi 1Q8: 2 doses of nivolumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 
5 days after the second dose of nivolumab

•NSCLC/Ipi 1Q6: 2 doses of ni volumab and 1 dose of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 
days after the second dose of nivolumab
•Bladder/Ipi 3Q3: 2 doses of nivolumab and 2 doses of ipilimumab, and followed for at least 5 
days after the second dose of each drug
The incidence of DLTs that occur within 6 weeks following the start of study drug will guide 
dose escalation decisions. AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. For the 
purposes of subject management, drug-related AEs occurring at any time that meet the DLT 
definition will lead to dose interruption, dose m odifications, and/or permanent discontinuation of 
study drug as defined in Section 4.5.3 and Section 4.5.6 . Subjects who withdraw from the study 
during the DLT evaluation interval for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced at the same dose level. The incidence of DLT(s) during the DLT evaluation period will be used in dose escalation decisions and to define the MTD. AEs occurring after th e DLT period will be 
considered for the purposes of defining the MTD, upon agreement between the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor and investigators, if they are determined to have no clear alternative cause and are not related to disease progression.
AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4. For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, 
DLTs are defined below based on the incidence and grade of AEs for which no alternative cause 
can be identified.
In addition to the criteria listed below, any drug-r elated toxicity th at results in a subject not being 
able to receive at least 75% of the doses of BM S-986205 and all pre-specified  doses (see above) 
of nivolumab and ipilimumab (where applicable) during the DLT evaluation period or causing 
greater than 2 weeks of dose delay may be classified as a DLT.

4.5.2 Management Algorithms for Immuno-oncology Agents
I-O agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from AEs caused 
by other therapeutic classes. Nivoluma b, ipilimumab, and BMS-986205 are considered I-O
agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with I-O agents

may mitigate severe tox icity. Manag ement algorithms have been developed from extensive 
experience with nivolumab and ipilimumab to assi st investigators in assessing and managing 
the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological
The clinical nature of AEs noted with BMS-986205 w ill determine the role of the a bove 
algorithms for use in tox icities related to its use in this study.
The algorithms reco mmended for utilization in this protocol are included in  Appendix 5 .
4.5.3 Guidelines for Dose Modification
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study drug. Subjects will be instructed 
to notify their physician immediately for any and all AE s. The criteria presented in this section 
and Table 4.5.3-1 for dose modifications for BMS-986205 are meant as general guidelines.
Dose modification may occur in th e setting of lower grade AE and/or be more conservative than 
indicated in Table 4.5.3-1 based on the clinical j udgment of the investigator and in consultation 
with the Sponsor/Medical Monitor.
•Dose reductions of BMS-986205 should be to the previous lower dose level; subjects 
receiving 25 mg of BMS-986205 will not undergo any (further) dose reductions.
•If several AEs of varying grade or severity occur simultaneously, the dose modification
applied should be the greatest reduction applicable.
•Assessment of causalit y (ie, chronology, c onfounding factors such as disease, concomitant 
medications, diagnostic tests, and previous experi ence with the agent) must be determined 
and documented by the investigator prior to dose modification.
•If the same AE recurs despite a dose reduction, a second dose reduction versus discontinuation of BMS-986205 will be disc ussed and agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor and investigators, if criteria for discontinuation are otherwise not met.
•No more than 2 dose reductions of BMS-986205 will be allowed per subject. Dose re-escalation after a dose reduction may occur in limited circumstances (such as a change in 
attribution of an AE) after discussion a nd agreement of the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and 
investigators.
•Skipped doses will not be administered within the same cycle.
•For an AEs leading to dose modification, BMS-986205, nivolumab, and ipilimumab (where
applicable) should be interrupted to allow recovery from the AE; see Section 4.5.4 for delay 
criteria.  Re-initiation of study drug cannot occur until AE decreases to ≤Grade 1 or baseline 
assessment. See Section 4.5.5 for resumption after dose delays. 
•During the DLT evaluation period, if the dose is  reduced and a subject experiences a DLT at 
the lower dose, this DLT will be attributed to the highest dose level administered.

4.5.4 Dose Delays due to Toxicity
•Subjects who experience a DLT must have study drug held. Subjects who are required to 
permanently discontinue all study drugs are listed in Section 4.5.6 . In addition, all Grade 2 
hepatic, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal,  and neurological AEs should be evaluated and 
managed per the toxicity management algorithms ( Appendix 5 ). Subjects not meeting 
guidelines for permanent discontinuation will be permitted to resume therapy based on the criteria specified below in Section 4.5.5 . Subjects eligible to resume study drug will resume 
study drug at the treatment visit followi ng their last received study drug dose.
•The scheduled tumor assessm ents (ie, CT/MRI, positron emission tomography [PET], etc.) 
will continue on the specified schedule relative to the subject’s first dose regardless of any 
treatment delay incurred.
Study treatment (BMS-986205, nivolumab and ipilimumab [where applicable]) administration 
should be delayed for the following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the exception of fatigue, nausea, vomiting and 
anemia
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin abnormalities
•Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE
•Grade 3 drug-related fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and anemia
•Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following exceptions: 
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amy lase or lipase elevations do not require dose 
delay
−Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discontinuation in most cases (see 
Section 4.5.6 for details)
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in th e judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication
In addition, only BMS-986205 should be delayed for the following:
•Methemoglobin ≥15%
•Clinically significant elevations in methemoglobin (generally 10% with a normal hemoglobin 
level55) with any associated Grade 3 AE (hypoxia, dyspnea, c onfusion, etc) attributable to 
sustained elevations of methemoglobin and not attributable to another etiology

Approved 7.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
•QTcF > 500 msec confirmed by at least 1 repeat ECG and at least 60 msec above baseline 
(See Appendix 8).
If nivolumab or (and ipilimumab in Part 3) dosing is delayed for reasons other than study d rug 
toxicity (eg, administrative issues, holid ays, etc), BMS-986205 dosi ng should continue 
uninterrupted.
Participants may continue to receive nivolumab (and ipilimumab in Part 3) during dose delays of 
BMS-986205 for elevations of methemoglobin and associated events, as well as QTcF prolongations.
For participants with methemoglobin elevations wi th associated Grade 3 AEs, if contribution of 
nivolumab (and ipilimumab in Part 3) to the associated AE cannot be ruled out (eg, a participant 
with dyspnea in whom pneumonitis has not yet been ruled out), nivolumab (and ipilimumab in 
Part 3) dosing should be delayed as well. See Section 4.5.7 for management of 
methemoglobinemia.
If BMS-986205 dosing is delayed, dose reduction may be necessary. See Section 4.5.3 .
If dosing is resumed after a delay, BMS-986205 may be resumed as soon as the criteria to 
resume treatment are met (see Section 4.5.5 ). Nivolumab (and ipilimumab in Part 3) should be 
resumed as soon as possible after criteria to resume treatment are met but may be resumed later than BMS-986205 given the differences in each drug’s administration.
Participants who require delay  of any study treatment should be re-evaluated weekly or more 
frequently if clinically indicated and resume dosing when criteria to resume are met.
4.5.5 Criteria to Resume Treatment
•Subjects experiencing AEs not meeting criteria for permanent discontinuation as ou tlined 
inSection 4.5.6 may resume treatment with study drug under the following criteria:
•Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade≤1 or baseline value with the following EXCEPTIONS:
−Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.
−Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•Grade 2 eye pain or blurred vision not meeting DLT criteria ( Section 4.5.1 ) must resolve to 
baseline prior to resuming study drug.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.
•Subjects with drug-related endoc rinopathies adequately contro lled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement ma y resume treatment.
•If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the sub ject s hould restart treatment at the next 
scheduled time point per protocol.
•The consideration to re-init iate study drug under these exceptions will be made on a case-by-
case basis after considering the overall benefit/risk profile and in consultation between the

investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor. Any AE with clinical risk will be assessed on a
case-by-case basis with the investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor to determine the risks 
and benefits of continuing therapy following resolution versus discontinuing therapy 
permanently.
•If treatment with study drug is delayed > 6 weeks from the last dose of BMS-986205 and /or 
nivolumab (and ipilimumab, where applicable), the subject must be permanently 
discontinued from study drug, except as specified in Section 4.5.3 .
4.5.6 Guidelines for Permanent Discontinuation
Subjects will be required to permanently discontinue all study drugs for the following AEs:
•Clinical deterioration, as assessed by the investigator
•Any occurrence of serotonin syndrome
•Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related AE lasting > 7 days, or recurs with the following 
exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, ne urologic tox icity, drug-related uveitis, 
pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity r eactions, i nfusion reactions, endocrinopathies
(and diarrhea and colitis for subjects receiving ipilimumab):
−Grade 3 drug-related neurologic toxicity, uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm,
myocarditis, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation; for subjects receiving ipilimumab, Grade 3 diarrhea and colitis of any 
duration also require discontinuation
−Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies, adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal ins ufficiency requires 
discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement. 
−Grade 3 drug-related laboratory a bnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation 
except:
♦Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 da ys or associated with bleeding requires 
discontinuation
♦Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) a bnormality that meets the following 
criteria require discontinuation:
oGrade ≥3 drug-related AST, ALT or Total Bilirubin requires discontinuation*
oConcurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN
* In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study tr eatment w ill be permanently 
discontinued. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuation of study treatment, a discussion  between the investigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur.
•Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or la boratory abnormality (including but not limited 
to creatinine, AST, ALT, or Total Bilirubin), except for the following events which do not 
require discontinuation:
−Grade 4 neutropenia ≤7 days
−Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase

−Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imb alances/abnorm alities th at are not associated with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected with supp lementation/appropriate management within 72 
hours of their onset
−Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events, such as, hyper- or hypothyroidism, 
or glucose intolerance, which resolve or ar e adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone rep lacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormone s) or glucose-controlling agents, 
respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the 
BMS Medical Monitor.
•Any dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks will be cause for permanent discontinuation. Extensions
to the period of dose delays may be granted  for individual subjects on a case-by-case basis
after specific consultation and agreement be tween the investigator and BMS Medical
Monitor in settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study drug (eg, subject deriving 
clinical benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper fo r management of non-DLT immune-
related AEs or experiences delays for management of a non-drug-related AE).
•Accordingly, dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related AEs 
are allowed. Additionally, dosing delays > 6 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
•Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMSMedical Monitor must be consulted.
•Tumor assessments should continue as pe r protocol even if dosing is delayed.
All subjects who discontinue investigational product s hould comply with protocol-sp ecified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 3.1.2. The only exception to this requirement is 
when a subject withdraws consent for all st udy procedures including post-treatment study 
follow-up or loses the ability to consent freely (e g, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for 
the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in th e subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page
4.5.7 Detection and Management of Methemoglobinemia
BMS-986205 may produce a p-chloroaniline metabolite . P-chloroaniline has been associated 
with the production of methemoglobin. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia are related to the lack 
of oxygen delivery to tissues and are proportional to the fraction of methemoglobin, as described 
below for subjects with normal hemoglobin levels. 
Symptoms associated with elevations of methemoglobin are as follows:
•0% to 10% - Usually asymptomatic
•10% to 20% - Cyanosis without other symptoms
•20% to 50% - Headache, dyspnea, lightheadedness (possibly syncope), weakness, confusion, 
palpitations, chest pain
•50% to 70% - Coma, seizures, arrhythmias; acidosis
•> 70% - Usually death

Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
Note that subjects with anemia may experience symptoms at lower methemoglobin percentages 
than listed above, depending on the degree of anemia. 
Increasing levels of methemoglobin may confound the results of standard pulse oximeters, with 
values of around 85% reported consistently as meth emoglobin levels increase, regardless of the 
true oxygen saturation.
When methemoglobinemia is suspected, part of the diagnostic work-up includes evaluation for 
other disorders that can present with a similar clinical picture, including cardiac and pulmonary 
disease. A fresh peripheral blood sample (either ve nous or arterial) should be sent for evaluation 
of methemoglobin levels; methemoglobin levels may vary with storage of blood.  
Testing is done at Screening, at least once each treatment cycle, and as clinically indicated. The following management recommendations are intended as guidelines for the investigator and 
may be modified based on institutional pract ices or local standard of care, as appropriate. 
Initial care includes supportive measures and the administration of supplemental oxygen. In mild 
cases, recovery often occurs simply by interrupting the administration of the offending medication. Concomitant medication lists s hould be reviewed for med ications besides st udy 
treatment which can cause methemoglobinemia (see Appendix 10 ).
Further treatment is generally indicated wh en the methemoglobin level is above 20% or is 
associated with symptoms.
Intravenous methylene blue is the first-line an tidotal agent and works by restoring the oxygen 
carrying capacity of hemoglobin by reduction of m ethemoglobin from its oxidized state. It is 
given as a 1% solution at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg. Most sub jects require only 1 dose, and 
symptoms should resolve within 1 hour. Met hylene blue may confound the interpretation of 
methemoglobin levels detected by co-oximetry; alternative methods s hould be used after 
treatment with methylene blue if methemoglobin  level monitoring is required. Methylene blue 
should be used with caution in subjects with concurrent use of serotonergic psychiatric 
medications, as this could increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. 
Exchange transfusion and hyperba ric oxygen treatment are second-lin e options for subjects with 
severe methemoglobinemia whose condition doe s not respond to methylene blue or who cannot 
be treated with methylene blue. Subject transfer should occur when life-threatening 
methemoglobinemia that is refractory  to treatment occurs in a fa cility that cannot provide the 
appropriate crit ical care.

BMS-986205 will be administered on an out-subject basi s, except when subjects are seen in the 
clinic for administration of nivolumab, assessment of AEs, and laboratory evaluation. Trained 
medical personnel will dispense BMS-986205 to the subjects. Treatment compliance will be 
monitored by drug accountability, as well as by recording BMS-986205 administration in the subject p ill diary, medical record, and CRF. Subjects s hould bring all drug containers to each 
study visit for drug reconciliation.
4.7.1 Treatment of Drug-related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, they 
are unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity r eactions. However, if 
such a reaction were to occur, it might mani fest with fever, chills, rigors, headach e, rash, 
pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion reactions s hould be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported 
as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local tr eatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: Mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not i ndicated; intervention not 
indicated.
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recomme nded for future infusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or acetami nophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional study drug administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion inte rruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤24 hours.
•Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and tr eat 
the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/ or paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg (acetaminophen); monitor subject until resolution of symptoms.
•Bronchodilator or corticosteroid therapy may also be administered as appropriate.
•The infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if 
no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely.
•The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the CRF.
•If symptoms recur, then no further ipilimumab or nivolumab, as the case may be, will be administered at that visit.
•The following prophylactic premedications ar e recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipilimumab

administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may 
be used.
Late-occurring symptoms:
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, 
oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: Severe reaction; Grade 3: prol onged (eg, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi talization indicated fo r other clin ical se quelae 
(eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates); Grade 4: life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated.
Immediately discontinue study drug infusion. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and treat the 
subject as follows: recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for 
subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of  a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Study drug will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should 
follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and 
monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity 
symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), 
symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced by the investigator) such as 
partially used study drug containers, vials , and syringes may be destroyed on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the 
responsible BMS study monitor unless study drug containers must be immediately destroyed as required for safety or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed, provide d the following minimal standards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not  expose humans to risks from the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and

5.1.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead-in Period
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior to 
Randomization) and is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, as it represents the 
subject’s most current, clinical state.
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 5.1-1 may be repeated in an 
effort to find all pos sible well-qualified subjects. Consultation with the med ical monitor may be 
needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular parameter is clinically relevant.Retesting is limited to these specific laboratory parameters and/or assessments.5.2 Study Materials
The site will provide all require d materials for the tests performed locally (ie, relevant clinical 
laboratory tests and urine drug screens). The site will have available a well- calibrated scale for 
recording body weight, a 12- lead ECG machine, and a calibrated sphygmomanometer and 
thermometer for vital signs assessments. A current and fully-stocked (advanced cardiac life 
support or basic cardiac life support) cart will be immediately available on the premises. The site 
will have urine collection con tainers, a refrigerated centrifuge, a monitored and alarmed 
refrigerator, and freezer (-20°C or below), as w ell as containers and dry ice for shipment and 
storage of blood and urine samples. The site will provide all materials required for accurate 
source documentation of study activities and for housing the subjects during the study. BMS will 
supply study medications. 
BMS will provide a BMS-approved protocol and any amendments or administrative letters (if 
required) and IB. CRFs (electronic or hard copy ) will be provided by BMS. BMS/The Central 
Laboratory will provide labels and tubes for the co llection of blood samples for PK/biomarker 
 analysis.
Additionally, the IVRS manual and pharmacy manual will also be provided. 5.3 Safety Assessments
AEs will be assessed continuously during the study and for 100 days after the last dose of study 
drug. AEs will be evaluated according to th e NCI CTCAE v4.03 and should be followed per 
requirements in Sections 6.1.1 and6.2.1 . AEs will be coded using the most current version of 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (M edDRA) and reviewed for potential significance 
and importance. Subjects should be followed un til all treatment-related AEs have recovered to 
baseline or are deemed irreversible by the investigator.
Protocol-specified assessments are detailed in Section 5.1 .

Pregnancy test (WOCBP only) 
TSH with reflex to free T3 and free T4 as applicable.

Results of all laboratory tests required by this prot ocol must be provided to BMS, either recorded 
on the laboratory pages of the CRF or by another mechanism as agreed upon between the 
investigator and BMS (eg, provide d electronically). If the units of a test result differ from those 
printed on the CRF, the recorded laboratory values must specify the correct units. Any abnormal laboratory test result considered clinically significant by the investigator must be recorded on the 
appropriate AE page of the CRF (see Section 6.3 ).
5.3.2.1 Microsatellite Instability Testing
MSI-H (Microsatellite Instability High) in tumors refers to changes in 2 or more of the 
5 National Cancer Institute-recommended panels of  microsatellite markers in tumor tissue. The 
original (1997) Bethesda guidelines proposed a panel of five microsatellite markers for the 
uniform analysis of MSI in HNPCC. This panel, which is referred to as the Bethesda panel, 
included 2 mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and 3 dinucleotide (D5S346, D2S123, and 
D17S250) repeats
56. Individual testing sites may utilize a sli ghtly different panel of markers
incorporating alternative mononucleotide or dinucleot ide markers. Regardless of the panel of 
markers, samples with instability in 0 or 1 marker are designated as non-MSI-H (nMSI-H). 
Those with one unstable marker are designated as MSI-Low (MSI-L). Samples with no detectable alterations are MSI-stable (MSS). Samples with detectable alterations in two or more markers are considered MSI-High (MSI-H).
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Assessment of tumor response will be reported by the investigator and recorded on the CRF for 
appropriate populations of subjects as defined by RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3 ) for subjects 
with solid tumors and IWG (see Appendix 4 ) for subjects with HL and NHL. Investigators will 
also report the number and size of new lesions that appear while on study.
For subjects with lymphoma with bone marrow involvement at screening, a bone marrow biopsy 
and aspirate will be required to confirm a CR.
Body Imaging
CT with contrast is the preferred modalit y (MRI if CT is not feasible). Assessment s hould 
include the chest/abdomen/pelvis at a minimum; and other known/suspected sites of disease 
should be performed.
Disease assessment with CT and/or MRI as a ppropriate will be performed at baseline and as

These efficacy assessment schedules were selected to allow for more direct comparisons of anti-
tumor activity in this study to those of historical comparators for each tumor type.
For all study parts, assessments will be performed every 12 weeks for the first year after the EOT 
visit and then every 6 months thereafter, up to 2 years following the EOT visit. Efficacy 
assessments should continue until disease progression, the completion of follow-up, or un til 
subjects withdraw from the study. 
For subjects with HL and NHL, PET will be performed at baseline and in order to confirm a CR. 
Disease assessments at other time points may be performed as clinically indicated.Brain Imaging
Brain imaging is only required at screening for subjects with known history or symptoms of 
brain metastases and who have not had brain imaging within 30 days of anticipated first study 
drug administration).  After screening, brain imaging is required only as clinically indicated.
Bone Scan
Bone scan may be performed as clinically indicated at baseline (eg, subjects with history of 
symptoms of bone metastases), but bone scans will not be considered a mod ality for assessment 
for measurable disease.  After baseline, bone scan are required only as clinically indicated
Imaging Modalities
For all the solid tumor types subjects, the follo wing imaging assessments should be performed at 
study-specified schedule: CT of the chest, CT or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known 
sites of disease, which is also summarized Table 5.4-1:
•CT scans should be acquired with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap 
(continuous) 
•Should a subject have a contraindication for CT IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest and a contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and other sites of disease may be

obtained. MRIs s hould be acqui red with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no gap 
(continuous).
•PET alone will not be considered for the disease assessment. Complementary CT and/or MRI 
or biopsy must be performed in such cases. 
Note: Use of CT component of a PET/CT sca nner: Combined modality scanning, such as
with FDG-PET/CT, is increasingly used in clinical care and is a mod ality/technology that is 
in rapid evolution; therefore, the recommendati ons outlined here may change rather quickly 
with time. At present, low-dose or attenuation c orrection CT portions of a combined FDG-
PET/CT are of limited use in anatomically-based efficacy assessments, and it is, therefore, 
suggested that they should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically-based RECIST ( Appendix 7 ) measurements. However, if a site can 
document that the CT performed as part of a FDG-PET/CT is of ident ical dia gnostic quality 
to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the FDG-PET/CT can 
be used for RECIST 1.1 measurements. Note, however, that the FDG-PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 
For subjects with lymphomas, FDG PET-CT (or PET-MRI, or PET with CT/MRI) may be 
performed for tumor response assessment throughout the study. If CT performed as part of FDG PET-CT is of comparable quality to a diagnostic  CT (+/- IV contrast), the adequate dose CT of 
the FDG PET-CT can be used for tumor measurements, otherwise additional diagnostic quality CT should be obtained, ideally with oral and intravenous contrast.

5.7.2 Tissue Markers from Fresh Tumor Biopsies
 
 
 
 
With 
Amendment 14, all subjects in Parts 1 and 3 (as well as subjects in other parts wit hout archival 
tissue meeting the requirements above) will  be required to undergo mandatory pre-tr eatment 
biopsies. All subjects will be required to  undergo an on-treatment biopsy at acceptable clinical
risk as judged by the investigator. Please notif y the BMS Medical Monitor if biopsy on-treatment 
may pose unacceptable clinical risk, or if tumor at the time of on-tr eatment biopsy is not 
accessible for sampling.
An optional specimen (not mandatory) at th e time of dis ease progression or during another 
clinically meaningful event (eg, response or AE) may be collected.
Where possible, biopsied lesions should be distinct from index lesions being evaluated for 
radiological response. Biopsies may be excisional,  incisional, or core needle. Excisional biopsies 
are strongly encouraged where feasible. Biopsies  from previously irradiated lesions are only 
suitable if they subsequently progressed. Ba seline samples may be obtained at any time 
following other screening procedures and prior to first dose of study drug (administered on Cycle 0 Day 1 in Part 1 or Cycle 1 Day 1 in Parts 2 and 3). In limited circumstances, recent fresh 
samples (frozen and FFPE) obtained prior to start of screening that meet biomarker requirements of the study as determined by the Study Direct or or Medical Monitor may be substituted for fresh 
biopsies, after permission from the Study Dir ector or Medical Monitor is obtained. Cycle 1 Day 
15 specimens may be obtained within a collection window of Cy cle 1 Day 15 through 
Cycle 1 Day 28. 
As described previously, complete instructions on the collection, processing, handling, and 
shipment of all biomarker specimens will be provi ded in a separate procedure manual. Please 
refer to this manual for information pertaining to the co llection and processing of tissue via 
biopsy or core needle. Collection procedures at baseline and on-tr eatment (and at progression) 
should be completed on a single, appropriately accessible lesion, when applicable. In the case that the lesion sampled at baseline is no longer accessible or within acceptable clinical risk to 
re-biopsy during study (at Cy cle 1 Day 15 or at progression), tissue from alternative lesion(s) 
may be obtained. This shoul d be documented. Immediate c onfirmation for presence of viable 
tumor cells from collected tissue s amples is strongly recommended. If adequate tissue is not 
obtained following initial passages of the needle, repeat passages may be required.
Subjects whose baseline or on-treatment biopsy yiel ds inadequate tissue quantity or quality (lack 
of tumor) will be allowed to continue in the study

 If tissue obtained from  a large proportion of 
subjects is deemed inadequate for testing (e g, possesses low tumor cell con tent), additional 
subjects may be enrolled in an attempt to obtain tissue specimens better-suited for testing.
5.7.2.1 Tumor Kynurenine and Related Metabolites
Tumor levels of kynurenine, tryptophan, and related  metabolites will be measured in fresh frozen 
tumor biopsies collected at baseline and on tr eatment. K ynurenine, tryptophan, and related 
metabolites will be assessed by LC-MS methods. On-tr eatment reduction in tumor k ynurenine 
level is the predicted effect of IDO1 inhibition.

5.7.3 Tissue Markers from Archived Tumor Samples
Submission of baseline tumor tissue sample is mandatory from all patients. Tumor tissue samples 
at baseline should be either archival tumor FFPE, FFPE slides and/or fresh biopsy in FFPE block
- specified wi th cohort. One FFPE block of < 1 year old or 20 slides (fewer slides may be 
acceptable with the approval of the medical monitor,  but generally 15 will be required) of less 
than 4 months old will be requested from patients with no mandatory fresh biopsy requirement at baseline; archival samples from subjects in Parts 1 and 3 are not sub ject to these time limitations 
as these subjects will also undergo fresh pr etreatment biopsie s. These specimens will be 
submitted for central PD-L1 immunohistochemis try (IHC) in melanoma and NSCLC patients. 
The pre-treatment tumor samples must be a core biopsy, punch biopsy, excisional biopsy, or surgical specimen. Fine needle aspirates or othe r cytology specimens are insufficient for 
enrollment. Tumor samples obtained from bone lesion are not acceptable. 
Molecular characterization of archival specimens will be similar to the characterizations 
described above (IHC ) but are likely to focus on the expression of PD-L1  
as candidate markers associated with response to combination therapy.  
 
 
  
Note that HPV status, a known prognostic factor for cervical cancer and SCCHN, will be 
monitored via CRF. When HPV status is unknown for cervical or SCCHN (oropharyngealprimary location) cancer subjects, HPV status (and type) may be assessed/confirmed retrospectively using archival and/or fresh specimens. Analyses may include p16 IHC and/or 
HPV detection methods such as, but not limited to, in situ hybridization and PCR-based 
techniques.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AEis defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition in a clinical investigation sub ject administer ed study drug and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with th is treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an a bnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determin ed by a physician and should be used to assess 
all AEs. The causal r elationship can be 1 of the following:
•Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the 
AE.
•Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration 
and the AE.
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent report ing bias, subjects should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of 1 or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Date: 29-Jun-2018 228
Approved 7.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
•is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event[s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or ho spitalization but, base d upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization). Potential DILI is also considered an important med ical event (see 
Section 6.7 for the definition of potential DILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agen t (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug DILI are not always serious by 
regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting 
pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to st udy drug (eg, death is an 
endpoint; if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be re ported 
as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment requiring admission for bas eline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colorectaloscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth and planned prior to entry into 
the study; appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, family  circumstances, administrative reason)
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB represent the Reference Safety Information to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with p rotocol-specified procedure s. All SAEs must be 
collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of discontinuation of dosingand for 30 days post discontinuation of study drug for subjects not receiving combination

therapy. If applicable, SAEs must be co llected that relate to any later protocol-specified 
procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy). 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to st udy drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS or 
designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the electronic case report form (eCRF). The 
paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporti ng. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only limited information is initially available, fo llow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same i nvestigator term[s] initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to st udy drug or if ne w information 
becomes available, the SAE  report must be updated and s ubmitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious AE is an AE not classified as SAE.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious 
AE information s hould also be co llected from the star t of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.

Approved 7.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and f or those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be reque sted for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AEOSI) have  been defined for this protocol which require 
expedited reporting by the investigator of these adverse events to BMS. These are:
•Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH; also known as histiocytosis haematophagic)
•Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome
These AEOSI, whether related or not related to study drug, must be repor ted to BMS or designee 
within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  These AEOSI are medically important events and are 
therefore considered SAEs. The reporting system for SAEs should be used (see Section 6.1.1 ).
Both HLH and DRESS syndrome may both pose di agnostic challenges due to varying clinical 
manifestations and signs and symptoms that may overlap with other clinical events. To assist 
investigators in identifying constellations of clinical symptoms that may be consistent with one 
of these diagnoses, standardized scoring criteria are provided in Appendix 12 . Formal evaluation 
and documentation of dia gnostic scores based on these systems is not required; investigators 
should use their best clinical judgement as informed by these provided criteria to determine if a 
subject has experienced one of these AEOSI.
6.4 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to  have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the sub ject to r eceive specific corrective 
therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at 
least 5 half-lives + 30 days after nivolumab administration (for a total of 23 weeks post-treatment

completion), the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of 
this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to the BMS designee within 
24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described 
in Section 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, 
dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).
If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment, or re-initiation of study treatment,  a discussion between the investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If, for whatever reas on, the pregnancy has ended, 
confirmed by negative serum pregnancy test, treatmen t may be resumed (at least 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of subject /sponsor /IRB/EC, as applicable.
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome, and where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject s hould be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.6 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses meeting the regulat ory 
definition of SAE must be reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
In the event of an overdose the investigator/treating physician should:
1) Contact the Medical Monitor/designee immediately
2) Closely monitor the subject fo r AEs/SAEs and laboratory a bnormalities
3) Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
CRF.
Decisions regarding dose inte rruptions or modificati ons will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor/designee based on the clinical evaluation of the subject.
6.7 Potential Drug-induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-rel ated laboratory a bnormalities  should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting th e defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).

Potential DILI is defined as: 
1) Aminotransaminases (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times ULN
AND 
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
AND 
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransaminases elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic or biliary 
obstruction caused by tumor.
6.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final PEs, ECG, x-ray filming, or any other 
potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol s hould also be rec orded as a 
nonserious AE or SAE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
8.1.1 Dose Escalation (Part 1)
As a Phase 1 dose escalation trial, the sample size at each dose in these arms depends on 
observed toxicity and posterior inference. For BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab 
(with BMS-986205 lead-in), approx imately 30 subjects are expected to be treated duri ng the 
dose escalation phase. Initi ally, approximately 3 subjects w ill be tr eated at the starting dose 
levels of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab. Due to the potential for early 
discontinuation, an additional subject (s) may be enrolled  to ensure approximately 3 evaluable 
subjects at each dose level.
During the dose escalation phase, once a dose level has been decided, a set of approximately 
3 subjects will be treated at that specified dose level. Cohort-tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendation will occur when  2 evaluable subjects within a set have 
completed a 6-week DLT evaluation period (2 weeks of monotherapy lead-in plus 4 weeks of 
combination treatment). If the potential DLT o ccurring in any third evaluable subject regarding 
the specific dose level does not influence th e dose recommendation by BLRM (-Copula), the 
BLRM (-Copula)-recommended next dose level ma y proceed without waiting for the third
subject to complete the corresponding DLT observation peri od, after discussion and agreement 
between sponsor and investigators. Conti nuous re-assessment of dose recommendation by 
BLRM in the lead-in phase and BLRM-Copula in the combination phase will be carried out at 
each dose level.

Date: 29-Jun-2018 233
Approved 7.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA017003
BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
Additional increments of approximately 3 evaluable subjects will be treated in recommended 
dose levels per BLRM-copula model during the dose escalation phase. At least 6 DLT-evaluable 
subjects will be tr eated in the selected dose cohort(s) chosen for expansion. Due to the 
BMS-986205 lead-in peri od, more than 3 sub jects per cohort may be treated per BMS-986205 
dose level considering potential DLTs happened within lead-in period.
Up to 12 additional subjects may be treated at any dose level below the estimated MTD/MAD 
for further evaluation of safety and pharmacodynamic/PK parameters as required. 
8.1.2 Dose Expansion (Part 2)
Dose expansions of BMS- 986205 administered in combination with nivolumab in 
8 disease-restricted populations, and subjects in 1 mixed cohort of additional signal-seeking 
tumor types will be included. The following 7 tumor-specific cohorts w ill be cla ssified into 3 
categories according to different sample size mod eling settings: SCCHN and bladder cancer in a 
group; cervical cancer, DLBCL, melanoma with prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, NSCLC with prior 
anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, and pancreatic cancer in  a different group; and melanoma with prior anti-
PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy in another group. The two last groups w ill be analyzed using 
a Simon 2-stage design. 
A Simon 2-stage (optimal) design will be used as  a guide for many of the tumor-specific cohorts 
(see below for exceptions). The 2-stage design with a reasonable FPR and FNR, based on 
assumptions of true (target) and historic ORR for each indication, will provide guidance for the 
total sample size for these cohorts. The sample s ize and operational characteristics of using a 
2-stage design are provided in Table 8.1.2-1 , although not used for hypothesis testing. For 
example, guided by, init ially, a minimum of 10 subjects for the SCCHN tumor type will be 
treated in Stage 1 for an initial evaluation of efficacy. Assuming the true response r ate is 50% 
when treated with BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab, if there are 2 or fewer 
responses in 10 tr eated subjects, the cohort would likely not be considered as efficacious. The 
probability of early  stopping for fut ility is a pproximately 53% in this case if in fact the treatment 
is inefficacious. The totality of efficacy data  and response profile will be considered while 
making the decision to terminate. Enrollment will be continued during initial efficacy evaluation (ie, with the indicated number of subjects at S tage 1) to ensure that additional subjects are 
enrolled to account for unexpected trial impact, such as response non-evaluable subjects due to 
early drop- out, design parameter change (eg, historical rate update), and so on.
For an expansion cohort of approximately 35 subjects in the cervical, melanoma: prior 
anti-PD-(L)1, pancreatic, NSCLC: prior anti-PD-(L)1, and DLBCL cohorts, and an assumed true response rate of 30%, there is a 94% chance of observing at least 7 responses (in other words, the 
FNR is 6%). If the true response rate is only 10% rather than 30%, then there is a 6% chance that 
there will be at least 7 responses in 35 subjects (in other words, FPR is 6%). Also if 7 responses are observed (eg, 20% observe d response rate), the lower bound of the 80% confidence interval 
(CI) for the ORR is 11% (higher than historical ORR of 10%). The CI is calculated using the 
Clopper-Pearson method.

For an expansion cohort of approximately 27 subjects in the bladder and SCCHN tumors and 
assumed true response r ate of 50%, there is a 88% chance of observing at least 11 res ponses (in 
other words, the FNR is 12%). If the true response rate is only 25% rather than 50%, then there is 
a 5% chance that there will be at least 11 responses in 27 subjects (in other words, FPR is 5%). If 
11 responses are observed (eg, 40% obs erved response rate), the lower limit of the 80% CI for 
the ORR is 28% (higher than historical O RR of 25%). The CI is calculated using the Cl opper 
Pearson method.
For an expansion cohort of a pproximately 37 subjects with melanoma with prior anti-PD-(L)1 
and anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and an assumed true response rate of 20%, there is a 85% chance of 
observing at least 5 responses (in other words, the FNR is 15%). If the true  response rate is only 
5% rather than 20%, then there is a 14% chan ce that there will be at least 5 responses in 
37 subjects (in other words, FPR  is 14%). Also, if 5 responses are observed (eg, 14% observed 
response rate), the lower bound of the 80% CI for the ORR is 7% (higher than historical ORR of 
5%). The CI is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
The Simon 2-stage design will not be used for the mixed cohort of additional signal-seeking 
tumor types in Part 2. Approximately 35 to 40 subjects will be enrolled to allow for the 
exploration of early efficacy signals seen duri ng the dose escalation portion of the trial as well as 
potential signals arising from ongoing trials of other IDO1 inhibitors in combination with anti-PD-(L)1. A 2-stage design will also not be  utilized for the RCC and I-O naïve melanoma 
and NSCLC cohorts, as nivolumab is already an established standard of care in these settings. 
Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in each of these c ohorts to allow for the exploration 
of early efficacy signals of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab. 
Approximately 16 melanoma I-O naïve BRAF mutant subjects’ post-BRAF inhibitor therapy 
will be randomized into 2 co horts and will either be tr eated with nivolumab or nivolumab in 
combination with BMS-986205, but will not be used for formal statistical comparison.

8.1.3 Combination with Both Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (Part 3)
The combination of BMS-986205 with nivolumab and ipilimumab in Part 3 w ill be evalu ated in 
2 parts, the safety evaluation phase and the cohort expansion phase of the combination in 
melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer as well as a mixed tumor type cohort.
All safety cohorts w ill begin with an assessment of safety and tolerability of the trip let 
combination regimen in a limited number of sub jects, including a sentinel subject. As described 
in Section 3.1.1.2 , the NSCLC and melanoma regimen cohorts w ill begin enro llment first, 
followed by the bladder regimen cohort once safety and tolerab ility has been established in either 
NSCLC or melanoma. Initially, approximately 3 sub jects will be tr eated at the selected dose 
combination of BMS-986205 with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Due to the potential for early 
discontinuation, an additional subject(s) may be enrolled to ensure approximately 3 DLT evaluable subjects. Initial safety assessment to allow enrollment in the bla dder safety cohort will 
occur when at least 2 evaluable subjects in ei ther the NSCLC or melano ma safety cohorts have 
completed a 6-week DLT evaluation period (see Section 4.5.1 for criteria for DLTs). In the 
melanoma and NSCLC safety evaluation cohorts, if the potential DLT occurring in any third evaluable subject regarding the specific dose combination does not influence the 
recommendation by BLRM (-Copula) to open enrollment in the bladder safety cohort, then the 
bladder safety cohort may proceed with enrollment without waiting for the third subject to 
complete the corresponding DLT observation peri od. After the init ial subjects in each tr eatment 
regimen are evaluated, additional increments of approximately 3 to 6 subjects will be treated in 
the same safety cohort as per BLRM-copula model reco mmendation that the dose combination is 
safe. At least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects will be treated and assessed in the selected dosing regimen safety cohort before starting enrollment in the expansion cohort for that tumor 
type/regimen. Up to 12 DLT-evaluable subjects in total may be treated in the safety evaluation 
cohort for each tumor type at the dose selected for e xpansion cohorts for evaluation of safety and 
pharmacodynamic/PK parameters as required. BLRM (-c opula) w ill be used to monitor the 
safety of the triplet dose combination on an ongoing basis. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment r elated toxicities meeting DLT criteria within an individual tr eatment tumor 
type/regimen exceeds 33% across all subjects treated in the safety evaluation and dose expansion 
cohorts, the findings will be discussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. At that time, 
depending on the nature and grade of the toxicities and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) of BMS 986205 for subjects within  that dosing regimen may be initiated at a 
previously tested lower dose le vel or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose 
levels.
Once the initial safety and tolerability has b een established independently for each regimen 
based on safety c ohort evaluations, enrollment will begin of subjects into expansion cohorts for 
further evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor

efficacy. In the expansion cohorts, BMS 986205 will be administered at a dose determined to be 
tolerable in combination with each nivolumab and ip ilimumab regimen. Each BMS-986205 and 
nivolumab/ipilimumab combination regimen will be evaluated in tumo r-specific cohorts based 
on the tumor type evaluated in the safety cohorts.  The Ipi 1Q8 regimen w ill also be evaluated in 
a mixed tumor-type cohorts which may incorporate tumor types evaluated in Part 2 Dose Escalation. This 40 subject cohort is used to ob tain preliminary safety, PK, and PD data for the 
triplet combination in other tumor types.
As all subjects in the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder disease-specific c ohorts w ill be r eceiving 
agents (nivolumab and ipilimumab) with known efficacy, a single-stage design will be utilized 
for each of these tumor types. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in each of the 
following cohorts: melanoma PD-L1 positive,  melanoma PD-L1 negative, NSCLC PD-L1 
positive, NSCLC PD-L1 negative and bladder, mixed tumor type to allow for the exploration of 
early efficacy signals of BMS-986205 in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in relevant subpopulations. In each NSCLC expansion cohort, approximately 10 subjects will be 
IO-treatment naive, 25 will be tr eatment-naive, and 5 IO-therapy experienced. In the melanoma 
cohorts, approximately 35 will be tr eatment-naïve in the advanced setting and 5 w ill be 
IO-therapy experienced in each cohort. In the bladder expansion c ohort in Part 3, at least 30 
subjects will be IO-therapy naive.
The anti-tumor activity of the e xpansion cohorts will be  continuously monito red in all subjects 
who are evaluable for response using the measurements described in Section 8.3.1 . In the 
NSCLC cohort, 16 of 25 responses for the treatment naïve subjects would result in 80% CIs for 
an ORR that is strictly higher than the historical r ate of 4 5.3%.
60In the melanoma cohort, 22 of 
35 responses for the treatment naïve subjects would result in 80% CIs for ORRs that are strictly 
higher than the historical rates of 580.0% .28In the bladder cohort, 16 of 30 responses would 
result in 80% CI for ORR that is strictly higher than the historical rate of 38.5%.61The CIs are 
calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
1) All Enrolled Subjects: All subjects who have signed an ICF and are registered into the IVRS.
2) All Treated Subjects: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
•The primary objective of this study is to establish safety, tolerability, and the 
MTD/MAD/alternate dose. The assessment of safety w ill be based on the incidence of AEs, 
SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and deaths. In addition, clinical laborat ory test 
abnormalities will be examined. AEs and laborat ory values will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE v4.03.
•The co-primary objective, anti-t umor activity of BMS-986205 in combination with 
nivolumab in Part 2 (dose expansion) and BMS-986205 in combination with both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab in Part 3, will be measured by ORR, DoR, and PFSR based on RECIST v1.1 
for solid tumors or IWG for blood tumor. For Parts 1 and 2, disease assessment with CT and/or MRI as appropriate will be performed at baseline, end of Cycle 2, and every 8 weeks. 
For Part 3, in the melanoma cohorts, the firs t tumor assessment will occur at Week 12 ( ±1 
week); subsequent imaging will be ev ery 8 weeks thereafter during the tr eatment period; for 
NSCLC, imaging assessments will occur every 6 weeks during the treatment period; for 
bladder, imaging assessments will occur ev ery 6 weeks during the treatment period up to 24 
weeks, and then occur every 12 weeks thereafter during the tr eatment period. For all st udy 
parts, assessments continue every 12 weeks for the first year after the EOT visit, and then 
every 6 months thereafter, up to 2 years following the EOT visit until disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 or IWG, or until confirmed disease progression for subjects treated beyond
progression (defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from 
time of initial progression including all target lesions and new measurable lesions), at the 
completion of follow-up, or until subjects withdraw from the study.
•Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the be st response designation over the study as a 
whole, recorded between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to 
subsequent therapy. CR or PR determinations included in the BOR assessment must be 
confirmed by a second scan performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are 
first met. For those subjects who have surgical resection, only presurgical tumor assessments 
will be considered in the determination of BOR.
•ORR is defined as the proportion of all treated  subjects whose BOR is either a CR or PR.
•DoR, computed for all tr eated subjects with a BOR of CR or PR, is defined as the time 
between the date of first response and the date of disease progression or death, whichever 
occurs first.
•PFSR at 24 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years: The proportion of treated  subjects remaining 
progression free and surviving at 24 weeks, 1 y ear, and 2 years if sufficient data are 
available. The proportion will be calcu lated by the Kaplan-Meier estimate, which takes into 
account censored data.

Term Definition
Complete Abstinence Complete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of 
heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of 
contraception for all study drugs. This also means that 
abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, sy mptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry 
into a clinical trial, postovulation methods) or withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women
must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate 
methods of highly or less effective contraceptive methods
must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to 
forego complete abstinence.

APPENDIX 1 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Statistical Details for Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM and BLRM-Copula) and 
Priors for Dose Escalation and Safety Monitoring
1 MODEL SETUP FOR BMS-986205 LEAD-IN (MONOTHERAPY)
1.1 Monotherapy Methodology Description 
An adaptive 2-parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) guided by the escalation 
with overdose control (EWOC) principle1,2,3will be used to guide the dose escalation of 
BMS-986205 alone in the lead-i n phase for dose recommendation during dose escalation. 
The BLRM will be fitted on the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) data for BMS- 986205 within the 
2 weeks lead-in th roughout the dose escalation to model th e dose-toxicity relationship of 
BMS-986205 in the lead-in phase. 
The dose-toxicity relationships for BMS-986205 alone follow a logistic model as follows:

Note that the ߙଵandߚଵparameters are assumed positive, and ݀ଵכis the reference dose for 
BMS-986205 (please refer to the meaning of ߙଵand ߚଵin Section 1.2.1 for detailed 
implementation).1.2 Prior Specification for BMS-986205 Monotherapy 
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for model parameters,
which include parameters ( ߙ
ଵ,ߚଵ) for BMS-986205. The prior distributions for BMS-986205 
single agent activity were derived using a weakly informative prior based on published 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) clinical trial data4as well as discussion with the Bristol-
Myers Squibb (BMS) clinical team.
Derivation of prior distribution of these parameters is provided in the following subsections.1.2.1 Prior Derivation for BMS-986205 Parameters ( ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢻ
૚ሻ,ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢼ ૚ሻ)
A weakly informative prior will be used for parameters ( ߙଵ,ߚଵ) for BMS-986205 to reflect the 
potential of different toxicity of BMS-986205 from historical IDO data and to allow for 
considerable prior uncertainty. Further details are provided below.Weakly Informative Prior
The median DLT rate at the reference dose (BMS-986205 at 800 mg QD) was assumed to be 
30%, ie, mean (log( ߙ
ଵ)) = -0.847.
A doubling in dose was assumed to double the odds of DLT, ie, mean(log( ߚଵ)) = 0.

The standard deviation of log( ߙଵ) was set to 0.722 using the following steps:
•Toxicity probability range was set to be [5%, 80%], then the toxicity interval would be 
logit(0.8)-logit(0.05) = 4.33.
•To cover 99.7% of the variance, the toxicity interval will cover 6*sd(log( ߙଵ)).
Correspondingly, the standard deviation of log( ߚଵ) was set to 1, which allows for considerable 
larger prior uncertainty for the dose toxicity.
1) The correlation between log( ߙଵ) and log( ߚଵ) was set to 0.
2) Log(ߙଵ) and log( ߚଵ) follow bivariate normal distribution.

2 MODEL SETUP FOR BMS-986205 AND NIVOLUMAB COMBINATION 
2.1 Methodology Description for Combination therapy
Toxicity profiles of both BMS-986205 monotherapy and nivolumab monotherapy w ill be 
incorporated to develop the combination model framework. A copula-type model will be utilized 
to cover all general combination cases, including additive and synergistic effects. The 
combination of 2 treatments will be explored using a Bayesian hierarchical model by utilizing 
the toxicity profiles of single agents as prior marginal profiles for the combination. The 
following copula-type model5will be used.

Where ݌௜is the pre-specified best guess toxicity probability for agent A, ݍ௝is the pre-specified 
best guess toxicity probability for agent B, and ݉and ݊characterize the individual drug effect 
and ߛcharacterizes drug-drug interactive effect.
The joint toxicity framework models toxicity rates of both agents as w ell as their interaction 
effects in a 7-parameter hierarchical model, where each of the monotherapy dose-toxicity 
relationship will be characterized by a 2-parameter BLRM model (see Section 1.1 ). There are 3
additional parameters for the copula-type model, 1 for each agent as well as 1 for the interaction 
term. A dose-toxicity surface w ill be characterized for different dose combinations of these 2
agents. 
As there is currently no historical data/prior knowledge to indicate how much information to be 
borrowed for each of the single agents, parameters mand nare both set to be 1, meaning 
borrowing 100% of the information from the 2 agents. The above formula is then simplified into 
a 5-parameter model as follows:

Since only a fixed nivolumab dose (240 mg) will be used in BMS-986205 and nivolumab 
combination, this surface will be simplified into a 2-dimensional dose-tox icity c urve. Posteriors 
for the corresponding 5 parameters (2 logistic regression parameters [ ߙଵ,ߚଵ] for BMS-986205
and 2 logistic regression parameters for Nivolumab [ ߙଶ,ߚଶ] as well as 1 interaction parameter for 
the copula-type model [ ߛ ,which will be discussed in d etail in the following session]) w ill be fit 
into the in-house developed model, which implements the above described theoretical setup.
2.2 Priors Specification for Combination Studies
2.2.1 Prior for BMS-986205
Posterior information on (log( Į1) and log( ȕ1)) from the lead-in part of the study will be used as 
marginal BMS-986205 prior for combination with nivolumab. This prior information is not 
pre-specified and will be continuously updated when additional toxicity (DLT) information from 
the lead-in is av ailable. In the simulation (see Section 2.4 ), the prior of BMS-986205 as 
described in Section 1.2.1 (Table 1 ) is used for illustration purposes, as no real-time DLT data are 
available at this time.
2.2.2 Prior Derivation for Nivolumab Parameters (log(Į 2),log(ȕ2)) 
Similar to BMS-986205 monotherapy in the lead-in phase, the logistic model for nivolumab is as 
follows:
ݐ݅݃݋݈൫ݍ௝൯ൌ݃݋݈ ሺߙଶሻ൅ߚଶ݃݋݈ሺ݀ଶ௝
݀ଶכ൘ሻ, where ܽଶ,ߚଶ  > 0.
Note that the ߙଶandߚଶparameters are assumed positive, and ݀ଶכis the reference dose for 
nivolumab. 
The toxicity profile of nivolumab has been studied in several studies. A bivariate normal prior 
for the nivolumab model parameters (log( Į2), log(ȕ2)) was obtained by extracting a posterior of 
nivolumab using DLT and safety  data from the Study CA209003, which is used later as the 
meta-analytical-predictive (MAP) prior for nivolumab. 
The MAP prior for the model parameters (log( Į2), log(ȕ2)) was obtained in the following steps.
First, a prior distribution for nivolumab was developed:
•The median DLT rate at the reference dose (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was assumed to be 10%, 
ie, mean (log( Į2)) = logit(1/10) = log(1/9) = -2.197.
•A doubling in dose was assumed to double odds of DLT, ie, mean(log( ȕ2)) = 0.
•The standard deviation of log( Į2) was set to 2, and the standard deviation of log( ȕ2) to 1, 
which allows for considerable prior uncertainty for the dose-toxicity profile.
•The correlation between log( Į2),and log( ȕ2) is assumed to be 0 (assuming independence of 
log(Į2) and log( ȕ2)).

•In addition, heterogeneity between the historical study and current study was incorporated 
using a meta-analytic predictive approach, by defining between-trial standard deviations Ĳ1
and Ĳ2for log(Į2) and log( ȕ2), respectively. The between-trial variability is assumed to be 
moderate. Therefore, Ĳ1and Ĳ2 were set to follow a log-normal distribution with mean 
log(0.25) and log(0.125), respectively, with a common standard deviation log(2)/1.96.
With this prior, the clinical trial data below were used to generate the posterior for nivolumab, 
which is then used as the MAP prior for this study.

Note: Nivolumab prior information was based on mg/kg dosing instead of flat dosing. If real 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data from this study show difference from mg/kg assumption, the 
nivolumab prior will be revisited and modified accordingly.
2.2.3 Prior for Interaction Parameters for Joint Toxicity of BMS-986205 and 
Nivolumab Combination
A gamma prior distribution for the interaction parameter ߛis derived to reflect the current 
uncertainty about the toxicity profile of the combination of BMS-986205 and nivolumab. 
Although no PK drug-drug interaction is expected, the possibility of significant positive interaction between BMS-986205 and nivolumab cannot be totally excluded. The interaction 
parameter ߛwas chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty in order to allow for the 
possibility that the interaction may be positive or ne gative. Therefore, the following assumptions
are made for the interaction parameter:
•ߛfollows a gamma distribution and with a mean centered at 1.1, which means the 
combination of 2 agents only has a little bit of synergistic effect.

•The 97.5 percentile of ߛis log(3), ie, 3-fold increase in odds of DLT due to interaction over 
independence at the combination starting dose.
This assumes, a priori, that there is a small synergistic interaction but also allows for the 
potential of significant synergism of the t oxic profiles. It also does not completely ignore the 
possibility of antagonism since we consider 40% prior probability that ߛis less than 1.
2.3 Parameters for Dose Recommendation Decision for the Lead-in Phase 
and Combination Phase
Dose recommendation for BMS-986205 alone and in combination with nivoluamb will be based 
on inference from Bayesian posterior, and the probability that the true DLT rate for each dose 
lies in one of the following categories:
•[0,16%) under-dosing
•[16%,35%) targeted toxicity
•[35%,100%] excessive toxicity
Following the principle of EWOC, after gaining information of each cohort of subjects, the 
candidate doses are the ones fulfilling the overdose criterion that there is less than 35% chance of 
excessive toxicity. Only the candidate doses will be considered for the next dose decision by Investigators and BMS study personnel based on a s ynthesis of all relevant data available from 
all dose levels evaluated in the ongoing study.  
Any information on the dose-DLT relationship generated by publicly available IDO clinical trial 
data as w ell as nivolumab prior data from Study CA 209003 will be incorporated into the prior 
distribution before the first dose-escalation decision is made within this study in order to reflect all relevant information at that time.
The final recommended maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose
(MAD)/alternate dose of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab for cohort expansion will be based on the recommendation from the BLRM-copula model and a synthesis of all the data available on all dosed sub jects, including clinical and laboratory safety assessments and PK and 
pharmacodynamic and efficacy data from all treated patients at each dose level up to the 
MTD/MAD. For further details of the BLRM-c opula model and results under a variety of 
scenarios, refer to the simulation results in Section 2.4.
2.4 Operating Characteristics
The BLRM and BLRM-copula models should make reasonable decisions during a study based 
on the observed toxicities particularly in early cohorts. After completion of a given cohort, the 
decision to dose escalate and actual dose chosen for the subsequent cohort w ill depend on the 
recommendation of the BLRM (-copula) EWOC principle and med ical review of all relevant 
data available up to date. Operating characteristics of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab using BLRM-copula models are shown in this section with simulation results. The

provisional dose levels for BMS-986205 are 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg. Nivolumab 
is fixed at a 240-mg flat dose.
In order to show how the design performs, 4 hypothetical scenarios were investigated (please

have increased DLT rates, with the highest  dose reaching the ta rget toxicit y rate ( Additive )

increased dose levels, with the highest dose toxicity level above 33% ( Synergistic)

Simulation Parameters
One thousand trial simulations were used for each scenario. The number of subjects to be treated 
in each patient cohort in a specific dose level a nd the stopping rules used to declare MTD were 
defined as:
I. Fixed cohort size: 3
II. Probability of overdosing: <35%
III. Maximum number of subjects treated: 30
IV. Probability of target toxicity: >50%
V. Minimum number of subjects treated at a given dose level in order to declare MTD: 6
All simulations were run using in house-deve loped code via R and Openbugs, and EAST 6.3.1®
software.
Simulation Results
Operating characteristics from the simulations were  reviewed to assess the relative performance 
under each true scenario. The metrics reviewed are:
1. Percentage of trials with MTD being selected at dose levels with the pre-specified 
toxicities fall within the range of [16%, 35%) ( Correct MTD)
2. Percentage of trials with MTD being selected at dose levels with the pre-specified 
toxicities fall within the range of [35%, 100%] ( MTD Too High )
3. Percentage of trials with MTD being selected at dose levels with the pre-specified 
toxicities fall with the range of [0%, 16%) ( MTD Too Low )
4. Percentage of trials with MTD being selected at the dose level with the pre-specified 
toxicity most closest to 33% and ≤33% ( MTD Point )
5. The 25% quantile of 1000 trials’ fitted MTDs derived by solving the logistic regression 
formula using posterior medians of parameters, as well as 33% as target DLT rate ( Fitted 
MTD )
6. Percentage of trials stopped before declaring MTD due to the reason that MTD is below 
the lowest dose level (simulation parameter II) ( EWOC Stop )
7. Percentage of trials stopped due to reaching the probability cutoff of posterior percentage 
fall in the target toxicity range (simulati on parameter IV) and a minimum sample size of 
N = 6 at the declared MTD (simulation parameter V) ( Target Range Stop )
8. Percentage of trials stopped due to reaching the maximum assigned sample size of N = 30 
(simulation parameter III) ( MaxN Stop )
9. Average sample size for each scenario (Average Sample Size )
Below summarizes the simulated operating characteristics of the model for the 4 different 
scenarios studied. One thing to note is that the following simulation results are only for illustrative purposes. This might not fully represent real trial conduction scenarios due to 
software/current programming code limitations as w ell as not considering the clinical team’s

Overall, from the scenarios illustrated above, it can be shown that the model performs very w ell 
under the hypothetical scenarios investigated. The model allows for high MTD identification 
accuracy (using the MTD range), a small average sample size (less than half of the proposed 
sample size), a high probability of good stopping with great confidence (> 98%), and a low 
probability of bad stopping (~ 0%) when all of the subjects have been used. 
In this simulation, different angles have been investigated regarding the performance of the 
model in terms of identifying the true MTDs under different scenarios. For scenario 1, the MTD 
point estimate is the lowest (24.2%) across all 4 scenarios. This means the dose level (800 mg) 
corresponding to the toxicity rate of 0.33 has only been identified 24.2% times as the MTD 
among all 1000 simulations. When it comes to th e “correct MTD” (considering the MTD range), 
which is the accumulated percentages, scenario 1 is the highest among all 4 scenarios (90.7%). 
This can possibly be attributed to the simulation set-up on pre-specified toxicity rates. The 
toxicity levels ar e relatively similar to each other among the last 3 highe r dose levels in scenario 
1, where 400 mg is associated with a toxicity rate of 0.21, 600 mg with a toxicity rate of 0.27,and 800 mg with a toxicity rate of 0.33, all f alling within the target interval of [16%,35%). This 
could also be explained by the model fitted MTD (771.1 mg), which is slightly lower than the true MTD of 800 mg. To improve the model’s performance under such scenario, dose levels with similar toxicity rates might be combined or dose levels might be assigned with more 
distinguishable toxicity rates
For “MTD too high” cases, scenarios 1, 3, and 4 show no possibility of overdosing. On the other hand, scenario 2 shows a rate of 12% of overdosing. Th is is matching with the model fitted MTD 
at 640.4 mg, which falls out of the range of  the hypothetical true MTD (between 400 and 
600 mg). The slightly higher estimated MTD might be  ascribed to the deviation of the prior 
distribution from the true underlying dose-DLT relationship. There is only 30% of the DLT rate 
assumed as current prior at the reference dose level of 800 mg, which is much lower than the truetoxicity rate (50%) at this dose level. As in all parametric models, the prior distribution plays an important role in the performance of the BLRM-copula model under each scenario. 
For “MTD too low” cases, scenarios 1, 2, and 3 s how very low percentages of under-dosing (all 
< 12%), which is consistent with  the hypothetical Pr (DLT ). This also benefits from the properly 
defined overdose control probability of (Pr(ove rdose) < 35%). In scenario 4, a very strong cancel 
effect has been investigated with the highest toxicity level set as 0.15. In this case, the “fitted 
MTD” of 1030.9 mg could provide more guidance for the clinical team during trial conduction.
Different reasons for stopping have been investigated to obtain a deeper understanding of the 
operating characteristics of the BLRM-copula model. The performance of a “Good Stopping/Target Range Stop” (a stop due to high confidence about the recommended MTD fall 
in the pre-specified target toxicity interval) is good across all 4 scenarios (all high above 98 %). 
Another indicator of a “G ood St opping” is the EWOC Stop; the overdosing control is low 
(< 2%) across all 4 scenarios. Low values are good b ecause all of the toxicities among the 4 
scenarios that correspond to the starting dose are low (ranging from 0.02 to 0.08). Therefore, the chance of stopping early and declaring the MTD lower than the pre-specified lowest dose level 
should rarely happen. This is consistent with  our hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, “Bad

Stopping” due to reaching the maximum pre-assigned sample size (max N = 30) is around 0 for 
all 4 scenarios, which is ideal for early phase trials. 
The average sample size from all 1000 simulations for each scenario is below or equal to 14, 
which is less than the pre-specified maximum sample size (N = 30). To control the possible 
heterogeneity between the prior distribution and the underlying true dose-DLT relationship, more information from the current st udy is warranted. Increasing the “total maximum number of 
subjects” for the trial or adding a stopping ru le for the “maximum number of subjects e nrolled 
for a next to-be dose level,” or adding a restriction for “dose skipping,” might be implemented during the conduction of the trial to gain more information from the trial. Also, intermediate dose levels and/or flexible cohort sizes might be investigated in the real study.
3 MODEL SETUP FOR BMS-986205, NIVOLUMAB AND IPILIMUMAB 
COMBINATION 
3.1 Methodology Description for Triplet Combination therapy
Toxicity profiles of BMS-986205 monotherapy, nivolumab and ipilimumab monotherapy will be 
incorporated to develop the triplet combination model framework. A copula-type model w ill be 
utilized to cover all general combination cases, including additive and synergistic eff ects. The 
combination of 3 treatments will be explored using a Bayesian hierarchical model by utilizing the toxicity profiles of single agents as prior marginal profiles for the combination. The 
following copula-type model
6will be used.

The joint toxicity framework models toxicity rates of both agents as w ell as their interaction

relationship will be characterized by a 2-parameter BLRM model (see Section 1.1). There are 4 
additional parameters for the copula-type model, 1 for each agent as w ell as 1 for the interaction 
term. A dose-toxicity surface will be characterized for different dose combinations of these 3 agents. 
As there is currently no historical data/prior knowledge to indicate how much information to be 
borrowed for each of the single agents, parameters m, nand tare both set to be 1, meaning 
borrowing 100% of the information from all 3 agents. The above formula is then simplified into

theoretical setup.
3.2 Priors Specification for Combination Studies
3.2.1 Prior for BMS-986205
Posterior information on (log( Į1), log(ȕ1)) from the BMS 986205 lead-in and BMS 986205 and 
nivolumab combination part of the study will be used as ma rginal BMS-986205 prior for 
combination of BMS 986205 with nivolumab and ipilimumab. This prior information is not 
pre-specified and will be continuously updated  when additional toxicity (DLT) i nformation from 
the study is available.
3.2.2 Prior for Nivolumab
Posterior information on (log( Į2), log(ȕ2)) from the BMS 986205 and nivolumab combination 
part of the study will be used as marginal nivolumab prior for combination of BMS 986205 with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab. This prior information is not pre-specified and will be continuously 
updated when additional toxicity (DLT) information from the study is available.
3.2.3 Prior Derivation for Ipilimumab Parameters (log(Į 3),log(ȕ3)) 
Similar to nivolumab monotherapy in the two drug combination part, the logistic model for 
ipilimumab is as follows:
ݐ݅݃݋݈ሺݎ௞ሻൌ݃݋݈ ሺߙଷሻ൅ߚଷ݃݋݈ሺ݀ଷ௞݀ଷכ൘ሻ, where ܽଷ,ߚଷ  > 0.
Note that the ߙଷandߚଷparameters are assumed positive, and ݀ଷכis the reference dose for 
ipilimumab. 
The toxicity profile of ipilimumab has been studied in several studies. A bivariate normal prior 
for the ipilimumab model parameters (log( Į3), log(ȕ3)) was obtained by extracting a posterior of 
ipilimumab using safety data from multiple studies, which is used later as the meta-analytical-
predictive (MAP) prior for ipilimumab. Since DLT information from ipilimumab studies was not 
available, incidence of treatment-related Grade 3-4 AEs from various Phase 2/3 ipilimumab 
studies at BMS in subjects with previously tr eated or untreated advanced melanoma was used in 
lieu of DLT rate in order to derive the prior for the BLRM parameters, (log( ߙଷ),log(ߚଷ)): a Phase 
3 study of ipilimumab administered at 3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg (CA184169, N=360 per arm), a 
Phase 2 study of multiple doses of ip ilimumab monotherapy (CA184022, N=71 per arm), a 
Phase 3 study in HLA-A*0201positive subjects (MDX010-20, ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy arm with N=131), and data from other various Phase 2 studies (N=111 for pooled 3 mg/kg; 
N=325 for pooled 10 mg/kg). 
The following steps describe how this MAP component is obtained.

First, a prior distribution for ipilimumab was developed:
•The median toxicity r ate at the ipilimumab reference dose (10 mg/kg Q3W) was assumed to 
be 30%, i.e., mean (log( ߙଷ)) = logit(0.30)= -0.847.
•A doubling in dose was assumed to double the odds of DLT, i.e. mean (log( ߚଷ)) = 0.
•The standard deviation of log( ߙଷ) was set to 2, and the standard deviation of log( ߚଷ) was set 
to 1, which allows for considerable prior uncertainty for the dose-toxicity profile.
•The correlation between log( ߙଷ) and log( ߚଷ) was assumed to be 0 (assuming independence 
of log(ߙଷ) and log( ߚଷ)).
•In addition, heterogeneity between the historical study and the current st udy was 
incorporated using a meta-analytic predictive approach, by defining between-trial standard 
deviations Ĳ1and Ĳ2for log(ߙଷ) and log( ߚଷ), respectively. The between-trial variability is 
assumed to be moderate. Therefore, Ĳ1and Ĳ2were set to follow a log-normal distribution 
with mean log(0.25) and log(0.125) respectively with a common standard deviation 
log(2)/1.96.
With this prior, the clinical trial data below were used to generate the posterior for ipilimumab, 
which is then used as the MAP prior for this study.

ones being used in Part 3 combination. If real safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from this 
study show difference, the prior will be revisited and modified accordingly.

3.2.5 Prior for Interaction Parameters for Joint Toxicity of BMS-986205, 
Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Combination
A gamma prior distribution for the interaction parameter ߛis derived to reflect the current 
uncertainty about the toxicity profile of the combination of BMS-986205, nivolumab and 
ipilimumab. Although no PK drug-drug interaction is expected, the possibility of significant positive interaction between BMS-986205, nivolumab and ipilimumab cannot be totally 
excluded. The interaction parameter ߛwas chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty 
in order to allow for the possibility that the interaction may be positive or negative. Therefore,
the following assumptions are made for the interaction parameter:
•ߛfollows a gamma distribution and with a mean centered at 1.1, which means the 
combination of 2 agents only has a little bit of synergistic effect.
•The 97.5 percentile of ߛis log(3), ie, 3-fold increase in odds of DLT due to interaction over 
independence at the combination starting dose.
This assumes, a priori, that there is a small synergistic interaction but also allows for the 
potential of significant synergism of the t oxic profiles. It also does not completely ignore the 
possibility of antagonism since we consider 40% prior probability that ߛis less than 1.
As specified in Section3.2.1 , 3.2.2 and 3.2.4 , recent safety information from other parts of the 
current study as well as multiple ongoing nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations studies may be used to update the prior distributions for the marginal of the individual drugs. Similarly, the interaction parameter may also be updated based on current safety data on an ongoing basis.
3.3 Safety Monitoring Examples with BLRM (-Copula) for BMS-986205, 
Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Combination
In order to provide a comprehensive view of th e dynamics of the models, although no study data 
from triplet combination are available at this point, prior information is used to illustrate 
hypothetical scenarios. For the simp licity of illust ration purposes, a static cohort s ize of 3 
subjects is applied for the initial safety cohort. BLRM - Copula models are also designed to fit 
various different cohort sizes, adaptively, and will be used for safety monitoring on a continued 
basis. 
During safety monitoring, posterior probabilities will be updated whenever new DLT 
information are available. The following two visualization plots w ill be used to reflect the real 
time dose-DLT relationship, to quantify benefit (in the form of target dosing) and risk (in the form of overdosing and underdosing) during model’s recommendation process, and to facilitate 
clinical team’s interpretation of the model recommendations for the final decision making:
•Dose-DLT profile for the entire dose range of BMS-986205. The doses ranging between 0 
mg and 800 mg ( Figure 1).
•Stacking histograms displaying predictive probabilities on DLT rates classified into 3 different categories (Underdosing, Target dosing and Overdosing) ( Figure 2 ).

Figure 1: Dose-DLT profile after incorporating prior information
Interpretation and usage of Figure 1:
Figure 1 is a snapshot of the dose-DLT profile with prior information only. The dose-DLT 
profile is captured with a c ontinuous dose spectrum ranging from 0 mg to 800 mg. For each dose 
within the range, there is a corresponding distribution of the predicted DLT rates calculated from the samples of the model parameters. This figure w ill be updated each time new DLT 
information becomes av ailable. In Figure 1, there are 3 different quan tiles (2.5%, 50%, and 
97.5%) plotte d to characterize the current trend of the toxicity profile (as shown by the 50% 
quantile), as well as the variation of the dose-DLT profile (as shown by the 2.5% per centile and 
the 97.5% percentile), according to the accumulation of DLT data from all previous and current 
dose levels. The toxicity boundaries (0.16 a nd 0.35) are illustrated in two dotted horizon tal lines 
to benchmark the way in which the dose-DLT profile is trendi ng. From this plot, based on only 
the prior information for the individual drugs, for BMS-986205 doses 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, 
200mg and 400mg, the median dose-DLT c urve lies between the pre-specified toxicity interval 
limits of 16% and 35%. 
If the proposed triplet combination is found to have safety concerns, and is considered 
intolerable, lower dose levels can also be iden tified using different boundary cutoffs from this 
plot. For example, using the 50% percentile curve (green line), which represents the median DLT 
distribution for each dose level, a potential lowe r dose level corresponding to a pre-specified 
DLT rate could be determined and used as a new dose.

Figure 2: Stacking histogram after incorporating prior information to classify 
predicted DLT rates into 3 categories (Underdosing, Target Dosing 
and Overdosing)
Interpretation and usage of Figure 2:
Figure 2 is a snapshot of stacking histogram with all prior information available. This figure will 
also be updated each time new DLT information becomes available.
When evaluating the dose levels based on prior i nformation or current safety data, the model will 
first exclude doses that are intolerable from c onsideration (with overdosing probabilities > 35%, 
the rate that has been specified for BMS-986205 co mbination). All of the remaining doses will 
be considered “tolerable”, however the model w ill also identify the dose that max imizes the 
probability of being within the target t oxicity range (DLT rate of 16% up to 35%). 
As illustrated in Figure 2, based on the prior infor mation, the distribution of predicted DLT rates 
will be characterized into possibilities falling in to 3 different categories. First, dose lev els of 400, 
600mg and 800 mg ar e considered unsafe according to the higher-than-cut off (0.35) overdosing 
probabilities. Among the remainder of tolera ble dose levels (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 and 200 mg), 
using the BLRM-Copula model the dose level that maximizes the probability of being within the 
target dosing interval can also be identified. Here dose level 200 mg is associated with the 
highest target dosing probability of 40%  compared with other dose levels.
Similarly (although not shown on Figure 2), according to the rules specified above, the model 
could possibly recommend to de-escalate to a lowe r dose level than current treated dose level or 
extend the current dose level. Please refer to description of Figure 1 for details on how to specify 
potential lower dose levels.

APPENDIX 3 RECIST 1.1
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE
Only subjects with measurable disease at ba seline s hould be included in protocols where 
objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. In studies where the primary endpoint is tumor 
progression (either time to progression or proportion with progression at a fixed date), the 
protocol must sp ecify if entry is restricted to those with measurable disease or whether subjects 
having non-measurable disease only are also eligible.
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable tumor lesion. When computed tomography (CT) scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, th e minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurab le or non-measurable as 
follows.
1.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accur ately measured in at least 1 dimension (l ongest di ameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with the following minimum size:
•10 mm by CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
•20 mm by chest x-ray
•Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged andmeasurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.
1.2 Non-measurable Lesions
•All other lesions, including small lesio ns (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathologi cal lymph 
nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable include the following:  leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

1.3 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
1.3.1 Bone Lesions
•Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or p lain films are notconsidered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be 
used to confirm the presence or  disappearance of  bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic Lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with Prior Local Treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irra diated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not consider ed measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by Methods of Measurements
1.4.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements s hould be recorded in metric notation (mm). All bas eline evaluations s hould 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.

1.4.2.1 CT/MRI Scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure  lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
1.4.2.2 Chest X-ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, partic ularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by 
aerated lung.
1.4.2.3 Clinical Lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested. As previously noted, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation 
should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
1.4.2.4 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in the assessment of lesion si ze and should not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by ul trasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised. 
1.4.2.5 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.
1.4.2.6 Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be s elected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .

A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to f urther characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
2.1.1 Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anato mical structures that may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes that are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥≥15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are c onsidered non-pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.
2.2 Non-target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorde d at baseline. Measurements are not required, and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrink age to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥
≥15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are c onsidered non-pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.
3.1.1.2 Target Lesions That Become ‘ Too Small to M easure’
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign, an exact measure then is as follows:
•If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
•If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5-mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). 
3.1.1.3 Target Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diam eter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
CR:  Disappearance of all non-target lesions a nd norm alization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.

PD:  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the appearance of 1 or more 
new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Non-target Lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows.
3.2.1.1 When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in the target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. 
3.2.1.2 When the Subject Has Only Non-measurable Disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of th e non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
•Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all 
lesions are non-measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the in crease in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease, ie, an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized  to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. 
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
3.2.1.3 Tumor Markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, however, they must norm alize in order for a subject to be 
considered as having attained a CR. 
3.3 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal, ie, no t attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in

BMS-986205 IDO1 INHIBITOR
imaging modality, or findings thought to represe nt something other than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis 
of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical lo cation that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan 
ordered that reveals metastases. The subject’s brain  metastases are considered to be evidence of 
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example, because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
3.3.1 FDG-PET Evaluation
While [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of the qualitative assessment of FDG-PET scanning 
to complement CT scanning in the assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. 
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, this is PD. 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if ther e is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial positive 
FDG-PET scan).
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
4 RESPONSE CRITERIA
4.1 Time Point Response
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol. 
For subjects who have measurable disease at baseline, Table 4.1-1 provides a summary of the 
overall response status calculation at each time point.

4.1.1 Missing assessments and not evaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of le sion measurements are made at an 
assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can 
be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have changed the 
assigned time point response.
4.1.2 Confirmation Scans
•Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is re quired at least 4 weeks later to 
ensure that the responses identified are not the result of measurement error.
4.2 Best Overall Response: All Time Points
The best overall response is d etermined once all the data for the subject are known. It is the best 
response recorded from the start of the study treatment until objectively documented progression 
per RECIST Criteria or subsequent cancer therapy, whichever happens first taking into account 
any requirement for confirmation. The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on 
the findings of both target and non-target dis ease and will also take into consideration the 
appearance of new lesions. 
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
CR or PR may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point as 
specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).

In this circumstance, the best overall res ponse can be interpreted as specified in Table 4.2-1 .
When SD is believed to be the best response,  it must meet the protocol-specified minimum time 
from baseline. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappear ed af ter CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duratio n for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were  likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the or iginal CR should be changed to PR and the best

4.3.1 Duration of Overall Response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent disease or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD th e smallest measurements recorded on study).

4.3.2 Duration of Stable Disease
SD is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of randomization) 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the 
baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).
CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires the following:
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related 
symptoms, if present before therapy.
a) Typically FDG-avid lympho ma: in patients with no pretr eatment PET scan or when the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is 
permitted as long as it is PET negative.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on CT scan to normal size ( ≤1.5 cm in their greatest transverse 
diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy). Pr eviously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 
1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment must have 
decreased to ≤1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, s hould not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic i nvolvement is not always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in s ize may still contain lymphoma,  whereas an enlarged sp leen 
may reflect variations in anatomy, bl ood volume, the us e of hematopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than lymphoma.
3. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before tr eatment, the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biops y sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of  > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is 
indeterminate by m orphology, it s hould be negative by immunohistochemistry. A sample that 
is negative by immunohistochemistry but demonstrates a s mall population of clonal 
lymphocytes by flow cytom etry will be considered a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according 
to all of the following: they s hould be clearly measurable in  at least 2 perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they s hould 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.

3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable, and no measurable disease should be present.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for the determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type s hould be specified 
(eg, large-cell lymphoma or s mall neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by the 
above criteria but have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered 
partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR 
was achieved but with no bone marrow a ssessment after treatment, patients s hould be 
considered partial responders.
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.
7. FDG:
a) Typically FDG-avid lymphoma: for patients with  no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least 
1 previously involved site.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only 
indicated with 1 or at most 2 residual masses that have regressed by > 50% on CT; those 
with more than 2 residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and s hould be 
considered partial responders.
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:1. A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for PD (see Relapsed Disease [after CR]/PD [after PR, SD]).
2. Typically FDG-avid lymphomas: th e PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET scan.
3. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/PD (after PR, SD)
Lymph nodes s hould be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be  considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes ≤1.0 x ≤1.0 cm will not be consid ered abnormal for relapse 
or PD.
1. Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even if 
other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site 
should only be considered relapsed or PD after confirmation with other mod alities. In

patients with no prior history of pulmonary ly mphoma, new l ung nodules identified by CT 
are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision s hould not be made solely on the basis of the 
PET without histologic confirmation.
2. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other le sions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node wi th a diameter of the short axis of < 1.0 cm must increase by 
≥50% and to a size of 1.5 × 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.
3. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
> 1 cm in its short axis.
4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed  in a typical FDG-avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is cons idered nodal disease. Disease that is only 
assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, 
while an a bnormality is still noted by imaging studies or physical examination, it is found to be 
histologically negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majority of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed nece ssary or appropriate for use (eg, a trial in p atients with MALT lymphoma), 
response s hould be asse ssed as above, but only using CT scans. However, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status but should be considered PRs.

APPENDIX 5 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor represe nting the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno- oncology drug-related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended intravenous doses may be considered for ambulatory 
patients with low-grade toxicity. The lower bioa vailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken 
into account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended. The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

While methylene blue is a rec ognized treatment for methemoglobinemia, it is an agent with oxidant potential (and 
may worsen the clinical situation) since in individuals  with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, it 
induces acute hemolysis that can further decrease oxygen delivery to the tissues. Paradoxically, in high doses,
methylene blue can also increase methemoglobinemia.

DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless  
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral  
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personn el’s review of the participant’s medical  
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45  
years in the absence of other biol ogical or phys iological causes. In additi on, females  
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level >  
40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below is required during study  
duration and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the end of

•Not for participants receiving BMS-986205: Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method for provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of  contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstin ence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2 . 
•Acceptable alternate methods of hi ghly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contr aceptive methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to inter action with the study drug, wh ich may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence 
that the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal e xposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that coul d be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when horm one exposures from intrauter ine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness. The absence of such interactions is not known for BMS-986205 when 
administered with nivolumab. Therefore, for particip ants of child-bearing potential who receive these 2 
medications, intrauterine hormone releasing systems are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Section 6.2: Secondary Objectives  
A secondary outcome will incl ude time from birth to either (a) requirement of ≥16-hour 
respiratory assistance per day (includes BiPAP) continuously for >2 weeks in the absence of an 
acute reversible illness or (b) death. 
Secondary outcomes will also include the change in CHOP -INTEND from baseline score 
and demonstration of improveme nt of  motor function  and muscle strength as determined 
by achievement of significant development milestones  including but not limited to the 
ability to sit alone and roll over unassisted.   Additionally, AveXis, Inc. may opt to provide 
videos of the physical exams, CHOP-INTEND assessments, and/or Bayley Scale 
assessments to an independent, blinded reviewer for confirmation of the development 
milestones.  
Rationale for Change  
Achievement of motor milestones will serve as a more clinically meaningfully efficacy  endpoint. 
 
Section 6.3: Exploratory Objectives 
Exploratory outcome measures will be tested during the study as part of the program and product development plan; however if exploratory measurement results show efficacy and primary outcomes do not reach sta tistical significance, the only interpretation is that the  results show a 
trend toward benefit but can never supersede primary measures.  These exploratory outcome 
measures will include: 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  4 • ACTIVE -mini (Ability Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation- mini) evaluation of 
infant movement ability.  
• Patient functional measures using the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of 
Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP- INTEND).  This test has been studied and validated in 
infants with spinal muscular atrophy and was found to be reliable in this population.19 
• Bayley Scales of Infant Development version 3 is a standardized, norm- referenced infant  
assessment.  The gross and fine motor portions of this test will administered if the child  
reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP- INTEND. 
• Motor neuron function will be assessed via evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). 
• Pathological status of muscles will be quantified by Electrica l Impedance Myography  (EIM).  
• The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard Motor Milesto ne Development Survey shown in Table 10 in Section  11.1.10. 
• Compel ling, demonstrable, documented evidence of efficacy as determined by changes 
in functional abilities as captured during videotaping sessions during site visits and/or captured by subject/parent/legal guardian at home.  
Rationale for Change  
Determination tha t “compelling evidence” of efficacy may be documented via video -taped 
physical therapy sessions, showing motor milestone achievement. 
 
Section 7.1: Overall Study Design  
The proposed clinical trial is an open-label, single injection ascending dose study of self -
complementary  AAV9 carrying the SMN gene under the control of a hybrid CMV 
enhancer/chicken  AVXS -101 delivered one-time through a venous catheter inserted into a 
peripheral vein (arm, leg, or scalp) of Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy subjects. The prim ary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of 
age (a database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 
months of age).  A follow- up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the 
last patient reaches 24 months post- dose.
 
Rationale for Change  
In a natural history study of SMA Type 1 survival,20 the distribution of the age at reaching the 
combined endpoint of death or respiratory failure differed by SMN2 copy number.  T he median 
age at the combined endpoint for subjects with two ( 2) SMN2 copies was 10.5 (IQR 8.1-13.6).  
Therefore,  13.6 months is the expected age at which 75% of SMA Type 1 patients with two ( 2) 
SMN2 copies will have met  the endpoint of death  and/or respiratory failure.  
 
The following are procedures that are being conducted for study purposes, but were not 
described/outlined as appropriate in previous versions of the protocol (s): 
Section 8.1 Inclusion Criteria  
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  5 Subjects must meet all of the following Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Six months of age and younger1 at day of vector infusion with Type 1 SMA as defined by 
the following features: 
a. Bi-allelic SMN1 gene mutations (deletion or point mutation) with two copies of  
SMN2 (no more and no fewer). 
b. Patients 6 months and younger with a disease onset up to 6 months of age 
c. Hypotonia by clinical evaluation with delay in motor skills, poor head control, round 
shoulder posture and hypermobility of joints. 
1 First nine subjects enrolled under previous version(s) of the protocol could be nine months of age or 
younger.   Inclusion revised to reflect six months of age or younger in 24 Jun 2015 Protocol Addendum #2.  
Initial genetic testing and diagnosis completed at an institution/laboratory other than 
Nationwide C hildren’s Hospital/Ohio State University is acceptable if proper 
documentation is received at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, verified by the PI, and filed 
in the patient’s medical record.  
AveXis, Inc.  may opt to confirm all genetic diagnoses through a con tracted third -party 
laboratory utilizi ng an additional blood sample collected during a post -dose visit. 
Rationale for Change  
For clarification purposes, added notation that baseline diagnostic genetic testing was not 
completed at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in all cases.  As noted, AveXis, Inc.  may opt to 
have baseline blood samples for all subjects re- tested at a commercial laboratory to ensure 
consistent results for all subjects in the trial.  As these samples would be run after enrollment/dosing was c omplete, results would not impact subject eligibility.  
Section 11.8.1 CHOP -INTEND  
CHOP -INTEND including head control, righting reactions, and trunk movements in supported 
sitting, supine, and prone positions.  Anti-gravity movements in assisted rolling, ve ntral 
suspension, and supported standing are also measured.  See Appendix  3. 
At such time that a subject achieves two cons ecutive CHOP -INTEND scores of ≥62, a 
teleconference will be conducted between PI, physical therapist, and  AveXis, Inc. to review 
the subject status and determine whether or not continued CHOP -INTEND assessments 
are necessary.  A decision will be reached and confirmed in writing following the teleconference.  If decided that no further assessments are necessary, the physical therapist 
will cease completion of the CHOP -INTEND assessment at subsequent visits; otherwise 
CHOP -INTEND assessments will continue monthly.  
CHOP -INTEND examinations will be videotaped in accord with the Videotaping Manual.  
Rationale for Change:  
As patients on a normal development course age, CHOP- INTEND scores decrease over time as 
there are portions of the assessment that are specific to infant development.  As patients develop out of infancy, they no longer exhibit some motor functions in an appropriate way for some of 
the assessment sections to be scored.  As study subjects achieve a score of 64, more in line with a 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  6 normal development course, it would be inappropriate to continue with the CHOP- INTEND for 
the same reason.  
 
Section 11.8.2 B ayley Scale of Infant Development v ersion 3 
Bayley Scales of Infant Development version 3 is a standardized, norm- referenced infant 
assessment.  The gross and fine motor portions and cognition portions of this test will 
administered if the child reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP- INTEND.   
The gross and fine motor portion will be completed monthly during the first year and the 
cognition portion will be completed every three months.  During the second year all 
required portions of the Bayl ey Scale will be conducted every three months , except for 
subjects still being seen monthly for CHOP -INTEND assessments .  For those subjects the 
gross and fine motor and cognition portions will be administered as in Year 1.  See 
Appendix  4. 
Bayley scales examinations will be videotaped in accor d with the Videotaping Manual.  
 
Section 11.9 Development Milestones Checklist 
The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard 
Motor Milestone D evelopment Survey shown in Table  10 and a Gross Motor Skills Checklist 
show n in Appendix  5.  The Gross Motor Skills Checklist was designed by physical therapists 
at Nationwide Children’ s Hospital specifically to assess SMA Type 1 subjects in this trial; it 
is source from a collection of existing motor assessments.   See Appendix  5. 
Additionally, CHOP -INTEND and Bayley physical therapy assessment videos may be 
transferred to a centralized reviewer for independent determination of milestones achieved.  
Rationale for Change  
The Gross Motor Skills Checklist was developed as an assessment and added to the protocol as a 
method by which to evaluate subjects achieving a maximum CHOP -INTEND score of 64.  
 
Section 11.10 Video Evidence 
Physical therapy assessments and physician physical examinations required at each study visit 
will be videotaped in an effort to produce compelling, demonstrable, documented evidence of effica cy as determined by changes in functional abilities.  Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) may also 
share home videos demonstrating achievement of functional abilities.  AveXis, Inc.  will provide 
a secure and confidential upload process for transfer and storage of the videos from NCH to a contracted third -party vendor that will compile and arrange videos as per AveXis, Inc. 
submission requirements.  Any/all videos received at AveXis, Inc. or the contracted vendor will be treated as confidential study data and will b e the sole property of AveXis, Inc.  AveXis, Inc.  
and the contracted vendor will provide this secure, encrypted transfer and storage solution to

Section 11.19.11 Saliva, Urine, Stool Collection  
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected for viral shedding studies.  Saliva will be 
collected from the patient’s mouth with a pipette and oral swab.  200 −500 µL of urine will 
be collected from patients’ soiled diapers by soaking a cot ton ball.  Pea- sized fecal samples 
will be collected from patients’ soiled diapers.  Each of these samples will be placed in a 
DNAse/RNAse -free Eppendorf tube with locking top.  The tubes will be stored in a -80°C 
freezer.  
Rationale for Change  
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected to study viral shedding.

Study center(s):  Nationwide Children’s Hospital 
Principal Investigator:  Jerry Mendell, MD  
Studied period (years):  
Estimat ed date first patient enrolled: May 2014 
Estimated date last patient completed: Jan 2017 Phase of development:  1 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Determination of safety based on the development of unacceptable toxicity: defined as the 
occurrence of any one Grade II I or higher, unanticipated, treatment- related toxicity.  
Secondary:  
• The time f rom birth until death or until patient requires at least 1 6-hour per day of ventilation support 
for breathing for ≥ 14 consecutive days in the absence of an acute reversible illness, excluding 
perioperative use. 
Methodology: 
Open -label, dose- escalation clinical trial of AVXS -101 injected intravenously through a peripheral limb 
vein.   Short- term safety will be evaluated over a two year period.  Patients will be tested at baseline and 
return for follow up visits on days 7, 14, 21, 30, followed by once every month through 12 months post 
dose, and then every three months through two (2) years post infusion.  Unscheduled vi sits may occur if 
the PI determines that they are necessary.  
 
The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of age (a 
database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 months of age).  A follow -up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the last patient 
reaches 24 months post-dose. 
 
Upon completion of the 2-year study period, patients will be monitored annually as per standard of care 
for up to 15 years. 
Number o f patients (planned):  15 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

Confidential  18 5 INTRODUCTION  
This is the first clinical gene therapy trial for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  The SMN gene 
will be transferred usi ng self -complementary adeno -associated virus (scAAV) type 9 under 
control of the chicken-β-actin hybrid promoter.  Pre -clinical studies have demonstrated  survival 
of the SMN-Δ7 mouse model for SMA from a median of 15.5 days to over 1 year, following 
intravenous delivery to the facial vein.  This clinical trial is an open -label, single  injection 
ascending dose study in which AVXS -101 will be delivered one -time through  a venous catheter 
inserted into a peripheral vein (arm, leg, or scalp) in SMA Type 1 subjects with 2 copies of SMN2.  
5.1 Background and Preliminary Data 
Spinal muscular atrophy is a neurogenetic disorder caused by a loss or mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) on chromosome 5q13, which leads to reduced SMN protein levels and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons.  SMA is an  autosomal recessive, early childhood 
disease with an incidence of 1:11,000 live births.
14  SMA is the leading cause of infant mortality 
due to genetic diseases.  Disease severity and clinical prognosis depends on the number of copies 
of SMN2.  In its most common and severe form (Type 1), hypotonia and progressive weakness 
are recognized in the first few months of life, leading to diagnosis by 6 months of age and then 
death due to respiratory failure by age two.  SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant death.  Motor neuron loss in SMA Type 1 is profound in the early postnatal period (or may even 
start in the pre -natal period), whereas motor neurons in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients adapt and 
compensate during development and persist into adult life.  The findings from various 
neurophysiological and animal studies have shown an early loss of motor neurons in the 
embryonic and early postnatal periods.
10,11,12  From a clinical perspective, these findings 
emphasize the importance of targeting the SMA Type 1 group for gene transfer of SMN2 in 
hopes of rescuing neurons at this critical stage.  Our goal is to modify the SMA  Type 1 
phenotype, which will hopefully lead to a milder disease course and prolonged survival as seen in SMA Type 2 and 3 patients. 
Therapeutic efforts in SMA have focused on the potential for small molecules to increase SMN 
levels.  These include deacetylase inhibitors, such as, valproic acid, sodium butyr ate, 
phenylbutyrate, and trichostatin A.  These agents activate the SMN2 promoter, resulting in 
increased full -length SMN protein in SMA animal models .
15-16  However, clinical trials 
employing se veral of these agents, most notably phenylbutyrate, valporic acid, and hydroxyurea, 
have not resulted in clinical benefit (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, and Darbar, et al17).  A dose 
escalation trial of scAAV9.CB.SMN will provide information for the potential gene transfer has 
in treating Type 1 SMA patients and will hopefully show promise for success in modifying the 
disease prognosis.  This will be a dose escalation study that includes 15 Type 1 patients with 2 copies of SMN2. 
5.2 Ration ale for Gene Transfer to SMA Type 1 Patients  
We have chosen Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1 as the target for this gene therapy 
study.  We believe there is a strong rationale for this based on studies of the natural history of this disease.  The class ification of SMA is shown below ( Table 5 ); Type 0 to Type 4 SMA is 
described.  SMA is conventionally classified into four phenotypes on the basis of age of onset

Confidential  19 and highest motor function achieved, with an additional phenotype (t ype 0) to  describe the 
severe forms of antenatal -onset spinal muscular atrophy.1,2 
Table 5 Spinal Muscular Atrophy Classification  
 
 
SMA Type 1 patients  by definition  never attain  independent sitting and have hypotonia within 
the first 6  months of life.  SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant death.  In contrast, 
SMA  Type 2 manifests within the first 18 months, and children afflicted with this condition are 
able to maintain sitting unassisted but never walk independently.  SMA Type 3 patients attain the 
ability to walk unaided [Type 3a have onset <3yo; Type 3b have onset >3 yo].  SMA Type 4 is an adult onset disease.  The genetic cause for SMA is well established and is i ntimately  involved 
with one’s prognosis.  All forms of SMA are autosomal recessive in inheritance and  are caused 
by mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.  Humans also carry a second nearly 
identical copy of the SMN1 gene called SMN2 .
3  Both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes express 
SMN protein, however, the amount of functional full-length protein produced by SMN2 is much 
less (by 10 -15%) than that produced by SMN1.3-5  Although SMN2 cannot completely 
compensate for the loss of the SMN1 gene, patients with milder forms of SMA generally have 
higher SMN2 copy numbers.6-7  Quantitative analysis of SMN2 copies in 375 pa tients with Type 
1, Type 2, or Type 3 SMA showed a significant correlation between SM N2 copy number and 
SMA type, as well as, duration of survival.  80% of patients with  Type 1 SM A carry one or two 
SMN2 copies, 82% of patients with Type 2 SMA carry three SMN2 copies, and 96% of patients with Type 3 SMA carry three or four SMN2 copies.
8  Among 113 patients with Type 1 SMA, 9 
with one SMN2 copy lived <11 months, 88/94 with two SMN2 copies lived <21 months, and 
8/10 with three SM N2 copies lived 33–66 months.  Even more refined data, describ ing this 
relationship, has been generated and has also influenced our choice of the study target group.  
The median survival for patients with SMA Type 1 is 7.4 months with the age of onset being the 
most predictiv e factor in survival .9 
The severity of SMA type 1 is unequivocally demonstrated by prognosis as illustrated in Kaplan -
Meier survival curves shown in Figure  1.

2, and 3 
 
 
In Figure  1, the relative stability of the clinical course of SMA Types 2 and 3 is dramatically 
illustra ted.  Perhaps most importantly these findings show that outcome differences are related to 
the number of SMN2 copies that enable motor neurons to adapt and compensate during the 
growth of the child and persist into adult life.  This contrasts with SMA Type 1 where motor 
neuron loss is profound in the early postnatal period (or may even start in the pre-natal period, 
especially for SMA Type 1 patients presenting in first three months of life).  The findings in Figure  1 confirm other pieces of evidence from neurophysiological studies and animal studies 
that also show early loss of motor neurons in the embryonic and early postnatal periods.
10,11,12  
From a clinical trials perspective these findings emphasize the  importance of targeting SMA 
Type 1 for gene transfer of SMN2 in hopes of rescuing neurons at this critical stage.  Ultimately, 
the goal is to modify the SMA Type 1 phenotype leading to a milder course and prolonged 
survival, as we see in SMA Type 2 or 3 patients. 
These findings more clearly provide the rationale for a clinical gene transfer trial in the younger 
patients making it more difficult to justify even Phase I safety trials in  older (SMA Type 2 or 3) 
subjects.  Based upon what we know about the natural history of SMA, gene transfer in the older, 
less severe SMA types (2, 3, and 4), is less likely to have a significant, clinical effect than it 
would in the younger Type 1 patients.  Since the motor neuron pool is stable in older patients due 
to higher copy number of SMN2, asking Type 2, 3, or 4 patients to undergo safety trials with possibly only minimal benefit is highly unreasonable.  It is much more appropriate and safe to 
prove tolerability in the younger SMA Type 1 group, in which death is the unequivocal outcome.  
Also, the poor prognosis of the SMA Type 1 patients, who only have 2 copies of SMN2, warrants the rescue of their lives as our top priority at this time.  
Factors other than risk -benefit discourage Phase I trials in older SMA patients.  The gene transfer 
viral dose for older patients, which is based on body weight, is much greater than what would be needed for an infant.  Not only does this add significantly to the cost of the clinical trial, in some 

AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  21 cases, it could exceed the capacity of the vector manufacturing facility.  These added costs, in 
addition to an increased risk prior to an established proof of principle provide a clear rationale 
for treating the younger Type 1 patients who have only 2 copies of SMN2.  Also present is the 
issue of a greater chance of encountering pre- existing immunity to AAV in these  older, Type 2 
and 3 patients. 
We also have good reason to believe that there are very few safety issues to b e concerned about 
when targeting the SMA Type 1 group for this clinical gene therapy trial.  Overexpression of 
SMN has been shown to be well tolerated in both mice and non-human primates, and in humans 
high copy number of SMN2 poses no risk (as seen in Type 2, 3, and 4 patients who have high 
SMN2 copy number).  This allows us to utilize robust, ubiquitous expression systems (like the CB-promoter) to ensure sustained, high-level SMN expression.  Additionally, it is important to 
point out that recombinant scA AV can be employed for this trial because of the small size of the 
SMN gene.  This enables efficient packaging and allows for efficient gene transfer with lower viral titers (a safety consideration), compared with prototypica l single -stranded AAV vectors. 
Our recent studies using scAAV9.CB.SMN show a robust postnatal rescue of SMA mice with correction of motor function, neuromuscular electrophysiology and survival after a onetime delivery of vector.
13  Intravenous scAAV9 is able to transduce neurons, muscle and vascular 
endothelium, all of which have been proposed as t arget cells for SMA treatment.  
Taken altogether, our preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies in mice and non-human primates have increased our confidence that our Phase Ib trial will be safe and will have a high 
potential for success in treating this devastating disease.  
5.3 Non-Clinical Studies  
A mouse model was developed by the Arthur Burghes Laboratory after a generation of multiple 
variants.  It was found that the double transgenic, referred to as the SMN -Δ7 mouse, provided the 
most suitable model to study gene transfer .
18  Studies performed in the Kaspar laboratory have 
shown that injecting 5 X 1011 viral  genomes of scAAV9.CB.SMN into the facial vein on day 1 
old mice rescues  the SMN -Δ7 mouse model.13  Figure  2 shows the results of these studies, 
including staining of transduced spinal motor neurons, SMN expression levels, righting ability, and weight and survival curves.  Approximately 42 ± 2% of lumbar spinal motor neurons were transduced in scAAV9.CB.SMN treated mice.  SMN levels were increased as well, in brain, 
spinal cord, and muscle of scAAV9.C B.SMN -treated animals, compared to untreated SMA mice  
(although lower than WT controls).  SMA animals treated with either scAAV9.CB.SMN or 
scAAV9.CB.GFP on P1 were assessed for their rig hting ability and were compared to WT 
control mice and untreated mice.  WT controls could right themselves quickly, whereas the SMN - and GFP- treated SMA animals showed difficulty at P5.  However, by P13, 90% of SMN -
treated animals could right themselves compared with 20% of GFP- treated controls  and 0% of 
untreated SMA animals .  At P18, SMN- treated animals were larger than GFP -treated  animals, 
but smaller than WT controls.  Locomotive ability of the SMN- treated mice was nearly identical 
to WT control s, as assayed by open field testing and wheel running. 
Survival of SMN- treated SMA animals compared with GFP -treated SMA animals was  
significantly improve d.  No GFP -treated control animals survived past P22 and had a median life 
span of 15.5 days.  The weights of GFP mice peaked at P10 and then precipitously declined until 
death, while SMN mice showed a steady weight gain until around P40 with it stabilizin g at 17g

Confidential  22 (about half the weight of WT controls).  The smaller size of  corrected animals is likely related to 
the tropism and incomplete transduction of scAAV9, resulting in a ‘chimeric’ animal in which 
some cells were not transduced .  Additionally, the smaller size suggests an embryonic role for 
SMN .  Most remarkably , SMN -treated mice survived well past 250 days of age.

Toxicology biodistribution studies were generated by the Kaspar laboratory.  In the non- GLP  
studies, 24 mice and 4 non- human primates (NHPs) were injected, by way of vascular  delivery, 
with scAAV9.CB.SMN.  To assess toxicity and safety scAAV9.CB.SMN was injected  into P1 
wild type FVB mice with either vehicle (PBS) (3 males/6 females) or 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg of 
scAAV9.CB.SMN (6 males/9 females) via the facial temporal vein.  This dose was previously 
shown to be most effic acious in the Δ7 mouse model of SMA16.  P1 mice were used in 
anticipation of simulating potential clinical studies in infants, which is the planned  population for 
the first -in-human clinical trial.  All mice survived the injection procedure and the initial 24 -hour 
observation period without any signs of distress or weight loss.  Body mass  was measured and 
hands-on observations were performed weekly for the remainder of the study; neither revealed 
any difference between contr ol and treated cohorts ( Figure  3).

At 60, 90 and 180 days post-injection, blood from the mi ce was collected for hematology studies 
and clinical chemistries assessment (ALT, AST, ALK  Phos, creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, and 
CK).  All were  normal except for one variant at the 90 day time point.  This  difference appeared 
to be due to a technical problem relating to the site of blood draw, which differed from that of all 
other mice.  For histopathology, 13 mice were necropsied at 120 days post-injection and 8 mice 
at 180 days.  All organs were normal; in particular there  was no inflammation seen in any section 
from any organ (heart, liver, kidney, muscle, gonads, brain, lung, lymph nodes, and intestines). 
In the safety study for the four male Cynomolgus Macaque s, subjects were injected at 90 days of 
age to closely mimic the likely age of administration of treatment in SMA Type 1  infants.  The 
scAAV9.CB.SMN vector was administered one time by catheterization of the  saphenous vein 
with a dose of 6.7 x 1013/kg, which corresponds to the lowest dose tested for which SMN -Δ7 
mice showed a significant increase of survival.  Animals were followed for six months until they 
were sacrificed at approximately 9 months of age.  No adverse effects  were seen, and all clinical 
chemistries were normal.  T-cell immune response was teste d using ELISpot in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and all were negative at 6  months post injection. 
These mouse and monkey studies can be summarized as follows.  The serum chemistry  and 
hematology studies were unremarkable as was the histopath ology assessment.  The  NHP subjects 
mounted appropriate immune responses to capsid (but not to transgene), with very high 
transgene expression persisting at 6 months post- injection .  In conclusion, these studies provide 
strong evidence that systemically -delivered scAAV9.CB.SMN is safe and  well tolerated, even at 
the high doses required for penetration of the blood- brain barrier .13 
Formal IND -enabling GLP pharmacology, toxicology, and biodistribution studies were discussed 
with the  FDA at the Pre-IND meeting held January 2012.  The toxicology plan discussed with 
CBER was found to be acceptable for the initiation of this Phase I trial.

Confidential  24 6 TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
6.1 Primary O bjective  
The primary  outcome for this clinical trial is safety.  Discontinuation criteria are based on  the 
development of unacceptable toxicity, defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or higher, 
unanticipated, treatment- related toxicity that presents with clinical symptoms and requires 
medical treatment.  
6.2 Secondary O bjectives  
A secondary outcome will include time from birth to either (a) requirement of ≥16-hour 
respiratory assistance per day (includes BiPAP) continuously for ≥2 weeks in the absence of an 
acute reversible illness , excluding perioperative ventilation or (b) death. 
Secondary outcomes will also include the change in CHOP- INTEND from baseline  score and 
demonstration of improvement of motor function and muscle strength as determined by 
achievement of  significant development milestones including but not limited to the ability to sit 
alone and roll over unassisted .  Additionally, sponsor may choose to provide videos of the 
physical exams, CHOP -INTEND assessments, and/or Bayley Scale assessments to an 
independent, blinded reviewer for confirmation of the development milestones. 
6.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Exploratory outcome measures will be tested duri ng the study as part of the program and  product 
development plan; however if exploratory measurement results show efficacy and primary 
outcomes do not reach statistical significance, the only interpretation is that the  results show a 
trend toward benefit but can never supersede primary measures .  These exploratory outcome 
measures will include: 
• ACTIVE -mini (Ability Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation-mini) evaluation of 
infant movement ability.  
• Patient functional measures using the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of

• Bayley Scale of Inf ant Development version 3 is a standardized, norm- referenced infant 
assessment .  The gross and fine motor portions as well as speech and cognition portions of 
this test will administered if the child reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP -INTEND.  
• Motor neuron function will be assessed via evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). 
• Pathological status of muscles will be quantified by Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM).  
• The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard Motor Milestone Development Survey shown in Table 10 in Section  11.1.10. 
• Compelling, demonstrable, documented evidence of efficacy as determined by changes in functional abilities as captured during videotaping sessions during site visits and/or captured by subject/parent/legal guardian at home.

Confidential  25 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design 
The proposed clinica l trial is an open -label, single injection ascending dose study of self-
complementary  AAV9 carrying the SMN gene under the control of a hybrid CMV 
enhancer/chicken  AVXS -101 delivered one-time through a venous catheter inserted into a 
peripheral vein (arm, leg, or scalp) of Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy subjects. 
The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of age (a 
database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 months of age).   A follow -up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the last patient 
reaches 24 months post-dose. 
This dose escalation study involves four cohorts.  There will be at least a 3 week intra -cohort 
dosing interval between dosing of patient s within  a cohort to allow review of the safety analysis 
from five time points (days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21) prior to dosing of the next patien t.  There will be 
at least a 4 -week inter -cohort dosing interval between dosing of patients  between cohorts to 
allow  time for review of the safety  analysis of at least six time points (days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 
30) from all the patients  within a  cohort.  Safety analysis will be done by the investigators and 
the DSMB, as well as, time for  decisions to be made about whether to implement a higher dose 
group.  Dose escalation will  be based on dose- limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Cohort 1 will consist of three (3) SMA patients followed by Cohort 2A with a minimum of three 
(3) and no more than six (6) SMA patients to receive a single infusion at escalating doses.  
• Cohort 1 (Low Dose): 6.7 X 1013 vg/kg (n=3)  
• Cohort 2A  (Intermediate Dose): 2.0 X 1014 vg/kg (n≥3 and n≤6) 
Cohort 2B and Cohort 3 will each consist of three (3) SMA patients to receive a single infusion at escalating doses.  
• Cohort 2B: 2.0 X 1014 vg/kg (n=3)  
• Cohort 3 (High Dose) : 3.3 X 1014 vg/kg (n=3)  
Cohort 2B will be done first and if efficacy is favorable but does not fully improve subjects to 
normal, Cohort 3 at high dose will be implemented. 
Treatment of Cohort 3 is permitted  based on safety assessment presented in the IND .  A score of 
8 or higher on the Bayley Scales of Infant Developm ent will be considered the low end of 
normal.  If efficacy (defined as any clinical improvement from baseline of either primary or 
exploratory outcome measures) is observed at the intermediate dose (2.0 X 1014 vg/kg), the 
Principal  Investigator may continue to enroll at the intermediate dose up to a maximum of 9 
patients.  
If no clinically significant improvement without toxicity is observed, the possibility of adding  an 
additional escalation cohort at a higher dose will be discussed with the FDA, DSMB and r elevant 
oversight regulatory agencies.  
7.2 Number of Subjects  
A total of 15 subjects may be enrolled.

Confidential  26 7.3 Treatment Assignment  
This is an open- label study.  Treatment will be assigned in accord with the dose escalation 
schedule specified in Section  10.6. 
7.4 Criteria for Study Termination  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and safety monitor will monitor safety 
data on a continual basis throughout the trial.  The DSMB can recommend early  termination of 
the tr ial for reasons of safety.  Study enrollment will be halted by the  investigators when any 
subject experiences a Grade III , or higher adverse event toxicity that is unanticipated and 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug that presents with clinical symptoms 
and requires medical treatment .  This will include any patient death, important clinical laboratory 
finding, or any severe local complication in the injected area related to administration of the study agent.  If after review by the DSMB, IRB, IBCSC,  NIH -OBA and FDA, the decision is 
made to continue, the study will proceed according to the dose escalation schedule. 
Subjects may be discontinued from further study participation or the trial may be terminated for 
the following reasons: 
• Development of unacceptable toxicity, defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or 
higher, unanticipated, treatment- related toxicity that presents with clinical symptoms and 
requires medical treatment.  
• Patient requires at least 16 -hour per day of ventilation support for breathing, including 
BiPAP use,  for ≥14 consecutive days in the absence of an acute reversible illness , excluding 
perioperative use 
• Death  
• Failure to comply with protocol-required visits or procedures 
• Study is terminated by sponsor 
• Subject withdrawal of consent to participate further

Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  32 terminal repeat (ITR) has been modified to promote intramolecular annealing of the transgene, 
thus forming a double-stranded transgene ready for transcription.  This modified ITR, termed a 
“self -complementary” (sc) ITR, has been shown to significantly increase the speed of which the 
transgene is transcribed and the resulting protein is produced.  The biological product, called 
scAAV9.CB.hSMN, expresses the human SMN protein.

9.2 Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be captured in the eCRF from two weeks prior to study 
dosing through the last study visit. 
9.2.1 Prophylactic Administration of Prednisolone 
In every gene therapy study NCH has completed , including the first SMA patient, an antigen 
specific T -cell response to the AAV vector has been observed.  This is an expected response 
between  2−4 weeks following gene transfer.  One possible consequence to such antigen specific 
T-cell response is clearance of the transduced cells and loss of transgene expression.   In an 
attempt to d ampen  the host immune response to the AAV based therapy, patients  will be started 
on prophylactic prednisolone (glucocorticoid) (approximately 1 mg/kg/day) 24 hours prior to the 
gene transfer  as agreed upon with FDA in the revised protocol submitted an IND update Serial 
No. 004, 31 Oct 2014.  Treatment will continue for approximately 30 days with the following 
guidelines for tapering:  When AST and ALT exceed 120 IU/L prednisolone will be maintained 
until enzymes fall below this level while at the same time  monitoring T-cell response for 
decreases  below 100 SFC per 106 PBMCs .  Discrepancies from these precise recommendations 
will be at the discretion of the investigator based on potential safety issues for participating patients.

In general, the high dose will not be diluted for a total dose of 3.3 X 1014 vg/kg.  The low doses 
will be diluted to the same volume as the high dose and split equally.  Thus, the vector will be 
withdrawn from each vial for the low doses, pooled together, and diluted in an amount of 
normosol-R to equal the total volume used in the high dose cohort in a given weight range for a 
total dose of 6.7 X 1013 vg/kg.  
Preparation of the vector will be done aseptically in a class II BSC by the research staff 
according to  the Manual of Operating Procedures.  The vector will be allowed to warm to room 
temperature prior to infusion to avoid the possibility of particle aggregation following product 
thaw.  The vector-containing syringes will be delivered to the designated PICU suite at NCH.  It 
will be delivered inside a sealed leak-proof bag, carried in a designated container at room 
temperature and administered to the subject within 8 hours from removal from the -80°C freezer.  
10.5 Administration  
The gene transfer infusion procedure will be performed under sterile conditions in a PICU 
patient room.  The final formulated vector will be administered at 10 −20 mL /kg and slowly 
infused for approx imately 6 0 minutes.  Patient- specific dosage based on patient weight recorded 
during hospital admission on Day -1 will be provided by the pharmacy on procedure date. 
10.6 Dose Escalation 
There will be at least a 3 week intra -cohort dosing interval between dosing of subjects within a 
cohort to allow review of the safety analysis from five time points ( days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21) prior 
to dosing of the next subject.  There will be at least a 4 week inter -cohort dosing interval

least six time points (days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 30) from all the subjects within a cohort.  Safety 
analysis will be done by the investigators and the DSMB, as well as, time for  decisions to be 
made about whether to implement a higher dose group.  Dose escalation will  be based on dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT)  as described in Section  11.1.1. 
The investigators will confer with the IRB and DSMB on all Grade III or higher adverse  events 
with 48 hours that are unanticipated and possibly, probably, or de finitely related to  the study 
agent before continuing enrollment.  Based on the outcome of the safety and  efficacy analysis at 
the end of each cohort decisions will be made to proceed with dose escalation for the following 
cohort. 
10.7 Study Drug Accountability  
Upon withdrawal of a vial, the Investigational Product Accountability Log will be recorded with 
the specific lot number and code of the reagent. 
10.8 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Handling of scAAV9.CB.SMN gene will follow compliance standards for Biosafety level 1 
vectors  following the NIH guidelines .  Individuals manipulating the vector will be required to 
wear adequate personal protective equipment.  
All materials used for injection, including sterile drapes, needles, and syringes in contact with the vecto r will be sealed in leak -proof primary and secondary containers.  All waste will be double 
bagged in autoclave bags bearing the biohazard symbol and sealed with autoclave tape.  The bag will then be autoclaved and disposed of in a biohazard waste container. 
The empty syringes used for delivery of the vector will be resealed in the procedure room and 
placed into a small labeled box.  The empty vials used to prepare the syringes will also be 
maintained in the pharmacy.  Both will be returned to a secure -80°C freezer archival storage separate from the unused vector storage. 
11 ASSESSMENT S 
11.1 Safety Parameters  
The primary outcome for this clinical trial is safety.  Withdrawal criteria are based on the development of unacceptable toxicity, defined as the occurrence of  any one Grade III or higher 
treatment -related toxicity.  
11.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose limiting toxicity is defined as any adverse event that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study agent.  This would include any grade III event, according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03; these classifications  are 
outlined in Table 9.

4 Life-threatening or permanently disabling adverse event 
5 Fatal adverse event  
 
Study enrol lment will be halted by the investigators when any subject experiences a Grade  III, 
or higher adverse event toxicity that is unanticipated and possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to the study drug.  The event will then be reviewed by the Data Safety  Monit oring Board 
(DSMB) and an evaluation will be made as to whether  the trial should be terminated early 
following the Discontinuation Rules. 
11.1.2 Discontinuation Rules  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and safety monitor will monitor safety 
data on a continual basis throughout the trial.  The DSMB can recommend early  termination of 
the trial for reasons of safety.  Study enrollment will be halted by the  investigators when any 
subject experiences a Grade III, or higher adverse event toxicity that  is unanticipated and 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug that presents with clinical symptoms 
and requires medical treatment .  This will include any patient death, important clinical laboratory 
finding, or any severe local compli cation in the injected  area related to administration of the 
study agent.  If after review by the DSMB, IRB, IBCSC,  NIH -OBA and FDA, the decision is 
made to continue, the study will proceed according to Section  10.6 of this protocol. 
11.2 Demographic/ Medical History  
Patient demographics and medical history information will be collected at baseline and captured 
in the CRF. 
11.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, and axillary temperature at the 
time points specified in Table 6. 
11.4 Pulse Oximetry  
Pulse oximetry will be measured through a small infrared light attached to the end of the 
patient’s finger. 
11.5 Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured as per the time points specified in Table 6. 
11.6 Physical Examination 
Physical examination will include review of the following systems: HEENT, lungs/thorax, 
cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and genitouri nary.

Confidential  38 11.7 Vaccination Recommendations  
Patients are encouraged to follow all routinely scheduled immunizations as recommended by the 
Center for Disease Control (CDC).  We also recommend seasonal vaccinations that include palivizumab prophylaxis (also known as Synagis) to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections . 
11.8 Physical Therapy Assessments  
11.8.1 CHOP -INTEND  
CHOP -INTEND including head control, righting reactions, and trunk movements in supported 
sitting, supine, and prone positions.  Anti -gravity movements  in assisted rolling, ventral 
suspension, and supported standing are also measured.   See Appendix  3. 
At such time that a subject achieves two consecutive CHOP -INTEND scores of ≥62, a 
teleconference will be conducted between PI,  physical therapist, and AveXis, Inc. to review the 
subject status and determine whether or not continued CHOP- INTEND assessments are 
necessary.  A decision will be reached and confirmed in writing following the teleconference.  If 
decided that no further assessments are necessary, the physical therapist will cease completion of 
the CHOP -INTEND assessment at subsequent visits; otherwise CHOP -INTEND assessments 
will continue monthly. 
CHOP -INTEND examinations will be videotaped in accord with the Videotaping Manual.  
11.8.2 Bayley Scale of Infant Development version 3 
Bayley Scales of Infant Development version 3 is a standardized, norm -referenced infant 
assessment .  The gross and fine motor portions  as well as the cognition portion of this test will be 
administered if the child reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP -INTEND.   The 
gross and fine motor portion will be completed monthly during the first year and the cognition 
portion will be completed every three months.  During the second year all required portions of the Bayley Scale will be conducted every three months , except for subjects still being seen monthly for 
CHOP -INTEND assessments.   For those subjects the gross and fine motor and cognition portions 
will be administered as in Year 1.   See Appendix  4. 
Bayley scales examinations will be videotaped in accord with the Videotaping Manual.  
11.9 Development Milestones Checklist s 
The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard Motor Milestone Development Survey shown in Table  10 and a Gross Motor Skills Checklist 
show in Appendix  5.  The Gross Motor Skills Checklist was designed by physical therapists at 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital specifically to assess SMA Type 1 subjects in this trial; it is source from a collection of existing motor assessments . 
Additionally, CHOP -INTEND and Bayley physical therapy assessment videos may  be transferred 
to a centralized reviewer for independent determination of milestones achieved.

11.10 Video Evidence 
Physical therapy assessments and  physician physical examinations required at each study visit 
will be videotaped in an effort to produce compelling, demonstrable, documented evidence of 
efficacy , as determined by changes in functional abilities.  Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) may also 
share home videos demonstrating achievement of func tional abilities.  AveXis, Inc.  will provide 
a secure and confidential upload process for transfer and storage of the videos from NCH to a contracted third -party vendor that will compile and arrange videos as per AveXis, Inc. 
submission requirements.  Any/ all videos received at AveXis, Inc. or the contracted vendor will 
be treated as confidential study data and will be the sole property of AveXis, Inc .  AveXis, Inc.  
and the contracted vendor will provide this secure, encrypted transfer and storage solution to 
properly protect the identities of patients /families on the videos, which may be shared with 
regulatory agencies and/or the medical community.  
Videos will be provided in a blinded fashion to an independent, centralized reviewer for unbiased assessment of milestone achievement.  
11.11 ACTIVE -mini  
ACTIVE -mini will be conducted to evaluate infant movement ability.  This assessment utilizes 
the Microsoft Kinect camera interface to capture infant movement with an inexpensive, commercially available camera system  with real -time quantitative data output provided.  Using 
the 3 cameras built into the Kinect  video, depth and color data of an infant’s movement is 
recorded and analyzed.  The Kinect's ability to capture images and simultaneously the distance to 
every point i n each  image, provides significantly more information for an assessment of infants, 
than are captured by current post-processed video-based computer vision systems. 
11.12 Electrophysiology Assessments 
11.12.1 EIM  
Pathological status of muscles will be quantified by EIM.   Skulpt, Inc., has developed a handheld 
device specifically for performing EIM measurements in infants.  This device will be used to 
measure EIM in this study.  The device is not yet approved by FDA, but has been tested in over 
30 other individuals with no adverse events (AEs) (serious or otherwise) reported to date and currently being tested in SMA infants as part of the Network for Excellence in Neuroscience 
Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) trials.  The device has undergone independent electrical safety 
testing by Intertek (www.intertek.com) to the requirements contained in the following standards:

12 ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
12.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or 
not considered casually related to the product.  In clinical studies, an AE can include an 
undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
All AE s that occur after any patient has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within 30 days of the last study visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be 
recorded in the eCRF . 
12.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a  congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes list ed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any patient  has signed informed consent, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within 30 days following the last study visit, whether or not they are related to the 
study, must be recorded on forms provided by AveXis, Inc. 
12.1.3 Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs may be identified by the Drug Safety Physician and , if applicable , also by the Clinical 
Study Team Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report.  
Significant adverse events of particular cl inical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs 
leading to discontinuation of the patient/subject from the study, will be classified as OAEs.  For 
each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 
12.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related) .  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, t here is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product.  If no valid reason 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  45 exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.3 Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the pat ient and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site.  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse need not be reported as AEs.  However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs will be collected from Day -1 until the end of the study.  Serious Adverse 
Event information will b e collected from  signing of the consent form until 30 days following the 
last study visit.  The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it 
caused the patient to discontinue the study . 
Events will be graded in accord with Table 9. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 12.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrel ated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until 30 days 
following the last study visit.  Any SAEs considered possibly or probably related to the 
investigational product and discovered by the Investi gator at any time after the study should be 
reported.  All SAEs must be reported to AveXis, Inc. within 24 hours of the first awareness of 
the event.  The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send notification to AveXis, Inc., as per the Safety Management Plan . 
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be provided to AveXis, Inc. within 5 calendar  days of receipt for events that are unexpected and/or 
possibly/probably/definitely related to the investigational product.  This information should be 
provided on a follow-up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with 
the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  Follow-up information for events that are not unexpected and are not related to the investigational product should be provided to AveXis, 
Inc. within 7 calendar  days of receipt. 
AveXis, Inc. is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authoriti es of certain events.  It 
is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at his or her site, as per the IRB’s reporting guidelines.

14 STATISTICS  
This is a Phase I trial, with safety as the primary measure.  A secondary outcome includes the 
time to death or ≥16- hour respiratory assistance per day  continuously for ≥2 weeks in the 
absence of an acute reversible illness.   Only patients with 2 copies of SMN2 will be enrolled.  
92% of SMA Type 1 patients with two copies of SMN2 live <21 months.  For this study the 
primary end point for efficacy will be death or ≥16 hour respiratory assistance per day (includes 
BiPAP).  A successful measure for efficacy for this study will be 50% of SMA Type 1 subjects 
living with less than 16 hour respiratory assistance at 2 years  of age .

The final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, must be 
approved or given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with local requirements.  The protocol must be re- approved by the IRB  upon 
receipt of  amendments and annually, as local regulations require. 
The Principal Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational 
product.  Ave Xis, Inc.  will provide this information to the Principal Investigator.  
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB according to local regulations and guidelines. 
16.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study wi ll be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (Appendix 1) and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, 
applicable regulatory requirements and AveXis, Inc.’s  policy on Bioethics. 
16.3 Written Informed Consent  
The Principal Investigator(s) will ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and 
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  Patients 
must also be notif ied that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The patient 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided. 
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before c onducting any study 
procedures. 
The Principal Investigator(s) must maintain the original, si gned Informed Consent Form.  A copy 
of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the patient.

APPENDIX 1 DECLARATION OF HELSI NKI : ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR 
MEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECT S 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
the: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983 41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, USA, October 2002 (Note of Clarification 
added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human ma terial and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians.   The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles. 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be  my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research.  The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subje cts. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments).  Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  55 8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can 
never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical re search to protect the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects.  The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the 
research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as wel l as applicable international norms 
and standards.  No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be cond ucted in a manner that minimizes  possible harm to the 
environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications.  Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified 
physician or other health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
14. Phys icians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in 
research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that part icipation in the 
research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured. 
Risks, Burdens  and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the 
objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subj ects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. 
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented.  The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are 
confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-101 
Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  56 When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof 
of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immedi ately 
stop the study. 
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the 
health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group.  In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to genera lly accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation.  The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed.  The protocol should 
include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts 
of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treati ng and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research 
study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval 
to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins.  This committee must be 
transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified.  It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allow ed to reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects  set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies.  The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information  about any serious adverse 
events.   No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by 
the committee.  After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s f indings and conclusions.

Investigational Product: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  57 Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information. 
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary.  Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated 
benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post- study 
provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study.  The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  Special attention should be given to the specific information 
needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the 
non-writte n consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the phys ician must be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician 
or may consent under duress.  In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized  representative.  These individuals 
must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized  representative.  The potential 
subject’s dissent should be respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research   group.  In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative.  If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed,

Confidential  58 the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for 
involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee.  Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the 
subject or a legally authorized representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research.  The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient- physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human materia l or data, such as research on material 
or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse.  There may be exceptional situations where consent 
would be impossible or impract icable to obtain for such research.   In such situations the 
research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested agains t 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or  safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving t he 
best proven intervention.  Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34. In advance of a cl inical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post- trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified as beneficial in the trial.  This information must also be disclosed to participant s 
during the informed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible 
database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researcher s, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard 
to the publication and dissemination of the results of research.  Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and a re accountable 
for the completeness and accuracy of their reports.  All parties should adhere to accepted 
guidelines for ethical reporting.  Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must 
be published or otherwise made publicly available.  Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication .  Reports of research 
not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.

Confidential  59 Unproven Interventions in Clini cal Practice  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other 
known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized  representative, may use an 
unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  This intervention should subsequently be made 
the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy.   In all cases, new 
information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

Confidential  60 APPENDIX 2 AUTOPSY PLAN  
Regional Pathology and Autopsy Services, Inc., a nationwide company that provides autopsy and 
tissue collection se rvices, will perform autopsy and tissue collection for the patients in the 
clinical trial.  This company will deploy a pathology assistant to the funeral  home of the 
deceased to perform the autopsy and tissue collection.  Standard autopsy incisions are used to perform the autopsy and pathology necessary to determine the cause of death, which will be 
completed by Regional Pathology and Autopsy Services. 
During the procedure, multiple tissues along with the entire spinal cord will be collected for 
research pu rposes.  Up to 7 sections or pieces from each organ and each region of the spinal cord 
will be collected and returned to the principal investigator of the trial at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  Analysis of the tissue will be done to determine whether the vector transduced the expected motor neurons and if the SMN gene was expressed.  These results demonstrate whether 
the vector delivered the therapeutic gene as expected.  Tissue  samples collected will also be 
available for histology and immunohistochemistry, allowing  the state of the motor neurons and 
muscles to be examined.  
Specifically, tissue samples from the following organs and regions of the spinal cord and brain 
will be collected ( see Table  12 below ).  Tissue sample will b e frozen or fixed (eg. 2% 
paraformaldehyde) for appropriate analysis.  
Families will be asked to consent to the autopsy and tissue collection prior to any sign of 
moribund or death by the clinical team conducting the trial.  There are distinct consent forms  for 
the formal autopsy and for the research tissue collection.  This allows the families the  flexibility 
to participate in one or both of the research activities.

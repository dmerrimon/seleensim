 Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  2. INTRODUCTION   
This Patient  Registry is a prospective, multi -center, single -arm, patient registry  which is intended 
to assess the clinical use in a heterogeneous patient population in a real world clinical 
application.  The L utonix 035 Drug Coated Balloon  (DCB)  PTA Catheter was appro ved by 
FDA on October 9, 2014 (PMA P130024) for the indication of percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA), after pre -dilatation, of de novo or restenotic lesions up to 150  mm in length 
in native superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal  arteries (P A) with reference vessel 
diameters of 4 -6 mm.  This is the first approved DCB used to treat stenoses in the  SFA and in the 
PA as a result of peripheral arterial diseases (PAD).  
 
This patient registry  will be conducted in conformance with the Declaration of  Helsinki, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  requirements and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) including 21  CFR Parts 50, 54, and 56.   
2.1. Background  
PAD  occurs when a narrowin g, or blockage, develops in the arteries; PAD  most commonly 
affects the legs1.The primary cause of lower extremity PAD is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis of 
the lower extremity arteries results in symptoms ranging from intermittent claudication (pain in 
the buttocks, thighs, or calf which occurs with exercise, and relieves with rest) to pain at rest, and 
can ultimately progress to ulceration and gangrene. A number of risk factors can be directly 
correlated with the onset of progressive PAD, including cigar ette smoking, diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, and advanced age .1,2 
2.2. Registry Objective  
The objective of this registry is to assess the clinical use of the  Lutonix 035 DCB  PTA Catheter 
in a heterogeneous patient popula tion in a real world , on-label  clinical application  per the 
Instructions For Use (IFU) .  
3. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The LUTONIX 035 DCB PTA  Catheter  is a standard PTA  catheter with a drug coating on the 
balloon portion of the catheter.  The L UTONIX Catheter 035 model  is an over -the-wire (OTW)  
with working length s of 75 and 130 cm  and is compatible with 0.035” guidewire . Marker bands 
are located at the proximal and dis tal ends of the balloons to assist in delivery and placement.   
The balloon surface between the marker bands is coated with a specialized immediate release 
non-polymer based coating  formulation that includes the anti -proliferative drug – paclitaxel  - at a 
surface concentration of 2μg/mm2.  Please refer to the IFU  for complete instructions , preparation  
and procedural use of the device.

4. PATIENT REGISTRY DESIGN  
The patient registry  is a prospective, multicenter, single arm , post-market real-world registry in 
the U.S. assess ing the clinical use, safety and outcomes of the LUTONIX  DCB  Catheter in the 
SFA and PA. Registry subject s will be enrolled  at up to 100 investigational sites and up to 2,000 
registry subject s followed for up to three years post-index procedure.  This registry will be 
performed with marketed devices within the indications for use. There are no additional 
treatments or exams that are required to take  place within this registry. There will be min imal 
patient registry  activities that will be conducted for data collection for the purpose of this registry 
in addition to routine standard of care  procedures ; including:  
• The subject  (or legally authorized representative) signing an informed consent form 
(ICF);  
• The possibility of performing follow -up visits via the telephone, if these are not routinely 
performed as on -site visits at the requested times, so that the data as detailed in Appendix  
1 can be obtained.  
• The collection and descriptive analysis of collected subject data.

informed consent.  Prior to the conduct of any patient registry  procedures, the s ubject must 
voluntarily sign and date the ICF and HIPAA Authorization.  All patient registry  procedures will 
be documented in the medical record and/or source document and on patient registry  electronic 
case report forms (eCRF).  After consent is obtained  the subject must meet all other eligibility 
criteria.  
 
7.1. Pre-Treatment Evaluations:  
After the subject voluntarily signs the ICF and HIPAA Authorization  all patient registry  
procedures will be documented in the medical record and/or source document and on patient 
registry  eCRF . The subject’s eligibility for patient registry  enrollment will be reviewed , and the 
following pre -treatment data points  for those registry subject s that are treated  will be collected:

calcification, adjunctive treatment, number of run -off vessels, etc.) 
• Device characteristics  (adjunctive treatment used to treat the lesion during the proc edure)   
 
7.3. Follow -Up Visits  
Registry subject s are to be followed according to the investigational site’s standard of care 
practices.  The only difference from routine clinical practice  and this registry is data collection 
and reporting of all AEs to be collected within each follow -up window through 3 years: 30 days  
(±7 days), 6 months (±1 month), 12 months -1 year (±1 month), 24 months -2 year (±1 month), 
and 36 months -3 year (±1 month) . Contact may be made either by telephone or by a clinical visit 
for each visit other than the 12 month follow -up visit  (clinical visit is not required per protocol). 
A clinical evaluation  with a Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) will be performed at 12 months post 
index-procedure.  
 
The following information to be collected is:  
• Occurrence of device and/or procedure related  AEs or SAEs sin ce discharge  
• TLR/TVR  evaluation

 Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  reporting of AEs/SAEs will be limited to those events that are d evice and/or procedure related 
and reporting  will begin immediately following subject enrollment, during the index procedure.  
 
8.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
Collection of AEs will be limited to those that are associated with a localized or systemic clinical 
manifestation that reasonably suggests the involvement of the patient registry  device (s) and/or 
procedure.    
 
− Device(s) -Related:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to the 
Lutonix® DCB Catheter device(s) used as part of the pro cedure.  
− Procedure -Related:   A procedure includes any activity performed during a patient 
registry -related procedure.  
  
8.2. Adverse Events Classification  
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by the 
subject.  
 
─ Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity 
or is transient and is resolved without treatment or sequelae.  
─ Moderate:   May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional intervention 
and/o r treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
− Severe:  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity.  
Additional intervention and or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae occur.   
 
8.3. Definition of Serious Advers e Event  
Each device and/or procedure related AE will be assessed to determine whether it is serious or 
non-serious.  (NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to 
describe the intensity of an event experienced by the subjec t.).  
 
An SAE is an AE that:  
1. led to a death  
2. led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
a. resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury  
b. resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
c. required in -patient hos pitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
d. resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure 
or a body function  
3. led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

 Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  Note: Planned hospitalization for pre -existing conditions or procedures (including subsequent 
TLR/TVRs - assessed in the patient registry  endpoints), without serious deterioration in health are 
not considered SAEs.  
8.4. Relationship of Adverse Event to D evice(s)/Procedure  
Each AE/SAE should be assessed for its relationship to the device or procedure as follows:  
The following categories should be used for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
− Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or there is little 
doubt regarding the relationship.  
− Possibly Related:   An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being related but relatively 
unlikely.  
− Not Related:  An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no plausible a ssociation .

 Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  9.2. Data Analysis  
The analysis popul ation consists of all enrolled registry subject s who have signed the Informed 
Consent Form and have been treated with the patient registry  device.  
The patient registr y endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics 
for categorical variables will include frequency counts and percentages and for continuous 
variables mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and ma ximum.  
The key patient registry  endpoints of freedom from TLR and TVR rates  as well as primary 
patency rate  will be reported by time point along with their 95% confidence intervals. The 
calculation of rates at each time point will be based on available dat a at the time point. Missing 
data will not be imputed. Additionally, a Kaplan -Meier curve across the whole duration of the 
patient registr y for TLR and TVR and Patency may be created. The rates at each time point 
derived from the Kaplan -Meier curve take in to account of information from registry subject s 
who discontinue from the registry  prematurely and cause missing data.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND RECORD MAINTENANCE  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring the complete and accurate recording of patient 
regis try data in the appropriate sections of the source documentation and eCRF s are provided . 
The monitor will ensure the accuracy of data recording at each investigational site by compar ing 
recorded data to supporting source documents during periodic site visits . Adherence to  proper 
recording of information as well as ensuring  that corrections are being made will also be 
addressed during these periodic visits.  
 
10.1. Electronic D ata Capture (EDC)  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all patient registry  
documentation . All clinical patient registry  data will be recorded in the eCRF s provided to the 
investigational site.

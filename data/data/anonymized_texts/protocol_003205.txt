1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
While  advances  in oncological  treatments  have  improved  survival for patients  with distal  
cholangiocarcinomas  and pancreatic  cancers,  progress  in the management  of malignant  
biliary obstruction  and occluded  SEMS  has been  limited.  Recently,  RFA, an ablative  
treatment modality  for dysplastic  Barrett’s  esophagus  and hepatocellular  carcinoma, has  
been  applied  to malignant  biliary obstruction  and occluded  SEMS  with encou raging  
results.  The efficacy and  safety  of this endoscopic technique  however  have  been  reported  
largely in  pilot studies, case  series,  and retrospective  reviews.  The primary objective  of 
this prospective  randomized  controlled  trial is  to compare,  in patients  with unresectable  
tumors  obstructing  the distal bile  duct presenting  with an episode  of SEMS  occlusion, the 
rate of failure  after instent  RFA followed  by SEMS  placement  versus  SEMS  placement  
alone  coaxially  within  the existing  occluded  SEMS.  As co-axial stent  placement is  the 
current  standard  of managing  an existing  occluded  SEMS,  and to study  the potential  
additive  effect  of RFA, the  study  treatment  arm will consist  of RFA followed  by SEMS  
placement.  Secondary  outcomes  on stent  patency,  as well as safety  and adverse  events  
will be monitored.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
To study  the efficacy  and safety  of endoscopic  biliary radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA)  for 
clearance  of occluded self expandable  metal  stents  (SEMS)  in unresectable  malignant  
distal biliary obstruction.  
 
Primary outcome:  
 
• Rate  of failure  at or before  180 days  from date of on-study  procedure  (co-axial 
stent placement +/- RFA)

Page  4 of 16  
 • Failure  is defined  as: 
Imaging  findings  supportive  of stent occlusion  (loss  of stent patency, debris  within  
stent,  loss of or excessive  pneumobilia)  with one or more  of the following:  
o Development  of jaundice  
o Clinical cholangitis  (fever,  elevated  white  blood  cell count,  clinical  
impression  of biliary infection)  
o Development  of bilirubin  rise to greater than  3.0 mg/dl in  patients  who had 
achieved  a normal  bilirubin  after the on-study  procedure  
o Rise in bilirubin  of 2.0 mg/dl  above  post-procedure  bilirubin  nadir  in patients  
who did not achieve  a normal  bilirubin  level post  procedure  
• There  is no  mandatory  imaging;  all imaging  will be triggered  by symptoms  therefore  
any patient who  does not have  imaging  by 180 days  will be considered  to hav        
e a patent stent  and be counted  as a success.  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
 
• Rate  of technical success  for endoscopic  biliary RFA  
o Technical success  for endoscopic  biliary RFA will be defined  as: 
▪ the ability  to position  the RFA catheter  and deliver  the prescribed  
energy.  
o Technical  failure  of RFA would  not impact  on the ability  to place  a co-axial 
stent. These  patients  would  still be followed  for the stent  occlusion  primary  
endpoint.  
• Rate  of stent patency  one month  and three  months  post procedure  
• Median  duration  of stent  patency  post procedure  
• Radiographic  evidence  of local disease  progression  
• Median  survival post  procedure  
• Incidence  of procedure  related  complications  
• Incidence  of adverse  events  within  one month  post procedure  
• Rates  of 30 day and 90 day mortality  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
Malignant  biliary obstruction  from intraductal disease  or extrinsic  compression  by tumor,  
adenopathy  or metastasis  can occur at presentation or with progression  of disease.  
Consequences  of biliary obstruction  include  risk of cholangitis, need  for hospitalization,  
procedural  risks associated  with decompression,  interruption  of chemotherapy  regimen,  
and associated  health  care costs.  Management of biliary obstruction  ranges  from 
percutaneous  or endoscopic  placement of plastic  or self expandable  metal  biliary stents  
(SEMS)  to potentially  curative  surgical resection,  and is influenced  by the stage  and 
resectability  of the disease,  patient performance  status,  and the need  and response  to 
neoadjuvant treatment.  SEMS  are the treatment of choice  for palliation  in unresectable  
disease,  and are superior to plastic  stents  and surgical bypass. Mean  SEMS  patency  
ranges  between  6 months  to under 1 year,  but as patient  survival  lengthens  with improved

 oncological care, s tent occlusion  from benign  epithelial hyperplasia,  sludge, tumor  
ingrowth  or overgrowth  often  necessitates  stent clearance.  
 
Recently,  radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA), an established  endoscopic  modality  for treatment  
of dysplastic  Barrett’s  esophagus  and hepatocellular  carcinoma, has  been  applied  for 
management  of malignant  biliary obstruction. Using  a 2.6mm  bipolar wire guided  catheter  
(HabibTM EndoHBP  catheter  from EMcision,  London,  United  Kingdom) inserted  through  the 
working  channel of a standard  side viewing  endoscope, contact coagulative  necrosis  is 
cylindrically  delivered  via two ring electrodes  along  a length  of 2.5cm across  the malignant  
stricture. In 2009, this  device  received  FDA approval  to assist in  the coagulation  of tissue  
during  endoscopic  surgical procedures  in the gastrointestinal  tract, and  has in turn been  
applied  to the treatment of biliary tumors  and SEMS  occlusion. There  are six published  
case series  evaluating  efficacy  and safety  of RFA for treating  malignant  biliary strictures.  
The most recent  study  included  58 patients  from 11 Austrian  centers with predominantly  
Klatskin  tumor (78%  of patients)  undergoing  84 RFA procedures.1 The intervention  
provided  was heterogeneous  with 44/58 patients  undergoing  a single  RFA,  13/58  patients  
having  multiple  sessions, 15/84  RFAs  performed  within  a SEMS.  31/58  patients  underwent  
other  treatment  modalities  prior to RFA. After RFA,  35/58  patients  had placement of 
SEMS,  19/58 patients  had a plastic  stent deployed  and 4/58 patients  had no stent  
placement.  Median  stent patency  from the last RFA procedure  was 170 days,  with no 
difference  between  the SEMS  and plastic  stent  groups.  21/58  patients  required  re- 
intervention  after RFA.  Median  surviva l from the first RFA was 10.6 months. The most  
serious  complication  was partial liver infarction  in a Bismuth  IV Klatskin  tumor  who had 
RFA applied  at 6 sites along  the biliary tree. The patient  was managed  conservatively,  and 
recovered. Other complications  included  cholangitis,  cholangiosepsis, hemobilia,  and 
gallbladder  empyema  requiring  cholecystectomy.  The only North  American  study  
prospectively  included  20 patients, 11 of which  had cholangiocarcinoma  and 7 with 
pancreatic  cancer.2 RFA significantly  increased  biliary stricture  diameter  by 3.5mm.  All 
patients  had placement  of either  a SEMS  or plastic  stent  after RFA, with all stents  patent  at 
30 days  post procedure.  Pain was the most common  complication  occurring  in 5/20 
patients, 1 from cholecystitis  requiring  percutaneous  drainage, and  1 due  to post ERCP  
pancreatitis  managed  conservatively.  Earlier  studies  concentrating  exclusively  on Bismuth  I 
hilar and distal  cholangiocarcinomas  showed  intraductal  RFA followed  by SEMS  had a 
median stent patency  rate of 9 months  (range  6-15 months).3 Finally,  the original  human  
study  on biliary RFA reported  in Gastrointestinal  Endoscopy  in 2011 described  successful  
deployment  of the RFA catheter  in 21/22  patents (16/21  with pancreatic  cancer)  followed  
by successful SEMS  placement in  all patients,  maintenance  of 30 day patency  and no 30  
day mortality.4 Overall,  over 100 patients  have  undergone  endoscopic  biliary  RFA with a 
technical success  rate of over 99%,  with the most  common  complications  as cholangitis  
(5%), cholecystitis  (<4%),  and post ERCP  pancreatitis  (<3%), which  is within  the 
recognized  range  of 5% for the procedure.  
 
The efficacy  of percutaneous  intraductal biliary RFA through  an existing  blocked  metal  
stent  was prospectively  assessed  in a 9 patient study  in 2014 by  Pai et al.5 6/9 patients  
had cholangiocarcinoma  with indwelling  blocked  metal  stent. After external biliary drainage  
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center

Amended:  03 OCT 2016  
Page  6 of 16  
 with an internal -external  catheter, RFA was performed  percutaneously  across  the blocked  
stent.  All patients  had stent  patency  restored  without  use of secondary  stents, a median  
stent patency  of 102 days  and no 30 day mortality.  A larger retrospective  study  with 39 
patients, predominantly  cholangiocarcinomas, who underwent  percutaneous  intraductal  
RFA followed  by SEMS  placement yielded  similar median  stent patency  durations. All  but 
one patient had  patent stents  at the time of last follow  up or  death.6 
A six month  review  of Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center’s  endoscopy  database  
identified  94 endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatograms  (ERCPs)  were  performed  
for malignant biliary obstruction, of which  41 patients  had an existing  SEMS.  In 17 
patients, a SEMS  was placed coaxially.  12 patients  had the SEMS  sweeped  with an 
extraction  balloon. 7 patients  had a plastic  biliary stent placed  coaxially.  In 2 patients,  a 
SEMS  replaced  the existing  stent.  No changes  were  made  to 3 SEMS.  
 
Despite  changes  in biliary stent  design, maintaining  long term biliary drainage  represents a 
management challenge,  especially  as advances  in oncological  treatments  improve  patient  
survival.  The efficacy  and safety  of endoscopic  biliary  RFA have  been demonstrated  
largely  in pilot studies, case  series,  and retrospective  reviews,  involving  small  numbers  of 
patients. A prospective  randomized  controlled  trial comparing  endoscopic  biliary RFA  
followed  by coaxial  SEMS placement  versus  standard  of care to rigorously  evaluate  this 
novel technique  could  potentially  establish  a treatment  for occluded  SEMS.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
In this single  center study  at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center, patients  with any 
unresectable  tumor obstructing  the distal  bile duct causing  an indwelling  biliary  SEMS  with 
symptoms,  biochemical,  radiographic  and endoscopic findings  supportive  of an episode  of 
stent occlusion  are prospectively  randomized  to endoscopic  RFA followed  by SEMS  
deployment  versus  coaxial placement of a SEMS  alone,  which  represents  standard  of 
care.  The primary  and secondary  outcomes  listed  in section  2.0 will be compared  between  
the two groups  to determine  the efficacy  and safety  of endoscopic  biliary RFA for 
clearance  of occluded  SEMS  in malignant  biliary obstruction.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP)  is performed  under  standard  
conditions  with cannuation  of the bile duct,  and demonstration  on a cholangiogram  the 
location,  diameter and length  of the biliary stricture.  The HabibTM EndoHBP probe  
(EMcision,  London,  United  Kingdom) is  advanced  through the working  channel  of a side 
viewing  endoscope  over a 0.035in  guidewire,  and positioned  across  the occluded  SEMS  
under fluoroscopy.  7-10W are usually  delivered  for 90 seconds  with a standard  high 
frequency  generator,  followed  by a 1 minute  resting  period.  Sequential  applications  of RFA 
are applied  along  the entire  length  of the stricture  with an overlap  of 1cm.  After RFA, a 
SEMS  the size determined  by the endoscopist is  placed.

 5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
The HabibTM EndoHBP  probe  (EMcision,  London , United  Kingdom) is  a commercially  
available  FDA approved  device  for the coagulation  of tissue  in the gastrointestinal  tract,  
and has been  used  for the treatment of biliary tumors  and SEMS  occlusion.  It is a 8Fr 
(2.6mm)  bipolar  0.035in  wire guided  catheter which  is inserted  through  the working  
channel of a standard  side viewing  endoscope. Contact coagulative  necrosis  is cylindrically  
delivered  via two radiologically  marked  ring electrodes  along  a length  of 2.5cm  across     
the occluded  SEMS  under fluoroscopic  guidance.  7-10W are usually  delivered  for 90 
seconds  with a standard  high frequency  generator, followed  by a 1 minute  resting  period.  
The HabibTM EndoHBP  probe  (EMcision,  London,  United  Kingdom)  has been  used at 
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center.

Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB #: 14-260 A(3) 
Amended:  03 OCT 2016  
Page  8 of 16  
 with the IRB approved  study  informed  consent  form at the time of their consultation  by the 
gastroenterology  service.  This consultation  is completed  at least one day prior to the 
procedure.  A consenting  professional on this study  will review  and have  a consenting  
discussion  with the participant,  detailing  all sections  of the consent form.  Participants will 
also be asked  to sign a procedural  consent  form,  detailing  standard  of care risks.  Those  
who consent for study  participation  will be provided  with a copy  of the consent form.  
Patients  will then be registered  and randomized  by study  research staff by use of CRDB.  
Patients’  clinical details  will become  part of an outcomes  database  for future  analysis.  No 
reimbursements  will be provided  to study  participants.  
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
Evaluation  of SEMS  occlusion  will be based  on symptoms  (abdominal  pain, jaundice,  
pruritus, changes  in urine/stool  color,  fever,  chills), bloodwork  (elevated  white  blood  cell 
count, liver enzymes),  imaging  findings  of biliary obstruction,  including  loss of stent  
patency,  debris  within  stent, loss  of or excessive  pneumobilia,  within  the 2  weeks  before  
study  enrollment.  Complete  blood  count,  comprehensive  profile  and coagulation  
parameters will be obtained  within  24 hours prior to  the procedure.  
 
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
Patients meeting  the inclusion  criteria  outlined  in section  6.1 will be randomized  to two 
treatment  arms: endoscopic  biliary RFA followed  by SEMS  deployment  (study arm) versus  
coaxial placement  of SEMS  alone  (standard  of care).  Existing  studies  outlining  safety  and 
efficacy of RFA for management of malignant  biliary obstruction  and occluded  SEMS  are 
outlined  in section  3.0. The procedural details  of endoscopic  biliary RFA are described  in 
section  4.2. Primary  and secondary  outcomes  defined  in section 2.0 will be monitored.  
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
At the time of endoscopy, the occluded  SEMS  position,  length  and diameter  will be 
documented  prior to intervention,  as will the number,  duration  and total energy  delivered  
during  RFA for the study  arm. Characteristics  of the SEMS  deployed  will be recorded.  
Post procedure  complications  will be evaluated  and managed  according  to standard  
clinical practice.  Patients  without  adverse  events  will be discharged within  48hours  after 
procedure,  and followed  to monitor primary and  secondary outcomes.  All additional  
imaging  and laboratory studies  will be conducted  as clinically  indicated  and recorded.  
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Among  published  studies,  over 100 patients  have  undergone  endoscopic  biliary RFA with  
a technical success  rate of over 99%,  with the most  common  complications  as cholangitis  
(5%)  all treated  conservatively,  cholecystitis  (<4%)  requiring  either percutaneous  drainage  
or cholecystectomy,  hemo bilia (<3%),  and post ERCP  pancreatitis  (<3%) all  treated  
conservatively,  and which  is within  the recognized  5% incidence  post ERCP  in general.  
Other  complications  occurring  at less than 1% include:  liver infarction managed  
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB #: 14-260 A(3)

Page  9 of 16  
 conservatively,  and left bundle  branch block  managed  conservatively.  All cases  of 
cholangitis, hemobilia,  liver infarction,  left bundle  branch block  were  reported  from a single  
study  where  78% of the study  group  consisted  of Klatskin  tumor,  a disease  site which  is 
excluded  from this study. All  procedural  related adverse  events  on study  will be captured  
by the Research  Study  Assistant (RSA)  and reported  to the IRB if serious.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Rate  of failure for biliary  stent obstruction  after randomization  to either instent  RFA or 
coaxial SEMS  placement  alone  serves  as the primary objective  to assess  treatment  
efficacy.  SEMS  re-occlusion  will be based  on symptoms  (jaundice  or cholangitis),  
bloodwork  (elevation  of total bilirubin),  imaging  findings  of biliary obstruction,  including  loss 
of stent patency,  debris  within  stent,  loss of or excessive  pneumobilia.  Study  participants  
will be instructed to contact  study  physicians  with any of the above  symptoms  of biliary  
stent occlusion  for further  evaluation.  Please  see section  2.0 for secondary  outcomes.  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Enrolled  patients  who withdraw  consent for continued  study  participation,  and patients  
who do not achieve  clearance  of occluded  SEMS  by the intended  randomized  treatment  
will be removed  from the study,  and will be managed  based  on standard  of care.  
 
Any patient  who withdraws  consent  prior to randomization  will be replaced  in the  study.  
Any patient  who withdraws  consent  after randomization  will not be replaced.

14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This is a prospective  randomized  study  comparing  RFA followed  by SEMS  deployment  
versus  placement  of a SEMS  alone.  Patients with unresectable  cancers of the distal bile 
duct or head  of the pancreas  with symptoms, biochemical, radiographic  and endoscopic  
findings  supportive  of biliary obstruction  will be randomized  to one  of these  two arms  and 
the primary endpoint, rate  failure  180 days,  will be compared  across  the two arms. Based  
on a review  of internal data,  rate of failure  at 180 days  is anticipated  to be  60% with SEMS  
alone.  Randomizing  a total of 170 patients  will give us approximately  80% power  to detect  
an odds  ratio of 2.5(i.e. a rate of 37% in the RFA+SEMS  group)  while  controlling  the Type  I 
error at 5%. This sample  size also allows  for one interim analysis  halfway  through  the trial 
(after  85 patients  are randomized)  using  the O’Brien -Fleming  boundary.  If the p-value  at 
the interim analysis  is less than 0.003, the study  will stop early  for efficacy  and if p>0.712   
it will stop for futility.  If the study  does  not stop early, final analysis  will use a p -            
value  threshold  of 0.048  for significance.  
 
Primary analysis  will follow  the intent -to-treat principle,  with each patient analyzed  in its 
randomized  group  even  if the patient received  another treatment or was not treated  at all. 
Patients  who do not receive  any treatment  or who die before  6 months will be counted  as 
events  regardless  of whether their stents  failed.  
 
Rate  of technical success  for the endoscopic  RFA group will be reported.  All other  
secondary endpoints will be presented  with summary statistics  or contingency  tables  as 
appropria te and compared  across  the two groups  with the tests  listed  next to them.:  
 
• Rate  of stent patency  one month  and three  months  post procedure:  chi-square  test 
• Median  duration  of stent  patency  post procedure: log -rank test 
• Median  survival post  procedure:  log-rank test 
• Incidence  of procedure  related  complications: chi -square  test 
• Incidence  of adverse  events  within  one month  post procedure:  chi-square  test 
• Rates  of 30-day and 90-day mortality: chi -square  test.

 All participants must  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  
Office  at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center.  PPR is available  Monday  through  
Friday  from 8:30am  – 5:30pm  at 646-735-8000. Registrations  must  be submitted  via the 
PPR Electronic  Registration  System ( http://ppr/ ). The completed  signature  page  of the 
written  consent/RA  or verbal script/RA, a completed  Eligibility Checklist  and other relevant  
documents  must  be uploaded  via the PPR Electronic  Registration  System.  
15.3 Randomization  
 
After consent  and prior to  the procedure,  patients  will be randomized  into either the 
intervention  or control  group  on a 1:1 ratio.  Patients  will be assigned  to either group by  the 
institutional Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB).  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research  Study  Assistant (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of 
the RSA include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring, problem  resolution  and prioritizat ion, and coordinating  the activities  
of the protocol  study  team.  
 
The RSA will track  and collect  all the information  gathered  by the study  clinicians  and 
enter the data into the institutional Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB).  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Throughout the life of the study, the study team comprising  of the PI, research  fellows,  
RSA,  and CRC  will meet  regularly.  During  these  meetings, they  will address  accrual  rates,  
review  adverse  events,  and discuss  any challenges  with using  the device  in this 
population.  Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of data. Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  
data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout the study  period  and potential problems will be brought  
to the attention  of the PI and CRM  for discussion  and action.  
 
Random  sample  data quality  audits  will be performed  on a recurring  basis  and evaluated  
at the study  team meetings.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
were  approved  by the National  Cancer Institute  in September 2001.  The plans  address  
the new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  
Cancer Institute  for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical Trials”  which  can be  found  at:  
http:// cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC  Data  
and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:

 There  are several  different mechanisms  by which  clinical trials  are monitored  for data,  
safety  and quality.   There  are institutional processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol  monitoring, compliance  and data  verification  audits, therapeutic  response,  and 
staff education  on clinical research  QA) and  departmental procedures  for quality  control,  
plus there  are two institutional committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  
of our clinical trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  
(DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical trials, and  the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  
(DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s  Research  Council  and 
Institutional Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and  review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored, in -house  sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the  time of protocol  
activation.

17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Participants will be informed  that information  collected  during  their participation  in this study  
is considered  confidential.  All data gathered  will be kept in a secured  location  and available  
only to members  of the research  study  team.  Findings  will be presented  in aggregate  form 
only - with no references  made  to the individual  participant’s  data. Confidentiality  of each  
participant’s  data will be protected  with utmost  care; data  will be identified  solely  by a code  
number.  A list matching  participant’s  names  and code  numbers  will be maintained  on a 
secure  and password  protected  database  in MSKCC  servers.  Participation  in this study  is 
entirely  voluntary.  All participants  will be required  to sign a statement of informed  consent  
that adheres  to MSKCC  guidelines.  Should  a patient  decide  not to participate  in this study  or 
to withdraw  their consent to participate  at any time during  the study,  their treatment at 
MSKCC  or participating  institutions  will in no way be compromised.  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use  and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form. The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator and  approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal life  functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death, be life threatening, or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospital admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatme nt is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days  after the participant’s  last investigational treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the  30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment must  be reported.

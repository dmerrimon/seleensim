Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 4 of 19 1. PURPOSE OF STUDY 
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential efficacy of topical ruxolitinib for the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). We propose a 12- week open- label  clinical 
trial. An exploratory objective of this study is to analyze cellular and molecular features of 
discoid lesions before and after treatment with topical ruxolitinib  to assess 1) predictors of 
treatment response, and 2) treatment response to ruxolitinib. 
  2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 Standard of care for patients with DLE depends on disease severity, but can include topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, systemic antimalarials, and systemic immunosuppressive medications.
 The only FDA -approved medication for DLE is 
hydroxychloroquine. Consequently, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, as well as a 
number of systemic immunosuppressive medications, are also used to treat  DLE.  Systemic 
immunosuppression is used infrequently. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally less 
effective than topical steroids, but arguably may have a more favorable safety profile.  Topical 
steroids have the potential to induce skin atrophy, an especially devastating side effect on the 
face, head and neck, the most commonly affected areas in DLE. Though not often used on the face to treat other skin conditions, due to the severe nature of the disease, class I superpotent topical steroids are used in DLE for short periods of time (< 2 weeks), while  weaker topical 
steroids are generally not very effective. Antimalarials and other systemic immunosuppressive 
medications are effective in s ome DLE patients, but have significant potential side effects 
including retinopathy, cytopenias, liver toxicity, and increased infection risk.  
  
Type I interferons are key inflammatory cytokines in DLE pathogenesis.1 These inflammatory 
mediators signal through the JAK -STAT pathway. Janus kinase (JAK)  inhibitors, which block 
interferon (IFN) signaling , are a new class of therapeutics with potential efficacy in lupus. 
Systemic JAK inhibitors have been effective in murine models of lupus.2-4 Of particular 
interest is one murine study in which oral ruxolitinib, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, attenuates 
cutaneous lupus development, without much effect on systemic disease .2 This study suggests 
that ruxolitinib may be more selective in treating lupus skin disease. 
 
Oral r uxolitinib is FDA -approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera , myelofibrosis and 
acute graft -versus -host disease. Topical ruxolitinib has been shown to be effective in a number 
of inflammatory human skin diseases including alopecia areata/universalis, vitiligo, and atopic 
dermatitis.5-7 Systemic side effects have not been reported with topical use. The most common 
side effects from topical JAK inhibitors are mild and include local irritation, erythema, acne, or papular eruptions. In summary, we hypothesize that topical ruxolitinib may be both more 
effective and safer than topica l steroids for the treatment of  DLE . 
 
    
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 5 of 19 3. ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION   
 
This is a single -center  study in  the Department of Dermatology at the University of Rochester 
Medical Center (URMC) . Dr. Christopher Richardson, who is a medical dermatologist with 
clinical and research expertise in lupus, will be the principal investigator (PI). The  study will 
be performed in the  URMC  Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), which will provide both 
administrative and coordinator support for  the trial. Medication management will be handled 
by the Investigational Drug Service of the URMC Department of Pharmacy. Safety laboratory  
monitoring will be done through URMC labs. Laboratory analyses  of deidentified skin samples  
will be performed in the Richardson laboratory and URMC core facilities.  
 
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a 12- week, single -center, open- label  study of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream for the treatment 
of discoid lupus. The primary endpoint  is a ≥ 2 -point reduction in Investigator’s Global 
Assessment (IGA) score at Week 12 compared to baseline.  Secondary endpoints at Week 12 
include the mean percentage change from baseline in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus 
Disease Area and Severity Index (CLAS I), CLASI -A (activity) and CLASI -D (damage) 
scores ; the change in erythema and pigmentatio n as determined by quantitative photographic 
analysis ; and the change in numeric rating scale ( NRS ) for pain and pruritus. Exploratory 
endpoints of skin biopsies will evaluate cellular and molecular features of discoid lesions pre - 
and post -treatment for 1) predictors of treatment response, and 2) treatment response to 
ruxolitinib. Q uantitative and qualitative measures of the cutaneous  inflammatory response, 
including evaluation of the immune cell infiltrate and IFN signature , will be assessed.  
 
4.1. SUBJECT POPULATION  
 
4.1.1 Number of Subjects  
Fifteen  subjects will be consented to enroll in this study. This small sample size is justified 
by the rarity of this condition and the exploratory nature of the study.   4.1.2 Gender and Age  
DLE has a female predominance, but both men and women may participate. Subjects will 
be 18 years old or older. 
 4.1.3 Racial and Ethnic Origin  
DLE affects all racial and ethnic groups,  but is more frequent and more severe among 
African Americans than among Caucasians. Racial and ethnic origin of subjects will be monitored to reflect the diversity of our community. However, no subjects will be excluded based on race or ethnic origin.  4.1.4 Vulnerable Subjects  
Vulnerable subjects will not be targeted , including children, pregnant women, prisoners, 
and decisionally impaired adults. Employees and students of the University may participate but will not be targeted or coerced.  
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 6 of 19 4.2. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
The active drug used in this trial will be ruxolitinib 1.5% cream . Ruxolitinib  cream will be 
applied topically twice daily to areas of active disease.  Ruxolitinib cream will be supplied 
by Incyte. Incyte’s IND number for ruxolitinib is #77,101. Inventory control and storage, 
drug accountability, packaging and labeling, and dispensing will be managed by the 
URMC Investigational Drug Services. Standard topical therapies will be replaced with the 
study drug, and only systemic antimalarials will be continued as standard of care during this study. Details of potential risks associated with this drug is discussed in detail in 
Section 9, Risks to Subjects . Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time.

6. RECRUITMENT METHODS  
 
Eligible subjects will be identified and recruited in the following ways:  
● Subjects with DLE may be recruited from the contact database of Med/AIR Subject 
Database and Tissue Repository (RSRB#276) or the Evaluation of the Pathogenesis of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus study (RSRB#3215) if subjects have previously 
indicated their interest in being contacted for future studies. The P I of this study (Dr. 
Richardson) is also the PI of RSRB#3215 and a sub-investigator on RSRB#276. 
● This study will identify potential subjects for recruitment using the UR CTSI Research 
Participant Registry, STUDY00001978. Subjects enrolled in the URMC Research 
Participant Registry may be contacted to enroll in this study.  
● Subjects may be recruited during routine clinic visits by providers and staff involved in their care. These providers may also include the PI and Sub- investigators. To assist 
in identifying subjects who have not yet been recruited into this study, the study 
coordinators may review eRecord charts of individuals prior to their clinic visits to 
prompt the provider to discuss research with them. Subjects will be approached by staff providing care to obtain the subject’s agreement to be contacted by the study te am. 
● As standard of care, subjects who have been evaluated  in the Department of 
Dermatology or Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology (AIR) Division, and who have been coded with a lupus specific ICD -9 or ICD -10 code, may have providers reach 
out and offer for them to be seen in a Dermatology or AIR clinic. They may also be 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 8 of 19 offered enrollment in this study. Subjects who do not want to be seen in clinic will still 
have the option to enroll into this study.  
Potential subjects may be contact ed via telephone call to discuss the study, field questions and assess 
interest; an IRB approved Telephone Script will be followed.  If the potential subject is interested in 
participating in the study they will be offered to have the consent form mailed or emailed to them to READ 
ONLY with  an IRB approved Information Sheet with instructions that the consent is for review only.  Prior 
to the consent being mailed or emailed to the potential subject a study team member will cross out the signature page to elimi nate confusion.  The potential subject will sign a NEW clean consent upon their 
clinic and/or study visit along with the study team member.  
 
7. CONSENT PROCESS  
 
7.1 Process of Consent  
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant 
and will allow adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her decision. The PI or a qualified study member listed in the CLICK IRB protocol will review the consent form 
with the participant and answer questions. Consent designees will be listed on the site 
delegation of responsibilities log, complete consenting certification, and have knowledge of the protocol and study procedures. The PI or designee  will meet directly with subjects 
in a private room and t he consent form will be read in its entirety . Any questions will be 
answered to the subject’s satisfaction. The subject’s capacity to comprehend the information in the consent form will be assessed by asking questions about the content and encouraging the subject to describe briefly the study procedures. Subjects will be assured 
that enrollment is voluntary and that they are free to not participate or to withdraw at any time, without risking loss of present or future care that they would otherwise receive. It 
will be explained to the subject that those who consent to participate in this study will have their contact information and medical history stored in the database. Subjects will be informed that if they withdraw consent, no new information will be collected, and they can choose to have any stored samples discarded. However, data generated from previously 
used samples may be retained. Subjects will be allowed as much time as necessary to provide consent. Subjects will provide consent by signing the informed consent form for this study. Subjects will receive a  signed copy of the  consent form. The consent process 
will be ongoing. The consent form will be revised, and the subjects re-consented, when 
important new safety information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new 
information becomes available that may affect participation in the study.   
 
7.2 Consent Forms  
Attached in the RSRB application. 
 
7.3 Documentation of Consent 
Both the study subject and the person obtaining consent will sign and date  the consent form 
in order to document consent.  
   8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 9 of 19 This study will be a single- arm trial of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream applied twice daily for 12 weeks. 
Only active lesions will be treated, defined as those with erythema, scale, pain, or pruritus. 
Each subject will be provided with ruxolitinib cream. 
 
8.1 Subject Visits  
Each subject will have a total of 7 visits. The initial visit will be the Screening visit, which 
will occur 7 to 28 days before the start of the trial. Treatment visits will be at week s 0, 2, 
4, 8, and 12, at which times the subject will have assessments performed to document DLE 
severity and assess safety . A follow -up visit to assess safety will be performed at 16 weeks.  
  
8.2 Study Procedures  
Clinical assessments, safety procedures, and research procedures will be performed as outlined below per the schedule of activities.  In the event that one of these is not able to be 
completed, disease activity increases or other concerns arise, the subject may be asked to return to the clinic for an “unscheduled visit” to reassess the subject and perform as needed 
any clinical assessments, safety procedures, or research procedures as outlined below.  8.2.1 Clinical Assessments 
Clinical Assessments: A detailed physical exam , past medical history and vital signs will 
be performed at study visit 1. A problem-focused physical exam, interval history and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, weight) will be performed at visits 2-7. Adverse events will be assessed at study visits 2-7. 
 
IGA: The Investigator’s Global Assessment  will be performed at study visits 2 -6. The IGA 
is an instrument to rate the severity of the subject's global disease. This IGA is comprised of a 5 -point scale of disease activity ranging from 0 to 4 as follows: 
 
0: “clear,” no erythema or scale  
1: “almost clear,” pink erythema without scale  
2: “mild,” pink erythema with  scale  
3: “moderate,” red erythema with  scale  
4: “severe,” purple/violaceous or hemorrhagic/crusted erythema OR hypertrophic/ 
 verrucous scale  
 
CLASI : The Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index will be performed at study visits 
2-6. This is a validated measurement instrument designed for use in clinical trials to assess disease activity and damage in subjects with cutaneous lupus. The CLASI is comprised of two parts, CLASI -A that measures disease activity (erythema and scale), and CLASI -D 
that measures disease damage (pigmentation and scarring). 
 
NRS : Subjects will maintain a symptom diary every day for 12 weeks. Specifically, 
subjects will rate pain and itch separately using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the questions below. Symptom diaries will be reviewed at study visits 2-6.  
 
On a scale of no itch (0) to worst imaginable itch (10), how itchy was the worst discoid 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 10 of 19 lupus lesion in the last 24 hours? 
 On a scale of no pain (0) to worst imaginable pain (10), how painful was the worst discoid lupus lesion in the last 24 hours?  
Photography: Photographs of all discoid lesions will be taken at study visits 2 -6. The Haiku 
app or Canto app will be used to directly load photos into the secure Epic medical record 
system. Images will be extracted  from Epic, and analyzed  as described.8 In brief, a melanin 
index (MI) and an erythema index (EI) will be generated for each lesion using Image J software analysis. The analysis uses perilesional skin to normalize the photograph. Images 
from serial visits will then be compared, as well as between treatment groups.  
 
Compliance:  Tubes of cream will be weighed at each visit.  Additional jars/tubes will be 
supplied as needed at study visits, which will vary depending on the percent body surface area (BSA) involved. 
 
8.2.2 Safety Monitoring  
History & Exam: An interval history and problem focused physical exam will be performed 
at each visit. Subjects will also be asked about recent systemic infections. The focused exam will also include an assessment of the skin immediately surrounding the DLE lesion for irrit ation using a standard 8- pt scale. This scale was developed by Berger and Bowman
9 
to assess the effect of topicals on normal skin; any visual assessment methodology for irritation on an already inflamed DLE lesion would not be informative. 
 
Phlebotomy:  Blood draws will be performed by a trained phlebotomist. A complete blood 
count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and lipid pane l will be assessed at 
the screening visit. Additional labs will be drawn as follows: CBC and CMP at 4 and 12 
weeks , lipid panel at 12 weeks . Standard of care laboratories may be drawn at the same 
time for subject convenience . The venipuncture site will be covered with gauze and a band-
aid. 
 
Urine pregnancy test:  Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at screening and monthly 
during treatment for all females of childbearing potential. Menopause is defined as at least 
12 consecutive months without menses; if in question, a follicle stimulating hormone of ≥25 U/mL must be documented. Hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation must be documented, as applicable; if documented, a urine pregnancy test is not required for women with these conditions. 
 
 
8.2.3 Research  Procedures  
Optional skin biopsies at weeks 0 and 12 will be analyzed as follows:  
● Histology: H&E , immunohistochemistry (IHC), and/or immunofluorescence 
microscopy (IFM) 
● Flow cytometry/cell sorting: composition of inflammatory infiltrate  
● RNAseq: IFN signature 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 11 of 19 Biopsy: For subjects that are willing to provide an optional skin biopsy, two  discoid lesions 
with equal IGA scores (3 or 4) will be selected at Visit 2, one of which will be biopsied at 
that visit. At visit 6, the other lesion will be biopsied .  
 After obtaining informed consent, a skin biopsy will be obtained by a study practitioner trained in this procedure.  A biopsy will consist of removing a piece of skin with a 4- mm 
skin biopsy punch. The biopsy will be performed after injecting a local anesthetic (lidocaine with epinephrine ) to minimize pain  and blood loss. At the biopsy site one or two 
sutures may be placed to improve healing, reduce blood loss and scar formation. A pressure 
bandage will be applied to the biopsy site to minimize the risk of bleeding and infection.  
The biopsy will be divided as appropriate for subsequent analysis. 
  
All study subjects will be given the option to visit the study center for suture removal 7-14 days after the biopsy was taken. Our experience is that some of our study subjects, especially the ones who live far from the study center, prefer to have their sutures removed by a local physician, health care provider, family member or friend trained on removing sutures.  Nevertheless, we will strongly recommend in each case that the study subject return to  the study center for removal of suture so that we can evaluate whether the biopsy 
site is healing well.  
  
We will provide each subject with a wound care instruction sheet which says: “If non -absorbable stitches were placed, they should be removed either by returning to the 
University of Rochester Department of Dermatology or by a local physician, health care provider, family member or friend with experience removing sutures in 7 to 10 days from their placement.  If possible, keep the biopsy site completely dry for the first 24 hours after the biopsy. After that, change the band- aid and apply petroleum jelly to the site on a daily 
basis. We have provided you with the supplies to do this.  The site will appear a bit red and 
may be itchy after several days and that is a normal healing response.  Please contact us if at the site of the skin biopsy the pain increases, the dressing continues to be saturated with blood or there is foul- smelling , pus- like drainage from the site (after the first 2 days).  For 
any questions or concerns, or to arrange for stitch removal, call the Clinical Coordinators 
- at 585-273-2909 or 585-273-4195.” 
 
Histology: We will analyze the  DLE skin tissue using IHC and /or IFM. Common features 
of DLE histology will be evaluated, including hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, follicular plugging, interface change, and immunoglobulin deposition. A quantitative analysis of immune cell counts will be performed . Markers of IFN response will be analyzed . 
 
Flow Cytometry:  We will evaluate the immune and other cell types from disaggregated 
DLE skin tissue by multi -color flow cytometry per lab protocols. 
 
Transcriptomics: The IFN signature will be evaluated  by RNAseq.

9. RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
 
9.1 Risks of Participation 
 
As with any change in treatment, there is a risk of no change or worsening of disease.  All 
subjects in this study will have active discoid lesions. This means that their current therapeutic 
regimen is inadequate to control their disease. Stopping any current topical therapies may lead 
to worsening of disease, but continuing the same treatment regimen will not lead to clearance 
of disease activity.  
 
Ruxolitinib cream: Skin- related side effects of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream are rare, but local 
irritation , pain, itch, erythema, acne, or papular eruptions  have been observed.5, 6, 11 Systemic 
side effects are not expected. In the largest trial of ruxolitinib cream to date (307 patients  with 
atopic dermatitis, 3 -20% BSA), no clinically significant laboratory changes  were observed .11 
As of June 28, 2020, a total of 2350 study participants  have been exposed to topical ruxolitinib, 
with no serious adverse events  or fatal or life -threatening serious adverse reactions identified  
as treatment -related  (Incyte, Global Investigator’s Brochure  v9, Aug 2020). In this study, we 
anticipate few effects from  systemic absorption since most patients with DLE have even  less 
cutaneous involvement than in prior studies, typically only 1- 2% BSA.   
 While systemic side effects have not been seen with topical ruxolitinib, and the amount applied to the skin will be limited given the small area of treatment, there is a theoretical risk of side effects that have been observed with much higher oral doses. The most common side effects of oral ruxolitinib include increased risk of infection, laboratory abnormalities (cytopenias, elevated transaminases, and elevated cholesterol & triglycerides), and mild neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms (dizziness, headache, fatigue, insomnia, diarrhea, abdominal pain). Ruxolitinib is a pregnancy Category C drug.  
As with any treatment, there is a small risk of an allergic reaction, though this has not been 
documented for ruxolitinib cream. There is no known risk of interaction between antimalarials 
and the study drug ruxolitinib. 
 Safety monitoring and mitigating risk associated with the use of ruxolitinib cream is addressed in Section 8.2.2. 
 
Phlebotomy: The risks of having blood drawn include some pain with needle insertion and a 
small risk of bruising and/or infection at that site.  Some people may get lightheaded, nauseous, or faint.  The risks of phlebotomy will be reduced by its performance by trained phlebotomists.  
 
Skin Biopsy:  The skin punch biopsy procedure involves the momentary pain of the needle 
prick used to insert the local anesthetic. There is a low risk of having an allergic reaction to the 
anesthetic used (lidocaine with epinephrine ), which could result in a rash, itching, swelling, 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 14 of 19 dizziness, or trouble breathing. There is also a low risk of skin discoloration, temporary 
bleeding/bruising, and infection. Subjects may have a scar at the site of each biopsy and there 
is a risk of delayed or difficult healing at the site of the biopsy. Standard precautions will be 
taken to minimize these risks. For example, the procedure will be performed by a trained professional who will discuss the risks of the procedure and actions to be taken in the event of a complication. Participants will be given a handout with wound care instructions and a number to call in the unlikely event that a  complication arises. Additionally, subjects will be asked if 
they have any allergies to lidocaine. If the subject does not return for suture removal, a  member 
of the study team will call the participant to check on the healing of the skin biopsy, and to see 
if there are additional questions or concerns. 
 
9.2 Alternatives to Participation Non-participation. Study participation is voluntary. Subjects are free to not participate or to 
withdraw at any time, without risking loss of present or future care that they would otherwise receive. If they choose not to participate, standard of care treatment will be available.  
  10. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
 
There may or may not be any direct benefits for the participants who elect to enroll in this study. The potential direct benefits to the subjects include more frequent provider evaluation 
and management of their disease as well as potential efficacy of a new therapy  (ruxolitinib). 
  
11. COSTS FOR PARTICIPATION 
 
There will be no additional costs to the subject  due to this study in addition to those incurred 
as part of routine standard of care. Insurance will not be billed for any study- specific visits or  
procedures associated with the study. The normal costs related to the subject’s care during the course of the study will be up to the subject’s  insurer:  
• Physician visits outside of study visits 
• Emergency room or urgent care visits 
• Hospitalizations  
 
 
12. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
 Subjects enrolled in this protocol will receive $35 for each visit and $100 for each individual 
skin biopsy. Subjects will only be compensated for the activities they complete. For subjects 
who will complete all of the visits (# 7) and optional biopsies (#2) , the total compensation will 
be $445. Subjects will be reimbursed $35 if they are asked to come in for an unscheduled visit 
(and compensated an additional $100 if a skin biopsy is performed).   For this study we use a subject payment system called Advarra Participant Payments. The system allows three ways to provide payment. Subjects  can choose: a reloadable debit card; 
direct deposit; or mailed paper checks. The study team will help the subject  create a “subject 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 15 of 19 profile” in the system.  In order to provide payment, the subject  will need to enter their  name 
and date of birth into their  subject profile which is required to set up a subject account and for 
customer service purposes.  Depending on which payment method they  choose, they may also 
need to enter their  email address and banking information. If they  already have an Advarra 
account (because they are in another study that uses this system), their  existing profile will be 
used to provide payment.  See the ‘Information Sheet for Advarra Participant Payments” for 
additional information.   Payment  received  for  participation  in  research  is  considered  taxable  income. If  the subject  
receives   payment  for  their   participation  in studies  at  the  University  of Rochester and  its 
affiliates of $600.00 or more in any one calendar year, the University is required to report this information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a 1099 (Miscellaneous Income) for m.  They  
will be sent a copy of this form and a copy will be sent to the IRS. Depending on the amount they are paid, they may be asked to submit a W- 9 form, which includes their  Social Security 
Number.  
  13. SUBJECT WITHDRAWALS  
 Subjects  will be notified by the study coordinator and advised in the written informed consent 
provided that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.   If participants of the study at any point meet the exclusion criteria established in this protocol, including pregnancy, study drug will be discontinued. In addition, study drug will be discontinued for any subject who experiences any of the following (per Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0):
 
• Grade 2 event in C ardiac D isorders  
• Grade 3 event in any other System Organ Class 
Current research does not suggest a treatment -associated increased risk for these events . 
Standard treatment will proceed as necessary to ensure optimal health for the subject. In this situation, long term data will no longer be collected, and only the data collected during the duration of participation of the clinical trial will be included in  the data analysis and 
conclusions of the study.   
   
14. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECTS AND RESEARCH DATA  
 
Steps to ensure privacy and confidentiality of subjects and research data will include: 
 
• The PI will be responsible for all aspects of this study, including privacy and confidentiality of subjects and research data.  
• All study personnel will be appropriately trained in Good Clinical Practice. 
• Study investigators or coordinators will meet with subjects in a private room, where they will conduct all aspects  of this study that involves direct subject interaction.  
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 16 of 19 • Subjects will not be re -contacted without prior consent. During the process of consent, 
subjects will be given the option to be re -contacted regarding opportunities to 
participate in future studies.  
• All electronic and physical documentation that includes protected  health information 
(PHI) will be stored in files and /or folders  with access limited to authorized study 
personnel only. 
• Physical files will be kept in a locked secure area of the URMC Dermatology CTU.  
• Computers on which electronic PHI data is accessed will be password protected  and 
will not be left unattended  while in use. 
• Passwords and system IDs will not be shared. 
• Physical security of computers /files will be maintained.  
• Subjects and samples will be assigned a unique code to facilitate deidentification of the 
data. Codes will not be generated from existing identifiers, such as initials or enrollment date.   
• Only authorized study personnel will have access to data containing PHI.  
• Other research personnel conducting experiments on tissue samples and analyzing data 
will have access to deidentified samples and data only. 
• Data will be stored for at least 6 years after the completion of the study, or for at least 
two years following marketing approval (or, if not approved, 2 years following 
shipment and delivery of the investigational product is discontinued), whichever is longer.    
       
 
15. DATA / SAMPLE STORAGE FOR FUTURE USE  
 Clinical labs drawn as standard of care and as part of this study will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and will be available to the subject. Since the non -clinical testing is being done 
strictly for research purposes, the results of these tests  will not be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and subjects will not be informed of the results of these research assays.  
 Data and samples collected as part of this protocol will be used to perform the studies related to the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints of this study. Any tissue that remains after these analyses have been performed will be deidentified and may be stored  and used for future 
studies. These stored samples may also be shared with companies that are providing support for this study; this includes Incyte and their affiliates.  
 
 
16. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 16.1 Data and Safety Monitoring During the conduct of the study, the PI  and his designee(s) will continually monitor the study 
to ensure that the study is conducted in com pliance with the IRB -approved study protocol and 
that subject safety is maintained. Safety data will be reviewed by the PI or designee as soon as it is received. The review will include: the number of subjects consented/enrolled/completed, possible adverse events , and any other responses observed.  
 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 17 of 19 The FDA defines an adverse event (AE) as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related” and a serious adverse event (SAE) as an AE that “results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect” (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, 13 Jan 2020).  The PI and study coordinator are the primary individuals charged with identification and 
reporting of all AE and SAE occurrences as well as protocol deviations. All SAEs that are 
considered serious, unexpected and related to the study participation will be reported to the IRB within 10 calendar days and all non- serious adverse events will be reported annually with 
the continuing review . The investigator will also notify the IRB of any serious deviations from 
the protocol, and any new information indicating added risk to subjects.   16.2 SAE Reporting to Incyte  
The Principal Investigator (PI) must report all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to Incyte within 24 hours of learning of an event, regardless of the PI’s causality assessment. This notification should be provided on a completed Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form.  SAE reporting for each subject begins the day the informed consent is signed by the patient and within 30 days after subject has completed or discontinued from the study or has taken last dose of the study drug, or as described in the protocol.  SAEs, occurring using Incyte study drug, are reported in accordance with the effective protocol.  SAEs occurring with any other commercial drug are reported to the manufacturer of that drug in accordance with regulations and protocol.   Initial SAEs and/or subsequent follow -up reports should be reported via email to 
SafetyReporting@Incyte.com
  or fax (+) 1 -866-981-2057.  SAE reports should be for a single 
subject.  SAE forms should be sent with a cover sheet and any additional attachments. 
 All adverse event information is reported to Incyte on the Principal Investigator’s/Institution’s Adverse Event Report Form, or a CIOMS -I or MedWatch Form FDA 3500A, or on an Adverse 
Event Report Form which may be provided by Incyte upon request. The Princ ipal Investigator 
does not provide medical records (e.g., discharge summary) to Incyte, unless specifically requested.  
  
16.3 Reporting of Pregnancy to Incyte  
An “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be completed in full and emailed to SafetyReporting@Incyte.com
 or faxed to (+) 1 -866-981- 2057 within 24 hours of discovery of 
a pregnancy of a subject who has taken the Incyte product or the pregnancy of a partner for a subject who has taken the Incyte product.  The “Follow -up Pregnancy Report Form” or 
equivalent mus t be completed and emailed to 
SafetyReporting@Incyte.com  or faxed to (+) 1 -
866-981- 2057 within 30 days after delivery, so that Incyte is provided with information 
regarding the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy results in any events which meet 
Version Date : 06Jun2023   Page 18 of 19 the serious criteria (i.e., miscarriage or termination), the SAE reporting process needs to be 
followed and the timelines associated with a SAE should be followed. 
 
 
17. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN 
 This exploratory study has a sample size of 15 subject s. Given the small sample size,  a robust 
statistical analysis will be limited . The primary endpoint will be a ≥ 2- point reduction in IGA 
score. The mean percentage change from baseline will be assessed for the secondary endpoints 
(CLASI, CLASI -A, CLASI -D, NRS , EI, MI).  Statistical a nalysis of exploratory endpoints 
comparing skin tissue before and after ruxolitinib treatment  will be performed in accordance 
with the technique being used (histology, flow cytometry, RNAseq) . Analyses of DLE 
histology (H&E , IHC, IFM ) wil l include common histologic features (follicular plugging, 
interface change, etc. ), cell counts of the immune infiltrate , and markers of IFN response . Flow 
cytometric analysis will evaluate the immune infiltrate , including T and B cell subsets. The 
focus of the RNAseq analysis will be on interferon expression, though other analyses may be perfo rmed. Differences w ill be  considered significant at p < 0.05.

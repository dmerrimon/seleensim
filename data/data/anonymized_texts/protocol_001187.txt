 4 1. Background and Rationale  
Patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)  typically 
require administration of immunosuppressive treatment (IST) for at least 6 months in 
order to prevent or treat graft -versus- host disease (GVHD) . GVHD is the most serious  
and common complication of allogen eic HCT. Significant a cute GVHD occurs in 20 -50% 
of patients,(1 -3) and chronic GVHD occur s in 30 -60% of p atients  who survive more than 
100 days after transplantation. (3, 4)  Duration of IST is typically prolonged once patients 
develop GVHD.  Particularly, duration of IST in patients who have  chronic GVHD is 
reported to exceed 2-3 years .(5, 6)  While IST is important to reduce mortality and 
morbidity associated with GVHD, it may increase risks of infection, recurrent malignancy 
and secondary malignancy. (7)  
“Immunologic tolerance” may be defined as the absence of immune -mediated injury 
when immunosuppressive medications are no longer given.  Unlike solid organ 
transplantation, (8) many patients after allogeneic HCT can achieve sufficient 
“functional ” tolerance even af ter development of GVHD, and can  eventually stop all IST 
permanently  without developing active manifestations of GVHD. However, many  
patients, especially those with chronic GVHD, develop GVHD exac erbation and require 
resumption of IST. Currently, there are no clinical or biological predictors for successful 
IST discontinuation , and management of chronic GVHD patients consists of repeated 
attempts to taper and stop IST.  
A recent retrospective evaluation of 250 adult patients who received systemic treatment 
for chronic GVHD at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC)/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA)  demonst rated that although 51% patients were able to 
stop IST at least one time, 46%  of these patient s required resumption of IST after a 
median of 3.4 months off therapy  (IQR 2. 1-8.0), due to GVHD exacerbation (9). Among 
patients stopping IST a second time, 30% restarted at a median of 6 months.   
Resumption of IST for chronic GVHD exacerbation may increase the morbidity and mortality of patients, since common practice is to reinstitute high doses of IST initially, followed by a taper again to the lowest dose. Additionally, GVHD may fail to be controlled after resumption of IST, or i rreversible organ damage may occur each time 
GVHD symptoms flare.  
A potential  alternative approach to the current practice of repeated attempts to taper 
and stop IST is continuation of I ST.  
The purpose of this study is to enroll a cohort of patients with chronic GVHD whose their 
treating physician is  planning to taper  their IST to off, and to randomize them to either 
discontinuation of IST (standard approach) or continuation of IST  for another 9 months  
(investigational approach) , in order to evaluate the effect of prolonged IST  on chronic 
GVHD control, with the hypothesis that this approach would decrease the risk of  GVHD 
exacerbation and decrease the need to  resum e high doses of IST. The rational for the 9 
months extended IST in the continuation IST arm  is retrospective data demonstrating 
9962  
 
 5 that >75% of patients who resumed  IST after discontinuation, restarted within 9 months  
of IST discontinuation.   
The rational e for the feasibility st udy is that a large sample size is needed to 
demonstrate statistically significant differences between the two treatment approaches.  
Thus, prior to proceeding with a large study we need to conduct a feasibility study to 
evaluate whether patients can be enrolled,  randomized, and follow their assigned 
treatment, and to assess whether the observations about IST resumption in the 
retrospective study appear accurate .  We acknowledge the heter ogeneity among the 
target patient population (e.g. donor and stem cell source, time since  transplant, and 
IST), but despite this heterogeneity when  patient s are ready to taper IST they are more 
similar than different in their clinical status. Information f rom this feasibility study are 
necessary to help us design a larger study  and apply for external funding. In the larger 
study , we plan to use  stratified randomization to help balance underlying patient and 
transplant characteristics .    
Biological samples will be collected during the study to analysis of blood profiles and 
cellular signatures of “functional” tolerance and biomarkers of GVHD exacerbation.

6. Study Procedures  
 
6.1 Study Design  
We plan to enroll 40 patients  in 2 years.  Patients are eligible for enrol lment at any time 
after an allogeneic transplant, as long as they were diagnosed with chronic GVHD , are 
on one immunosuppression agent,  and are planning to withdraw all IST . Patients will be 
randomized to either IST discontinuation (following standard of care pr actice) or 
continuation of IST  for an additional 9 months  (investigational) . If patients are enrolled 
on the study prior to reaching the IST dose that the attending physician recommends 
9962  
 
 7 they continue should they be randomized to the continuation IST arm , randomization 
will take place  before the patient gets to  the IST dose that would be continued if they 
are randomized to the IST continuation arm ( investigational arm).  If patient s are enrolled 
on the study while they are already taking the IST dose that the attending physician 
recommends they continue should they be randomized to the continuation IST arm , 
randomization will take place at time of enrollment  (Figure 1) . Randomization wil l occur 
within three months of study enrol lment . Patients will be actively followed for 12 months 
after randomization.  After active participation will continue long term annual follow up 
via chart review.   
Patients on the discontinuation IST arm  will have their IST tapered and discontinued per 
the plan of the treating physician, while patient s on the continuation IST arm  will 
continue a fixed dose IST for an additional 9 months with no taper. After 9 months, IST 
may be tapered.   
The dose of IST to be continued, if a patient is randomized to the continuation IST arm , 
will be determined by the attending physician at the time of enrollment  based on the 
following overarching guidelines in the table below:   
Immunosuppressive 
therapy  Age  18 years  Age <18 years  
Cyclosporine  Continuation dose should result in a level < 120 ng/mL  
Tacrolimus  Continuation dose should result in a level < 5 ng/mL  
Sirolimus  Continuation dose should result in a level < 3 ng/mL  
Mycophenolate mofetil  Continuation dose  
≤ 500 mg BID  Continuation dose  
≤ 7.5 mg/kg BID  
Prednisone  < 20 mg/day or  
< 40 mg every other day  < 0.25 mg/kg/day or  
< 0.5 mg every other day  
Any other agent  Defined by the treating physician at the time of 
enrollment  
 
For further evaluation of  adult  patients’ health status, adult participant s will be asked to 
complete a survey  (Appendix A) based on the PROMIS -29 and Lee S ymptom Scale. 
Please note that patient surveys might be reformatted for ease of completion and to 
ensure uniform font and style in the two documents or to correct any formatting or 
typographical errors.  However, no questions will be added without IRB approval.  
 Patients will be asked to complete the survey at enrollment , randomization, every 3 
months after randomization, at the end of the active study participation (12 months after 
randomization) , and if IST resumed/dose increased (if still during the active study 
participation period).  
 
The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®), is a 
set of person- centered measures developed with NCI support  (10). The PROMIS -29 
profile contains 7 PROMIS domains with 4 questions each (short -forms using Likert 
scales), and one pain intensity (0- 10) question. All PROMIS scores use a  standardized 
t-score metric against normative data for the U.S. general population (11, 12) . The scale 
takes less than 5 minutes to complete.  
9962  
 
 8  
The Lee cGVHD symptom scale is a 30 item measure with 7 domains capturing bothersome symptoms from chronic GVHD  (13). The Lee cGVHD symptom scale is 
sensitive to change in patient status with 6- 7 point differences being clinically 
meaningful  (14, 15) . The scale takes 2- 5 minutes to complete.  
 
Pediatric patients will not be asked to complete the surveys, which were  designed to the 
adult population. No Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement  or symptom scale 
surveys have been validated for transplant pediatric population. Thus, pediatric participants would not be asked to complete surveys.     
 
Whole blood s amples will be colle cted for research. All effort will be made to collect 40 
mL blood samples (see table for children < 40 kg) at  enrollment , randomization, and 
monthly until one year after randomization, and at times of IST resumption or dose increase.   
 
 25-40 kg  10-24.99 kg  <10 kg  
Maximum volume of each blood draw  20 mL  10 mL  5 mL  
Maximum volume in 1 year  260 mL  130 mL  65 mL  
  
Patients may participate without donating blood but every effort will be made to collect 
the samples, including use of remote draw and overnight shipping.

 9 6.2 Study Design Rational e 
Need for a feasibility study : This study is based on the hypothesis that prolonged low 
dose IST will prevent GVHD exacerbation and need to resume of high doses of IST. 
Preliminary data in support of this hypothesis are derived from a retrospective study 
demonstrating that approximately half of patients with chronic GVHD who stop IST need to restart t reatment  after a median of 3- 6 months. The only way to test this hypothesis is 
with a randomized trial but the sample size for such a study is prohibitive without evidence that patients can be enrolled and randomized, that they will follow their 
assigned treatment, and that the observations about IST resumption in the retrospective study appear accurate.  
 
Justification for allowing heterogeneity in last agent, tapering schedules, and dose to 
continue in the intervention arm:  As patients with chronic GVHD respond to a variety of 
immunosuppressive agents and doses, there is no unified treatment protocol  for chronic 
GVHD. S imilarly there are no uniform criteria when attempts to stop IST should be 
initiated. In our retrospective study the  last immunosuppressive regimen to be 
discontinued w as variable, including calcineurin inhibitors (43%), prednisone (28%), 
sirolimus (19%), or mycophen olate m ofetil (10%). Thus, after discussion with the LTFU 
attendings, we elect ed to allow heterogeneity in plan s for IST taper timing and speed. 
This study design mirrors routine clinical practice and allows us to capture data about the most common practices regarding IST discontinuation.  At the time of enrollment, physicians must specify the dose/schedule at which they are comfortable randomizing a patient to possibly continue stable treatment for an additional 9 months. Ideally, this would be a dose that does n ot cause toxicity and also controls GVHD.  
 
Enrollment time: We will enroll patients at the time when they are only taking  one 
immunosuppressive agent, chronic GVHD is under control  and the plan is to start 
taper ing IST , or when patients  are already tapering IST . Patients may be enrolled on the 
study before or at the time they are taking the IST dose that the attending physician 
recommends they continue should they be randomized to the continuation IST arm. Enrolling patient s before or at the time they reach the IST dose that may be continued 
should they be randomized to the continuation IST arm  (Figure 1) allows us to present 
the protocol to patients when they are seen in the clinic , which will increase the chance 
of enrolling patients on the study  (Patients with well controlled GVHD are seen in clinic 
infrequently and thus may be seen before or at the time they have already reached the lower IST dose to be continued).  
 
6.3 Subject Registration and Informed Consent  
 
Eligible subjects will be identified by the SCCA LTFU or SCH providers and the study 
staff.  A complete, signed, study informed consent is required for registration.  
 Before enrollment , the study  investigator or sub -investigator s will discuss the study and 
consent form  thoroughly with the potential participant. The study  will be presented as 
objectively as possible and the potential risks and hazards of the study  explained to the 
9962  
 
 10 subject. Consent will be obtained using forms approved by the Institutional Rev iew 
Board of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  (FHCRC) .  
 
The study and consent form  will be discussed with potential pa rticipants at their LTFU at 
the SCCA or  SCH visits. H owever , if the patient requests to think about the study prior 
to making f inal decision, the study PI or sub- PI will call the patient about a week after 
his/her appointment, will review the study and consent form  again, answer any 
questions the patient might have, and if the patient is interested he/she will sign consent 
over the phone.  The rational for the telephone follow -up and not in person follow -up is 
that many of the patient s are not local, and the phone follow -up will decrease burden on 
the patient. If patient would like to have in person follow -up this option would be 
available.  
 If subject signs the informed consent at home (after discussing the study procedure and its potential risk with the study investigator or sub-investigator ), he/she will mail the 
signed informed consent form (ICF) to the FHCRC and the doc ument will be signed by 
the person  who obtained the consent over the phone . The investigator /sub-investigator  
will document the consent discussion in the medical record.  A copy of the ICF  will be 
provided to the subject.  Signed ICFs will remain in each subject’s chart.  
 
6.4 Data  Collection  
Provider and patient assessments will be collected in the form of s tudy surveys at 
enrollment , and if possible at randomization, and every three months  for 12 months and 
at times of IST resumption or increased dose, if still during the period of active study 
participation.  If patients cannot be seen at the SCCA  or SCH clinic at these time points, 
an effort will be made to collect the pertinent information from the patients’ local 
providers. The study team will contact participants monthly  via p hone or email to check 
on each patient’s status . Additional information (e.g.  laboratory test results) would be 
obtained from the patients’ records.  
 
For further evaluation of patients’ health status, adult participant s will be asked to 
complete a survey based on the PROMIS -29 and Lee symptoms scale ( Appendi x A). 
Patients will be asked to complete the survey at enrollment , randomization, every 3 
months after randomization, at the end of the active study participation (12 months after 
randomization) and if IST  resumed/ dose increased (if still during the active study 
participation period) . If a patient is  not seen in clinic, questionnaires will be mailed  to the 
patient .  
 Following the 12 months active participation period, participants will be followed by chart review annually to determine disease status,  GVHD status, IST status, and survival.  
 
6.5 Study Procedures  
Eligible patients will be identified at  Seattle Cancer  Care  Alliance  or Seattle Children’s 
Hospital by clinicians . Signed informed consent will be obtained  by clinician s. All 
9962  
 
 11 females of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at enrollment. Pregnant 
women will be excluded from the study.  
After consent, the clinician will complete the provider survey , the patient will complete 
the patient  self-assessment survey , and a n effort will be made to have a research blood 
sample drawn .  
If patients are enrolled on the study prior to reaching the IST dose the attending physician recommends they continue should they be randomized to the continuation IST arm,  then randomization will take place before the patient gets to the IST dose that 
would be continued if they are randomized to the IST continuation arm (investigational arm). If patient s are enrolled on the study while they are already taking the IST dose 
that the  attending physician recommends they continue should they be randomized to 
the continuation IST arm, randomization will take place at time of enrollment  (Figure 1).  
The clinician and the patient will be informed about  the randomization, and further IST 
management would be according to  the study arm the patient was randomized to,  as 
described above.  
There is no financial compensation to patients for participating in this study.  
Participants will be contacted by the study coordinator via phone or email (according to 
their preference) monthly, if they are not seen at the LTFU clinic . The s tudy coordinator 
will review health status, c onfirm future clinic schedules and check whether IST was 
restarted for GVHD . Following the 12  month s active participation period, participants will 
be followed by chart review annually to determine disease status , GVHD status,  IST 
status , and survival.  
Research blood samples will be collected from patients  at time of enrollment, and 
potentially several  time points after enrollment  as discussed above in section 6.1.   
Data will be entered electronically into a password- protected database using only the 
participant study ID. All data will be maintained in secur ed areas (locked file cabinets 
and password- protected electronic databases).  
If a patient relapses with their primary disease and requires  systemic anti -cancer 
treatment , data collection from the patient and clinician will cease and no additional 
research samples will be taken. The patient will continue to be followed via chart review . 
The intent is to randomize patients within three months of enrol lment. If a patient has 
not been randomized within three  months of enrollment, data collection from the patient 
and clinician will cease and no additional research samples will be taken. The patient will continue to be followed via chart review.  
If a participant or the partner of a research participant becomes pregnant during the study, the principal investi gator will follow the pregnant female for pregnancy outcome.  
 
9962  
 
 12 6.6 Adverse Reactions and their Management  
Prolonged IST on the continuation IST arm may result in increased risk of infection, 
treatment related organ toxicity, and increased risk for relapse. Earlier discontinuation of 
IST on the discontinuation arm may result in increased risk for GVHD exacerbation, required initiation of high dose immunosuppression, which again may result in increased risk of infection, treatment related organ toxicity, and i ncreased risk for relapse. 
Treatment of any complication will be at the discretion of the patient’s provider.  
Blood collection for research purposes will usually be done at the same time as clinical 
sampling.  
If an adverse event occurs as a result of study participation, the PI will ensure appropriate follow -up is carried out until the effects of the adverse event are resolved.  If 
the study staff becomes aware of any unanticipated severe adverse reactions due to 
study participation, the circumstances wil l be reported to the IRB. To note, clinical 
events  and/or laboratory findings  related to IST will not be reported as adverse events, 
since both discontinuation or prolonged continuation of IST are used in practice.  
 
6.7 Data and Specimen Storage  
Blood samples will be collected  for future laboratory studies. Participants will donate 
whole blood at enrollment  and additional time points as detailed in section 6.1 . Samples 
will be processed according to standard procedures and labeled with a sample 
identification number. Samples will be stored in a repository  and may be used to study 
chronic GVHD and/or other transplant complications . 
 All study data will be stored in the master database using only the participant’s unique 
identif ier.  The link to the participant’s identity will be maintained separately from the 
study data.  
 
7. Statistical Considerations 
 
7.1. Statistical Analysis Plan  
7.1.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary objective of this study is to assess feasibility of enrolling and randomizing 
patients with chronic GVHD to discontinuation ( discontinuation IST arm ; standard of 
care) versus prolonged continuation of IST ( continuation IST arm ; investigational arm ).  
 
Feasibility will be assessed by accrual rate of 20 patients per year. Early stopping of the accrual to the study is low accrual rate defined as less than 12 patients enrolled in the first year.  
9962  
 
 13 7.1.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary objective of this study includes three parts: 1) treatment compliance 
including rate of patient reaching randomization and rate of patients following study specific IST management based on study arm; 2) assess feasibility (enrollment  and 
data collection) for patients who are not local ; and  3) assess whether continuation IST 
decreases the need for pulses of high does IST and efficacy and safety evaluation of 
continuation IST arm   
 Secondary  endpoint  analyses will be descriptive.  The analys es will be conducted by 
overall population, patients who are not local, and by arm, as applicable.  
 The summary statistics for continuous variables will include sample size, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum for both baseline and post -
baseline measurements (if applicable). The summary statistics for categorical variables will include sample size, frequency and percentages.  The difference between two arms will be examined if applicable. Fisher’s exact test will be proposed to test t he difference 
between two arms for categorical variables.  
7.1.3. Methods  
Descriptive summary table will be provided for overall study population, and by each arm, respectively.  The summary statistics for continuous variables will include sample size, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum for both baseline and post-baseline measurements (if applicable). The summary statistics for categorical 
variables will include sample size, frequency and percentages.  The difference between the two arms will be examined if applicable. Fisher’s exact test will be proposed to test 
the difference between two arms for categorical variables.  
 
7.2. Sample Size and Power  
This feasibility study is to assess the ability to enroll and randomize patients with 
chronic GVHD to discontinuation versus continuation of IST.  Sample size o f 40 patients 
is based on the anticipated availability of eligible patients. Although the study is not powered  based on a specific null hypothesis, if 20 patients are enrolled in each arm, we 
will have 83% power to see statistically significant difference between two arms (at the 
two-sided level of 0.1) if the true 12 months rate of IST resumption in discontinuation 
IST arm is 75% and true 12 months rate of increase IST dose in investigation arm is 
30%.  
 
8. Risks and Discomforts 
Prolonged IST on the continuation IST arm  (investigational arm) may result in increased 
risk of infection, treatment related organ toxicity, and increased risk for relapse. Earlier 
discontinuation of IST on the discontinuation arm (standard of care) may re sult in 
increased risk for GVHD exacerbation, required initiation of high dose immunosuppression, which again may result in increased risk of infection, treatment 
9962  
 
 14 related organ toxicity, and increased risk for relapse. Treatment of any complication will 
be at the discretion of the patient’s provider.  
Blood collection for research purposes will usually be done at the same time as clinical sampling.  
9. Potential Benefits  
Based on  retrospective data demonstrating that approximately 50% of patients who  stop 
IST require  resumption of IST due to GVHD exacerbation, the continuation arm of this 
study (investigational arm) offers potential benefit of decreasing the risk of chronic 
GVHD exacerbation and decreasing the need for resuming high- dose IST . 
 
10. Adverse Event s/Serious Adverse Events  
 
10.1 Adverse Events  
According to ICH guidelines (Federal Register. 1997; 62(90):25691 -25709) and 21 CFR 
312.32, IND Safety Reports, and ICH E2A, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, an adverse event is defined as follows:  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Abnormal laboratory values for laboratory parameters specified in the study should not be recorded as an adverse event unless an intervention is required (repeat testing to confirm the abnormality is not considered intervention), the laboratory abnormality results in a serious adverse event or the adverse event results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment.  
Medical conditions present at screening (i.e., before the study treatment is administered) are not adverse events and should not be recorded on adver se 
event pages of the CRFs.  These medical conditions should be adequately documented on the subject chart.  However, medical conditions present at baseline that worsen in intensity or frequency during the treatment or post -
treatment periods should be reported and recorded as adverse events.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE  or SAE  include:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless 
9962  
 
 15 judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or 
symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condi tion 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital)  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or 
condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• Clinical events or laboratory findings related to immunosuppressive 
therapy  
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event should be clas sified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:  
 
Fatal  Adverse event results in death.  
Life threatening:  The adverse events placed the subject at immediate risk of 
death. This classification did not apply to an adverse event that 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalization:  It required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization. Ho spitalizations 
for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before enrollment in the treatment plan or routine check -ups are 
not SAEs by this criterion. Admission to a palliative unit or 
hospice care facility is not considered to be a hospitalization.  
Disabling/incapacitating  Resulted in a substantial and permanent disruption of the 
subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
Congenital anomaly or 
birth defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to 
the molecule or treatment plan regimen bef ore conception or 
during pregnancy.  
Medically significant:  The adverse event did not meet any of the above criteria, but  
could have jeopardized the subject and might have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  
 
10.3 Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
SAEs  
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease 
progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, or if the invest igator considers that there was a causal relationship between 
treatment with investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.  
9962  
 
 16  
10.4 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected adverse event  is defined as an event that has a nature or severity, or 
frequency that is not consistent with the applicable investigator brochure, or the prior 
medical condition of the subject or other treatment given to the subject.  “Unexpected,” as used in this defi nition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been 
previously observed and reported in preclinical or clinical studies rather than an experience that has not been anticipated based on the pharmacological properties of the study drug.  
 
10.5 Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed by the investigator or qualified designee and recorded in the 
CRFs. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis 
of signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the adverse event and/or serious adverse event and not described as the individual signs or symptoms. The following information should be recorded:  
• Description of the adverse event using c oncise medical terminology  
• Description as to whether or not the adverse event is serious, noting all criteria that apply  
• The start date (date of adverse event onset)  
• The stop date (date of adverse event resolution)  
• The severity (grade) of the adverse event  
• A description of the potential relatedness of the adverse event to study drug, a study procedure, or other causality  
• The action taken due to the adverse event  
• The outcome of the adverse event  
 
If an adverse event occurs as a result of study participati on, the PI will ensure 
appropriate follow -up is carried out until the effects of the adverse event are resolved.  If 
the study staff becomes aware of any unanticipated severe adverse reactions due to study participation, the circumstances will be immediately reported to the IRB. To note, clinical events related to IST will not be reported as adverse events, since both discontinuation or prolonged continuation of IST are used in practice. All AEs and SAEs will be reported to the DSMC at least annually.   
10.6 Grading Adverse Event Severity  
All AEs will be graded in severity according to the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the 
investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 ( mild), Grade 2 (moderate), 
Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life- threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum 
intensity of the adverse event.   
 
9962  
 
 17 10.7 Attribution of an Adverse Event  
Association or relatedness to the study agent will be assessed by the investigator as 
follows:  
• Definite : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to 
the investigational agent, has been previously described in association with the 
investigational agent, and cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such 
as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
medications; AND the event disappears or improves with withdrawal of the 
investigational agent and/or re- appears on re -exposure (e.g., in the event of an 
infusion reaction).  
• Probable : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to 
the investigational agent and has been previously been described in association 
with the investigational agent OR cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such a s the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
medications.  
• Possible : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to 
the investigational agent, but could be attributable to other factors such as the subjec t’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant 
medications.  
• Unlikely : Toxicity is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s).  The event 
may be attributable to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeuti c interventions or concomitant medications.  
• Unrelated : The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications.  
 
For general AE assessment, an AE is considered related i f it is assessed as definitely, 
probably, or possibly related; unrelated if it is assessed as unlikely related or unrelated.  
 
10.8 Adverse Event Recording Period  
AEs will be monitored and recorded in study -specific case report forms (CRFs) from the 
time o f consent through the end of active follow -up (~12 months after randomization) .  
 
 
11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the FHCRC/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.   Under 
the provisions of this plan, FHCRC Clinical Research Support (CRS) coordinates data and compliance monitoring conducted by consultants, contract research organizations, or FHCRC employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study.   Independent 
monitoring visits occur at specified intervals determined by the assessed risk level of the study and the findings of previous visits per the institutional DSMP.  
9962  
 
 18 In addition, protocols are reviewed at least annually and as needed by the Consortium 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), FHCRC Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the FHCRC/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Review Board (IRB).   The review committees evaluate accrual, adverse events, 
stoppi ng rules, and adherence to the applicable data and safety monitoring plan for 
studies actively enrolling or treating subjects.   The IRB reviews the study progress and 
safety information to assess continued acceptability of the risk -benefit ratio for human 
subjects.   Approval of committees as applicable is necessary to continue the study.  
The trial will comply with the standard guidelines set forth by these regulatory committees and other institutional, state and federal guidelines.

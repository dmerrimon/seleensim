Page 14 of 54 4. Introduction  
i) Background  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common abnormal rhythm disturbances and affects 
approximately 5.5 million people worldwide, including 10% of people older than 75 years .1 
The most debilitating consequence of AF is thrombus formation from stagnant blood flow 
leading to thromboembolism and stroke.  As such, the rate of ischemic stroke attributed to 
non-valvular AF is estimated to average 5% per year which is 2 -7 times that of those without 
AF2. 
Treatment with warfarin therapy for the prevention of thromboemboli originating in the left atrial appendage has been well documented .
3,4,5 Warfarin therapy targeting an International 
Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 – 3.0 is considered the gold standard treatment today 
for patients with non -valvular AF for prevention of stroke.  While warfarin has remained the 
optimum treatment for many years, there are numerous challenges with the drug, such as frequent need for monitoring and dosage adjustments, dietary and metabolic interactions, and concerns  of patient compliance.  Additionally, the potential for frequent and fatal bleeding 
are high concerns for patients and caregivers and often times it is found this drug is not well tolerated.  
As the risk of stroke increases with age and the disability and  tolerance concerns with 
available drug therapy persist, the need for permanent protection against thromboembolism in AF patients remains unmet.  The sponsor has been investigating the use of a permanent implantable device to seal off the left atrial appen dage, the location where the vast majority 
of thrombi originates in AF patients.  This device may provide an alternative to warfarin therapy in non- valvular AF patients who require thromboembolic protection.  
ii) WATCHMAN Therapy  
The WATCHMAN
® Left Atrial Appe ndage Closure Technology is intended for patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation who require treatment for potential thrombus formation and 
are eligible for warfarin therapy.  
The implanted component of the system, hereafter referred to as the WATCHMAN device, is a novel device designed to prevent the embolization of thrombi that may form in the left atrial appendage (LAA).  The WATCHMAN device may prevent the occurrence of isch emic 
stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) 
who require treatment for potential thrombus formation.  It may also reduce the risk of life -
threatening bleeding events such as hemorrhagic stroke as seen in patients on warfarin therapy.  The WATCHMAN is manufactured by Atritech, a subsidiary of Boston Scientific, received CE Mark in October 2005 and is under IDE in the United States (U.S.).   
iii) WATCHMAN Clinical Study Experience  
Clinical evaluation of the WATCHM AN LAA Closure Technology has been ongoing since 
2002, with all U.S. studies conduct ed under IDE #G020312. Table 4 -1 lists the clinical 
studies conducted in the U.S. with the WATCHMAN device.  The pivotal study, PROTECT AF, demonstrated non- inferiority of the WATCHMAN device to long -term warfarin therapy

Page 15 of 54 for the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism and cardiovascular death.  
The Pre -Market Application (PMA) was therefore submitted to FDA in August 2008.  The 
FDA requested that a second pivotal study be conducted to confirm the results of the PROTECT AF study.  The second pivotal study, PREVAIL, was conducted to provide additional information on the implant procedure and complication rates associated with the device.  When available, the results from the PREVAIL study will be submitted to FDA in a Pre-Market Application for consideration of commercial approval of the WATCHMAN 
device in the U.S.  This continued access study will permit availability of the device to investigators and subjects during the preparation and FDA review of the Pre -Market 
Application.

5. Device Description 
The WATCHMAN device is designed to be permanently implanted at or slightly distal to the ostium (opening) of the LAA to prevent embolization of blood clots formed within the trabeculated LAA.  The placement procedure can be performed under general or consc ious 
sedation in a catheterization or electrophysiology ( EP) laboratory setting using standard 
trans -septal technique under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance.  
The WATCHMAN LAA Closure Technology is a three -component system which includes 
the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device (WATCHMAN device), the WATCHMAN Delivery System and the WATCHMAN Access Sheath.  
i) WATCHMAN De vice 
The WATCHMAN device is comprised of a self -expanding nitinol frame structure with 
fixation barbs around the device perimeter and a permeable polyester fabric that covers the atrial facing surface of the device ( Figure 5 -1).  The device is constrained within the 
Delivery System unt il deployment into the LAA.  
The WATCHMAN device is available in various sizes to accommodate a range of LAA ostial diameters.  The device size, measured in mm, is the diameter of the device at its maximum dimension in an uncompressed (fully expanded) stat e.  An appropriate device size 
is selected based on LAA measurements obtained utilizing Fluoroscopy and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).

ii) WATCHMAN Delivery System  
The delivery catheter consists of  an inner core wire with a reinforced braided jacket that is 
connected to the deployment knob at the proximal end and a screw thread assembly at the 
distal end.  The outer sheath has an overall profile of 12F.  
The WATCHMAN device is pre- loaded and is depl oyed by loosening the valve on the 
Delivery System and retracting the outer sheath.  The WATCHMAN device can be partially 
recaptured and redeployed if the device is too distal.  If the device is deployed too proximal, it can be fully recaptured. The device  is released by rotating the device deployment knob 
counter clockwise. 
iii) WATCHMAN Access Sheath  
The 14F transseptal Access Sheath is utilized to gain access to the LAA and serves as a conduit for the Delivery System.  The distal end of the Access Sheath is a vailable in various 
curve styles to assist with placement of the sheath into the LAA.  Various curve styles allow for coaxial placement of the sheath into the LAA.  The distal tip contains a marker band for in situ visualization as well as sizing marker ba nds used to gauge if the Access Sheath is 
positioned at the appropriate depth in the LAA based on the device size selected.   
The Access Sheath and dilator are utilized to gain access to the LAA after initial transseptal access into the left atrium has been established.  Once the Access Sheath is positioned into 
the left atrium and the dilator has been removed, it then serves as a conduit for the Delivery 
System.  The Delivery System is introduced into the Access Sheath and the components snap 
together to a ct as one during device implantation.   
6. Objectives  
This Continued Access Protocol is a prospective, non- randomized, multicenter study to allow 
continued access to the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Technology during the data analysis, reporting and review of the PRE VAIL pivotal study Pre -Market Application by FDA.   
Subjects with non- valvular AF who require treatment for potential thrombus formation, and 
are eligible for warfarin therapy, will be screened to participate in the study.  Subjects will be screened via review of medical history, transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) and TEE 
testing.  Once study eligibility is determined, subjects will be enrolled and implanted with the

Page 17 of 54 WATCHMAN device.  After implant, subjects will receive warfarin therapy until TEE 
imaging has confirmed adequate sealing of the LAA.  Successfully implanted subjects will be followed post enrollment for assessment of adverse events at intervals of 45 days, 6 months, 12 months, semi -annually through 3 years, and thereafter annually through 5 ye ars.  
7. Endpoint Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline, procedure and follow -up data collected 
through the study. Analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural success, procedural complications, and incidence  of stroke leading to significant 
disability/death. Any adverse events associated with screened failures who have diagnostic testing to assess eligibility for the device or for device implantation, or who have medication changes  in preparation for device i mplantation will be included in the analyses.  
8. Design  
This is a prospective, non -randomized, multicenter study to provide additional information 
about the safety and efficacy of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Technology.  
This study will be conducted at up to 60 investigational sites in the U.S. and enroll an initial 
cohort of up to 300 subjects.  Incremental enrollment increases may be requested during the study to reach a maximum of 1500 subjects.  FDA approval will be obtained prior to proceeding with the next cohort of subjects.  Additionally, enrollment may terminate early if the device is approved for commercial use or when the PMA review is complete.  The 60 sites will include those physicians with prior WATCHMAN experience demonstrated in the PREVAIL or PRO TECT AF pivotal studies.  
8.1. Scale and Duration  
Subjects will be followed at intervals of 45 days, 6 months, 12 months, semi -annually 
through 3 years, and thereafter annually through 5 years post enrollment.   
It is anticipated that enrollment will be conducted over a period of two years.   
8.2. Implant Procedure Training  
Investigators in the study will be those exhibiting proficiency in the trans -septal approach 
into the left atrium. Investigators with prior WATCHMA N implant experience in the 
PROTECT AF or PREVAIL studies will not be required to repeat operator training for this 
continued access study.  
New operators must complete the WATCHMAN training program.  Operator training includes the following elements:  
• On-line pre -study examination  
• Interactive on -line WATCHMAN case studies  
• Case observations with an experienced WATCHMAN implanting physician

8.3. Treatment Assignment  
Not Applicable  
8.4. Justification for the Study Design  
Clinical evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Technology has been ongoing since 
2002, with all U.S. studies  conducted under IDE #G020312. The pivotal study, PROTECT 
AF, demonstrated non- inferiority of the WATCHMAN device to long -term warfarin therapy 
for the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism and cardiovascular death.  
The Pre -Market Application (PMA) was therefore submitted to FDA in August 2008.  The 
FDA requested that a second pivotal study be conducted to confirm the results of the 
PROTECT AF study.  The second pivotal study, PREVAIL, was conducted to provide additional information on the implant procedure and complication rates associated with the device.  When available, the results from the PREVAIL study will be submitted to FDA in a Pre-Market Application for consideration of commercial approval of the WATCHMAN 
device in the U.S.  This continued access study will permit availability of the de vice to 
investigators and subjects during the preparation and FDA review of the Pre -Market 
Application.  
9. Subject Selection  
9.1. Study Population and Eligibility  
The eligibility criteria for this continued access study are the same as the PREVAIL pivotal study.  All subjects who present with non- valvular AF and are eligible for warfarin therapy

10.1. Enrollment  
All adult subjects with non -valvular AF who require treatment for potential thrombus 
formation and are eligible for warfarin therapy shall initially be screened as candidates for the study.  Subjects receiving dabigatran or rivaroxaban prior to enrollment may be considered for inclusion in the study however they will be required to be treated with warfarin post -WATCHMAN implant. Those subjects who provide consent and meet the 
Inclusion and Clinical Exclusion Criteria will undergo an echocardiographic examination (TTE and TEE) to further evaluate Echo Exclusion Criteria.   
If the baseline TEE confirms the presence of any intracardiac thrombus, the sub ject cannot be 
enrolled in the study.  The subject may be treated with anticoagulation therapy and, after an appropriate period of time, return for another baseline TEE to assess evidence of intracardiac

Page 23 of 54 10.2. Withdrawal  
Every effort should be made to retain subject enrollment for the duration of the study.  
During the informed consent process subjects should be fully informed of the risks and should only be enrolled if willing to fully participate in the study.  In the event a subject does decide to withdraw from the study, every effor t should be made to obtain full information on 
any ongoing adverse events.  Subjects will be given the following withdrawal options:  
1) Telephone contact to complete some or all of the visit requirements that can be completed over the phone including adverse event reporting  
2) Telephone contact for adverse event reporting only 
3) No contact  
Subjects should only be considered lost to follow -up after significant effort has been made to 
contact the subject.  At a minimum there should be 3 documented telephone contact a ttempts 
and one certified letter sent to the subject’s last known residence.  
Subjects with unsuccessful implant attempts should be followed through the 45- day visit for 
any adverse events or followed through the resolution of existing adverse events, whichever is later, and then be withdrawn from the study.  
Subject withdrawal and lost to follow -up will be documented on the End of Study case report 
form.  
10.3. Subject Status and Classification  
• Consent Ineligible/Screen Failure: A subject who has signed the informed consent but is found to not meet the eligibility criteria, and does not undergo an implant.  
• Unsuccessful Implant Attempt: A subject who meets all the eligibility criteria, is 
conside red enrolled at the time of venous access at the beginning of an implant 
attempt but does not receive an implant. If the device is not successfully implanted, the post procedure medication regimen will be administered per physician discretion.   The subject  will be followed in the study through the 45- day follow -up 
visit or through resolution of any peri -procedural adverse events, whichever is later.    
• Implant: A subject who receives an implant.  
11. Study Methods  
11.1. Data Collection  
To ensure data quality and comple teness, all required data will be recorded on case report 
forms (CRFs) provided by the sponsor.  Data will be entered onto electronic case report forms by the investigational site or designee.  Case Report Forms should be completed accurately and completel y during and in a timely manner after any visit in the study.  The 
Principal Investigator or appointed designee must review the case report forms and sign them

Page 24 of 54 certifying their accuracy.  Completed case report forms are to be submitted to the sponsor 
within two weeks of completion of a study visit.  
11.2. Stroke Assessments  
Three stroke assessment scales will be routinely collected at baseline and follow -up visits for 
all subjects.  These scales include the following:  
• National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS):  The NIHSS is an assessment tool which quantifies stroke related neurological deficit.  This assessment must be conducted in person to provide valuable information on stroke severity.  This test will 
be performed at baseline and at all office visits.  It must be conducted by a neurologist 
or personnel who have a current certification to conduct the NIHSS.  
• Modified Rankin Scale (MRS): This scale assesses the severity of stroke disability and functional dependence of subjects. This test will be collected at baseline and all 
office and telephone follow -up visits.  The assessment must be performed by either a 
neurologist or personnel who have completed a certification for the MRS.    
• Barthel Index:  The Barthel Index quantifies a subject’s ability to perfo rm typical 
daily functions.  This test will be collected at baseline and all office and telephone 
follow -up visits.  
11.3. Imaging Requirements  
All subjects will undergo a baseline TEE and TTE and follow -up TEE at the 45 -day visit and 
12 month visits. All study r equired TEEs will be performed in accordance with the Imaging 
Manual.  
Copies of all protocol required TEE imaging will be saved to disk and availab le to the 
sponsor upon request.  Certain information from TEEs conducted during the course of the 
study, incl uding any non- protocol required TEEs, will be captured on the study case report 
forms.   A copy of the baseline TTE imaging will be saved to disk and available to the 
sponsor upon request.   The site and subject identification  number along with the subject 
initials should be cle arly identified on the disks.  
i) Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)  
All TTEs will be conducted according to the Imaging Manual.  The baseline TTE will be 
done to evaluate LVEF to confirm subject eligibility .  An LVEF value obtained from a TTE 
performed within 60 days prior to enrollment may be used.  If a significant cardiac event 
occurs after the TTE which cau ses a change in cardiac status [ i.e., major C ongestive H eart 
Failure (CHF) decompensation]  the baseline TTE should be repeated prior to enrollment . 
ii) Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE)  
All TEEs will be conducted according to the Imaging Manual.  The implant TEE will allow the investigator to obtain proper measurements of the LAA to correctly size the de vice,

Page 25 of 54 confirm device release criteria are met prior to device release, and to confirm adverse events 
have not occurred during the implant procedure (i.e., pericardial effusion).  
The 45- day and 12- month TEEs are conducted to assess flow through and around the 
WATCHMAN device and to verify there is no thrombus on the surface of the device.  As required by protocol, some subjects may also have a 6- month TEE if the 45- day TEE 
demonstr ates inadequate seal around the device.

 11.4. Study Candidate Baseline Screening  
After the subject informed consent document has been  signed, subject eligibility will be 
determined through evaluation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Only those subjects 
who provide consent and meet all of the study entrance criteria will be enrolled.  Enrollment is defined as the time of venous access at the beginning of an implant attempt . 
Subjects who provide informed consent but do not meet all of the study entrance criteria or 
do not have an implant attempt will be considered screening failures .  
The following will be assessed during baseline  screening and documented on the baseline 
case report forms for enrolled subjects:  
• Medical and cardiac history  
• Current medical status, vital signs and AF status  
• Pregnancy test for women of child- bearing potential  
• Laboratory analysis (hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine)  
• Current medication regimen  for the use of a ntiplatelet and anticoagulation 
medications  
• Subjects with prior history of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke or TIA are 
required to have a Baseline MRI or CT obtained  
• NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin Scale  
• TTE – If the subject had a TTE within 60 days prior to enrollment it will not need to 
be repeated as long as the subject did not have an appreciable difference in cardiac 
status since the TTE was performed.  
• TEE – Th e TEE must be completed prior to enrollment to confirm eligibility criteria.  
As this is an invasive screening procedure, it is recommended the TEE be performed 
at the end of the screening process.  Subjects will be implanted within 2 calendar days 
of the baseline TEE.  
11.5. Informed Consent  
In order to determine eligibility of a subject, the investigator needs to implement the consent 
process and verify and document the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Subjects must be informed about the investigational nature of the therapy and the potential benefits and risks of the WATCHMAN device prior to enrollment.  Only those subjects (or legal 
guardians) who voluntarily provide written consent to participate will be allowed to continue 
in the screening process.  A subject must receive informed consent and sign and date a 
current IRB approved consent document.  Subjects should be informed that even if they agree to participate in the study, the baseline screening and TEE may demonstrate they are not candidat es for the study.  The original, signed document is to be kept with the subject’s 
file and a copy must be provided to the subject.

 11.6. Implant Procedure  
i) Thrombus Assessment Prior to Implant  
Prior to implantation with the WATCHMAN device, the peri -procedural TEE should confirm 
there is no thrombus in the LAA or left atrium.  If thrombus is identified the subject may not 
be implanted and appropriate anticoagulation should be prescribed.  If venous access was 
achieved at the time a thrombus is detected, the subj ect is considered enrolled .  The subject 
may not be implanted, and will be considered an implant failure.   
If thrombus is identified prior to the implant, but without venous access, the subject will be 
considered a screening failure and may be re- screened  after the thrombus has resolved.  
ii) Implant of the WATCHMAN Device  
Investigators performing the WATCHMAN implant procedure will be chosen based on their 
familiarity with and training in currently accepted trans -septal and left heart techniques.   
The decisio n to bridge prior to the procedure with warfarin and/or heparin will be at the 
discretion of the operator. 
Antibiotics for subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis are recommended for 
administration in a single dose before the procedure as outlined in t he American Heart 
Association Guideline for Prevention of Infective Endocarditis.  If the dosage of antibiotic is inadvertently not administered before the procedure, the dosage may be administered up to 2 hours after the procedure.  Refer to the Guideline s for more details (Circulation 
2007;116;1736- 1754 or current update).  
Subjects should be fully heparinized, per hospital policy, throughout the procedure with a 
recommended active clotting time (ACT) of 200 -  250 seconds.  An ACT should be obtained 
at lea st every 30 minutes throughout the procedure, or per standard practice at each 
investigative center, to ensure an appropriate ACT is maintained for the duration of the 
procedure.  
TEE imaging and fluoroscopy are required during the WATCHMAN implant procedur e to 
assist the investigator to appropriately guide the WATCHMAN Access System into the LAA, obtain proper measurements of the LAA to correctly size the device, and to ensure that the device meets implant release criteria.  Intraoperative TEE imaging shoul d be performed 
in accordance with the Imaging Manual for the collection of images.  TEE imaging will include at least one measurement of the maximum LAA ostium width and maximum 
appendage length to confirm measurements obtained during the baseline TEE as w ell as to 
ensure all post device release criteria are met during the procedure and captured on imaging. 
Implanting physicians need to be cautious of inadvertently introducing air entrapped within 
the Access Sheath.  The operator must be diligent in properly flushing the sheath to prevent air from becoming entrapped within the sheath and then embolizing into the systemic 
circulation.

 iii) Prior to Device Release 
To ensure implant release criteria have been satisfied according to the IFU for position, size, 
stability and seal complete the following:  
• Using both fluoroscopy and TEE, confirm the implant is appropriately positioned at 
or slightly distal  to and spans the entire LAA opening (perform multiple contrast 
injections at multiple viewing angles).  
• Confirm appropriate implant size by measuring the deployed diameter of the implant 
in situ  using fluoroscopy and/or TEE to ensure appropriate device compression 
guidelines are met.  
• Confirm acceptable implant stability by performing a gentle tug on the device 
deployment knob to ensure the implant is well anchored within the LAA.  
• Confirm via fluoroscopy and TEE that all lobes are covered by the device.  
iv) Unsuccessful Implant Attempt  
If the WATCHMAN device is not successfully implanted, the post procedure  medication 
regimen (See Table 11.7- 1) will be administered per physician discretion.  The subject will 
be followed in the study through the 45- day follow -up visit or through resolution of any peri -
procedural adverse events, whic hever is later.  The TEE evaluation and in -office visit are not 
necessary at the 45 -day visit for subjects without a device; these subjects may have a 45 -day 
telephone follow -up in lieu of an office visit.  After completion of the 45- day visit and 
resolution of adverse events, the subject will be exited from the study.  
11.7. Medication Regimen for the Study  
i) Discharge Through 45 -Day TEE  
Following device placement warfarin therapy should be appropriately adjusted so as to achieve a therapeutic INR of 2.0 – 3.0.  I mplanted subjects are to be on adjusted dose 
warfarin therapy through at least the 45 -day follow -up TEE.  While on warfarin therapy, 
subjects will also be prescribed 81mg aspirin.  Aspirin is necessary post device placement to 
mitigate platelet aggregation.   Subjects will remain on warfarin until the 45 -day TEE 
evaluation has shown adequate seal of the LAA.   
ii) 45-Day TEE 
A TEE will be conducted at the 45 -day visit to assess position and the seal around the 
perimeter of the WATCHMAN device within the LAA ostiu m.  Adequate LAA seal is 
defined as little or no visible residual blood flow around the margins of the WATCHMAN device in either a retrograde or antegrade fashion, with jet size <  5mm.   
• If the 45- day TEE shows adequate seal of the LAA with a jet around th e device < 
5mm,  
o Warfarin therapy will be discontinued,

Page 30 of 54 
 o Aspirin dosage will be increased to 325mg indefinitely,  
o Clopidogrel will be initiated and taken until the 6 month follow -up visit then 
discontinued, and    
o There will not be a TEE at the 6 month visit  
• If the 45- day TEE shows inadequate seal of residual LAA blood flow with a jet size > 
5mm around the margins of device,  
o The subject will remain on warfarin therapy and a 6 month TEE will be 
required to assess LA A seal,  
o Aspirin dosage will remain 81mg while the subject is on warfarin therapy, and  
o Clopidogrel will not be initiated  
iii) 6 Month Visit  
A 6 month TEE is only required for those subjects determined to have an inadequate seal at the 45- day TEE.   
• If the 6 month TEE shows adequate seal of the LAA with a jet around the device < 
5mm,  
o Warfarin therapy will be discontinued, and  
o Aspirin dosage will be increased to 325mg indefinitely  
• If the 6 month TEE shows inadequate seal of residual LAA blood flow with a jet si ze 
> 5mm around the margins of device,  
o The subject will remain on warfarin therapy until a TEE can confirm adequate LAA seal, and  
o Aspirin dosage will remain 81mg while the subject is on warfarin therapy  
Caution should be used if considering use of novel or al anticoagulants since this has not 
been studied in patients with a WATCHMAN device.  If anticoagulation is required for any reason beyond what is specified in the protocol, ensure medication labeling is followed; specifically that related to the abrupt d iscontinuation of NOACs in patients 
with non- valvular atrial fibrillation without adequate continuous anticoagulation.

 i) INR Monitoring  
All subjects will have INR monitoring performed at a minimum of every 28 days while on 
warfarin therapy.  Warfarin dosage should be adjusted to ensure subjects are in the therapeutic range of 2.0 – 3.0, which is standard practice for subjects with non- valvular AF. 
It is essential that investigators discuss the importance and value o f the study required INR 
monitoring schedule with study subjects.  INR values will be collected from subjects during 
follow -up visits, or directly from Coumadin Clinics, and reported by sites on the INR Log.  
While subjects are not required to have an INR during time off warfarin therapy, careful 
attention should be given to ensure compliance to the INR monitoring requirement of at least every 28 days once warfarin is restarted.  Early discontinuation of warfarin therapy will be 
documented and the rationale  provided on the case report form.  
ii) 45-Day Office Visit  
The 45- day visit will be scheduled such that the TEE occurs within 30- 60 days post implant.  
Warfarin therapy and 81mg aspirin are to be maintained through the 45- day TEE.  
During the visit a TEE will b e conducted to assess the presence of LAA blood flow through 
and around the WATCHMAN device.  If the TEE evaluation indicates complete LAA seal or 
residual blood flow around the margins of the WATCHMAN device in a retrograde or 
antegrade fashion, with jet size <  5mm, the subject will discontinue warfarin therapy and 
begin adult aspirin regimen (325mg) once daily for the duration of the study, unless continuing on 81mg aspirin is medically necessary.  Additionally, clopidogrel must also be started at this time and taken until the 6 -month follow -up visit.   
Alternatively, if the TEE evaluation indicates residual LAA blood flow with a jet size > 5mm around the margins of WATCHMAN device in either a retrograde or antegrade fashion, the 
subject should continue or reinitiate warfarin therapy until such time that LAA seal occurs or a jet size <  5mm  around the WATCHMAN device is observed.  In this case aspirin will be 
continued at 81mg.   
Additional information collected during the 45- day visit includes the following:  
• INR values while on warfarin therapy     
• TEE to assess device position, LAA seal, thrombus on the device surface, intracardiac thrombus and residual atrial septal shunt – t o be conducted according to the Imaging 
Manual  
• NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin Scale  
• Current medical status  
• Current medication regimen  
• Adverse events experienced since implant procedure

 iii) 6 Month Visit  
The 6 month visit will be conduct ed via telephone for those subjects with LAA seal or 
residual blood flow with jet size <  5mm around the margins of the WATCHMAN device at 
the 45- day TEE.  Subjects who had 45- day TEE evidence of LAA seal are expected to be on 
clopidogrel and aspirin therapy at the time of the visit.  At completion of the 6 -month visit, 
clopidogrel should be discontinued and subjects should remain on adult aspirin therapy 
indefinitely.  
If a subject was unable to discontinue warfarin therapy due to jet size > 5mm at the 45 -day 
TEE, the 6 month visit will be conducted via an office visit and the TEE will be repeated to assess seal around the WATCHMAN device.  Subjects will be eligible to discontinue warfarin therapy only if the 6- month TEE confirms residual flow of <  5mm aroun d the 
device.  In this scenario, warfarin would be discontinued and an adult daily aspirin prescribed 
indefinitely; Clopidogrel therapy would not be necessary to aid in the healing process  after 6 
months post implant. 
Information collected during the 6 -month visit includes the following:  
• Collection of INR values for subjects who were on warfarin therapy during this time  
• TEE (if required) to assess device position, LAA seal, thrombus on the device 
surface, intracardiac thrombus and residual atrial septal sh unt – to be conducted 
according to the Imaging Manual  
• Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale  
• Current medical status  
• Current medication regimen  
• Serious adverse events and adverse events experienced since previous visit  
iv) 12 Month Office Visit  
Subjects will complete an office visit 12 months post implant with a TEE evaluation. Information collected during the 12- month visit includes the following:  
• Collection of INR values for any subjects who continued on warfarin therapy beyond 
the 6 month visit  
• TEE to assess device position, LAA seal, thrombus on the device surface, intracardiac 
thrombus and residual atrial septal shunt  – to be conducted according to the Imaging 
Manual  
• NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin Scale  
• Current medical sta tus  
• Current medication regimen  
• Serious adverse events and adverse events experienced since previous visit

 v) Additional Telephone Visits -18 Months and 30 Months  
All subjects will complete a telephone visit at 18 months and 30 months. 
At the 18 and 30- month visit the following information will be collected:  
• Collection of INR values for any subjects who continued on warfarin therapy after the 
last visit  
• Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale  
• Current medical status   
• Current medication regimen  
• Serious adverse events and adverse events experienced since previous visit  
vi) Annual Visits -2,3,4,5 Years  
All subjects will complete an office visit at annual intervals.  No additional TEEs are 
required after the 12- month visit.  Information collected during the annual off ice visits 
includes the following:  
• Collection of INR values for any subjects who continued on warfarin therapy  
• NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin Scale  
• Current medical status  
• Current medication regimen  
• Serious adverse events and adverse events experienced since previous visit  
11.9. Study Completion  
Each subject will be followed for 5 years after the implant procedure.  
12. Statistical Considerations  
An overview of the adaptive study design, sample size and statistical analysis is provided below.  Details on each aspect and methods for analyzing the study endpoints will be 
described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan that will supersede this document.  
12.1. Sample Size Justification  
This is a prospective, multi -center non randomized continued access study with no formal 
pre-specified hypothesis test.  All subjects will be followed for up to 5 years or until the 
study is terminated.  Subjects enrolled in this study will be analyzed separately from the roll-in and randomized subjects enrolled in the PREVAIL study.

Page 35 of 54 
 A sample size of up to 1500 subjects was chosen to assess incidence of rare events with a 
large degree of precision.  Table 12.1- 1 provides the two- sided 95% confidence interval 
width assuming an event rate of 5%.

Sample Size  95% CI Width  
1000  2.8%  
1250  2.5%  
1500  2.3%  
12.2. Statistical Analysis  
Analysis will include all subjects  enrolled into the study who undergo an attempted implant 
of the WATCHMAN device (i.e. undergo venous access with the intent of implanting the 
WATCHMAN device).  While no formal hypothesis tests will be performed, descriptive statistics will be generated f or the data collected at baseline, during the procedure and at 
follow -up.  For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, range and 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported.  Confidence intervals (95%) for the difference between means wil l be used to compare groups.  For proportions, 95% confidence intervals will be 
reported.  For time -to-event analyses, all subjects not having an event or are lost to follow -up 
will be censored at the time of the last documented follow -up visit.  Analyses may include, 
but will not be limited to, the following: procedural success, procedural complications, and incidence stroke leading to significant disability/death.  
13. Data Management 
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by Medidata. All changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) or its representative. The associated RAVE software and database have been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of cli nical 
studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regu lations. A written signature on printouts 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging and approving the changes . 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will

 be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the database.  
13.2. Data Retention  
The Investigator will maintain, at the investigative site, in original format all essential study 
documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in 
compliance w ith ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be retained for at least 2 years after 
the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the product. These document s will be 
retained for a longer period of time by agreement with BSC or in compliance with other local regulations. It is BSC’s responsibility to inform the Investigator when these documents no 
longer need to be maintained. The Investigator will take measures to ensure that these 
essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the 
Investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody 
must be transferred to an individual who will assume resp onsibility and BSC must receive 
written notification of this custodial change.  
14. Amendments  
If a protocol revision is necessary which affects the rights, safety or welfare of the subject or 
scientific integrity of the data, an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., IRB/EC/FDA/CA) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation.  
15. Deviations  
Per 21 CFR 812.150(a)(5) “The investigator shall notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRB of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well -being of a 
subject in an emergency.  Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 working days after the emergency occurred”   
Except in an emergency, prior written approval to deviate from t he protocol should be 
obtained from the sponsor.  Any deviation from the protocol must be recorded on the protocol deviation case report form and must provide the dates of and the reasons for each deviation.  
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate corrective and preventive actions (including notif ication, center re -training, or 
discontinuation) will be put into place by the sponsor.  
16. Device/Equipment Accountability  
The sponsor will provide the WATCHMAN devices and access system to the investigator.  These devices will be labeled as Investigational Use Only and will require special handling and storage controls. The devices must be kept in a secure location with restricted access.  Devices are intended for u se only by the investigator or sub -investigator(s).  The investigator

 is responsible to track the receipt, use and disposition of all investigational devices received, 
including lot/serial number and device model number.  
WATCHMAN product associated with device deficiencies should be returned to BSC for analysis.  If it is not possible to return the product, the investigator should document why the product was not returned and the final disposition of the product.  Used product not 
associated with device de ficiencies does not need to be returned to BSC but should be 
discarded according to hospital policy.  Expired product should be returned to BSC and all 
unused product will be returned to BSC at the end of the study.  Instruction for returning WATCHMAN prod uct is included in the study regulatory binder.  
17. Compliance 
17.1. Statement of Compliance

 • Atrial septal shunt or iatrogenic atrial septal defect  
• Device misplacement  
• Device embolization  
• Device fracture or extrusion  
• Excessive bleeding  
• Hypertrophic scarring or thrombosed veins  
• Infection  
• Device thrombosis 
• Inability to move or retrieve device  
• Inability to implant the device  
19.2. Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  
Subjects who receive the WATCHMAN device may stop Warfarin therapy as early as the 
45-day follo w-up visit if they meet Warfarin cessation guidelines; therefore, at that time, 
subjects may be at an increased risk of stroke.   Warfarin is the proven standard of care for 
reducing the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation.  The WATCHMAN device is designed to be used instead of Warfarin.  Thus, the absence of Warfarin may represent a risk, especially if 
the device is not effective in preventing stroke.   
From the Warfarin package insert, risks associated with Warfarin therapy include:  
• Major or fatal bleed ing 
• Risk factors for bleeding include: INR > 4.0, age 65 and older, high variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular 
disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, 
concomitant drugs a nd long duration of warfarin therapy   
• Hemorrhage from any tissue or organ  
• Necrosis and/or gangrene of the skin or other tissues  
• Epistaxis  
• Bruising  
• Prolonged bleeding from a cut or scrape  
• Headache  
• Nausea/upset stomach  
• Vomiting  
• Diarrhea  
• Fever  
• Skin rash  
• Skin or tissue necrosis  
• Decrease in white blood cell count  
• Inability to tolerate the medication

 19.3. Risk Minimization Actions  
Efforts have been made to minimize these risks by clearly defining the subject 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and by ensuring that the treat ment and follow -up of subjects are 
consistent with current medical practices.  The WATCHMAN device is constructed of well -
known, well -characterized materials and has undergone extensive mechanical functionality 
and clinical testing.  
Investigational teams selected to conduct the study will be experienced and skilled in interventional cardiology and/or electrophysiology with trans -septal and left heart 
experience, will have training on the WATCHMAN LAA closure implant procedure and will have access to modern high technology medical facilities to conduct those procedures.   
19.4. Anticipated Benefits  
The potential benefit of implanting the WATCHMAN device is its expected ability to 
prevent thromboembolic events originating in the LAA.  The WATCHMAN device may protect  against ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism.  In subjects implanted with 
the device, the elimination of Warfarin therapy may reduce bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic stroke, associated with long- term anticoagulation.  Economic and subje ct 
benefits related to the elimination of life -long compliance to Warfarin therapy and the 
frequent blood tests and lifestyle changes associated with blood thinning medications are numerous.  Lastly, a device -based solution addressing the mechanism of stro ke in atrial 
fibrillation subjects may prove to be simple, tolerable and cost -effective.  
20. Informed Consent 
Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from all subjects or their legally authorized representative.  The Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any investigational devices, study- required procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in a ccordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority body, as applicable. The ICF must be  
approved by the center’s IRB , or central IRB, if applicable.  
Boston Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of t he 
investigative center’s IRB/EC .  Any modification requires approval from BSC prior to use of 
the form.  The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the center in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated con sent forms 
must also have IRB/EC  approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included in the 
body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall:  
• be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the process,  
Released 90884521 AF.6 CAP2 Protocol

  Confidential 
 
Boston Scientific  
CAP2 Protocol  
PDM  90884521 RevAF 
Page 45 of 54 
 • include a descript ion of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical study, 
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate,  
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and e xisting subjects throughout the 
clinical study.  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative 
and by the investigator or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. If a legal  representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by the center and a copy of the signed and dated document and 
any other written information must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory body 
according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learni ng 
of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities,  as appropriate.  
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future healt h 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant informati on during the course of a 
study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following annual review by the IRB . The new version of th e ICF must be approved by the IRB/EC . 
Boston Scientific approval is required if changes to the revised ICF are requested by the 
center’s IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be re -consented. 
Study personnel should explain that even if a subject agrees to participate in the study and 
signs an Informed Consent for, TEE may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable 
candidate for the study.  
21. Safety Reporting  
21.1. Adverse Event Reporting  
For the purpose of this study an adverse event (AE) is an untoward event related to the study, the device, or the study procedures that affects the subject’s health or safety.  For the purposes of this study an Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use

  Confidential 
 
Boston Scientific  
CAP2 Protocol  
PDM  90884521 RevAF 
Page 46 of 54 
 of the investigational medical  device.  When reporting an AE or ADE, the investigator will 
indicate the diagnosis of the event and correlating signs and symptoms on the adverse event 
report.  Individual signs and symptoms and treatment/intervention/diagnostic testing should not be repo rted as separate adverse events, instead be reported as supporting documentation 
on the AE CRF.  Additionally, it is not necessary to report an underlying disease that was 
present at baseline (i.e., CHF, AF, hypertension, chronic anemia, etc.).  However, a ny 
increase in the severity of the underlying disease may require reporting, if at the 
determination of the investigator, it is relevant to the study.   
Adverse experiences that require reporting include any adverse event with clinical symptoms that could possibly be contributed to any of the following:  
• The WATCHMAN device  
• The WATCHMAN implant procedure  
• The use of study mandated medications including warfarin, clopidogrel or aspirin 
(i.e.,: gastrointestinal bleeding due to warfarin or an allergic reaction to clopidogrel)  
• Any study required procedures (i.e., clinical complications from protocol required 
TEE)  
• The following adverse events will also be reported:  
• Neurological events including, but not limited to, stroke, TIA or seizure which are not 
pre-study co nditions  
• Any events possibly related to the study endpoints of stroke, systemic embolization, 
death, etc.  
• Thrombosis  
• Bleeding complications requiring intervention or transfusion of blood 
• Any potential UADE  
Each adverse event will be evaluated by the inve stigator for relatedness and seriousness.  
Definitions of procedural related complications are located in  Table 25- 1. 
i) Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse events should meet the reporting requirements in the preceding section before 
consideration for reporting as serious events.   
Serious adverse events are to be reported to the sponsor within 1 business day of learning of 
the event.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that:  
• Led to death  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
o Resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
Released 90884521 AF.6 CAP2 Protocol

  Confidential 
 
Boston Scientific  
CAP2 Protocol  
PDM  90884521 RevAF 
Page 47 of 54 
 o Required in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
or 
o Resulted in medical or surgical interventio n to prevent life -threatening illness 
or injury or permanent impairment to body structure or a body function  
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a pr ocedure required by the 
protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. 
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of 
the consequences characteristic of a seriou s adverse event.  All SAEs that could have led to a 
SADE if suitable action had not been taken or if circumstances had been less fortunate shall be reported as required by the local IRB or the protocol.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or appli cation (including a supplementary plan or application), or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  If an adverse event is determined to meet the definition of an 
unantici pated adverse event, the sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation.  If an 
unanticipated adverse device effect that represents an unreasonable risk for subject health or 
a product performance failure becomes apparent, immediate action will be taken an d the 
appropriate authorities will be notified.  The investigator will be notified of the results of this evaluation.  All unanticipated device -related adverse effects will be reported to all 
investigators.  
21.2. Stroke Reporting  
In the event that a subject expe riences a stroke during the course of the study, supporting 
documentation will be requested by the sponsor.  This information may include neurologist consultation note/s, MRI/CT imaging, radiology reports, additional NIHSS/MRS/Barthel Index evaluations, or  statement from the investigator. In addition, a search for alternative 
causes of stroke (including hypercoagulable work- up) and TEE evaluation at the time of any 
stroke or embolic event is strongly encouraged to help better ascertain the mechanism of all strokes. An optimal TEE evaluation includes, where feasible based on patient status and technical considerations, evaluation of:  
i. LA thrombus  
ii. WATCHMAN Device Seal  
iii. WATCHMAN Device thrombus or pannus  
iv. Agitated saline contrast injection to evaluate presence of residual right to left shunt at 
the atrial level (persistence of PFO or residual puncture hole from transseptal catheterization for device placement)

Page 48 of 54 
 v. Presence and grade of ascending and arch aortic atheroma 
vi. Presence of worsening left ventricular dysfu nction, “new” regional wall motion 
abnormality or presence of LV thrombus (LVEF data may be supplemented by TTE 
where appropriate, in addition to TEE parameters above)  
21.3. Device Thrombus 
The most accurate determination of whether thrombus has formed on the s urface of the 
WATCHMAN device is through TEE evaluation.  In the case of thrombus on the atrial 
facing side of the device, anticoagulation therapy should be initiated for approximately 12 
weeks or a longer period of time per hospital standard of care for t reatment of thrombus.  
After the course of anticoagulation therapy a repeat TEE evaluation should be performed to 
confirm the thrombus has resolved6 
21.4. Boston Scientific Device Deficiencies 
A device deficiency is any inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  Device deficiencies include malfunctions, misuse or use errors, and inadequate labeling.  All device deficiencies will be documented and reported to BSC on the appropriate e CRF within one business day of first 
becoming aware of the event.  Device deficiencies are not to be reported as adverse events. However, if there is an adverse event that results from a device deficiency, that specific event would be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the device. Device deficiencies should also be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
21.5. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators  
BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating investigators and regulatory authorities, as applicable. The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB , and regulatory authorities of UADE and SAE as required by 
local /regional regulations . 
22. Committees 
22.1. Safety Monitoring Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, the CAP 2 CEC will provide evaluations of safety events. Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. This is expedited through Boston Scienti fic’s Global Safety 
Office, which is responsible for coordinating the collection of information for the subject dossier from the centers. During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, clinical research

 monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of source document 
information. 
22.2. Clinical Events  Committee  
A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is an independent group of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews and adjudicates important endpoints and relevant adverse events 
reported by study investigators. The CEC will review a safety event dossier, which may 
include copies of subject source documents provided by study centers. CEC responsibilities, 
qualifications, membership, and committee procedures are outlined in the CEC char ter. The 
CECs classifications of the adverse events will be used in all study reports, evaluation of study endpoints and in all data analyses.  
22.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for the 
review of data and safety parameters in the study.  The DSMB will develop a charter and stopping rules for the study.  The members will consist of at least four physicians in specialties of electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, or neurology.  A t least one 
member of the committee will be a biostatistician.  
The DSMB will function in accordance with Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: 
Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.  Meeting frequency will be determined by the DSMB to review the clinical data and assess the impact of adverse events.   
The DSMB will be utilized to review data from the continued access study until the time of 
commercialization of the WATCHMAN device.  
23. Suspension or Termination  
This study ma y be terminated at any time.  Upon completion or termination, all data and 
unused investigational devices must be returned to the sponsor

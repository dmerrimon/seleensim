Clinical Trial Phase : Pilot Study  
Study Disease:  Surgical hypothyroidism, Weight gain, Energy Expenditure  
Main  
Eligibility Criteria:   
Age ≥18-89 years of age  
Clinical indication for total thyroidectomy  TSH at screening  >0.45 <4.5 
mIU/ml  
Total Thyroidectomy for benign goiter or thyroid cancer not requiring 
suppressive thyroid hormone therapy  
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed 
consent document.  
 
Primary Objectives:   
To characterize changes in energy metabolism following 
thyroidectomy in response to LT3/LT4 vs. LT4 therapy . 
3 
 We will perform dense phenotyping including energy expenditure and 
substrate utilization during a up to 24-hour stay in a whole -room indirect 
calorimeter  before , and at three and six months following the surgery . 
These data will enable us to define in detail the changes in weight and 
energy metabolism due to the lack of endogenous thyroid hormone 
production, and the response to LT3/LT4 therapy.  
 
Secondary 
Objectives:  To determine the effects of thyroidectomy and response to 
therapy on cardiovascular and endothelial function.  
This aim will provide novel information on the effects of hypothyroidism 
on cardiovascular function, in a well -defined experimental mode l, and 
of the potential for LT3/LT4 therapy in preventing hypothyroidism -
associated myocardial dysfunction and excess of cardiovascular risk.  
 
Tertiary  Objectives  To characterize the changes in lipid metabolism following 
thyroidectomy. In this aim, we will be able to define the changes in 
serum lipids as a consequence of post -surgical hypothyroidism, and to 
estimate whether LT3/LT4 is superior to LT4 therapy with respect of 
this important endpoint associated with cardiovascular risk.  
 
Endpoints:  Primary . Differences in weight between LT4 alone or LT3/LT4   
therapy . 
Primary . Differences in Energy Expenditure between LT4 alone or 
LT3/LT4 therapy.  
Secondary . Differences in echocardiogram parameters between LT4 
alone or LT3/LT4 therapy.  
Secondary . Differences in Lipid levels between LT4 alone or LT3/LT4 
therapy.  
Exploratory . Effects of the Thr92Ala D2 variant on the primary and 
secondary endpoints.  
Exploratory . Differences in QoL (ThyPRO -39) between LT4 alone or 
LT3/LT4 therapy.  
 
Study Design:  This is a pilot, randomized, double -blind,  controlled, parallel study 
in which thirty patients will be phenotypically characterized at baseline 
before surgery, 3 and 6 months following surgery .  There will be one 6 
week post -surgery dose adjustment visit. Both groups will receive 
active therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism: either LT4 and 
placebo or LT4/LT3 combination therapy.

 Number  of 
Subjects:  30 
Subject 
Participation 
Duration:  6 Months  
Estimated Time to 
Complete 
Enrollment:  1 year  
Statistical 
Methodology:  Our preliminary estimate is based on the findings of our cross -over 
study with a population of 14 patients (13 female, weight (kg) = 
69.7±12.5, age (years) =49.3±8.0. After substitution of LT3 for LT4 a 
decrease in weight was 1.8±1.9 kg, and in LDL -cholesterol  was 13%.  
In this study LT3 treatment resulted in 85% higher morning serum T3 
level as compared to LT4. From our recent study, the estimated 
increase in serum T3 level on LT3/LT4 combination therapy adopted in 
the current proposal would be about 44% as com pared to LT4 alone, 
approximately half of the increase in serum T3 observed with full LT3 
substitution. Using the point estimates of our recent meta -analysis, the 
predicted weight gain occurring after thyroidectomy is 1.4 to 2.2 Kg. 
Similarly, no study has  measured changes in energy expenditure using 
WRIC in similar study populations, and our crossover intervention did 
not show significant differences in REE between LT3 only and LT4 
treatments despite a significant change in body weight.  
We hypothesize that LT3/LT4 therapy will be superior to LT4, likely to 
a smaller effect than LT3 alone. We do not expect that the effect would 
be larger than that of pure LT3 therapy. On the other hand, the complex 
interaction of LT4 and LT3 means that an optimal combination ratio may 
exist theoretically that outperforms the pure LT3 therapy. Based on our 
empirical observations and extrapolations, we enumerate a few 
possible effect size to estimate the required sample sizes in a two -arm, 
randomized, cross -sectional design, given a significance level of 0.05. 
The following sample size calculation and statistical power estimation 
are obtained based on two -sample, one -sided t -test based on weight 
loss in LT3/LT4 as compared to LT4 alone.

 Power and sample size calculation for weight differences 
following thyroidectomy between LT4 and LT4/LT3 combination 
therapy. The left columns indicate the power of the study on the 
current sample size (dictated by the time and funding constrains 
of the R21 funding mechanism). The right columns indicate the 
sample size ca lculations necessary to assure an 80% power with 
a significance of 0.05 . 
Similarly, power and sample size calculations for changes in lipids were 
based on our original cross -over study which was associated with 13% 
reduction in LDL and 12% reduction in non -HDL. From our preliminary  
study, the estimated increase in serum T3 level on LT3/LT4 
combination therapy would be about 44% as compared to LT4 alone. 
With linear extrapolation, a 5% to 8% reduction in LDL or non -HDL for 
this study is hypothesized. We also provide the sample size ca lculation 
and power estimation for the hypothesized percent reduction in 
LDL/non -HDL given the LDL of 122.6±25.2 (mg/dl) for LT4 group.

Power and sample size calculation for differences in LDL -
cholesterol following thyroidectomy between LT4 and LT4/LT3 
combination therapy. The left columns indicate the power of the 
study on the current sample size (dictated by the time and funding 
constrains of the R21 funding mechanism). The right columns 
indicate the sample size calculations necessary to assure an 80% 
power with a significance of 0.05.  
Given the sample size of 15, we further estimate the statistical power 
of detecting differences in energy expenditure. Based on our recent 
pilot study on assessing resting metabolic rate (RMR) across 12 
healthy, normal weight subjects (including both sexes , BMI: 24.1 ± 2.9, 
age: 25~71), we estimated that the within -subject variation in RMR is 
less than 0.15 kcal/min, whereas our instrument variation is less than 
0.05 kcal/min within a day. Therefore, using the same cross -sectional 
design of 15 patients per arm, assuming we can detect a difference in 
RMR of 0.14 kcal/min (which is more than two times of the instrument 
precision), we can achieve a sufficient power of 80% with a significance 
level of 0.05 using a one -sided two -sample t -test. 
For the exploratory aims, we plan to assess if the response to ThyPRO -
39, a QoL questionnaire/instrument would yield significant difference 
between subjects on LT4/LT3 vs LT4 alone. We are also interested in  
6 
 assessing potential genetic heterogeneity underlying the treatment 
group effect. More specifically, we would model the QoL endpoints 
using the ANOVA models incorporating treatment effect (LT4/LT3 vs 
LT4 alone), Thr92Ala D2 polymorphism (Thr/Thr, Thr/Ala, v s Ala/Ala), 
and their interaction effects. This would depict a better picture of which 
genetic group might benefit the most from LT4/LT3 combo therapy. This 
ANOVA modeling strategy can be extended in a straightforward 
manner to ANCOVA to assessing changes in other outcomes of 
interest, adjusting for potential genetic heterogeneity, as well as serum 
T3 level, and other important covariates.  
Notice that even if the primary endpoints are expressed as differences 
between baseline and end of the study, in the LT3/LT4 vs LT4 alone 
groups, we are collecting phenotypic data at each follow -up time point. 
This will offer great opportunities to charact erize the longitudinal 
profiles of these phenotypic data and to estimate the effect size as well 
as the standard deviation over time, essentially the trajectory of these 
measured endpoints over the 6 -month time period. Ultimately, this 
would help size a mu ch more powerful study that analyzes the repeated 
measures of the phenotypic data, or design a sufficiently powered study 
with a limited number of subjects due to the elimination of inter -subject 
variation. For example, with 4 time points planned for the s tudy, even if 
the power to assess the treatment effect difference on the weight loss 
of 1.4 (SD=1.9) is 62.7% given a sample size of 15 vs 15 (LT4/LT3 vs 
LT4 alone), the power to detect the treatment by time effect could range  
from 80% up to 95% depending on mean trajectory change, and the 
correlation structures between measurements at different time points 
from a repeated measures ANOVA/ANCOVA modeling. We believe 
this is a significant strength in our dense phenotyping approach  with 
multiple time points, particularly in consideration of the exploratory 
scope of the R21 funding mechanism.

 1 BACKGROUND  
Hypothyroidism is a common condition, particularly among women (1, 2). Weight gain despite 
optimal levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy is a common and distressful occurrence in 
hypothyroidism (3), leading to frequent modifications in therapy (4) with n egligible 
improvements and to patients’ dissatisfaction. Importantly, weight gain has been consistently 
recognized as a driver of poor quality of life in hypothyroid patients (3, 5 -8). Additionally 
hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemia (9 -11) and myocardium dysfunction and 
increased cardiovascular risk (12 -16). There is a need to characterize in detail the changes in 
energy metabolism in hypothyroidism, and to study the effects of alternative treatment 
modalities directed to minimize the prevalence  and severity of hypothyroid symptoms. Previous 
studies directed to assess the efficacy of combination liothyronine (LT3)/LT4 therapies aimed 
to supplement for the loss of endogenous T3 were underpowered, with heterogeneous study 
populations, and often wit h inadequate treatment scheme (17 -29). Virtually all the professional 
organizations lament the lack of high quality, definitive data to support or deny the use of 
combination therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism (30 -32). Post -surgical hypothyroidism  
represents an ideal model to study the effects of loss of endogenous production of thyroid 
hormone and of therapeutic modalities because of the absence of confounders due to residual 
endogenous hormone production and long transition from eu - to hypothyroi dism. By combining 
the study population characteristics with our ability to perform dense phenotyping, and a 
rigorous study design, we will conduct a proof -of-concept study to characterize the changes in 
energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, and lipi d metabolism before and after 
thyroidectomy in response to LT4 or LT3/LT4 combination therapy. The results of this study, 
within the scope of the R21 funding mechanism will define the point estimates of our 
intervention. This in turn will enable us to: a) define whether a larger study is scientifically 
warranted, b) provide for the effect size for post -thyroidectomy weight gain to adequately 
power a large trial which definitely will address the role of combination therapy for the 
treatment of hypothyroidism , and c) define effect size for secondary and exploratory aims to be 
applied to a large clinical trial.  
Irrespective of the etiology, the treatment of hypothyroidism is based on the replacement of the 
lack of  endogenous production of thyroid hormone. This is commonly accomplished with LT4, 
which is metabolized by the deiodinase enzymes into T3 that ultimately delivers the hormonal 
signal to the tissues (30). This strategy is based on the assumption that the act ion of the 
deiodinase enzymes is able to deliver adequate T3 to all the tissue targets of thyroid hormone. 
Experimental and in vivo observations have c hallenged this axiom. The landmark experiments 
of Morreale d’Escobar in a rodent model of hypothyroidism demonstrated that LT4 alone is not 
sufficient to restore hypothyroidism in all tissues (33), and only administration of a combination 
of LT3  and LT4 could provide adequate restoration of T3 (34). On the clinical side, a 
significant number of patients, est imated in up to 40%, complain of residual symptoms 
attributed to hypothyroidism despite achieving the therapeutic goal of normalization of the 
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (3). Common symptoms include weight gain, cold 
intolerance, sluggishness, and “ mental fog” (35). The persistence of hypothyroid symptoms 
has been attributed to an insufficient delivery of T3 to the target tissues because of the loss of 
23 
 the T3 produced by the thyroid (estimated to be 20 -30 mcg/day) (36) or to a deficit in 
peripheral conversion of T4 into T3, possibly due to a common polymorphism of the type 2 
deiodinase gene (37). Importantly, weight gain is considered the major driver of  patients’ 
dissatisfaction (3, 5 -8). The use of LT3/LT4 combination therapy was  proposed  to provide  a 
more  “physiologic”  replacement and  several  clinical  trials  have  been  conducted  (17-29); 
however,  the results  are inconsistent  and no clear evidence  has emerged. This  is likely  due to 
low power,  different therapeutic  regimens, and  to the heterogeneity  of the study  populations , 
which  were  mostly  composed  of individuals  with hypothyroidism  secondary  to autoimmune  
thyroid  disease,  which  often  have  residual  endogenous  thyroid  hormone  production.  In a 
crossover  study,  the substitution  of desiccated  thyroid  extracts  (DTE) for LT4 resulted  in 1.27 
Kg weight loss (38).  Importantly,  patients  who lost weight on  DTE therapy  had a significant 
improvement in  symptoms.   Moreover,  a secondary  analysis  of the largest LT3/LT4 trial 
indicated  that carriers  of the Thr92Ala  D2 were  more  likely  to have  worse  quality  of life at 
baseline, and more  robust  response  to LT3/LT4  combination  therapy (39). In  a crossover  
intervention,  we observed  that the substitution of LT3 alone  for LT4 resulted  in significant weight 
loss and lowering  of cholesterol  (40). Collectively, these  data support the hypothesis  that 
increased  serum  T3 levels  as result of T3-containing  therapeutic  regimens  enables  weight loss, 
reduction  in cholesterol, and  possibly  improvement  in quality  of life in hypothyroid  patients.  
Post-surgical  hypothyroidism  is unique  because patients  become  acutely  devoid  of 
endogenous  thyroid  hormone  production,  transitioning  from a state  of euthyroidism to 
hypothyroidism  entirely  dependent  on exogenous  thyroid  hormone  replacement. To this end, 
this form of hypothyroidism  represents  an ideal  experimental  platform to study  the effects  of 
loss of endogenous  thyroid  hormone  production  and of the response  to therapy.  Importantly,  
recent guidelines  for the treatment of thyroid  cancer  have  significantly  reduced  the need  for 
thyroid  hormone  suppressive  therapy,  and the majority  of patients  undergoing  total 
thyroidectomy  for differentiated  thyroid  cancer  are treated  with replacement therapy  aimed  to 
normalization  rather than  suppression  of the Thyroid  Stimulating  Hormone  (TSH)  (41). 
Surprisingly,  little information  is available  on the changes  in body  weight  and composition  
following  thyroidectomy, and  no thyroid  hormone  replacement therapy  study has selectively  
recruited  patients  post-thyroidectomy.  The reported  weight  gain within  a year of 
thyroidectomy  ranges  from none  to almost  3 Kg (42-47). These  differences  are likely  due to 
retrospective  nature  of the analyses,  methodological  shortcomings,  and inclusion  of patients  
with pre-existing  thyroid  dysfunction.

 2  RATIONAL E  
 2.1 Levothyroxine/Liothyronine (LT4/LT3) combination therapy  
 
Contrary  to a smaller  longitudinal  study  (48), Gullo  and co-workers  have demonstrated  that 
patients  on LT4 therapy have  lower  T3 levels  than controls (49). We have  shown  that 
pharmacoequivalent  doses  of LT3, able to achieve  the same  TSH as LT4 (50), result in  high-
normal  serum T3 levels  and that LT4  alone  results  in serum  T3 levels  at the low end of the 
normal  range  (40). The increase  in serum  T3 levels  (and as a consequence, its increase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
at the target tissue level) is a likely explanation for the  beneficial  metabolic  effects  of LT3 
monotherapy. To this end, the addition  of LT3 to the LT4 therapy  regimen  has been  proposed  as 
a means  to overcome  the lack of endogenous  thyroid  hormone  production  of T3. The definition  
of LT3 pharmacokinetics  PK) is thus a necessary  preliminary  step to design  a therapy  which  can 
provide  adequate  amount  of exogenous  T3 to maintain  the serum  levels  within  the normal  range  
and to minimize  T3 serum  level fluctuations  above  and below  the target range.   The current data  
on the LT3 PK are not clear,  with an estimated  half-life ranging  from 6 to 22 hours (51 -53). The 
wide range  is in part explained  by different  experimental  protocols  and dated  hormonal  assays.  
We revisited  this question  by assessing  LT3 kinetic  and terminal  elimination  in a group  of                
patients  treated  with LT3 alone  in preparation  for nuclear  medicine  procedures  for thyroid  cancer  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED],  PI Celi) . Study patients  were  treated  with LT3 0.6 mcg/Kg/day in three daily 
doses  (average dose 18.8±4.5 mcg) (50)  for four weeks before undergoing last dose  PK 
analysis  and terminal elimination. In this population, the kinetics  of LT3 can be described by a 
two-component (fast distribution and slow elimination)  model with a distribution half -life of 1.1 
hour and an elimination half -life of 28.4 hour.  The Tmax was reached at 1.8±0.5 hour from the 
LT3 administration, with a Cmax of 324.0±63.3 ng/dl. Based on these observations, we have 
developed a model to assess the effects of 10 mcg LT3 substitution for 25 mcg of levothyroxine 
on serum T3 levels, sufficient to increase the serum T3 levels. While a single administration 
would result in significant fluctuations of T3 levels, a twice daily administration regimen will 
provide more stable T3 s erum levels, well within the normal range throughout the day. The 
therapeutic scheme adopted in this proposal is thus based on these preliminary data.   
 
2.2 Experimental approach  
 
This proposal is based on the premise that thyroidectomized patients on levothyroxine 
replacement therapy represent an ideal experimental model to study the pathophysiology of 
hypothyroidism due to the lack of endogenous thyroid hormone production. To this  end, we 
intend to perform dense phenotyping in thirty patients with clinical indications for total 
thyroidectomy at baseline (pre - surgery), and while on LT4 or LT4/LT3 combination therapy for 
a 6-month period aimed to restore the individuals’ TSH level p rior to the surgery . The 
recruitment will be primarily performed from patients undergoing evaluation in the 
multidisciplinary thyroid neoplasia clinic and through ENT at Virginia Commonwealth University, 
but the study information will be disseminated among local endocrinolog ists, and self -referral 
will be allowed.

 2.3 Whole -room indirect calorimeters  
 
The indirect calorimeter instruments and techniques allow for non -invasive real -time recording 
of energy expenditure and respiratory quotient by measuring oxygen consumption and carbon 
dioxide production15. In comparison with alternate forms of measuring energy expenditure (the 
historically -used metabolic carts and portable calorimeters), the whole room calorimeters 
overcome the issues of: 1) Low accuracy due to environmental interference (relative humidity, 
oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration in the testing room, presence of study personnel); 2) 
Inconvenience of using a face mask or a canopy hoo d which limit the duration of the 
observations and  the flexibility of conducting tests which require additional sensors or 
manipulations. Conversely, whole room calorimeters, by allowing free movement of the subject 
and through controlling and monitoring environmental factors (e.g. temperature, gas 
concen tration in the inflow air), overcome the limitations of the metabolic carts and portable 
calorimeters. Traditionally, room calorimeters were challenged by the long equilibration period 
and limited ability of capturing dynamic interventions with time resolu tion of less than 30 
minutes16. At VCU, we have recently built and validated a fast -response whole -room calorimeter 
suite, which allows a fast equilibration period (10 minutes) and recording dynamic changes 
within 10 -15 minutes, favorably comparable to the metabolic cart methods. Addit ionally, the 
environmental temperature of our systems can be modulated between 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 
86°F) while maintaining an accurate reading. Our room calorimeters are equipped with airtight 
ports for food administration, Television set, a toilet, and Wi -Fi connectivity, which enable more 
comfortable and longer studies, as well as direct observation of acute (minutes to hours) effects 
of pharmacologic interventions on energy expenditure and substrate utilization. The flexibility of 
the VCU whole -room indirect calorimeter system allows for continuous and noninvasive 
monitoring of energy expenditure, and other parameters such as heart rate and skin 
temperature, while the volunteer is in a comfortable environment.  
3 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Aim 1:  To characterize changes in energy metabolism following thyroidectomy in 
response to LT3/LT4 vs. LT4 therapy.  
Historically, the measurement of energy expenditure (EE) by indirect calorimetry has been used 
as an index of thyroid function (57). While overt thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism are  
associated with dramatic extremes in EE, small differences sufficient to  generate significant 
weight changes (40) or small variations in LT4 dose fall below the detection of the ventilated 
hood (“metabolic cart”) technique (58). Additionally, the ventilated hood method does not allow 
for prolonged recordings, negating the oppo rtunity to reliably measure the entire spectrum of the 
EE. Interestingly, a recent report indicated that the metabolic signature of chronic calorie  
restriction is low T3 and decreased sleeping EE (59). The whole room indirect calorimeter 
(WRIC) technique enables recordings of the entire spectrum of EE components, including 
resting and sleeping EE, spontaneous movements, and thermic effect of food in a near free -
living environment (60). For our WRIC system, we have recently devised and validated a data 
26 
 analysis algorithm to overcome the suboptimal temporal resolution issue associated with 
traditional WRICs. This method minimizes the latency between events and response in EE  
recordings and enable truly minute -by-minute real -time monitoring capability of WRIC (61). 
Additionally, the continuous recording of the respiratory quotient (RQ) during controlled fasting 
enables us to assess substrate utilization and metabolic flexibilit y, which correlates well with the 
risk of developing metabolic complications from obesity (62). The real -time monitoring capability 
of WRIC, coupled with precise event annotation and timestamping as well as the wearable 
sensors that collect other physiolog ical data simultaneously, allows for analysis of each 
component of EE. For example, the thermic effect of food can be found by aggregating the  
post-prandial EE 4 -hours after the meal time. Sleeping/wake onset times can be detected using 
wearable activity sensors (63) and sleeping EE can be found by aggregating EE between sleep 
time and wake onset time. While no exercise will be conducted in our s tudy, we also plan to 
monitor minute -by-minute activity counts and assess the impact of spontaneous activities on EE 
in our analysis. The optimized temporal  response of our WRIC system, and expertise in 
wearable data collection and analysis, will in turn m ake the  VCU whole room indirect calorimeter 
system uniquely poised to record small differences in the EE and its  components. For the 
purpose of this study, we will perform 24 -hour recordings of EE in the VCU WRIC which has a 
precision of 0.05 Kcal/min. In preliminary experiments performed in a group of  liver transplant 
patients with or without non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we were able to detect a 
significant difference in RQ during controlled fast (Figure 4) indicating that NAFLD adversely 
affects metabolic flexibility in this population. These data show that the VCU WRIC system is 
uniquely positioned to detect small differences in EE components which over time can result in 
significant weight changes. In our study design, study participants wi ll undergo a total of three 
24-hour EE recordings before, three, and six months after total thyroidectomy while on LT4 
alone or LT3/LT4 therapy. Weight will be measured by a stadiometer at the end of each EE 
recording, following 15 -hour fasting, after void ing. Body composition will be measured by DXA 
scan at baseline and at the completion of the study.  
Expected results. We predict that patients undergoing total thyroidectomy treated with LT4 
alone will experience a significant weight gain over a six -month period following the procedure 
despite adequate replacement therapy. Treatment with LT3/LT4 combination therapy will 
prevent weight gain while achieving TSH levels similar to the LT4 -only group. Moreover, the  
longitudinal assessment of EE will provide novel and clinically relevant information on the 
effects of surgical hypothyroidism and its treatment on EE and its components. Collectively, the 
data will enable us to define in detail the changes in weight and e nergy balance in its  
components, and body composition due to the lack of endogenous thyroid hormone production, 
and the response to therapies.  
 
3.2 Aim 2: To determine the effects of thyroidectomy and response to therapy on 
cardiovascular and endothelial function.  
Hypothyroidism, even in the subclinical range, is an important cardiovascular risk factor (12 -16) 
which is not completely eliminated by the LT4 treatment (64, 65). Experimental data indicate 
beneficial effects of LT3 supplementation in the recovering phase  of cardiac surgery (66), and 
LT3 therapy has been suggested as a potential addition to the treatment of congestive heart 
failure (67). While overt hypothyroidism is associated with systolic dysfunction and congestive 
27 
 heart failure, the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism are subtle, mostly characterized as 
diastolic dysfunction with distinct echocardiographic changes (14). Of note, in our original study, 
the LT3 -only arm had a significant decrease in isovolumetric re laxation time, and a trend toward  
an increase in left ventricle end diastolic volume, suggesting an increase in compliance and 
diastolic function (40). Aside the direct effects on the heart, thyroid hormone also plays a 
significant role in the maintenance of vascular tone and endothelium f unction (68 -70), and 
hypothyroidism is associated with an increase in systemic vascular resistance (71). To 
comprehensively assess the effects of surgical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular function, and 
to compare the effects of LT4 vs. LT3/LT4 combination therapy, we will use echocardiography  
. This is a non -invasive device based on the volume clamp method, which continuously 
measures blood pressure by clamping the artery to a constant volume by dynamically providing 
equal pressure on either side of the arterial wall, while the volume is measur ed by a 
photoplethysmography built into a cuff which is fitted on a hand finger. This non -invasive device 
is very precise and accurate when compared with measurement of cardiac output using 
pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution (Swan -Ganz right heart ca theterization) (72, 73). The 
echocardiogram will measure left ventricular end  diastolic and end -systolic volumes, calculate 
ejection fraction, and measure indirect parameters of diastolic function.. The measurements of 
diastolic parameters will include measuring the early velocity of the mitral  
annulus in diastole at pulsed wave, tissue Doppler analysis (E’) which is an indirect measure of 
myocardial relaxation and a surrogate for the myocardial relaxation constant , and the ratio of 
the early transmitral flow velocity E to E’ (E/E’), which correlates with left ventricular filling 
pressures (75). Expected results. When compared to baseline, we expect that the LT4 -treated 
group will develop subtle evidence of diastolic dysfunction, while the LT3/LT4 -treated group will 
show no changes, indicating t hat the combination therapy is able to prevent the effect of 
hypothyroidism on the cardiovascular system. Due to the exploratory nature of the proposal we 
do not expect that the results will be conclusive, but will provide a unique opportunity of  
estimati ng the effects of transition from a state of euthyroidism to full reliance on replacement 
therapy, and to compare the differential response to LT4 vs. LT3/LT4 therapy on the 
cardiovascular system. The point estimates obtained from this proposal will then e nable us to 
design an adequately powered study to assess the effects of thyroid hormone replacement on 
cardiovascular function.  
 
3.3 Aim 3: To characterize the changes in lipid metabolism following thyroidectomy.  
 
Thyroid hormone exerts pervasive actions on lipid metabolism by directly regulating 
transcription of the LDL receptor, intracellular metabolism of cholesterol within the hepatocyte, 
cholesterol excretion and reabsorption through the biliary tract, and peripheral lipolysis (10, 76). 
Hypothyroidism results in significant, reversi ble hypercholesterolemia, which in turn contributes 
to increased cardiovascular risk. We have previously demonstrated that the increase in 
circulating levels of T3 following substitution of LT3 for LT4 results in significant decrease in 
total and LDL chole sterol, 10.9% and 13.3%, respectively (40). No significant differences in 
cholesterol or in lipoprotein levels were demonstrated as a result of LT3/LT4 therapy, 
presumably because of the heterogeneity of the study populations. Our study design offers the 
28 
 unique opportunity to assess the effects of LT3/LT4 combination therapy in patients who 
transitioned from euthyroidism to hypothyroidism without the confounder of residual thyroid 
hormone production or a prolonged course of thyroid dysfunction. We will com pare the levels of 
total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol at baseline and at three and six months following surgery 
between LT4 and LT3/LT4 -treated patients. Additionally, by longitudinally assessing serum 
lipids in the same patient before and after thyroidectomy  while on LT4 or LT3/LT4 therapy, we 
will be able to obtain information whether surgical hypothyroidism, despite adequate  
replacement results in significant changes in lipid levels, and if LT3/LT4 therapy this can be 
prevent these changes. The data gathered in this aim will thus provide high value (due to the 
strengths of the study design) point estimates to evaluate the effe ct size of the LT3/LT4 on lipid 
metabolism. Expected results. We predict that the LT3/LT4 therapy will result in a measurable 
decrease in total and LDL cholesterol compared to LT4 treatment arm, which in turn will show 
an increase compared to baseline.  
 
3.4 Exploratory aims: to evaluate the changes in ThyPRO -39, a thyroid specific quality 
of life instrument, and the role of the Thr92Ala D2 polymorphism in post -surgical 
thyroidectomy patients treated with LT4 or LT3/LT4 combination therapy . 
 
Quality of Life . A deterioration in quality of life is a common complaint of hypothyroidism (4 -8), 
which persists despite adequate replacement therapy (3). While few studies have indicated 
improvement in indices of quality of life in patients treated with LT3/LT4 combina tion therapy, 
the results are far from definitive. Aside study design limitations, some studies used quality of 
life instruments which lack of specificity for thyroid dysfunction related symptoms. To address 
this shortcoming, we plan to use the ThyPRO -39, a validated thyroid -specific quality of life 
instrument which is considered the gold standard for the assessment of thyroid related 
symptoms and overall well -being (77 -80). We have secured the collaboration of Dr. Watt, the 
creator of this i nstrument, who will contribute in analyzing the data (see letter of support). We 
are confident that we will be able to obtain a point estimate difference between the two 
treatment groups which will enable us to justify the development of a larger adequatel y powered 
study to detect clinically significant differences in quality of life.  
D2 Polymorphism. Epidemiologic, in vivo , and in vitro data support the hypothesis that the 
Thr92Ala D2 polymorphism (81) causes a reduction in the hormonal signaling due to a decrease 
in conversion of T4 into T3 (82 -86). The Thr92Ala D2 polymorphism is associated with worse 
quality of life at baseline in hypo thyroid patients, who responded better to LT3/LT4 combination 
therapy (39), but the results are not conclusive (87), and no prospective study has been 
performed to assess its role in the response to com bination therapy. The prevalence of the 
minor Ala92 allele (81) will enable a Mendelian randomization, and we expect that 50% of  
the study population will be a carrier as heterozygous or homozygous. We do not expect to be 
able to detect a significant difference in any of the study outcomes as a consequence of the 
Thr92Ala D2 status, but the data gathered in this proof -of-concept stu dy will enable to measure 
the point estimate for the modulatory role of the Thr92Ala D2, and if deemed relevant and 
feasible to design an adequately powered study. Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping will 
be performed in the Department of Endocrine  lab. Briefly, genomic DNA isolated from whole 
29 
 blood is amplified and genotyped using a SYTO 9 based PCR master mix containing primers 
specific to the DIO2  
rs225014 (Thr92Ala) variant. PCR amplification and genotyping by small amplicon high -
resolution melting (88) will be performed on the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 real -time 
PCR system.  
4 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a two arm, parallel, double blind placebo controlled (both arms will receive active 
medication) proof of concept study. Thirty  patients will be enrolled and allocated 1:1 to the 
LT4 alone or to the LT3/LT4 combination regimen. Due to the exploratory and preliminary 
nature of the funding mechanism (R21) and FOA (Pilot and Feasibility Clinical Trials in 
Diabetes, and Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases), the study is geared toward gathering a 
large amount of preliminary data in a relatively small number of study participants (dense 
phenotyping). The acquisition of point estimates of the endpoints will then enable us to 1) 
justify the execution of a large study (go/no -go); 2) define primary and secondary outcomes; 
3) adequately power a large, multicenter s tudy able  to demonstrate clinically relevant 
differences in the selected endpoints.

8 TREATMENTS  
8.1 Investigational /non Investigational Product s 
The following  medications will be used in this study:  
• Levothyroxine  (LT4)  
• Liothyronine  (LT3) 
• Placebo (sugar pill)                                                                                          
(Medisca empty gelatin capsules size 00 manufactured by CapsuleDepot ) 
The VCU Investigational Drug Pharmacy will over -encapsulate the Investigational Pharmacy will 
over-encapsulateLT4 plus placebo, or LT4 plus 5 mcg LT3 in “AM” and “PM” color coded 
capsules.     
33 
 The pharmacy will create the over -encapsulating tablets and making matching placebo capsule 
placebo distinguish the A M and PM doses They will use; dextrose, USP (anhydrous) 
manufactured by Medisca empty gelatin capsules size 00 manufactured by CapsuleDepot  
The placebo capsules is used to assist in the blinding process, It will allow that two capsules to 
be given as one of the randomized study drug is one drug Levothyroxine alone. The placebo will 
make the number of capsules (2) the same dose Levothyroxine an d Lithothyroxine dose 
combination        
 
8.2 Study Dosing Group  
In this study,  Levothyroxine  (LT4) and placebo (a look -alike inactive substance, a “sugar pill”) 
will be compared to Liothyronine/levothyroxine (LT3/LT4) combination therapy.  Levothyroxine 
(LT4) and Liothyronine ( LT3) are drugs approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA).  
 
There will be thirty  (30) subjects enrolled into the study. They will be randomly assigned 1:1 into 
one of two study -dosing groups : 
Table 3:  Randomization Dosing Table  
 Study Group  Number of Subjects  
LT4 group  + Placebo  Fifteen Subjects  
LT4/LT3 group  Fifteen Subjects  
 
8.3 Dosage and administration  
Study Dosing   
 
Patients in the LT4 group will be started at a dose of 1.6 mcg/Kg (52), while patients assigned to 
LT4/LT3 group will have 25 mcg of LT4 substituted with 5 mcg LT3 twice daily, to mimic the 
average daily T3 production form the thyroid (36). For p atient s taking oral Semaglutide the initial 
levothyroxine dose will be reduced to 1.2 mcg/Kg ( -25 mcg in case of randomization to the 
levothyroxine/liothyronine group)  to correct for increase in absorption. The VCU Investigational 
Pharmacy will over -encapsulate LT4 plus placebo, or LT4 plus 5 mcg LT3 in “AM” and “PM” 
color coded capsules. Patients will be instructed to take the AM drug first thing in the morning 
with water only, and to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medications coffee or 
breakfast. The PM dose will be taken at least 30 minutes before dinner. Dose adjustments will 
be performed at the 6 -week and 3 -month follow up visits by an unblinded endocrinologist (Dr.  
Madan ) aiming to achieve and maintain a target TSH within the normal range and withi n ± 0.5 
mcIU/ml from the baseline (pre -surgery) TSH, according to the scheme in Table 1. Doses will be 
rounded to the nearest available formulation. No changes will be made in LT3.  
34 
 Patients and their healthcare providers will be encouraged to inform the study team of any 
change in medications. An information card containing a basic description of the protocol, study 
medications, and contact information of the PI and study coordinator  will be given to the study . 
participants with instructions to show it at any encounter with healthcare providers for the 
duration of the study.  
 
 
 
Table 4: Dose Adjustment Table  
 
9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
STUDY VISIT PROCEDURES  
 
 
 
The entire protocol consists of  five visits: one screening visit, one baseline visit, one dose 
adjustment visit, and three inpatient overnight admissions  (referred as “phenotyping visits ”). The 
follow up study visits will occur in a +/ - 7-day window.  Study participants will be admitted for 
their baseline phenotyping visit before surgery. Randomization will be performed at the time of 
the baseline visit. On discharge from the hospital,  (postoperative day 1 or 2) patients  will start 
the study drugs. An outpatient visit for dose adjustment will occur six weeks following surgery. 
Three months after surge ry, patients will have a second overnight phenotyping visit and therapy 
adjustment. A third phenotyping visit (end of study) will be performed six months after surgery. 
The overnight phenotyping visits will be identical, except no DXA scan will be performe d at 
baseline and during the 6-month post -op visit.  
The summary of the procedures is presented in the table 2 (study scheme)  

35 
 9.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to performing any study -related procedures, the patient must sign and date an Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) -approved informed consent form (ICF).  The informed consent process 
must be thoroughly documented in the patient’s record.  
9.2 Medical History:   
The following information will be gathered from the patient and from the review of the medical 
records:  
• Age 
• Self-reported race/ethnicity  
• Medical History  
• Prior history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  
• Prior surgical history  
• Social history (use of tobacco or alcohol ) 
• History of Medication usage  
• Female subjects will be asked to provide a menstrual history,  
o use of contraception, and  
o self-reported pregnancy status planning for the study period.  
 
9.3 Physical Examination  
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed,  and the following organ systems will be 
evaluated:  
• Vital signs : oral temperature and blood pressure  
• Neurological exam: focal deficit, resting tremor, reflexes  
• Lungs: sounds  
• Cardiovascular: rate, rhythm, murmur, peripheral pulses  
• Abdomen: tenderness, organomegaly  
 
9.4 Energy Expenditure  Recordings   
Each of the three phenotyping visits will include a n up to  24-hour recording of energy 
expenditure in the whole room calorimeter. The room calorimeter is a 10’ x 10’ x7’6” room with a 
window and transparent plexiglass wall. The room is fitted with TV, phone, hospital bed, small 
desk, a toilet behind a privacy scr een and a vanity. Meals are passed through an air lock port. 
The room is fitted with Wi-Fi and the door has no lock. The enclosed space may cause some 
minimal discomfort and the ventilation can be n oisy, non -dissimilar to a commercial airplane. 
Study volunteers will be instructed they can step out the room and withdraw from the study at 
any time, and there is no lock in the calorimeter’s door.  Volunteers will enter the WRIC at the 
earliest at 11:00 and will receive standardized meals at 13:00  (if already entered in the WRIC) , 
and at 18:00, each representing 1/3 of the estimated EE with the following macronutrient 
composition: 50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 30% fat.  
36 
 Approximate total energy needs for weight maintenance will be calculated using the Mifflin -St. 
Jeor equation (89). EE recording will be completed at approximately 11:00 of the following day . 
 
9.5 Anthropometric data  
Height and weight will be recorded using a calibrated stadiometer. T emperature, heart rate, and 
blood pressure  will be recorded by a research nurse . 
 
9.6 Blood Collection  
Venous Blood Sample Collection  
We will insert a needle in a vein to collect blood samples at specified times . Study subjects will 
undergo one venipuncture during each of the study visits. Altogether, five blood samples will be 
collected throughout the study for a total of approximately one and a half cup of blood.  All the 
samples collected will be for the researc h study, except for the measurement of TSH that will be 
used to adjust the therapy.   We will store and analyze your samples for lipids ( cholesterol, HDL, 
triglycerides ), Thyroid stimulating Hormone TSH (determinations for dose adjustments ), Free T4 
and total T3. TPO antibodies  and HbA1c or fructosamine < 325 mcmol/l in substitution of HbA1c 
to reflect recent improvement in diabetes control (the latter for patients with diabetes) will be 
collected at the screening visit to help determine the presence of autoimmune thyroid disease 
and, limited to patients with diabetes, the control of the disease . Blood samples will be collected 
at screening, baseline (pre -surgery), 3 -month and 6 -month study visits . 
 
We will collect two 5 mL of blood will be collected in a Na -EDTA tube (purple top) at the baseline 
visit to obtain HbA1c and to extract genomic DNA. Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collected  
in SST tubes with  (no additives except  serum separator ) each session  for TSH, thyroid hormones 
(total T3 and free T4), serum lipids and storage .  No more than 320 mL  of blood will be collected 
over the course of the five sessions. Serum will be separated by centrifugation, aliquoted in 1 mL  
cryovials  and stored in -80⁰C freezers  in the Department of Endocrine  laboratory in Sanger Hall. 
Samples will be stored as described above for future analyses for studies . The  Thr92Ala D2 
polymorphism will  be analyzed in the Department of Endocrine laboratory. Dr. Ni will supervise 
the p erformance of these analyses.  
9.7 Accel erometers  
 The accelerometers are s ensing devices that measure a moving object's acceleration and can 
detect frequency and intensity of human  movement . They are very similar to “ Fitbit ” or other 
exercise recording devices.   Maybe done depending upon availability  
 
9.8 Genetic Material  
 
Genetic material will be collected during the study to study whether common gene variations 
called “Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms” (SNPs) in gene that regulate the thyroid hormone 
37 
 signaling affect the response to the therapy. We do not plan to screen for genetic disease, and 
the information collected are without clinical interest, thus the information will not be provided to 
the volunteers. No genome wide association study will be p erformed, and the genetic material 
will be disposed of at the end of the study. Study volunteers can opt out the collection of genetic 
material.  
 
9.9 Quality of Life assessment  
 
Study participants will be administered ThyPRO -39, a thyroid specific quality of life instrument 
at the baseline (pre -surgery), 3 -month and 6 -month visit. This questionnaire helps the 
researchers to measure the intensity of the symptoms associated with hyp othyroidism, and their 
changes in relation to the therapy. Some individual may experience discomfort by gaining 
introspection in their condition .  
 
9.10 DXA Scan (D ual-energy x -ray Absorptiometry):  
DXA  stands for dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry  (also known as a  DEXA scan ). A simple, 10 -
minute test  takes a comprehensive snapshot of your exact breakdown of bone, fat tissue, and 
muscle mass. The  DXA scan  is the most accurate and precise  body  fat test available.  There are 
not any special preparations needed, except to stop taking any calcium supplements for 24 
hours before the test. Study participants are requested to lay still on a table while a sensor 
(similar to an X -ray machine) moves over  the body from the head to the feet. Wear comfortable 
clothing. Study volunteers will undergo (DXA scan) at the baseline and six -month visits. The 
only potential risk associated with DXA scan is the exposure to radioactivity.  
 
 
9.11 Echocardiogram (echo)  
An echocardiogram will be performed at the baseline , three and six -month visits  to assess the 
myocardial structure and ejection fraction .

10.7 End of study Treatment  
At the end of the trial the subjects care will be transferred to their endocrinologist or primary 
care provider. We will prescribe three -month supply of the levothyroxine or levothyroxine -
42 
 liothyronine combination therapy, based on the subject’s preference since both drugs are 
approved for the treatment of hypothyroidism. The subjects insurance will be responsible for 
the cost of the prescription since the study is completed.  
 
 
11     STUDY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
11.1 Recruitment                                                                                      
11.1.1      Recruitment of Women, children and minority individuals study   
In this  study , we will recruit exclusively adult women and men (age > 21). This choice is  
driven by scientific reasons because the prevalence of hypothyroidism is highest in the adult  
population. The study design precludes the recruitment of children since the differences in the  
biomarkers between adults and children would impede the interpretation of the data collected.  
Furthermore, since this proof -of-principle study the participation of minors in the study would  
provide little additional information. We expect an overrepresentation of women in the study,  
reflecting the higher prevalence of hypothyroidism in females. We will encourage the  
recruitment of minorities, and the ethnic composition of the accrual table reflect the population  
attending the outpatient clinics of Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center.  
 
11.1.2      Recruitment and retention plan  
The recruitment will be primarily performed from patients undergoing evaluation in the 
multidisciplinary thyroid neoplasia clinic and through ENT at Virginia Commonwealth University, 
but the study information will be disseminated among local endocrinologists , and self -referral 
will be allowed. Additionally, the study will be disseminated through Adult Endocrinologists and 
Surgeons performing thyroidectomy at VCU (ENT and Endocrine Surgeons) will be made aware 
of the study hypothesis, design, and potential b enefits for the participants.  
 
11.2 Retention                                                                                     
Study participants will not receive compensation, but the study visits, including  TSH assay for 
therapy adjustment will be performed free of charge. Additionally, the study medications will be 
dispended free of charge for the duration of the study (six months). Patients will be provided 
with meal and parking coupons for the study visit s. Patients will also be informed of the results 
of their phenotype studies, including body composition, energy expenditure, and 
echocardiogram. These benefits should provide sufficient incentive to assure retention of the 
study participants.  
43 
 12     DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP):  
The research team will develop a complete DSMP  for review by the NIH. The PI,  Dr. Angeliki 
Stamatouli , a physician board -certified Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, and Internal 
Medicine will assume responsibility to ensuring the overall safety of protocol participants.  
 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for monitoring 
the safety of participants and the data associated with the proposed study.                                   
The DSMB will be comprised of a physician, a pharmacist, and biostatistician. One member of 
the DSMB will be selected as the Committee Chair and will be responsible for generating a 
written summary of the content of each quarterly meeting. Potential advers e events will be listed 
in the IRB -approved protocol and  in the consent form. A record of adverse events will be 
retained in a study binder for review by the study team, the independent DSMB, and the IRB. 
The classification of adverse events will be as follows: 1) Mild Severity, discomforts that do not 
disrupt daily activities, or adverse events in which no therapy or only symptomatic therapy is 
required); 2) Moderate Severity (discomfort sufficient to modify normal daily activity, or adverse 
events requiring specific therapy that is more than symptomatic; 3) Se rious Severity (illness or 
injury resulting in inability to work or to perform normal daily activities, life -threatening events or 
death). All adverse events will initially be evaluated by the PI Stamatouli ), a physician who is 
board -certified in Endocrinology and Internal Medicine. Additionally , the unblinded physician 
(Madan ) and the Cardiologist (Abbate) will be available to provide insight on the severity and the 
potential association with the study drugs and dosage. Those events classified as moderate o r 
severe will be reported to DSMB Committee Chair for review within 24 hours. The entire DSMB 
will meet to review all serious adverse events, should they occur. In addition, all serious adverse 
events, both anticipated and unanticipated, will be reported t o the IRB within 48 hours (and to 
the NIH within a timeframe consistent with the policy of the institute). Additionally, a summary of 
all adverse events will be submitted to the Institution IRB annually as part of the protocol’s 
continuing review.  
13    CLINICALTRIALS.GOV REQUIREMENTS:  
This application includes a trial which requires registration in ClinicalTrials.gov. As is required, 
this trial will be registered upon approval from the institution’s IRB.  
Dissemination of study results through ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting at a minimum 
will include the following components: The Principle Investigator (PI) will be responsible for 
ensuring compliance with ClinicalTrials.gov requirements for this project. The PI or his/her 
designee will register the trial prior to enrolling the first subject. Once a record is established, the 
PI will confirm accuracy of r ecord content; resolve problems; and maintain records including 
content update and modificat ions. The PI will also be responsible for aggregate results reporting 
and Adverse Event reporting at the conclusion of the project. I certify that this submission 
contains an Applicable Clinical Trial (ACT) and that I will ensure compliance with registrati on 
and results reporting submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov as required under the FDA Amendment 
Act of 2007 (FDAAA) and the Final Rule (42CFR Part 11).   For all clinical trials in scope of the 
Policy, the informed consent will include the FDA - required stat ement related to 
44 
 ClinicalTrials.gov: “A description of this clinical trial will be available on 
http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law.  
14    ADVERSE EVENTS  
Any adverse reaction occurring during the study either observed by the physicians or nurses or 
reported by the patient will be recorded. Anticipated adverse events that will not be reported to 
the IRB include the pain and bruise associated with needle stic k, and abnormal laboratory 
results that are found as a part of the screening blood work and lead to exclusion from the 
study, but will receive appropriate follow -up and referral to the primary care provider. Also other 
incidental serious adverse events unr elated to the study (such as trauma resulting from motor 
vehicle accidents or sport activities) will not be reported to the IRB. Serious adverse events: All 
serious adverse events related or possibly related to the research protocol, i.e. cardiovascular 
events, psychiatric events, intravenous catheter or venipuncture site infection/bleeding, and  
thrombophlebitis will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than seven days of 
death or life threatening serious adverse event or within fifteen days after the occurrence of all 
other forms of serious adverse events. A serious adverse ev ent is any adverse drug experience 
that: 1) Results in death; 2) Is life threatening; 3) Results in hospitalization or prolongs 
hospitalization; 4) Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 5) Results in 
congenital anomaly or birth def ect; 6) Results in a condition, which in the judgment of the 
investigator represents a significant hazard.  
45 
 15 ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS  AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS  
15.1 Definitions  
15.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
15.1.2  Serious AE (SAE)   
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of 
the following outcomes : 
• death, 
• a life-threatening AE (An AE is consider “life -threatening” if, in the view of the 
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. ), 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , 
• a persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
15.1.3  Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
Unanticipated problems include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria:  
• unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents , such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research ); and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
46 
 15.1.4  AE Description and Grade 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  
15.1.5  AE Expectedness  
AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’.  
Expected AEs are listed in section 8.2 below . 
Unexpe cted AEs are those AE s occurring in one or more subjects participating in 
the research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent 
with either:  
• The known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved 
in the research that are described in (a) the protocol -related document, such as 
the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and 
the current IRB -approved informed consent document, and other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
• The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or 
condition of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing 
risk factor profile for the AE.  
15.1.6  AE Attribution  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
15.2 Known AEs List 
Table 3: Known AEs/Risks.  
Research -related risks in this study include those associated with study procedures, namely 
blood drawing, study medications, radiation exposure, and dissemination of PHI, including 
genetic data . 
No significant risk can be expected from the whole room indirect calorimeter, echocardiogram . 
Some individuals may experience anxiety during the stay in the indirect calorimeter. Potential 
additional risks are associated with the collection of genetic material and the possible 
47 
 infringement of the study participants’ privacy with dissemination of protected health 
information (PHI).

(dermatitis) from the electrodes.   
DXA Scan  A  low dose of X -ray radiation comparable to 1/10 of the radiation from a 
chest x -ray.   
Blood collection  There may be pain at the site where the catheter is inserted, and some 
bruising and very rarely infection may occur. Some people may 
experience nausea or faint when the catheter is inserted or when they see 
blood. Bandages used to cover the catheter site may cause a skin rash 
(dermatitis) in some people who are allergic or sensitive to adhesive or 
latex  
Quality of Life (QoL) 
questionnaires  Participants  may experience some emotional discomfort as they assess 
their perceived quality of life  
Genetic Risk   Infringement of the study participants’ privacy with dissemination of 
protected health information (PHI).   Breech of confidentiality  
 
Pregnancy:  Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a patient will be withdrawn from 
the study if a pregnancy occurs and the visit will be completed. The pregnancy must be 
immediately reported to the Principle investigator. Additional follow -up may be required.  
15.3 Time Period and Grade of AE Capture  
Collection of AEs will start immediately following signing of the ICF and will continue 
throughout the study.  Illnesses present before the patient signs the informed consent form 
(ICF) are considered pre -existing conditions and are documented on the medic al history 
worksheet  and in the Case Report Form .  Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the 
study are entered on the AE case report form.

15.4 Procedures for Recording AEs, SAEs, and U ps 
All AEs will be documented on the AE case report form and in the patient’s medical record.  
The following attributes must be assigned:  (1) description, (2) dates of onset and 
resolution, (3) severity , (4) “serious” criteria if applicable, and (5) action taken.  The 
investigator will actively solicit this information and assess the AEs in terms of severity and 
relationship to the study.  The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required until 
the AE either resolves or becomes medically stable.  The treatment may extend beyond 
the duration of the study.  The investigator will record treatment and medications required 
for treatment on the appropriate CRF(s).  
In the event that a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the event must 
be recorded on the Termination CRF as the reason for discontinuation.  
All serious adverse events related or possibly related to the research protocol, i.e.  
cardiovascular events, psychiatric events, intravenous catheter or venipuncture site 
infection/bleeding, and thrombophlebitis will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, 
but no later than seven days of death or life threatening serious adverse event o r within 
fifteen days after the occurrence of all other forms of serious adverse events.  
 
51 
 15.5 Routine Reporting Procedures for AEs  
Each event will be reported  to the Principle Investigator  once  becoming aware of the 
occurrence. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, 
until the event is otherwise explained, whichever occurs first.  All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit/contact and designated a s ongoing, will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts, where the designation may remain ongoing.  The investigator 
will ensure that the follow -up includes any supplemental investigation as may be indicated 
to elucidate  at the nature and/or causality of  the SAE. This may include additional 
laboratory test or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation  with other 
health care professionals. SAEs that are ongoing at the time of the subjects final study 
visit/contact will be documented as ongoing.

15.7 Resource sharing plan  
  
The data generated by this proof -of-principle proposal will be limited due to the small 
number of patient recruited, and by the exploratory nature of the investigation. Nonetheless, 
the information gathered may be of use to other investigators who are invo lved in thyroid 
pathophysiology or in the development of efficacy/effectiveness trials.  
In accordance to the new Rigor and Reproducibility guidelines, we will clearly describes the 
experimental protocols in the material and methods section of the publications and maintain 
a clear and readily accessible documentation of the experimental proced ures. Any research 
resources developed through this proposal will be made readily available for research 
purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community in accordance with the NIH 
Grants Policy Statement and the Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research 
Grants and Contracts on Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources. 
Virginia Commonwealth University (Technology transfer office) has established policies for 
Material Transfer Agreements that identify what int ellectual property rights will be retained 
by the University to distributed resources.

Informed consent is a n ongoing process  that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to 
participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. 
Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the 
subjects and their families. Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/
products, study procedures, and risks are given to the subject and written documentation 
of informed consent is required prior to starting intervent ion/administering study product. 
Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the subject will be asked to read and review the 
document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the research study to 
the subject and answer any questions that ma y arise. The subject will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The 
subjects should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think 
about it prior to agreeing to participa te. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time 
throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to 
the subjects for their records. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by 
emphasizing to them t hat the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if 
they decline to participate in this study.  
54 
 16.5 Subject Confidentiality  and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators  and their 
staff. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to participating subjects, 
as well as any genetic or biological testing . 
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in 
strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the principal investigator . 
The principal investigator  will allow access to all source data and documents for the 
purposes of monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections .  
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the principal investigator may 
inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including 
but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the 
subjects in this study. The clinical study site will permit access  to such records.

 17 DATA HANDLING  AND  RECORD KEEPING  
17.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
The principal investigator is responsible for: (i) the overall conduct of the investigation; (ii) 
ongoing review of trial data including all safety reports; and (iii) apprising participating sites 
of any UPs.  
Any laboratory conducting correlative studies must maintain the laboratory records and 
documentation (laboratory notebooks, laboratory protocols, print -outs, recordings, 
photographs, etc.).  
17.2 Source Documents  
Paper based source documents will be kept in secure location and only accessed by 
authorized study personnel.  Electronic records will be made available only to those 
personnel in the study through the use of access controls and encryption.  Identifiers wi ll 
be removed from study -related data (data is coded with a key and stored in a separate and 
secure location).  
17.3 Case Report Forms   
Patient information will be collected and documented in paper based case report forms. All 
hand written entries on the case report forms (CRFs) should be made legibly in black ink. 
Errors, when made, should be corrected by drawing a single line through the incorrect 
entry (do not erase, white -out, or tape over errors) and then entering the correct data 
above the original entry. Entry corrections should be initialed and dated. Explain miss ing 
data with “ND” for “not determined ” and “NA” used for “not applicable.”  
17.4 Study Record Retention  
As applicable, s tudy records will be maintained a minimum of 5 years beyond: (i) the 
publication  of any abstract or manuscript reporting the results of the protocol ; (2) the 
submission of any sponsored research final report; or (iii) submission of a final report to 
clinicaltrials.gov.  Those patients who consent to be a part of the data registry will have all 
personal identifiers kept indefinitely. Information in the databases will only be accessible to 
individuals working on the study or VCU/VCUHS officials  who have access for specific 
research -related tasks.

 1 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION     
  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including Levo -T, either alone or with other therapeutic 
agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss.  
In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are 
ineffective for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of 
toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines 
such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug 
Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage (10)] .  
  
  
  
1.1 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism  
  
LEVO -T is indicated as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary 
(pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.  
  
1.2 Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression  
LEVO -T is indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the 
management of thyrotropin -dependent well -differentiated thyroid cancer.  
  
Limitations of Use:   
• LEVO -T is not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules and 
nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no clinical 
benefits and overtreatment with LEVO -T may induce hyperthyroidism [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  
  
• LEVO -T is not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery 
phase of subacute thyroiditis.  
  
1.3 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
  
1.3.1  2.1 General Administration Information  
Take LEVO -T with a full glass of water as the tablet may rapidly disintegrate .  
  
Administer LEVO -T as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one -half to one hour 
before breakfast.  
 
 
 
 
 
69 
  
 Administer LEVO -T at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with 
LEVO -T absorption [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .   
  
Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour 
of certain foods that may affect LEVO -T absorption [see Drug Interactions (7.9) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  
  
Administer LEVO -T to infants and children who cannot swallow intact tablets by 
crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL 
or 1 to 2 teaspoons) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon 
or dropper. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease 
absorption of LEVO -T, such as soybeanbased infant formula [see Drug Interactions 
(7.9)] .  
  
1.3.2  2.2 General Principles of Dosing  
The dose of LEVO -T for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a 
variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, 
concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co -
administe red food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7)] . 
Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made 
based on pe riodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .  
  
The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of LEVO -T may not be attained for 4 to 6 
weeks.  
  
2.3 Dosing in Specific Patient Populations  
1.3.3  Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are 
Complete  
Start LEVO -T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly individuals 
who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average 
full replacement dose of LEVO -T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example : 
100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).  
  
Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is 
clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg 
per day are seldom  required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 
300 mcg per day is rare and may  indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug 
interactions, or a combination of these factors.  
  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 
12.5 to 25 mcg per day.  Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the 
patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full 
replacem ent dose of LEVO -T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly 
patients.  
  
 
70 
 In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg 
per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the 
patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.  
  
1.3.4  Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Start LEVO -T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly individuals. 
Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular 
disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. 
Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO -T dose adequacy in patients with 
secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use 
the serum free -T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. 
Titrate LEVO -T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and 
the serum free -T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.  
  
1.3.5  Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism   
The recommended daily dose of LEVO -T in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is 
based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start LEVO -T at 
the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns 
(0-3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see 
below). Monitor for   clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.4)].

6-12 years  4-5 mcg/kg/day  
Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty 
incomplete  2-3 mcg/kg/day  
Growth and puberty complete  1.6 mcg/kg/day  
a. The dose should be adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Newborns (0 -3 months) at risk for cardiac failure : Consider a lower starting dose in 
newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed 
based on clinical and laboratory response.  
  
Children at risk for hyperactivity : To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at 
one- fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by 
one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended 
replacement dose is reached.  
  
1.4.1  Pregnancy  
 
71 
 Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: LEVO -T dose requirements may increase during 
pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, 
at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy.  In patients with primary 
hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester -speci fic reference range. For 
patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester - specific range, increase the dose 
of LEVO -T by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable 
LEVO -T dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimesters pecific range. 
Reduce LEVO -T dosage to pre -pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and  
measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure LEVO -T dose is 
appropriate.  
  
New Onset Hypothyroidism : Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible.    In 
patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start LEVO -T 
at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day).  In patients with mild 
hypothyroidism (TSH < 1 0 IU per liter) start LEVO -T at 1.0 mcg per kg body weight per 
day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4   
weeks and adjust LEVO -T dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester 
specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .  
  
1.4.2  TSH Suppression in Well -differentiated Thyroid Cancer  
Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO -
T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high -risk tumors, 
the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.  
  
5.2.2.1  2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an 
apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO -T may be evidence of inadequate 
absorptio n, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.  
  
1.4.3  Adults  
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an 
interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and 
appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 
12 months an d whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status.  
  
1.4.4  Pediatrics  
In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement 
therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free -T4. Monitor TSH and total or 
free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks 
after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose 
stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may 
necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including 
assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at 
regular intervals.  
  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in 
some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -thyroid feedback. 
Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the  
72 
 normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO -T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to 
decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving 
adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method 
of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO -T [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .  
  
1.4.5  Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Monitor serum free -T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in 
these patients.

1.6 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
  
LEVO -T is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].  
  
1.7 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
  
1.7.1  5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying 
Cardiovascular Disease  
Over -treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall 
thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, 
particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients.  Initiate 
LEVO -T therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger 
individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), 
Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] .  
  
73 
 Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary 
artery disease receiving suppressive LEVO -T therapy. Monitor patients receiving 
concomitant  LEVOT and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary 
insufficie ncy.  
  
If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the LEVO -T dose or withhold for one 
week and restart at a lower dose.  
  
1.7.2  5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium 
from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not 
recomme nded to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products 
formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.  
  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency 
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid  
hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute 
adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal 
insufficiency with replacement  glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with LEVO -T 
[see Contraindications (4)].  
  
5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism 
LEVO -T has a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment with LEVO -T may  
 have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone 
metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal 
functio n, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of LEVO -T carefully and 
monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.4)] . Monitor fo r the presence of drug or food interactions when using LEVO -T and 
adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.9) and Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)] .  
  
1.7.3  5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen 
glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing LEVO -T 
[see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .  
  
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -
Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may 
occur as a result of levothyroxine over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal 
women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels 
and urinary excretion o f calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline 
phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the 
minimum dose of LEVO -T that achieves the  desired clinical and biochemical response 
to mitigate this risk.  
 
 
74 
 1.8 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
  
Adverse reactions associated with LEVO -T therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , 
Overdosage (10)] . They include the following:  
• General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive 
sweating  
• Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, 
emotional lability, insomnia  
• Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, muscle spasm  
• Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood 
pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
1.8.1  •   Respiratory: dyspnea  
• Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function 
tests  
• Dermatologic: hair loss, flushing, rash  
• Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density  
• Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility  
  
Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.  
  
1.9 Adverse Reactions in Children  
Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in 
children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis 
in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant 
compromised adult height.  
  
1.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with 
thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, 
angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness, and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to 
levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.  
  
1.11 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
  
1.11.1  7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
(e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue 
response) and may alter the therapeutic response to LEVO -T (see Tables 2 -5 below).  
 
 
 
 
75 
 Table 2. Drugs That May Decrease T4 Absorption (Hypothyroidism)  
Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of LEVO -T by binding and 
delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Calcium Carbonate  Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with  
Ferrous Sulfate  levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric - 
thyroxine complex. Administer LEVO -T at least 4 hours apart 
from these agents.  
Orlistat  Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and LEVO -
T for changes in thyroid function.  
Bile Acid Sequestrants  
-Colesevelam  
-Cholestyramine  
-Colestipol  
Ion Exchange Resins  
-Kayexalate  
-Sevelamer  Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to 
decrease levothyroxine absorption. Administer LEVO -T at 
least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels.  
Other drugs:  Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for adequate  
Proton Pump Inhibitors  absorption of levothyroxine. Sucralfate, antacids and proton  
Sucralfate  pump inhibitors may cause hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric  
Antacids  pH, and reduce levothyroxine absorption. Monitor patients  
- Aluminum & Magnesium  
Hydroxides  
- Simethicone  appropriately.  
  
Table 3. Drugs That May Alter T4 and Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport 
Without  
Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism)  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Clofibrate  
Estrogen -containing oral 
contraceptives 
Estrogens (oral)  
Heroin / Methadone  
5-Fluorouracil  
Mitotane  
Tamoxifen  These drugs may increase serum thyroxine -binding globulin 
(TBG) concentration.  
Androgens / Anabolic Steroids  
Asparaginase  
Glucocorticoids  
Slow -Release Nicotinic Acid  These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration.  
 
76 
 Potential impact (below): Administration of these agents with LEVO -T results in an initial 
transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and 
normal FT4 and TSH concentrations.  
Salicylates (> 2 g/day)  Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and 
transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by 
return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic 
serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may 
decrease by as much a s 30%.  
Other drugs:  
Carbamazepine  
Furosemide (> 80 mg IV)  
Heparin  
Hydantoins  
Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory  
Drugs  
-Fenamates  
  These drugs may cause protein -binding site displacement.  
Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of 
T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increase free T4 fraction 
in serum. Furosemide competes for T4 -binding sites on TBG, 
prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can 
acutely lower the tot al T4 level. Phenytoin and 
carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of 
levothyroxine, and total and free T4 may be reduced by 20% 
to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and 
are clinically euthyroid.  
Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters.  
  
Table 4. Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of T4 (Hypothyroidism)  
Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug -metabolizing enzyme activity may 
cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased LEVO -T 
requirements.  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Phenobarbital 
Rifampin  Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to 
thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L -thyroxine metabolism by 
inducing uridine 5’ -diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 
and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid 
status may occur if bar biturates are added or withdrawn from 
patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been 
shown to accelerate the metabolism of levothyroxine.  
  
Table 5. Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3  
Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral 
conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually 
normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Beta-adrenergic antagonists  
(e.g., Propranolol > 160 mg/day)  In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (> 160 
mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, 
and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta -
adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid 
patient is co nverted to the euthyroid state.  
 
77 
 Glucocorticoids  
(e.g., Dexamethasone > 4 
mg/day)  Short -term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids 
may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal 
change in serum T4 levels. However, long -term glucocorticoid 
therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due 
to decreased TBG  production (See above).  
Other drugs: 
Amiodarone  Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine 
(T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated 
biochemical changes (increase in serum free -T4, and 
decreased or normal free -T3) in clinically euthyroid patients.  
  
7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of LEVO -T therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic 
control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully 
monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or 
discon tinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  
  
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
LEVO -T increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in 
the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or 
when the LEVO -T dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit 
appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
LEVO -T may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis 
glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, 
necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) 
antidepressants and LEVO -T may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both 
drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects 
may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system 
stimulation. LEVO -T may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of 
sertraline in patients stabilized on LEVO -T may result in increased LEVO -T 
requirements.  
  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and LEVO -T may produce marked hypertension and 
tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.  
  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and LEVO -T may increase the effects of 
sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of 
coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with 
coronary artery di sease.  
 
 
78 
 7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause 
hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
  
7.9 Drug -Food Interactions  
Consumption of certain foods may affect LEVO -T absorption thereby necessitating 
adjustments in dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Soybean flour, 
cottonseed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of 
LEVO -T from the gastrointestinal tract. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of 
levothyroxine and reduce its bioavailability.  
  
7.10 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure 
and evaluate unbound (free) hormone and/or determine the free -T4 index (FT4I) in this 
circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen -containing oral 
contr aceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentration. 
Nephrosis, severe  
hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens, and corticosteroids 
decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper - or hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias 
have been described,  with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
  
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
            8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary  
  
Experience with levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -
marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or 
miscarriages [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with 
untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during 
pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and LEVO -T dosage adjusted during pregnancy 
[see Clinical Considerations] . There are no animal studies conducted with levothyroxine 
during pregnancy. LEVO -T should  not be discontinued during pregnancy and 
hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.  
  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of 
major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 
15 to 20%, respectively.  
  
Clinical Considerations  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
79 
 Disease -Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk  
Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of 
complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -
eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may 
have an adverse e ffect on fetal neurocognitive development.  
  
Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period  
Pregnancy may increase LEVO -T requirements. Serum TSH levels should be 
monitored and the LEVO -T dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH 
levels are similar to preconception values, the LEVO -T dosage should return to the pre -
pregnancy dose imm ediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  
  
Data  
  
Human Data  
Levothyroxine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. There 
is a long experience of levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -
marketing studies that have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, 
miscarriages or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with levothyroxine 
use in pregnant women.  
  
8.2 Lactation  
Risk Summary  
  
Limited published studies report that levothyroxine is present in human milk. However, 
there is insufficient information to determine the effects of Levothyroxine on the 
breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of levothyroxine on milk 
production. Adequate levothyroxine treatment during lactation may normalize milk 
production in hypothyroid lactating mothers. The developmental and health benefits of 
breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for LEVO -T 
and a ny potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LEVO -T or from the 
underlying maternal condition.  
  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of LEVO -T varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are 
based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] .  
  
In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been 
established, discontinue LEVO -T administration for a trial period, but only after the child 
is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, 
and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and 
treatment, if warranted.  
  
Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]  
 
 
80 
 Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the 
adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on 
overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate LEVO -T therapy immediatel y 
upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.  
  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of LEVO -T therapy for cardiac overload, 
arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.  
  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment 
may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. 
Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the 
tempo of br ain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature 
epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
  
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients   
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment 
may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed 
mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age 
and result in  premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in 
some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged 
hypothyroidism, catch -up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.  
  
8.5 Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, 
initiate LEVOT at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.1) and Dosage and  
Administration (2.3)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is 
the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the 
elderly.  
  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings 
and  
Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . In addition, confusion and disorientation 
may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Seizures 
occurred in a 3 -year old child ingesting 3.6 mg of levothyroxine. Symptoms may not 
necessarily be evident or may not appear until  several days after ingestion of 
levothyroxine sodium.  
  
Reduce the LEVO -T dose or discontinue temporarily if signs or symptoms of 
overdosage occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by the patient’s 
medical status.  
  
For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the 
National Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 or  www.poison.org.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription 
and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell 
nucleus and  bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nucle ar 
receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and 
cytoplasmic proteins.  
  
The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the 
majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral 
tissues.  
  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic 
effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is 
present.  
  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
  
Absorption   
Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 
80%. The majority of the LEVO -T dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. 
The relative bioavailability of LEVO -T tablets, compared to an equal nominal dose of 
oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 99%. T4 absorption is increased by 
fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as 
soybeans. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T4. Absorption may also decrease 
with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T4 absorption [see Drug Interactions 
(7)].  
  
Distribution   
Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including 
thyroxine -binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine -binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin 
(TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of 
both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic 
clearance, and longer half -life of T4 compared to T3. Protein -bound thyroid hormones 
exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound 
hormone i s metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the 
binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Thyroid 
hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations 
(8.1)] .  
  
83 
 1.11.2  Elimination  
Metabolism  
T4 is slowly eliminated (see Table 7). The major pathway of thyroid hormone 
metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is 
derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of 
degradation for  both T4 and T3, with T4 deiodination also occurring at a number of 
additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily 
dose of T4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and 
rT3 are further  deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized 
via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and 
gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation.  
  
Excretion  
Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. Approximately 
20% of T4 is eliminated in the stool. Urinary excretion of T4 decreases with age.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Inform the patient of the following 
information to aid in the safe and effective use of  
  
LEVO -T:  
  
Dosing and Administration  
  
• Instruct patients that LEVO -T should be taken with a full glass of water since the 
tablet may rapidly disintegrate.  
• Instruct patients to take LEVO -T only as directed by their healthcare provider.  
• Instruct patients to take LEVO -T as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, 
one-half to one hour before breakfast.  
• Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can 
decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take LEVO -T 
tablets within 4 hours of these agents.  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or 
breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant while taking LEVO -T.  
  
Important Information  
  
85 
 • Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in 
symptoms.  
• Inform patients that the levothyroxine in LEVO -T is intended to replace a hormone 
that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to 
be taken for life.  
• Inform patients that LEVO -T should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy 
in a weight control program.  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other 
medications, including prescription and over -the-counter preparations.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician of any other medical conditions they may 
have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary 
gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions 
may need to be adjusted while they are taking LEVO -T. If they have diabetes, 
instruct patients to monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by 
their physician and immediately report any changes to their physician. If patients 
are taking  anticoagulants, their clotting status should be checked frequently.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist that they are taking LEVO -T prior 
to any surgery.  
  
Adverse Reactions  
  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the 
following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in 
appeti te, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat 
intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other 
unusual medical event.  
• Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of 
LEVO -T therapy, but this is usually temporary.

 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine sodium tablets, either alone or with other 
therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss.  
In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective 
for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, 
particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for 
their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage 
(10)] . 
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
Hypothyroidism:  Levothyroxine sodium tablets are indicated as a replacement therapy in 
primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired 
hypothyroidism.  
Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression: Levothyroxine sodium 
tablets are indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of 
thyrotropindependent well -differentiated thyroid cancer.  
Limitations of Use:  
• Levothyroxine sodium tablets are not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules 
and nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no clinical benefits and 
overtreatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets may induce hyperthyroid ism [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  
• Levothyroxine sodium tablets are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the 
recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.  
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
2.1 General Administration Information  
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one -half 
to one hour before breakfast.  
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere 
with levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 
Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of 
certain foods that may affect levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption [see Drug Interactions 
(7.9)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets to infants and children who cannot swallow intact 
tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 
mL or 1 to 2 teaspoons) of water and immediately administering the su spension by spoon or 
dropper. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets, such as soybean -based infant formula [see Drug Interactions (7.9)] . 
2.2 General Principles of Dosing  
90 
 The dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a 
variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical 
conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant med ications, co -administered food and the specific 
nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions 
(5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose 
adjust ments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 
The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may not be attained for 4 to 
6 weeks.  
2.3 Dosing in Specific Patient Populations  
2 PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM IN ADULTS AND IN ADOLESCENTS IN WHOM GROWTH AND 
PUBERTY ARE COMPLETE  
Start levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly 
individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full 
replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets is appro ximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for 
example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).  
Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid 
and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An 
inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor 
compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per 
day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the 
serum TSH returns to normal. The full replaceme nt dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may be less 
than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.  
In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. 
Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid 
and the serum TSH level is normalized.  
3 SECONDARY OR TERTIARY HYPOTHYROIDISM  
Start levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly 
individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease 
or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable 
measure of levothyroxine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary 
hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free -T4 level to monitor 
adequacy of therap y in this patient population. Titrate levothyroxine sodium tablets dosing per above 
instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free -T4 level is restored to the upper 
half of the normal range.  
4 PEDIATRIC DOSAGE -CONGENITAL OR ACQUIRED HYPOTHYROIDISM  
The recommended daily dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets in pediatric patients 
with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in 
Table 1. Start  
91 
  
levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower 
starting dose in newborns (0 -3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for 
hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory r esponse [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4)].  
5 TABLE 1. LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM TABLETS DOSING 
GUIDELINES FOR PEDIATRIC HYPOTHYROIDISM  
 
* The dose should be adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 
5.1 Newborns (0 -3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure  
Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 
to 6 
weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.  
5.2 Children at Risk for Hyperactivity  
To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one -fourth the recommended full 
replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one -fourth the full recommended 
replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.  
5.3 Pregnancy  
Pre-Existing Hypothyroidism  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure 
serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each 
trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH i n the 
trimester -specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester -
specific range, increase the dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and 
measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable levothyroxine sodium table ts dose is reached and 
serum TSH is within the normal trimester -specific range. Reduce levothyroxine sodium tablets 
dosage to pre -pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 
8 weeks postpartum to ensure levothyroxine sodiu m tablets dose is appropriate.

 Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs 
and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full replacement 
dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothy roidism (TSH < 10 
IU per liter) start levothyroxine sodium tablets at 1.0 mcg per kg body weight per day. 
Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage until a 
serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see U se in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 
5.4 TSH Suppression in Well -Differentiated Thyroid Cancer  
Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a levothyroxine 
sodium tablets dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high -risk 
tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.  
2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent 
adequate replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may be evidence o f inadequate 
absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.  
5.5 Adults  
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 
to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement 
dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is 
a change in the patient’s clinical status.  
5.6 Pediatrics  
In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by 
measuring both serum TSH and total or free -T4. Monitor TSH and total or free -T4 in children as 
follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after  any change in dosage, and 
then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor 
compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine 
clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and 
bone maturation, at regular intervals.  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize 
in some patients due to in utero  hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -thyroid feedback. 
Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of 
initiation of  
levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter 
within  
4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, 
dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose 
of levothyroxine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific 
Populations (8.4)] . 
5.7 Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Monitor serum free -T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these 
patients.

Levothyroxine sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal 
insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
94 
 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying 
CardiovascularDisease  
Over -treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and 
cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with 
cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate levot hyroxine sodium tablets therapy in this 
population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without 
cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . 
Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease 
receiving suppressive levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant 
levothyroxine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents f or signs and symptoms of coronary 
insufficiency.  
If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose or withhold for 
one week and restart at a lower dose.  
5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recomme nded to treat 
myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to 
treat myxedema coma.  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency  
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone 
therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with 
adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal i nsufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to 
initiating treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4)].  
5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment with 
levothyroxine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular 
function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function , emotional state, 
gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of levothyroxine sodium 
tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4)] . Monitor for the prese nce of drug or food interactions when using levothyroxine 
sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.9) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and 
result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after 
starting, changing, or discontinuing levothyroxine  sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . 
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -Replacement  
Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine 
over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal women.  The increased bone resorption may be 
associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and  phosphorous, 
95 
 elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. 
Administer the minimum dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical 
and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.  
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Overdosage 
(10)]. They include the following:  
• General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive 
sweating  
• Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional 
lability, insomnia  
• Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, muscle spasm  
• Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, 
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
 • Respiratory: dyspnea  
• Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests  
• Dermatologic: hair loss, flushing, rash  
• Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density  
• Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility  
Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.  
Adverse Reactions in Children: Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have 
been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in 
craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant 
compromised adult height.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in 
patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, 
flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness, and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to 
levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.  
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., 
absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) 
and may alter the therapeutic response to levothyroxine sodium tablets (see Ta bles 2 -5 
below).  
 
96 
 TABLE 2. DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE T4 ABSORPTION (HYPOTHYROIDISM)  
Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine sodium tablets 
by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.  
 Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Calcium Carbonate  Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate  
Ferrous Sulfate  with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms  
a ferric -thyroxine complex. 
Administer levothyroxine sodium 
tablets at least 4 hours apart from 
these agents.  
Orlistat  Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat  
and levothyroxine sodium tablets for 
changes in thyroid function.  
Bile Acid Sequestrants Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are - Colesevelam 
known to decrease levothyroxine absorption.  
- Cholestyramine  Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 4 - Colestipol  hours 
prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels.  
Ion Exchange Resins  
- Kayexalate  
- Sevelamer  
Other Drugs:  Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for  
Proton Pump Inhibitors  adequate absorption of levothyroxine. Sucralfate,  
Sucralfate  antacids and proton pump inhibitors may cause  
Antacids  hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric pH, and reduce  
- Aluminum & Magnesium Hydroxides  levothyroxine absorption. Monitor patients  
- Simethicone  appropriately.  
  
TABLE 3. DRUGS THAT MAY ALTER T4 AND TRIIODOTHYRONINE (T3) SERUM TRANSPORT 
WITHOUT AFFECTING FREE THYROXINE (FT4) CONCENTRATION (EUTHYROIDISM)  
 
 
  
Clofibrate  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
globulin  (TBG)  concentration.  
 
 
 
 
97 
 Glucocorticoids  
Slow -Release Nicotinic Acid  
Potential impact (below): Administration of these agents with levothyroxine sodium 
tablets results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a 
decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH concentrations.  
Salicylates (> 2 g/day)  Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG  
and transthyretin. An initial increase 
in serum FT4 is followed by return of 
FT4 to normal levels with sustained 
therapeutic serum salicylate 
concentrations, although total T4 
levels may decrease by as much as 
30%.  
Other drugs:  These drugs may cause protein -binding site  
Carbamazepine Furosemide (> 80 mg IV) Heparin  displacement. Furosemide has been 
shown to inhibit  
Hydantoins  the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin,  
Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs  causing an increase free T4 fraction in serum.  
- Fenamates  Furosemide competes for T4 -binding sites on  
TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that 
a single high dose can acutely lower 
the total T4 level.  
Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce 
serum protein binding  of levothyroxine, 
and total and free T4 may be reduced by 
20% to 40%, but most patients have 
normal serum TSH levels and are 
clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor 
thyroid hormone parameters.  
  
TABLE 4. DRUGS THAT MAY ALTER HEPATIC METABOLISM OF T4 (HYPOTHYROIDISM)  
Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug -metabolizing enzyme activity 
may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased 
levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements.  
 Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Phenobarbital  Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the  
Rifampin   response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L - 
thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5’diphospho - 
98 
 glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and 
leads to a lower T4 serum levels. 
Changes in thyroid status may occur 
if barbiturates are added or 
withdrawn from patients being 
treated for hypothyroidism. 
Rifampin has been shown to 
accelerate the metabolism of 
levothyro xine.  
  
TABLE 5. DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE CONVERSION OF T4 TO T3  
Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral 
conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are 
usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.  
 Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Beta -adrenergic antagonists  In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (e.g., 
Propranolol > 160 mg/day)  (> 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH  
levels remain normal, and patients 
are clinically euthyroid. Actions of 
particular beta -adrenergic 
antagonists may be impaired when 
a hypothyroid patient is converted 
to the euthyroid state.  
Glucocorticoids  Short -term administration of large doses of (e.g., Dexamethasone 
≥ 4 mg/day)  glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3  
concentrations by 30% with minimal 
change in serum T4 levels. However, 
long -term glucocorticoid therapy may 
result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 
levels due to decreased TBG 
production (See above).  
Other drugs:  Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of  
Amiodarone  levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and  
may cause isolated biochemical 
changes (increase in serum free -T4, 
and decreased or normal freeT3) in 
clinically euthyroid patients.  
99 
 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may 
worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin 
requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is 
start ed, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets increase the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. 
Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of 
the hypothyroid state or when the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is increased. Close ly 
monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. 
Serum digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes 
euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) 
antidepressants and levothyroxine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic 
effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholam ines. 
Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system 
stimulation. Levothyroxine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. 
Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on levothyroxin e sodium tablets may 
result in increased levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements.  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and levothyroxine sodium tablets may produce marked 
hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these 
patients.  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and levothyroxine sodium tablets may increase the 
effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the 
risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to 
patients w ith coronary artery disease. insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are 
administered to patients with coronary artery disease.  
7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. 
Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
100 
  
 
 
7.9 Drug -Food Interactions  
Consumption of certain foods may affect levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption thereby 
necessitating adjustments in dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Soybean flour, 
cottonseed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets from the gastrointestinal tract. Grapefruit juice may delay 
the absorption of levothyroxine and reduce its bioavailability.  
7.10 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and 
evaluate unbound (free) hormone and/or determine the free -T4 index (FT4I) in this 
circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen -containing oral 
contr aceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentration. Nephrosis, 
severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens, and corticosteroids 
decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper - or hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias have 
been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
Experience with levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing 
studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data]. 
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in 
pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and 
levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy [see Clinical 
Considerations] . There are no animal studies conducted with levothyroxine during 
pregnancy. Levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and 
hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% 
and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical Considerations  
Disease -Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk  
101 
 Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of 
complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -eclampsia, 
stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an 
adverse e ffect on fetal neurocognitive development.  
Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period  
Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels 
should be monitored and the levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during 
pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the 
levothyroxine  sodium tablets dosage should return to the pre -pregnancy dose 
immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  
Data  
Human Data  
Levothyroxine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. There is a 
long experience of levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -
marketing studies that have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, 
misc arriages or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with levothyroxine 
use in pregnant women.  
8.2 Lactation  
Risk Summary  
Limited published studies report that levothyroxine is present in human milk. However, 
there is insufficient information to determine the effects of levothyroxine on the 
breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of levothyroxine on milk 
production. Adequate levothyroxine treatment during lactation may normalize milk 
production in hypothyroid lactating mothers. The developmental and health benefits of 
breastfeeding should be con sidered along with the mother’s clinical need for 
levothyroxine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant 
from levothyroxine sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing 
adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] . 
In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, 
discontinue levothyroxine sodium tablets administration for a trial period, but only after 
the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end  of the trial  
102 
 period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if 
warranted.  
Congenital Hypothyroidism  
[See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]  
Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of 
congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and 
maturation. Therefore, initiate levothyroxine sodium tabl ets therapy immediately upon diagnosis. 
Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy for cardiac 
overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have 
deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with 
craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of br ain maturation, and may accelerate the 
bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in 
poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult 
height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in  premature epiphyseal closure and 
compromised adult stature.  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to 
normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch -up growth may 
not be adequate to normalize adult height.  
8.5 Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate 
levothyroxine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial 
fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in 
the elderly.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5)and Adverse Reactions (6)] . In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, 
shock, coma, and death have been reported. Seizures occurred in a 3 -year -old child ingesting 3.6 mg of 
levothyroxine. Symptoms may not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after 
ingestion of levothyroxine sodium.  
Reduce the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose or discontinue temporarily if signs or 
symptoms of overdosage occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by 
the patient’s medical status.  
For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the 
National Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 or www.poison.org.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  

104 
 12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and 
protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus 
and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor 
complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytopla smic 
proteins.  
The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the 
majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral 
tissues.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same 
physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a 
deficiency is present.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 
80%. The majority of the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is absorbed from the jejunum 
and upper ileum. The relative bioavailability of levothyroxine sodium tablets, c ompared to 
an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 93%. T4 
absorption is increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by 
certain foods such as soybeans. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T4. Absorption 
may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T4 absorption [see 
Drug Interactions (7)] . 
Distribution  
Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including 
thyroxinebinding globulin (TBG), thyroxine -binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin 
(TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of bot h 
TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic 
clearance, and longer half -life of T4 compared to T3. Protein -bound thyroid hormones 
exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone 
is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of 
thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Thyroid hormones do not 
readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 
Elimination  
5.7.1 Metabolism  
105 
 T4 is slowly eliminated (see Table 7). The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is 
through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from 
peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 
and T3, with T4 deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the 
kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T4 is deio dinated to yield 
equal amounts of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and rT3 are further deiodinated to 
diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides 
and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they un dergo enterohepatic 
recirculation.  
5.7.2 Excretion  
Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. Approximately 20% 
of T4 is eliminated in the stool. Urinary excretion of T4 decreases with age.

 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION  
Inform the patient of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets : 
Dosing and Administration:  
• Instruct patients to take levothyroxine sodium tablets only as directed by their 
healthcare provider.  
• Instruct patients to take levothyroxine sodium tablets as a single dose, preferably on 
an empty stomach, one -half to one hour before breakfast.  
• Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can 
decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take levothyroxine 
sodium tablets within 4 hours of these agents.  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or 
breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant while taking levothyroxine sodium 
tablets.  
Important Information:  
• Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in 
symptoms.  
• Inform patients that the levothyroxine in levothyroxine sodium tablets is intended to 
replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, 
replacement therapy is to be taken for life.  
• Inform patients that levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or 
adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other 
medications, including prescription and over -the-counter preparations.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician of any other medical conditions they may 
have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary 
gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may 
need to be adjusted while they are taking levothyroxine sodium tablets. If they have 
diabetes, instruct patients to monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as 
directed by their physician and immediately report any  
 
 
 
 
 
109 
 changes to their physician. If patients are taking anticoagulants, their clotting status 
should be checked frequently.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist that they are taking levothyroxine 
sodium tablets prior to any surgery.  
Adverse Reactions:  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the 
following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg 
cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appeti te, 
weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, 
changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.  
• Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy, but this is usually temporary.

HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
These highlights do not include all the information needed to use LEVOTHYROXINE 
SODIUM TABLETS safely and effectively. See full prescribing information for 
LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM TABLETS.  
LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM tablets, for oral use  
Initial U.S. Approval: 2002  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning   
• Thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be used for 
the treatment ofobesity or for weight loss.  
• Doses beyond the range of daily hormonal requirements may produce serious or 
even life threateningmanifestations of toxicity (6, 10).  
 
Levothyroxine sodium tablets is L -thyroxine (T4) indicated for:  
• Hypothyroidism: As replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary) 
and tertiary (hypothalamic)congenital or acquired hypothyroidism. (1)  
• Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression: As an 
adjunct to surgery and radioiodinetherapy in the management of thyrotropin -dependent 
well -differentiated thyroid cancer. (1) Limitations of Use:   
- Not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules and nontoxic diffuse 
goiter in iodine -sufficient patients. - Not indicated for treatment of 
hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. (1)  
 
• Administer once daily, preferably on an empty stomach, one -half to one hour before 
breakfast. (2.1)  
• Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with 
absorption. (2.1)  
• Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of 
certain foods that may affectabsorption. (2.1)  
 
 
148 
 • Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular 
status and concomitantmedications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4 -6 
weeks. (2.2)  
• See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. (2.3)  
• Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as 
clinical status. (2.4) (2)  
 
• Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular 
disease:  Initiate levothyroxine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose 
because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation. (2.3, 
5.1, 8.5)  
• Myxedema coma:  Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (5.2)  
• Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency:  Treat with replacement glucocorticoids 
prior to initiation of levothyroxine sodium tablets treatment. (5.3)  
• Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism:  Proper dose titration and careful 
monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. 
(5.4)  
• Worsening of diabetic control:  Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and 
result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after 
starting, changing or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy. (5.5)  
• Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over - replacement:  Over -replacement can 
increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose. (5.6) (5)  
 
Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, muscle 
spasm, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, i ncreased appetite, 
weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities and skin rash. (6) (6)  
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1 -800-525-8747 or FDA at 1 -800-FDA1088 
or www.fda.gov/medwatch . (6) 
 
See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and 
metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding and target tissue 
response) and may alter the therapeutic response to levothyroxine sodium tablets. (7) (7)  
 
Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of levothyroxine sodium tablets. (2.3, 8.1) (8)

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine sodium tablets, either alone or with other 
therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss.  
In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective 
for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, 
particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for 
their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7) and Overdosage (10)].  
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HYPOTHYROIDISM   
Levothyroxine sodium tablets are indicated as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), 
secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.  
PITUITARY THYROTROPIN (THYROID -STIMULATING HORMONE, TSH) SUPPRESSION  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets are indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in 
the management of thyrotropin -dependent well -differentiated thyroid cancer.  
Limitations of Use:   
• Levothyroxine sodium tablets are not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules 
and nontoxicdiffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no clinical benefits and 
overtreatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets may induce hyperthyroidi sm [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4)].  
• Levothyroxine sodium tablets are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the 
recoveryphase of subacute thyroiditis.

disintegrate.  
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one -half 
to one hour before breakfast.  
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere 
with levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].  
Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of 
certain foods that may affect levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption [see Drug Interactions 
(7.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets to infants and children who cannot swallow intact 
tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 
mL or 1 to 2 teaspoons) of water and immediately administering the su spension by spoon or 
dropper. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets, such as soybean -based infant formula [see Drug Interactions (7.9)].  
2.2 General Principles of Dosing  
The dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression 
depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, 
concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant med ications, co -
administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5) and Drug Interactions (7)].  Dosing must be 
individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustm ents made based on periodic 
assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4)].  
The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may not be attained 
for 4 to 6 weeks.  
2.3 Dosing in Specific Patient Populations  
Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete  
Start levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly 
individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The 
average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg 
per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).  
Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically 
euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are 
seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300  mcg per day is 
rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions or a combination of 
these factors.  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 
mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically 
euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replaceme nt dose of levothyroxine 
sodium tablets may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.  
152 
 In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per 
day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is 
clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.  
Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Start levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non -elderly 
individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular 
disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH 
is not a reliable measure of levothyroxine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with 
secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum 
free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therap y in this patient population. Titrate levothyroxine 
sodium tablets dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the 
serum free -T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.  
Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism  
The recommended daily dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets in pediatric patients with 
hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1 . Start 
levothyroxine sodium tablets at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower 
starting dose in newborns (0 -3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for 
hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and labo ratory response [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4)].  
TABLE 1. LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM TABLETS DOSING GUIDELINES 
FOR PEDIATRIC HYPOTHYROIDISM  
AGE Daily Dose Per Kg Body Weight 
a 
0-3 months  10-15 mcg/kg/day  
3-6 months  8-10 mcg/kg/day  
6-12 months  6-8 mcg/kg/day  
1-5 years  5-6 mcg/kg/day  
6-12 years  4-5 mcg/kg/day  
Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty 
incomplete  2-3 mcg/kg/day  
Growth and puberty complete  1.6 mcg/kg/day  
a. The dose should be adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations 
(8.4)].  
Newborns (0 -3 months) at risk for cardiac failure:  Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at 
risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and 
laboratory response.  
Children at risk for hyperactivity:  To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one - 
fourth the  
153 
 recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one -fourth the full 
recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.  
Pregnancy  
Pre-existing Hypothyroidism:  Levothyroxine sodium tablets dose requirements may increase 
during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at 
minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain 
serum TSH in the trimester -specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the 
normal trimester -specific range, increase the dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets by 12.5 to 25 
mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stab le levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is 
reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester -specific range. Reduce levothyroxine 
sodium tablets dosage to pre -pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum 
TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is 
appropriate.  
New Onset Hypothyroidism:  Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with 
moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start levothyroxine sodium tablets 
at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild 
hypoth yroidism (TSH <10  
IU per liter) start levothyroxine sodium tablets at 1.0 mcg per kg body weight per day. 
Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage until a 
serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  
TSH Suppression in Well -differentiated Thyroid Cancer   
Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a levothyroxine 
sodium tablets dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high -risk 
tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.  
2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent 
adequate replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may be evidence o f inadequate 
absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions or a combination of these factors.  
Adults   
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 
to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement 
dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months an d whenever there is 
a change in the patient’s clinical status.  
Pediatrics   
In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by 
measuring both serum TSH and total or free -T4. Monitor TSH and total or free -T4 in children as 
follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after  any change in dosage, and 
then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor 
compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine 
clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth and 
bone maturation, at regular intervals.  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize 
in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -thyroid 
feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the no rmal range within 2 
weeks of initiation of  
levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter 
within  
 
154 
 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, 
dose of medication administered and method of administration prior to increasing the dose 
of levothyroxine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific 
Populations (8.4)].  
Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism   
Monitor serum free -T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these 
patients.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal 
insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].  
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying 
Cardiovascular Disease  
Over -treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, 
and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with 
cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate levot hyroxine sodium tablets therapy in 
this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients 
without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].  
155 
 Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery 
disease receiving suppressive levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving 
concomitant levothyroxine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents f or signs and 
symptoms of coronary insufficiency.  
If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose or 
withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.  
5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recomme nded to treat 
myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous 
administration to treat myxedema coma.  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency  
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid 
hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal 
crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal i nsufficiency with 
replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets [see 
Contraindications (4)].  
5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets has a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment with 
levothyroxine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, 
cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function,  
emotional state, gastrointestinal function and glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose 
of levothyroxine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these 
effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].  Monitor for the presenc e of drug or food 
interactions when using levothyroxine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see 
Drug Interactions (7.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic 
control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor 
glycemic control after starting, changing or discontinuing levothyroxine sodium tablets [see 
Drug Interactions (7.2)].  
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -
Replacement  
Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of 
levothyroxine over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal women. The increased bone 
resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion o f calcium and 
phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase and suppressed serum parathyroid 
hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets that achieves the 
desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this ris k. 
156 
 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Overdosage 
(10)].  
They include the following:  
• General:  fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating  
• Central nervous system:  headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional 
lability, insomnia  
• Musculoskeletal:  tremors, muscle weakness, muscle spasm  
• Cardiovascular:  palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, 
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
• Respiratory:  dyspnea  
• Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests  
• Dermatologic:  hair loss, flushing, rash  
• Endocrine:  decreased bone mineral density  
• Reproductive:  menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility  
Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.  
ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CHILDREN  
Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children 
receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and 
premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height.  
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS  
Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with 
thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, 
angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to 
levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.  
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., 
absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding and target tissue response) and 
may alter the therapeutic response to levothyroxine sodium tablets (see Tables 2 -5 below).  
TABLE 2. DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE T4 ABSORPTION (HYPOTHYROIDISM)  
Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine sodium tablets 
by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.  
157 
 Drug or Drug 
Class Effect  
Calcium  
Carbonate  
Ferrous Sulfate  Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, 
and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric - thyroxine complex. Administer 
levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 4 hours apart from these agents.  
Orlistat  Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine 
sodium tablets for changes in thyroid function.  
Bile Acid  
Sequestrants  
-Colesevelam  
- 
Cholestyramine  
-Colestipol  
Ion Exchange  
Resins  
-Kayexalate  
-Sevelamer  Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease 
levothyroxine absorption. Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 
4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels.  
Other drugs: 
Proton Pump  
Inhibitors  
Sucralfate  
Antacids  
Aluminum 
&Magnesium  
Hydroxides  
Simethicone  Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for adequate absorption of 
levothyroxine. Sucralfate, antacids and proton pump inhibitors may cause 
hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric pH and reduce levothyroxine 
absorption. Monitor patients appropriately.  
TABLE 3. DRUGS THAT MAY ALTER T4 AND TRIIODOTHYRONINE (T3) SERUM TRANSPORT 
WITHOUT AFFECTING FREE THYROXINE (FT4) CONCENTRATION (EUTHYROIDISM)  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Clofibrate 
Estrogencontaining 
oral contraceptives 
Estrogens (oral)  
Heroin /  
Methadone 
5Fluorouracil  
Mitotane  
Tamoxifen  These drugs may increase serum thyroxine -binding globulin 
(TBG) concentration.  
158 
 Androgens /  
Anabolic  
Steroids  
Asparaginase  
Glucocorticoids  
Slow -Release  
Nicotinic Acid  These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration.  
Potential impact (below): Administration of these agents with levothyroxine 
sodium tablets results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued 
administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH 
concentrations.  
Salicylates (>2 
g/day)  Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An 
initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal 
levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, 
although total T4 levels may decrease by as much a s 30%.  
Other drugs:  
Carbamazepine  
Furosemide  
(>80 mg IV) 
Heparin  
Hydantoins  
Non-Steroidal 
Antiinflammatory 
Drugs  
-Fenamates  These drugs may cause protein -binding site displacement. 
Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to 
TBG and albumin, causing an increase free T4 fraction in serum. 
Furosemide competes for T4 -binding sites on TBG, prealbumin and 
album in, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 
level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding 
of levothyroxine, and total and free T4 may be reduced by 20% to 
40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are 
clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters.  
TABLE 4. DRUGS THAT MAY ALTER HEPATIC METABOLISM OF T4 (HYPOTHYROIDISM)  
Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme 
activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in 
increased levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements.  
Drug or  
Drug Class  Effect  
Phenobarbital 
Rifampin  Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine.  
Phenobarbital increases L -thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine  
5’-diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 
serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are 
added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. 
Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism  of 
levothyroxine.  
159 
 TABLE 5. DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE CONVERSION OF T4 TO T3  
Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the 
peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, 
serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.  
Drug or Drug Class  Effect  
Beta-adrenergic 
antagonists (e.g., 
Propranolol  
>160 mg/day)  In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), 
T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal and patients 
are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular betaadrenergic 
antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is 
converte d to the euthyroid state.  
Glucocorticoids  
(e.g.,  
Dexamethasone  
≥4 mg/day)  Short -term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may 
decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in 
serum T4 levels. However, long -term glucocorticoid therapy may 
result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG  
production (See above).  
Other drugs: 
Amiodarone  Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to 
triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes 
(increase in serum free -T4 and decreased or normal free -T3) in 
clinically euthyroid patients.  
7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may 
worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is start ed, changed or 
discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, 
a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid 
state or when the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is increased. Clos ely monitor coagulation 
tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
Levothyroxine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum 
digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, 
necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants 
and levothyroxine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, 
possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholam ines. Toxic effects may include 
increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Levothyroxine 
sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in 
160 
 patients stabilized on levothyroxine sodium tablets may result in increased levothyroxine 
sodium tablets requirements.  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and levothyroxine sodium tablets may produce marked 
hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and levothyroxine sodium tablets may increase the 
effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of 
coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients w ith 
coronary artery disease.  
7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. 
Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
7.9 Drug -Food Interactions  
Consumption of certain foods may affect levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption thereby 
necessitating adjustments in dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].  Soybean flour, 
cottonseed meal, walnuts and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of 
levothyroxine sodium tablets from the gastrointestinal tract. Grapefruit juice may delay the 
absorption of levothyroxine and reduce its bioavailability.  
7.10 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and 
evaluate unbound (free) hormone and/or determine the free -T4 index (FT4I) in this 
circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen -containing oral 
contr aceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentration. Nephrosis, severe 
hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease 
TBG concentration. Familial hyper - or hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias h ave been 
described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
Experience with levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing 
studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data] . 
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. 
Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and levothyroxine 
sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].  There are no 
animal studies conducted with levothyroxine during pr egnancy. Levothyroxine sodium tablets 
should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy 
should be promptly treated.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of 
161 
 major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 
to 20%, respectively.  
Clinical Considerations  
Disease -Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk  
Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, 
including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -eclampsia, stillbirth and 
premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal 
neurocognitive development.  
Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period  
Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels should 
be monitored and the levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since 
postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the levothyroxine  sodium tablets 
dosage should return to the pre -pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3)]. Data  
Human Data  
Levothyroxine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. There is a long 
experience of levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing studies 
that have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, misc arriages or other adverse 
maternal or fetal outcomes associated with levothyroxine use in pregnant women.  
Lactation  
Risk Summary  
Limited published studies report that levothyroxine is present in human milk. However, there 
is insufficient information to determine the effects of Levothyroxine on the breastfed infant and 
no available information on the effects of levothyroxine on milk production. Adequate 
levothyroxine treatment during lactation may normalize milk production in hypothyroid 
lactating mothers. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be 
considered along with the mother’s clinical need for levothyroxin e sodium tablets and any 
potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from levothyroxine sodium tablets or from the 
underlying maternal condition.  
Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing 
adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].  
In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, 
discontinue levothyroxine sodium tablets administration for a trial period, but only after the child 
is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end  of the trial period, and 
use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if 
warranted.  
6.2 Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]  
Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse 
effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical 
162 
 growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy immediately 
upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy for 
cardiac overload, arrhythmias and aspiration from avid suckling.  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have 
deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated 
with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of br ain maturation and may 
accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult 
stature.  
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result 
in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in 
reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in  premature 
epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in some 
cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch -up 
growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.  
Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate 
levothyroxine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial 
fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in 
the elderly.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)].  In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. 
Cerebral embolism, shock, coma and death have been reported. Seizures occurred in a 3 -year- 
old child ingesting 3.6 mg of levothyroxine. Symptoms may not necessarily be evident or may 
not appear until s everal days after ingestion of levothyroxine sodium.  
Reduce the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose or discontinue temporarily if signs or symptoms 
of overdosage occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by the patient’s 
medical status.

 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and 
protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and 
bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclea r receptor complex 
activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.  
The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority 
of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as 
endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 80%. 
The majority of the levothyroxine sodium tablets dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper 
ileum. The relative bioavailability of levothyroxine sodium tablets, c ompared to an equal 
nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 99%. T4 absorption is 
increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such 
as soybeans. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T4. Absorption may also decrease with 
age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T4 absorption [see Drug Interactions (7)].  
Distribution  
Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including 
thyroxinebinding globulin (TBG), thyroxine -binding prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (TBA), 
whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both  TBG and 
TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance and longer 
half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein -bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium 
with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is m etabolically active. Many 
drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see 
Drug Interactions (7)].  Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)].  
Elimination  
Metabolism  
T4 is slowly eliminated (see Table 7 ). The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is 
through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral 
T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3, with T4 
deiodinatio n also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other 
tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T4 is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T3 
and reverse T3 (rT3). T3 and rT3 are further  deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones 
are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into 
the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation.  
Excretion  
165 
 Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. Approximately 20% of 
T4 is eliminated in the stool. Urinary excretion of T4 decreases with age.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION  
Inform the patient of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of levothyroxine 
sodium tablets:  
Dosing and Administration  
• Instruct patients that levothyroxine sodium tablets should be taken with a full glass of water 
since thetablet may rapidly disintegrate.  
• Instruct patients to take levothyroxine sodium tablets only as directed by their healthcare 
provider.  
• Instruct patients to take levothyroxine sodium tablets as a single dose, preferably on an empty 
stomach,one -half to one hour before breakfast.  
• Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease 
theabsorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take levothyroxine sodium tablets within 
4 hours of these agents.  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or breastfeeding or are 
thinkingof becoming pregnant while taking levothyroxine sodium tablets.  
Important Information  
• Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in symptoms.  
• Inform patients that the levothyroxine in levothyroxine sodium tablets is intended to replace a 
hormonethat is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be 
taken for life.  
• Inform patients that levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or adjunctive 
therapyin a weight control program.  
167 
 • Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, 
includingprescription and over -the-counter preparations.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician of any other medical conditions they may have, 
particularlyheart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, 
as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions ma y need to be adjusted 
while they are taking levothyroxine sodium tablets. If they have diabetes, instruct patients to 
monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by their physician and immediately 
report any changes to their physician. If  patients are taking anticoagulants, their clotting status 
should be checked frequently.  
• Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist that they are taking levothyroxine sodium 
tabletsprior to any surgery. Adverse Reactions  
• Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following 
symptoms:  
rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, 
nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, 
vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in men strual 
periods, hives or skin rash or any other unusual medical event.  
• Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of 
levothyroxinesodium tablets therapy, but this is usually temporary.

 APPENDIX E  
CYTOMEL® 
brand of liothyronine 
sodium tablets  
DESCRIPTION  
Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing tetraiodothyronine (T 4, 
levothyroxine) sodium or triiodothyronine (T 3, liothyronine) sodium or both. T 4 and T 3 are 
produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. 
T4 contains four iodine atoms and is formed by the coupling of two molecules of diiodotyrosine 
(DIT). T 3 contains three atoms of iodine and is formed by the coupling of one molecule of DIT 
with one molecule of monoiodotyrosine (MIT). Both hormones are stored in the thyroid colloid 
as thyroglobulin.  
Thyroid hormone preparations belong to two categories: (1) natural hormonal preparations 
derived from animal thyroid, and (2) synthetic preparations. Natural preparations include 
desiccated thyroid and thyroglobulin. Desiccated thyroid is derived from dome sticated animals 
that are used for food by man (either beef or hog thyroid), and thyroglobulin is derived from 
thyroid glands of the hog. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has standardized the total 
iodine content of natural preparations. Thyroid USP co ntains not less than (NLT) 0.17 percent 
and not more than (NMT) 0.23 percent iodine, and thyroglobulin contains not less than (NLT) 
0.7 percent of organically bound iodine. Iodine content is only an indirect indicator of true 
hormonal biologic activity.  
Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets contain liothyronine (L -triiodothyronine or L 
T3), a 
synthetic form of a natural thyroid hormone, and is available as the sodium salt.  
193 
 The structural and empirical formulas and molecular weight of liothyronine sodium are given 
below.  
Liothyronine Sodium  
 
L-Tyrosine, O-(4-hydroxy -3-iodophenyl) -3,5-diiodo -, monosodium salt  
Twenty -five mcg of liothyronine is equivalent to approximately 1 grain of desiccated thyroid or 
thyroglobulin and 0.1 mg of L -thyroxine.  
Each round, white to off -white Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) tablet contains liothyronine sodium 
equivalent to liothyronine as follows: 5 mcg debossed JMI and D14; 25 mcg scored and 
debossed JMI and D16; 50 mcg scored and debossed JMI and D17. Inactive ing redients 
consist of calcium sulfate, gelatin, starch, stearic acid, sucrose and talc.  
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic action are not well 
understood. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body, 
increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and protei ns. 
Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular 
importance in the development of the central nervous system.  
PHARMACOKINETICS  
Since liothyronine sodium (T 3) is not firmly bound to serum protein, it is readily available to body 
tissues. The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium is rapid, occurring within a few hours. 
Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days, providing early clinical respons e. 
The biological half -life is about 2 -1/2 days.  

194 
 T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the 
natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones.  
Liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff of activity which permits quick dosage adjustment and 
facilitates control of the effects of overdosage, should they occur.  
The higher affinity of levothyroxine ( T4) for both thyroid -binding globulin and thyroid -binding 
prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T 3) partially explains the higher serum levels and 
longer half -life of the former hormone. Both protein -bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium 
with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.  
INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
Thyroid hormone drugs are indicated:  
1. As replacement or supplemental therapy in patients with hypothyroidism of any etiology, 
except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. This 
category includes cretinism, myxedema and ordinary hypothyroidism in patients of  any 
age (pediatric patients, adults, the elderly), or state (including pregnancy); primary 
hypothyroidism resulting from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total 
absence of thyroid gland, or the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, wit h or without 
the presence of goiter; and secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) 
hypothyroidism (see WARNINGS).  
2. As pituitary thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressants, in the treatment or 
prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, subacute or 
chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s) and multinodular goiter.  
3. As diagnostic agents in suppression tests to differentiate suspected mild 
hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.  
195 
 Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets can be used in patients allergic to desiccated thyroid or 
thyroid extract derived from pork or beef.  
CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Thyroid hormone preparations are generally contraindicated in patients with diagnosed but as 
yet uncorrected adrenal cortical insufficiency, untreated thyrotoxicosis and apparent 
hypersensitivity to any of their active or extraneous constituents. There is no well -documented 
evidence from the literature, however, of true allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to thyroid 
hormone.  
WARNINGS  
Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have 
been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily 
hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger dos es may produce 
serious or even lifethreatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association 
with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.  
The use of thyroid hormones in the therapy of obesity, alone or combined with other drugs, is  
unjustified and has been shown to be ineffective. Neither is their use justified for the treatment 
of male or female infertility unless this condition is accompanied by hypothyroidism.  
Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the 
integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected. These 
include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is  a greater likelihood of 
occult cardiac disease. In these patients, liothyronine sodium therapy should be initiated with 
low doses, with due consideration for its relatively rapid onset of action. Starting dosage of 
196 
 Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets is 5 mcg daily, and should be increased by no more than 
5 mcg increments at 2 -week intervals. When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be 
reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease , thyroid hormone 
dosage should be reduced.  
Morphologic hypogonadism and nephrosis should be ruled out before the drug is administered. 
If hypopituitarism is present, the adrenal deficiency must be corrected prior to starting the drug. 
Myxedematous patients are very sensitive to thyroid; dosage shou ld be started at a very low 
level and increased gradually.  
Severe and prolonged hypothyroidism can lead to a decreased level of adrenocortical activity 
commensurate with the lowered metabolic state. When thyroid -replacement therapy is 
administered, the metabolism increases at a greater rate than adrenocortical act ivity. This can 
precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency. Therefore, in severe and prolonged hypothyroidism, 
supplemental adrenocortical steroids may be necessary. In rare instances the administration of 
thyroid hormone may precipitate a hyperthyroid state  or may aggravate existing 
hyperthyroidism.  
PRECAUTIONS  
General  – Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or insipidus 
or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate 
adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endo crine 
diseases are required.  
The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of 
glucocorticoids.  
Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. 
Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid -treated patients on oral anticoagulants 
and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent  prothrombin time 
197 
 determinations. In infants, excessive doses of thyroid hormone preparations may produce 
craniosynostosis.  
Information for the Patient  – Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of 
pediatric patients on thyroid therapy should be informed that:  
1. Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of 
transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients  
receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.  
2. They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of 
thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive 
sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.  
3. In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication 
may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid 
medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close 
monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.  
4. In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be 
measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be 
readjusted.  
5. Partial loss of hair may be experienced by pediatric patients in the first few months of 
thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually 
the rule.  
Laboratory Tests  – Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic  
assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical 
evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid 
preparation, bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative 
feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of 
198 
 all thyroid medications except products containing liothyronine sodium. When the total serum 
T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. 
Specific measurements of T4 and T 3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are 
not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine and have essentially replaced older 
tests of thyroid hormone measurements, i.e., PBI, BEI and T4 by column.  
DRUG INTERACTIONS  
OralAnticoagulants – Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K -
dependent  
clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting 
factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to 
require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a 
patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. 
No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a 
patient already stabilized on ma intenance thyroid replacement therapy.  
Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics – Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases 
in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and 
depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and 
endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be 
closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy.  
Cholestyramine – Cholestyramine binds both T 4 and T 3 in the intestine, thus impairing 
absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro  studies indicate that the binding is not easily 
199 
 removed. Therefore, 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine 
and thyroid hormones.  
Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives – Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine -binding 
globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid 
replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started  
thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient’s thyroid gland has sufficient 
function, the decreased free thyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine 
output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroi d gland who are on 
thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens  
or estrogen -containing oral contraceptives are given.  
Tricyclic Antidepressants – Use of thyroid products with imipramine and other tricyclic 
antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity; 
transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed. Thyroid hormone activity may also be 
enhanced.  
Digitalis – Thyroid preparations may potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis. Thyroid 
hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate, which requires an increase in digitalis 
dosage.  
Ketamine – When administered to patients on a thyroid preparation, this parenteral 
anesthetic may cause hypertension and tachycardia. Use with caution and be prepared to 
treat hypertension, if necessary.  
200 
 Vasopressors – Thyroxine increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as 
epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, injection of these agents into patients 
receiving thyroid preparations increases the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency,  
especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Careful observation is required.  
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  – The following drugs or moieties are known to 
interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: 
androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine -
containing preparations and the numero us preparations containing salicylates.  
1. Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the 
interpretation of T 4 and T 3 values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone 
should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens and estrogen -containing oral 
contraceptives increase TBg concentrations. TBg may also be increased during 
infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, 
acromegaly and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper - or hypo -
thyroxinebinding -globulinemias have been described. Th e incidence of TBg 
deficiency approximates 1 in 9000. The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine -binding 
prealbumin (TBPA) is inhibited by salicylates.  
2. Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radioiodine uptake, 
producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone 
synthesis.  
3. The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of 
adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance, poor 
201 
 absorption, excessive fecal loss, or inactivity of the preparation. Intracellular 
resistance to thyroid hormone is quite rare.  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility  – A reportedly apparent 
association between prolonged thyroid therapy and breast cancer has not been confirmed 
and patients on thyroid for established indications should not discontinue therapy. No 
confirmatory long -term studies in animals have been perfo rmed to evaluate carcinogenic 
potential, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility in either males or females.  
Pregnancy  – Category A. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier. The 
clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse effect on fetuses when thyroid 
hormones are administered to pregnant women. On the basis of current knowledge, 
thyroid  replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during 
pregnancy.  
Nursing Mothers  – Minimal amounts of thyroid hormones are excreted in human milk. 
Thyroid is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known 
tumorigenic potential.  
However, caution should be exercised when thyroid is administered to a nursing woman.  
Geriatric Use  – Clinical studies of liothyronine sodium did not include sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses 
between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient 
should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the 
202 
 greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant 
disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the 
kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients wit h impaired 
renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, 
care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.  
Pediatric Use  – Pregnant mothers provide little or no thyroid hormone to the fetus. The 
incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is relatively high (1:4000) and the hypothyroid fetus 
would not derive any benefit from the small amounts of hormone crossing the placental 
barrier. Routine determinations of serum T 4 and/or TSH is strongly advised in neonates in 
view of the deleterious effects of thyroid deficiency on growth and development.  
Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis and maintained for life, unless 
transient hypothyroidism is suspected, in which case, therapy may be interrupted for 2 to 8 
weeks after the age of 3 years to reassess the condition. Cessation of ther apy is justified in 
patients who have maintained a normal TSH during those 2 to 8 weeks.  
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions, other than those indicative of hyperthyroidism because of therapeutic 
overdosage, either initially or during the maintenance period are rare (see OVERDOSAGE).  
In rare instances, allergic skin reactions have been reported with Cytomel 
(liothyronine sodium) Tablets.  
203 
 OVERDOSAGE  
Signs and Symptoms  – Headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, arrhythmia (including 
tachycardia), increased bowel motility and menstrual irregularities. Angina pectoris or 
congestive heart failure may be induced or aggravated. Shock may also develop. Massive 
overdosag e may result in symptoms resembling thyroid storm. Chronic excessive dosage 
will produce the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  
Treatment Of Overdosage  – Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily 
discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted 
at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic -pituitary -thyroid axis 
function is restored in 6 to 8 we eks after thyroid suppression.  
Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing 
gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, 
mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if furth er 
gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such 
as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and 
supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glyco sides 
may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, 
hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, 
particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased  
sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 
204 
 mg over a 10 -minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, especially when no 
contraindications exist for its use.  
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be 
individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.  
Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets are intended for oral administration; once -a-day dosage 
is recommended. Although liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff, its metabolic effects persist 
for a few days following discontinuance.  
Mild Hypothyroidism:  Recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg daily. Daily dosage then may 
be increased by up to 25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks. Usual maintenance dose is 25 to75mcg 
daily.  
The rapid onset and dissipation of action of liothyronine sodium (T 3), as compared with 
levothyroxine sodium ( T4), has led some clinicians to prefer its use in patients who might be 
more susceptible to the untoward effects of thyroid medication. However, the wide swings in 
serum T 3 levels that follow its administration and the possibility of more pronounced 
cardiovascular side effects tend to counterbalance the stated advantages.  
Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets may be used in preference to levothyroxine ( T4) during 
radioisotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more 
abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral 
conversion of T4 to T 3 is suspected.  
Myxedema:  Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This may be increased by 5 to 10 
mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may be increased by 5 to 
25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks until a satisfactory therapeutic response is attained. Usual  
maintenance dose is 50 to 100 mcg daily.  
205 
 Myxedema Coma:  Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long 
standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be 
considered a medical emergency.  
An intravenous preparation of liothyronine sodium is marketed by Jones Pharma 
Incorporated, under the trade name Triostat® for use in myxedema coma/precoma.  
Congenital Hypothyroidism:  Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily, with a 5 mcg 
increment every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old 
may require only 20 mcg daily for maintenance. At 1 year, 50 mcg daily may be required. 
Above 3 years, ful l adult dosage may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).  
Simple (non -toxic) Goiter:  Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This dosage may be 
increased by 5 to 10 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may 
be increased every week or two by 12.5 or 25 mcg. Usual maintenance dosage is 75 mcg daily.  
In the elderly or in pediatric patients,  therapy should be started with 5 mcg daily and 
increased only by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals.  
When switching a patient to Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets  from thyroid, 
Lthyroxine or thyroglobulin, discontinue the other medication, initiate Cytomel at a low 
dosage, and increase gradually according to the patient's response. When selecting a 
starting dosage, bear in mind that this drug has a rapid onset of a ction, and that residual 
effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks of therapy.  
Thyroid Suppression Therapy:  Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than 
those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of 
endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an 
aid in the diagnosis of  patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom baseline 
206 
 laboratory tests appear normal or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with 
Graves’ ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of 
the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal 
thyroid -pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.  
Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets are given in doses of 75 to 100 mcg/day for 7 days, 
and radioactive iodine uptake is determined before and after administration of the 
hormone. If thyroid function is under normal control, the radioiodine uptake will d rop 
significantly after treatment. Cytomel (liothyronine sodium) Tablets should be administered 
cautiously to patients in whom there is a strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in 
view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to  the endogenous 
source.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including liothyronine sodium tablets, either alone or with other 
therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight 
loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements 
are ine ffective for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life -threatening manifestations of toxicity, 
particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for 
their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage 
(10)] . 
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
1.1 Hypothyroidism  
Liothyronine sodium tablets are indicated as a replacement therapy in primary 
(thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired 
hypothyroidism.  
1.2 Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression  
Liothyronine sodium tablets are indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine 
therapy in the management of well -differentiated thyroid cancer . 
1.3 Thyroid Suppression Test  
Liothyronine sodium tablets are indicated as a diagnostic agent in suppression tests to 
differentiate suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.  
213 
 Limitations of Use  
Limitations of Use  
 Liothyronine sodium tablets are not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid 
nodules and nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no 
clinical benefits and overtreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may induce 
hyperthyroidi sm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . 
 Liothyronine sodium tablets are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during 
the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.  
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
6.3 2.1 General Principles of Dosing  
The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid -
Stimulating Hormone  
(TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body 
weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), 
concomitant medications, co -administered food and the specific nature of the condition  
being treated [see Dosage and  
Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . 
Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made 
based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 
Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily.  
2.2 Recommended Dosage for 
Hypothyroidism Adults  
The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg 
daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once 
daily.  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine 
sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended 
intervals.  
Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in 
patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor 
therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient populati on. 
Pediatric Patients  
The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 
days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg 
214 
 once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 
years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:  
Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as 
needed based on clinical and laboratory response.  
Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity  
To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one -fourth the 
recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one -fourth the full 
recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reache d. 
Pregnancy  
Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during 
pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at 
minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, 
main tain serum TSH in the trimesterspecific reference range. For patients with serum 
TSH above the normal trimester -specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone 
and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within 
the no rmal trimester -specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to prepregnancy 
levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks 
postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate.  
2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well -Differentiated Thyroid Cancer  
The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired 
therapeutic range.  
This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.  
2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test  
The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine 
uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine 
sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop 
significan tly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal 
thyroid -pituitary axis.  
2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets  
Liothyronine sodium tablets has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the 
other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating 
liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium 
tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a 
low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets dose according to the 
patient's response.  
215 
 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an 
apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium tablets may be evidence of  
inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these 
factors.  
Adults  
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after 
initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to 
therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to 
be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In 
patients on a stable and appropriate rep lacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical 
response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical 
status.  
Pediatrics  
In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by 
measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the 
recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose s tabilization 
until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may 
necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including 
assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at  regular 
intervals.  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not 
normalize in some patients due to in utero  hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -
thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation 
of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate 
therapy. Assess complianc e, dose of medication administered, and method of 
administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see War nings 
and Precautions (5.1)  and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . 
Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range.  
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

216 
 50 mcg: debossed "50" above the score and "223" below the score on one side and plain 
on the other  
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Liothyronine sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal 
insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying 
Cardiovascular Disease  
Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall 
thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, 
particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate 
liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those 
recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].  
Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary 
artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor 
patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic 
agents for  signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms 
develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one 
week and restart at a lower dose.  
5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from 
the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not 
recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products 
formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency  
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid 
hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute 
adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal 
insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with 
liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4)].  
217 
 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
Liothyronine sodium tablets has a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment 
with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and 
development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, 
cognitive function, e motional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid 
metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor 
response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].  
Monitor for the prese nce of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium 
tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)].  
5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen 
glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronin e 
sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].  
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -
Replacement  
Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of 
thyroid hormone over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal women. The 
increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary 
excretion  of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and 
suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of 
liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response 
to mitigate again st this risk.  
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium tablets therapy are primarily 
those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following:  
General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive 
sweating  
Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, 
emotional lability, insomnia  
Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps  
218 
 Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, 
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
Respiratory : dyspnea  
Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests  
Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing  
Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density  
Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility  
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients  
Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in 
pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in 
craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric 
patients w ith resultant compromised adult height.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated 
with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, 
angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing.  
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, 
synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter 
the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 – 4). 
Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism)  
Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium 
tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in

Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and 
transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to 
normal Salicylates (>2 g/day)  
levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, 
although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%.  
Other drugs:These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement.  
Carbamazepine Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to 
Furosemide (>80 mg TBG and albumin, causing an increased free -T4 fraction in serum.  
IV) Furosemide competes for T4 -binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and  
Heparin albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4  
Hydantoins level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of Non -
Steroidal Anti - thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, 
inflammatory Drugs but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically - 
Fenam ates euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters.  
220 
 Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones  
Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug -metabolizing enzyme 
activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting 
in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements.  
DRUG OR DRUG CLASS  EFFECT  
Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine.  
Phenobarbital increases L -thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5' -
diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower  
Phenobarbital  
T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates  
Rifampin are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for 
hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to 
accelerate the metabolism of thyroid 
hormones.  
TABLE 4: DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE CONVERSION OF T4 TO T3  
Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the 
peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, 
serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly 
increased.  
DRUG OR DRUG CLASS  EFFECT  
In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3  
Beta -adrenergic and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and  
patients are antagonists (e.g., clinically euthyroid.  
 Actions of particular beta -adrenergic Propranolol >160 antagonists  
may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted mg/day)  
to the euthyroid state.  
Short -term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may  
Glucocorticoids (e.g., decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal 
change in Dexamethasone ≥4 serum T4 levels. However, long -term 
glucocorticoid therapy may mg/day) result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 
levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).  
Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of 
levothyroxine (T4) to Other drugs: triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated 
biochemical changes Amiodarone (increase in serum free -T4, and decreased or 
normal free -T3) in clinically euthyroid patients.  
221 
 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may 
worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium table ts are started, 
changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . 
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
Liothyronine sodium tablets increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. 
Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of 
the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium tablets dose is increased. Closel y 
monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
Liothyronine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. 
Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes 
euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) 
antidepressants and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic 
effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholami nes. 
Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system 
stimulation. Liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. 
Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine s odium tablets may result 
in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements.  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium tablets may produce marked 
hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these 
patients.  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the 
effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the 
risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to 
patients wi th coronary artery disease.  
222 
 7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. 
Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
7.9 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and 
evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, 
estrogens, estrogencontaining oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria  
increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, 
acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper - 
or hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG 
deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing 
studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see 
Data).  There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism 
in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored 
and liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical 
Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during 
pregn ancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and 
hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% 
and 15 to 20%, respectively.  
Clinical Considerations  
Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk  
Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of 
complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -eclampsia, 
stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an 
adverse e ffect on fetal neurocognitive development.  
Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period  
223 
 Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels 
should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during 
pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the 
liothyronine so dium tablets dosage should return to the pre -pregnancy dose immediately 
after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  
Data  
Human Data  
Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data 
from postmarketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal 
malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes 
associated with liothyronine u se in pregnant women.  
8.2 Lactation  
Risk Summary  
Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, 
there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed 
infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk pro duction. The 
developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on 
the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium tablets or from th e underlying maternal 
condition.  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of liothyronine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing 
adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] . 
In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been 
established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at 
least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial  period, and 
use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if 
warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].  
Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6)]  
Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the 
adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on 
overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediate ly 
upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients.  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac 
overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.  
224 
 Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may 
have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is 
associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of br ain 
maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure 
and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions 
(6)]. 
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment 
may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed 
mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and 
result in  premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in 
some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, 
catch -up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions 
(6)]. 
8.5 Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate 
liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in 
elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with 
thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly.  
common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . In addition, confusion and disorientation may 
occur. Cerebral embolism, seizure, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Symptoms 
may not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after ingestion.  
Reduce the liothyronine sodium tablets dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or 
symptoms of overdosage occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by 
the patient's medical status.  
For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the 
National Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 or www.poison.org . 
11 DESCRIPTION  
Liothyronine sodium tablets contain the active ingredient, liothyronine (L -
triiodothyronine or LT3), a synthetic form of a thyroid hormone liothyronine in sodium 
225 
 salt form. It is chemically designated as LTyrosine, O-(4-hydroxy -3-iodophenyl) -3,5-diiodo -
, monosodium salt. The molecular formula, molecular weight and structural formula of 
liothyronine sodium are given below.  
 
        C15H11I3NNaO 4                 M.W.672.96  
Liothyronine sodium tablets contain liothyronine sodium equivalent to liothyronine in 5 
mcg, 25 mcg, and 50 mcg. Inactive ingredients consist of calcium sulfate, microcrystalline 
cellulose, hypromellose, talc, and colloidal silicon dioxide.  
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and 
protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus 
and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclea r receptor 
complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic 
proteins.  
The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the 
majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral 
tissues.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum 
pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the 
natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones.  
Distribution  
Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of 
levothyroxine  

226 
 (T4) for both thyroid -binding globulin and thyroid -binding prealbumin as compared to 
triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half -life of the 
former hormone. Both protein -bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute 
amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.  
Elimination  
Metabolism  
The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. 
Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. 
The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodina ted to 
diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides 
and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic 
recirculation.  
Excretion  
Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half -
life is about 2 -1/2 days.  
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenic 
potential or effects on fertility of liothyronine sodium.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION  
Dosing and Administration  
Instruct patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should only be taken as directed by 
their healthcare provider.  
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or 
breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking liothyronine sodium 
tablets.  
Important Information  
Inform patients that the liothyronine in liothyronine sodium tablets are intended to 
replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally

tablets s hould not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control 
program.  
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other 
medications, including prescription and over -the-counter preparations.  
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, 
particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland 
problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to 
be adjusted while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. If patents are taking anticoagulants 
(blood thinners), their clotting status should be checked frequently.  
 Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking liothyronine 
sodium tablets prior to any surgery.  
Adverse Reactions  
 Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the 
following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg 
cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in 
appet ite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat 
intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other 
unusual medical event [see Adverse Reactions (6)] .

Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and 
careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of 
hyperthyroidism. (5.4) Worsening of diabetic control: Thera py in patients with diabetes mellitus may 
worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully 
monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy (5.5)  
 Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over -replacement: Over -
replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest 
effective dose (5.6)  
 
Most common adverse reactions for CYTOMEL are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to 
therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, 
irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight  loss, diarrhea, heat 
intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6)

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including CYTOMEL, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, 
should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss.  
In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are 
ineffective for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life -threatening manifestations of toxicity, 
particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for 
their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage 
(10)] . 
238 
 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
1.1 Hypothyroidism  
CYTOMEL is indicated as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary 
(pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.  
1.2 Pituitary Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone(TSH) Suppression  
CYTOMEL is indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the 
management of welldifferentiated thyroid cancer . 
1.3 Thyroid Suppression Test  
CYTOMEL is indicated as a diagnostic agent in suppression tests to differentiate suspected 
mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.  
Limitations of Use  
CYTOMEL is not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules and nontoxic 
diffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no clinical benefits and 
overtreatment with CYTOMEL may induce hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4)] . 
CYTOMEL is not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of 
subacute thyroiditis.  
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
2.1 General Principles of Dosing  
The dose of CYTOMEL for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a 
variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, 
concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co -
administ ered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions 
(7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments 
made  based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory 
parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 
Administer CYTOMEL tablets orally once daily.  
2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism  
Adults  
239 
 The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg 
daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once 
daily.  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with CYTOMEL 5 mcg 
once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals.  
Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of CYTOMEL dose adequacy in patients with 
secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use 
the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population.  
Pediatric Patients  
The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 
days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg 
once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required . Above 3 
years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:  
Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as 
needed based on clinical and laboratory response.  
Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:  
To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one -fourth the 
recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one -fourth the full 
recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reache d. 
Pregnancy  
Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during 
pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at 
minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, 
maintain serum TSH in the trimesterspecific reference range. For patients with serum 
TSH above the normal trimester -specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone 
and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within 
the normal trimester -specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to prepregnancy 
levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks 
postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate.  
2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well -Differentiated Thyroid Cancer  
The dose of CYTOMEL should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This 
may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.  
240 
 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test  
The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine 
uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of CYTOMEL. If 
thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after 
treatment.  A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid -
pituitary axis.  
2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to CYTOMEL  
CYTOMEL has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation 
may persist for the first several weeks after initiating CYTOMEL therapy. When switching 
a patient to CYTOMEL, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate CYTOMEL at a low 
dosage. Gradually increase the CYTOMEL dose according to the patient's response.  
2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an 
apparent adequate replacement dose of CYTOMEL may be evidence of inadequate 
absorpti on, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.  
Adults  
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after 
initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to 
therapy before the TSH has had a  
chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, 
measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and 
appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 
months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.  
Pediatrics  
In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by 
measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, 
the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose 
stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values 
may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, 
including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, 
at regular intervals.  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not 
normalize in some patients due to in utero  hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -
thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation 
of CYTOMEL therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess 
241 
 compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to 
increasing the dose of CYTOMEL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific 
Populations (8.4)] . 
Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism  
Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range.  
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  
Tablets (round, white to off -white) available as follows:  
5 mcg: debossed with KPI on one side and 115 on the other side  
25 mcg: scored on one side and debossed with KPI and 116 on the other side  
50 mcg: scored on one side and debossed with KPI and 117 on the other side  
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
CYTOMEL is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
 5.1 CARDIAC ADVERSE REACTIONS IN THE ELDERLY AND IN PATIENTS WITH UNDERLYING 
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE  
Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall 
thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, 
particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate 
CYTO MEL therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger 
individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) 
and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].  
Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary 
artery disease receiving suppressive CYTOMEL therapy. Monitor patients receiving 
concomitant CYTOMEL and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary 
insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the 
CYTOMEL dose for one week and restart at a lower dose.  
242 
 5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from 
the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not 
recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products 
formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency  
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid 
hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute 
adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal 
insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with 
CYTOMEL [see Contraindications (4)].  
5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
CYTOMEL has a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment with CYTOMEL 
may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone 
metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, 
gastrointestinal functio n, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of 
CYTOMEL carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.4)].  Monitor for the presence of drug or food 
interactions when using CYTOMEL and adju st the dose as necessary [see Drug 
Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen 
glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing CYTOMEL [see 
Drug Interactions (7.2)].  
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -
Replacement  
Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of 
thyroid hormone over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal women. The 
increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary 
excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and 
suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of 
CYTOMEL that achieves the de sired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against 
this risk.  
243 
 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions associated with CYTOMEL therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and 
Overdosage (10)] . They include the following:  
General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive 
sweating  
Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, 
emotional lability, insomnia  
Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps  
Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, 
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
Respiratory : dyspnea  
Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests  
Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing  
Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density  
Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility  
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients  
Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in 
pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in 
craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric 
patients w ith resultant compromised adult height.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated 
with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, 
angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing.  
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, 
synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter 
the therapeutic response to CYTOMEL (see Tables 1 – 4). 
244

Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and 
transthyretin. An Salicylates (>2  initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by 
return of FT4 to normal g/day)  levels with sustained therapeutic serum 
salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 
30%.  
Other drugs:  
These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide

Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid Hormones  
Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug -metabolizing 
enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid 
hormones, resulting in increased CYTOMEL requirements.  
DRUG OR DRUG CLASS  
Effect  
Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine.  
Phenobarbital increases L -thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine  
5'-diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4  
Phenobarbital serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if 
barbiturates are  
Rifampin added or withdrawn from patients being treated for 
hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to 
accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones.  
246 
 TABLE 4: DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE CONVERSION OF T4 TO T3  
Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the 
peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, 
serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly 
increased.  
DRUG OR DRUG CLASS  
Effect  
In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3  
Beta -adrenergic and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and 
patients are

Glucocorticoids decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with 
minimal change in (e.g., serum T4 levels. However, 
long -term glucocorticoid therapy may 
Dexamethasone result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 
levels due to decreased TBG ≥4 mg/day) production 
(see  above).  
 
Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine 
(T4) to Other drugs:  triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical 
changes  
Amiodarone  (increase in serum free -T4, and decreased or normal free -T3) 
in clinically euthyroid patients.  
7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of CYTOMEL therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic 
control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully 
monitor glycemic control, especially when CYTOMEL is started, changed, or discontinued 
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . 
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
CYTOMEL increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in 
the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or 
247 
 when the CYTOMEL dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit 
appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
CYTOMEL may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis 
glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, 
necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) 
antidepressants and CYTOMEL may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both 
drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects m ay 
include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. 
CYTOMEL may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in 
patients stabilized on CYTOMEL may result in increased CYTOMEL requirements.  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and CYTOMEL may produce marked hypertension and 
tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and CYTOMEL may increase the effects of 
sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of 
coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with 
coronary artery d isease.  
7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. 
Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
7.9 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and 
evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, 
estrogens, estrogencontaining oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria  
increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, 
acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper - 
or hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG 
deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
248 
 11 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing 
studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see 
Data).  There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism 
in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored 
and CYTOMEL dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are 
no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. CYTOMEL should  not be 
discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be 
promptly treated.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% 
and 15 to 20%, respectively.  
Clinical Considerations  
Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk  
Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of 
complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -eclampsia, 
stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an 
adverse e ffect on fetal neurocognitive development.  
Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period  
Pregnancy may increase CYTOMEL requirements. Serum TSH levels should be 
monitored and the CYTOMEL dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum 
TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the CYTOMEL dosage should return to 
the pre -pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.3)].  
Data  
Human Data  
Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data 
from postmarketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal 
malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes 
associated with liothyronine u se in pregnant women.  
8.2 Lactation  
249 
 Risk Summary  
Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, 
there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed 
infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The 
developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother's clinical need for CYTOMEL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed 
infant from CYTO MEL or from the underlying maternal condition.  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of CYTOMEL varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are 
based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] . 
In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been 
established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at 
least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial  period, and 
use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if 
warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].  
Congenital Hypothyroidism  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6)]  
Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the 
adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on 
overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately 
upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients.  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac 
overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may 
have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is 
associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of br ain 
maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure 
and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions 
(6)]. 
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may 
result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation 
and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in  
premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in 
some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, 
catch -up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions 
(6)]. 
250 
 8.5 Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate 
CYTOMEL at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and 
Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial 
fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone 
overtreatment in the elderly.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . In addition, confusion and disorientation may 
occur. Cerebral embolism, seizure, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Symptoms 
may not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after ingestion.  
Reduce the CYTOMEL dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage 
occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by the patient's medical status.  
For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the 
National Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 or www.poison.org.

251 
 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and 
protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus 
and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclea r receptor 
complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic 
proteins.  
The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the 
majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral 
tissues.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum 
pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural 
preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones.  
Distribution  
Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of 
levothyroxine  
(T4) for both thyroid -binding globulin and thyroid -binding prealbumin as compared to 
triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half -life of the 
former hormone. Both protein -bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute 
amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.  
Elimination  
Metabolism  
The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. 
Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. 
The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodina ted to 
diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with 
glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo 
enterohepatic recirculation.  
Excretion  
252 
 Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half -
life is about 2 –1/2 days.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
Thyroid hormones, including liothyronine sodium, either alone or with other 
therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. 
In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are 
ineffective for weight reduction.  
Larger doses may produce serious or even life -threatening manifestations of toxicity, 
particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for 
their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage 
(10)].  
264 
 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
1.1 Hypothyroidism  
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are indicated as a replacement therapy in primary 
(thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired 
hypothyroidism.  
1.2 Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression  
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine 
therapy in the management of well -differentiated thyroid cancer.  
1.3 Thyroid Suppression Test  
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are indicated as a diagnostic agent in suppression tests to 
differentiate suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.  
Limitations of Use  
 Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid 
nodules and nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine -sufficient patients as there are no clinical 
benefits and overtreatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may induce 
hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  
 Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism 
during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.  
2   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
2.1 General Principles of Dosing  
The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid -
Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the 
patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions 
(including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co -administered food and the specific 
nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage  
and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] 
. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made 
based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].  
Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily.  
2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism  
265 
 Adults   
The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg 
daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once 
daily.  
For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine 
Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the 
recommended intervals.  
Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients 
with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. 
Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population.  
Pediatric Patients   
The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 
days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg 
once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required . Above 3 
years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:   
Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as 
needed based on clinical and laboratory response.  
Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:   
To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one -fourth the 
recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one -
fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended 
Pregnancy   
Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during 
pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free -T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at 
minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, 
main tain serum TSH in the trimester -specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH 
above the normal trimesterspecific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and 
measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the 
normal trimester -specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre -pregnancy levels 
immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to 
ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate.  
2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well -Differentiated Thyroid Cancer  
 
266 
  
The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired 
therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH 
suppression.  
2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test  
The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine 
uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine 
Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop 
signi ficantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a 
normal thyroid -pituitary axis.  
2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP  
Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid  
preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium 
therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue 
levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage.  
Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response.  
2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels  
Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical 
evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an 
apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be 
eviden ce of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination 
of these factors.  
Adults   
In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after 
initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to 
therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be 
assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In 
patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical 
response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's cl inical 
status.  
Pediatrics   
In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy 
by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and 
older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose 
stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal 
267 
 values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, 
including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone 
maturation, at regular intervals.  
While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not 
normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary -
thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after 
initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate 
therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of 
administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see 
Warni ngs and Precautions (5.1) andUse in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism   
Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range.  
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  
Tablets (white to off-white, round, SC) available as follows:  
5 mcg: debossed “∑” on one side and “18” on the other side  
25 mcg: debossed “∑19” on one side and “BISECTED” on the other side  
50 mcg: debossed “∑20” on one side and “BISECTED” on the other side  
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal 
insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].  
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying 
Cardiovascular Disease  
Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall 
thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly 
in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liot hyronine sodium 
therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals 
or in patients without cardiac disease [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in 
Specific Populations (8.5)].  
Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary 
artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients 
receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents 
for signs and symp toms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop 
268 
 or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart 
at a lower dose.  
5.2 Myxedema Coma  
Myxedema coma is a life -threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and 
hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to 
treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hor mone products formulated for intravenous 
administration to treat myxedema coma.  
5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency  
Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid 
hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute 
adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal 
insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with 
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4)].  
5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over - or undertreatment with 
liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, 
cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, 
emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate 
the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration 
to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Monitor for the presence of 
drug  or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the 
dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control  
Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen 
glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronin e 
Sodium Tablets, USP  [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].  
5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over -
Replacement  
Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of 
thyroid hormone over -replacement, particularly in post -menopausal women. The increased 
bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion  of 
calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum 
parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, 
USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate a gainst this risk.  
269 
 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of 
hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 
and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following:  
General:  fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive 
sweating Central nervous system:  headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, 
irritability, emotional lability, insomnia  
Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps  
Cardiovascular:  palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, 
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest  
Respiratory:  dyspnea  
Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests 
Dermatologic:  hair loss, flushing  
Endocrine:  decreased bone mineral density  
Reproductive:  menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility

Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in 
pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in 
craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients 
with resultant compromised adult height.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions   
Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated 
with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, 
angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics  
Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. 
absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue 
response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see 
Tables 1 - 4). 
270 
  
TABLE 1: DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE T3 ABSORPTION (HYPOTHYROIDISM)  
 
 
Potential  impact:  Concurrent  use may reduce  the efficacy  of liothyronine  sodium  by 
binding  and delaying  or preventing  absorption,  potentially  resulting  in hypothyroidism.

-Cholestyramine 
-Colestipol  
Ion Exchange  
Resins  
-Kayexalate  
-Sevelamer  
Bile acid sequestrants  and ion exchange  resins are known  to decrease  
thyroid  hormones absorption.  Administer Liothyronine  Sodium  
to these  drugs  or monitor  TSH  
levels.

Class  Effect  
Clofibrate  
Estrogencontaining

contraceptives  
Estrogens (oral)  
Heroin /  
Methadone  
5-Fluorouracil  
Mitotane  
Tamoxifen  These drugs may increase serum thyroxine -
binding globulin (TBG)  
concentration  
Androgens /  
Anabolic  
Steroids

Glucocorticoids  These drugs may 
decrease serum TBG 
concentration  
271 
 Slow -Release  
Nicotinic Acid  
 
 
Salicylates (>2  
g/day)  
 Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG 
and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum 
FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal  
levels with sustained therapeutic serum 
salicylate concentrations, although total T4 
levels may decrease by as much as 30%.  
Other drugs:  
Carbamazepine  
Furosemide  >80 
mg IV Heparin  
Hydantoins Non - 
Steroidal 
Antiinflammatory  
Drugs  
- Fenamates H  These drugs may cause protein binding site 
displacement. Furosemide has been shown 
to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and  
albumin, causing an increased free -T4 
fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for 
T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and 
albumin, so  
that a single high dose can acutely lower the 
total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine 
reduce serum protein binding of thyroid 
hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced 
by 20% to 40%, but most patients  
have normal serum TSH levels and are 
clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid 
hormone parameters  
 
 Table  3: Drugs  That  May  Alter  Hepatic  Metabolism of Thyroid  hormones  
  
 
 
Table  4: Drugs  That  May  Decrease  Conversion of T 4 to T 3 
 
 Potential  impact:  Stimulation of hepatic  microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme  activity  
may cause  increased hepatic  degradation  of thyroid  hormones, resulting  in increased 
liothyronine  sodium  requirements. 
Drug  or Drug  
Class Effect 
 
Phenobarbital  
Rifampin Phenobarbital  has been  shown  to reduce  the response to thyroxine.  
Phenobarbital  increases L-thyroxine  metabolism by inducing  uridine 5' -
diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)  and leads  to a lower  T4 
serum  levels.  Changes  in thyroid  status  may occur  if barbiturates  are 
added  or withdrawn  from  patients  being  treated  for hypothyroidism.  
Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid  
hormones.  
Rifampin has been  shown  to accelerate  the metabolism of thyroid   
 
272 
 Potential  impact:  Administration of these  enzyme  inhibitors  decreases  the peripheral  
conversion of T4 to T3, leading  to decreased  T3 levels.  However,  serum  T4 levels  are 
usually  normal  but may occasionally be slightly  increased. 
Drug  or Drug  
Class Effect 
Beta-adrenergic 
antagonists  (e.g.,  
Propranolol 
>160  mg/day)  In patients  treated  with large  doses  of propranolol (>160  mg/day),  T3 
and T4 levels  change,  TSH  levels  remain normal,  and patients  are 
clinically euthyroid.  Actions  of particular  beta-adrenergic antagonists  
may be impaired when  a hypothyroid  patient  is converted to the 
euthyroid  state.  
Glucocorticoids  
(e.g.,  
Dexamethasone 
≥4 mg/day)  Short -term  administration of large  doses  of glucocorticoids  may 
decrease  serum  T3 concentrations  by 30%  with minimal  change  in 
serum  T4 levels.  However,  long-term glucocorticoid  therapy  may 
result  in slightly  decreased  T3 and T4 levels  due to decreased  TBG  
production  (see above).  
 
Other  drugs:  
Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits  peripheral  conversion of levothyroxine  (T4) to 
triiodothyronine  (T3) and may cause  isolated  biochemical changes  
(increase  in serum  free-T4, and decreased  or normal  free-T3) in 
clinically euthyroid  patients.  
 
7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy  
Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen 
glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. 
Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are 
started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  
7.3 Oral Anticoagulants  
Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, 
a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the 
hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor 
coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.  
7.4 Digitalis Glycosides  
Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum 
digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes 
euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.  
7.5 Antidepressant Therapy  
Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) 
antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects 
of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Tox ic 
effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system 
stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. 
273 
 Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in 
increased liothyronine sodium requirements.  
7.6 Ketamine  
Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension 
and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.  
7.7 Sympathomimetics  
Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of 
sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of 
coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with 
coron ary artery disease.  
7.8 Tyrosine -Kinase Inhibitors  
Concurrent use of tyrosine -kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism.  
Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.  
7.9 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions  
Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and 
evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, 
estrogens, estrogen -containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyri a 
increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, 
acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper - or 
hypo -thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of  TBG 
deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.  
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary   
Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post -marketing 
studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see 
Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism 
in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored 
and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). 
There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Li othyronine 
Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism 
diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
274 
 of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% 
and 15 to 20%, respectively.  
Clinical Considerations  
Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk  
Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of 
complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre -eclampsia, 
stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an 
adverse e ffect on fetal neurocognitive development.  
Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period  
Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be 
monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since 
postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium 
dosage shou ld return to the pre -pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.3)] . 
Data  
Human Data  
Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data 
from postmarketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal 
malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes 
associated with liothyronine u se in pregnant women.  
8.2 Lactation  
Risk Summary   
Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, 
there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the 
breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk 
production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be 
considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any 
potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the 
underlying mat ernal condition.  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. 
Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and 
laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].  
275 
 In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been 
established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at 
least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial  period, and 
use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if 
warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].  
Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6)]  
Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the 
adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on 
overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediate ly 
upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients.  
Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for 
cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.  
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may 
have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is 
associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of br ain 
maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure 
and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse 
Reactions (6)].  
Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients   
Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. 
Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired 
concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment 
may accelerate the bone age and result in  premature epiphyseal closure and 
compromised adult stature.  
Treated children may manifest a period of catch -up growth, which may be adequate in 
some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged 
hypothyroidism, catch -up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see 
Adverse Reactions (6)].  
8.5 Geriatric Use  
Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate 
Liothyronine  
Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in 
elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with 
thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly.  
276 
 10 OVERDOSAGE  
The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . In addition, confusion and disorientation may 
occur.  
Cerebral embolism, seizure, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Symptoms may 
not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after ingestion.  
Reduce the liothyronine sodium dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of 
overdosage occur. Initiate appropriate supportive treatment as dictated by the patient's 
medical status.  
For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the 
National Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 or www.poison.org.  
11 DESCRIPTION  
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP contain the active ingredient, liothyronine (L -
triiodothyronine or LT3), a synthetic form of a thyroid hormone liothyronine in sodium 
salt form. It is chemically designated as L -Tyrosine, O-(4-hydroxy -3-iodophenyl) -3,5-
diiodo -, monosodium salt. The molecular formula, molecular weight and structural 
formula of liothyronine sodium are given below.  
 
Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP contain liothyronine sodium equivalent to liothyronine in 
5 mcg,  
25 mcg, and 50 mcg. Inactive ingredients consist of calcium sulfate dihydrate, corn 
starch, gelatin, magnesium stearate and mannitol.  
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription 
and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L -thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell 
nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclea r 
receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and 
cytoplasmic proteins.  

277 
 The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the 
majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral 
tissues.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum 
pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural 
preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones.  
Distribution  
Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of 
levothyroxine  
(T4) for both thyroid -binding globulin and thyroid -binding prealbumin as compared to 
triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half -life of the 
former hormone. Both protein -bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute 
amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for  the metabolic activity.  
Elimination  
Metabolism  
The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination.  
Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. 
The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to 
diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with g lucuronides 
and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic 
recirculation.  
Excretion  
Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated 
hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half -
life is about 2 -1/2 days.  
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, 
mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of liothyronine sodium.

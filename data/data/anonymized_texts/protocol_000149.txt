Monoclonal Antibody to CD20 (Rituxi mab) for the Treatment of Systemic  Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary 
Arterial Hypertension (SSc-PAH) 
ACE Protocol Number:   ASC01  
Protocol Chair(s):   Mark Nicolls, MD; David Badesch, MD 
IND Holder: DAIT/NIAID/NIH 
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare patients with SSc-PAH treated with 
rituximab to those on placebo for change in exercise capacity, as determined by six minute walk distance 
(6MWD).

endpoint.  
 To evaluate the relationship between 6MWD, PVR, and other clinical measures.  
Study Arms:    
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either: 
 2 infusions of rituximab, 1000 mg  each, given 2 weeks apart, or 
 2 infusions of placebo given 2 weeks apart 
Study Design:   This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multi-center, randomized trial to 
evaluate the effect of rituximab on disease progression  in subjects with SSc-PAH receiving concurrent stable-
dose standard medical therapy with a prostanoid, endot helin receptor antagonist, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) 
inhibitor, and/or guanylate cyclase stimulators. The st udy will focus on assessment of clinical response and 
safety measures longitudinally. In addition, the effects of treatment with rituximab on the underlying immune 
mechanisms associated with B-cell dysregulation and pa thogenic autoantibody response in this disease will be 
investigated.   
 
Subjects with SSc-PAH with elevat ed mean pulmonary artery pressure as measured by right heart 
catheterization will be enrolled. The diagnosis of SSc-PAH should be confirmed   by a rheumatologist 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of systemic sclerosis in conjunction with a pulmonologist or cardiologist specializing in management of PAH. Both sp ecialists will be part of the study team at each site.  
 
Rituximab/placebo will be administered as two IV infu sions of 1000 mg each, given two weeks apart at Day 0 
and Week 2. All subjects will receive  40mg of prednisone orally the night before and morning of each 
infusion, as well as 100 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid intravenously thirty minutes prior 
to each infusion, with diphen hydramine and acetaminophen or ally thirty to sixty minut es prior to each infusion 
of rituximab or placebo. Subjec ts will remain on their baseline standard medical regimen.  
 
Sixty eligible subjects will be accrued.  Each potential study subject will provide written informed consent prior 
to screening procedures. All inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 4, Selection of Subjects ) must be met at 
time of randomization prior to receipt of the first dose of rituximab/placebo (Day 0, Treatment Initiation).  
 
Clinical assessments and sample collection will occur regularly through Week 48 with telephone follow-up 
conducted intermittently. If a subject has not recovered B cells by Week 48, B cell studies will be conducted quarterly until recovery is documented or for 2 years af ter initial treatment (whichever occurs first). Recovery 
is defined as the time point at which B cells recover to within 10% of baseline levels; if a baseline value is not 
available then recovery is defined as a B cell level of at least 90% of the lower limit of normal. During this 
quarterly monitoring period of B cell recovery, AEs an d SAEs will be assessed, providing the subject has not 
withdrawn consent, to capt ure any infectious event ≥  Grade 3 using the National Cancer Institute—Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). No additional study-related data will be collected. 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is th e change in 6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. 
Hemodynamic measures will be assessed at baseline and Week 24, contributing to the understanding of the 
relationship between PVR and clinical endpoints. Time to  clinical worsening will be assessed as a secondary 
outcome measure through Week 48, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between PVR and

Monoclonal Antibody to CD20 (Rituxi mab) for the Treatment of Systemic  Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary 
Arterial Hypertension (SSc-PAH) 
following treatment initiation. 
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints : 
1. All NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 AEs, which are defined as  possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
rituximab infusion.  
2. All NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 adverse events. 
3. All infection related events. 
4. Treatment-related mortality, defined as death occurring at any time after randomization and possibly, 
probably, or definitely resulting from treatment given in the study. Study investigators will make an initial determination of the cause of death of any subject and if uncertainty remains, a final decision 
will be made by an independent blinded panel after re viewing all clinical and, if available, autopsy 
data. 
5. All-cause mortality, defined as any death oc curring at any time after randomization. 
6. CD19+ B cell levels post treatment (note that anal yses will be performed regularly per Table 6.1 
through 48 weeks and quarterly thereaf ter as documented in Section 3.1, Description of Study 
Design ). 
7. Peripheral blood cell counts, liver function,  and creatinine levels after treatment. 
 
Exploratory Endpoints : 
Exploratory analysis of standardization of the PVR calculation will be based on PVR calculated from a 
standardized Fick calculation of cardiac output, which is a function of hemoglobin, arterial and mixed-venous saturations, and oxygen consumption according to the La-Farge and Miettinen formula. The cardiac output 
calculation is a function of assumed oxygen consumption according to the La-Farge calculation of values 
normalized for age, gender, heart rate. Calculation of a standardized Fick cardiac output will also allow for 
determination of the pulmonary artery capacitance (PACf). See Appendix E, Exploratory Analysis: 
Standardized Fick-based Pulmonary Vascular Resistance and Pulmonary Artery Capacitance  for details. 
Additionally, an exploratory analysis of the relationshi p between change in PVR and change in 6MWD will be 
addressed. Relationships with other clinical endpoin ts, like change in NTproBNP, will also be explored. 
Sample Size:  The study will include 30 subjects treated with rituximab and 30 subjects treated with placebo.   
Data Analyses :  The primary efficacy analysis of change in 6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks will be 
performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. and will be tested using a repeated measures random 
effects model to model change from baseline in 6MWD as the primary outcome and treatment as the primary 
predictor, controlling for visit day, limitations by musc uloskeletal disease, baseline levels of 6MWD, and a 
treatment by visit day interaction.  A random slope and in tercept will be fit for each subject.  An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be assumed for the random effect s. Additional covariates will be considered for this 
model as part of secondary analysis. 
 
Secondary analyses will include repeating the primary analysis in the per protocol population, subgroup 
analyses of the primary outcome, safety analyses, ex ploratory analyses of th e secondary endpoints, and 
exploratory analyses of the mechanistic endpoints.

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION A ND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
 Systemic Sclerosis – General Disease Concepts 1.1
 
Background :  Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a system ic connective tissue disease characterized 
by fibrosis and atrophy of the skin, joints and tendons, skeletal muscles,  and internal organs 
(e.g., lungs, heart, gastrointestinal tract,  and kidney) as well as by immunological 
disturbances [1]. SSc is a rare disease which is diagnosed in approxima tely 67 male patients 
and 265 female patients per 100,000 people each year in the United States. Internationally, 
SSc is estimated to occur in 20 people per million annually but is relatively rare in Japan and China. Overall, a substantial female predomin ance exists, with a female-to-male ratio of 3-
6:1 [2]. The limited cutaneous form of SSc has a more striking female predominance, with a 
female-to-male ratio of 10:1. SSc usually app ears in women aged 30-40 years and in slightly 
older men. In roughly 85% of cases, SSc develops  in individuals aged 20-60 years. Cases are 
also found among children and the elderly.   The clinical manifestations of SSc include Raynaud phenomenon and skin fibrosis and, in its severest form, sclerosis of multiple internal or gans with vascular inflammatory and fibrotic 
components. Of the numerous manifestations th at affect multiple organ systems, pulmonary 
involvement produces some of the most common  and serious complicatio ns of the disease. 
The major pulmonary manifestations of SSc are interstitial lung disease and systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypert ension (SSc-PAH). Estimates of the prevalence 
of PAH in patients with SSc have varied wi dely based on the definition of PAH and the 
method of obtaining the measurements (i.e. ca rdiac catheterization or echocardiography) but 
is thought to be between 8 and 12%. A conser vative estimate of PAH prevalence of 10% 
among patients with SSc in the United States would indicate a prevalence of 24 individuals per million, which may actually be higher than the number of patients affected by idiopathic 
PAH. Further, patients with SSc-PAH tend to have a worse prognosis compared to all other forms of PAH. One year survival rates fo r SSc-PAH patients range from 50-81%, which is 
considerably lower than the 88% one year surv ival rate for idiopathic PAH patients [3-5]. 
One study documented survival rates for indivi duals with SSc-PAH of 81%, 63% and 56% at 
1, 2, and 3 years from diagnosis respectively [4]. A more recent study again suggested a 3-
year survival rate of 52% in patients with SSc-PAH [6].  SSc-PAH assumes three basic forms: 1) se vere SSc-PAH accompanying limited cutaneous 
SSc, 2) SSc-PAH accompanying (secondary to) in terstitial lung diseas e, and 3) a more 
indolent form of SSc-PAH which reflects vasc ular pathology of SSc [7]. Although there 
appear to be different subtypes of SSc-PAH,  it is not known if and how the pathogenesis 
differs with each form. In all patients with SSc, SSc-PAH significantly worsens survival and is the leading cause of mortality in these patients.  Treatment for this disease is currently limited to the same vasodilator therapy employed in all forms of PAH. An evaluation of 91 patients with  PAH treated with pros tanoids revealed that 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 23 of 135 Confidential

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 SSc-PAH patients had the worst survival of all subgroups analyzed [8]. SSc-PAH is a life-
threatening illness for which there is currently no cure.  SSc-PAH Pathology:  Lungs from patients with SSc-PAH ex hibit a characteristic vascular 
pathology, the plexiform lesion, which is structur ally similar to plexiform lesions found in 
other PAH conditions such as idiopathic P AH and HIV-associated PAH [9]. In SSc-PAH, 
both plexiform and concentric obl iterative lesions st ain positively for factor VIII-related 
antigen consistent with abnormal endothelial ce ll proliferation. Macrophages, T and B cells 
are noted clustering in and around the vasc ular lesions. Intere stingly, the primary 
proliferative abnormalities within the pulmonary arterial walls are similar to those found in 
SSc digital arteries. Both digital and pulmonary arteries have medial and advential fibrosis 
that lead to struct ural luminal narrowing. 
 
Pathogenesis of SSc and SSc -PAH : Endothelial cell apoptosis ma y be the first event in the 
pathogenesis of the disease [10]. Anti-endothe lial cell antibodies (A ECA) are found in the 
circulation of SSc patients and have been posit ed to play a role in the development of 
vascular disease found in SSc, including PAH [11]. An instigati ng injury to endothelial cells 
in SSc that may trigger such autoantibody forma tion may be a viral infection [12]. A number 
of investigators have found evidence for vira l infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, 
parvovirus B19 and hepatitis C, E, and G in pa tients with SSc [13-18]. Although the role of 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the pa thogenesis of SSc is debated [ 19], indirect evidence for a 
role of CMV-specific antibodies in the developm ent of this disease has also been presented 
[20, 21]. Not only are absolute lymphocyte counts reduced in SSc [22, 23], but SSc patients 
also have relatively fewer CD4
+CD25+ cells in the peripheral circulation compared to healthy 
controls [24]. In this setting of diminished regulatory T cells , a dysregulation of B cells is 
also observed [25]. Of note is th at CD19 expression is increased by ≈ 20% on B cells in 
patients with SSc, while other B cell mark ers CD20, CD22 and CD40 are normally expressed 
[26]. Several different autoantibodies have b een implicated in disease pathogenesis; anti-
topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) and anticentrom ere antibodies, for example, are relatively 
specific for SSc [27], whereas  an antibody to Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and anti-
topoisomerase II have been associated with localized scleroderma [28, 29]. In summary, SSc 
is an autoimmune disorder that has been asso ciated with viral infection, endothelial damage, 
diminished regulatory T cells, dysregulated B cells, abundant mast cells, and serum 
autoantibodies.   
 
Specific Concepts Concerning SSc-PAH Pathogenesis:  Very little is known about the 
pathogenesis of SSc-PAH, but it appears to be  a complex and multifactorial process. Unlike 
familial PAH, SSc-PAH has not been found to  be associated with a mutation of bone 
morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), a member of the TGF- β superfamily of 
receptors [30]. However, it has been r ecognized that altered expression of TGF- β superfamily 
receptors, interacting proteins, or downstream  signaling molecules occurs in SSc [31-33]. 
Defects in the balance of vasoc onstrictors and vasodilators have  been another research focus 
in SSc-PAH with a notable elevation of endothe lin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor [34].

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 In addition to interest in TGF-β  superfamily alterations and a bnormal vascular tone, there is 
significant work focusing on dysregulated imm unity in the pathogenesis of SSc and SSc-
PAH. Plexiform lesions found in the arteri al walls of SSc PAH patients include an 
inflammatory infiltrate [35] consisting of macrophages, T cells , B cells, and mast cells [36, 
37]. 
 Figure 1 presents a model which integrates what is known generally about SSc pathogenesis, 
including the concept of abnormal Treg be havior, and speculates how this immune 
dysregulation could culminate in SSc-PAH.  
 
 Figure 1. Immune Dysregulation in SSc (Adapted from Hasegawa et al., 2005 [38])  The 
panel on the left demonstrates that patients with SSc have a preponderance of Th2 cytokines which work in concert with growth factors to promote tissue fibrosis. The panel on the right is a model showing the putative relationship between systemic autoimmunity (possibly 
contributed to by abnormal Treg activity) and ti ssue fibrosis in SSc and how this could 
culminate in vascular injury and SSc-PAH.  Endothelial alterations may lead  to a cascade of stimulatory ch anges that involve many cells, 
including T cells, macrophages, mast cells, and fibroblasts. Once activated, these cells 
secrete a variety of substances, including en zymes and their inhibito rs and cytokines and 
their soluble receptors. These substances lead to  changes in the extracellular matrix proteins, 
including fibronectin; proteoglycans; and collag en types I, III, V, and VII which results in 
fibroproliferative changes [39]. Activation of the immune system  appears to be of paramount 
importance in the pathogenesis of SSc. Antigen-activated T cells infiltrate the skin and produce the profibrotic cytokine IL-4. B cells may contribute to fibrosis, as deficiency of 
CD19, a B-cell transduction molecule, results in  decreased fibrosis in animal models as 
described below.  TH2

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 The chemokine CXCL4 was recently found to provide a link between plasmacytoid dendritic 
cell activity and the evolution of SSc. A proteome-wide screen showed CXCL4 to be the only chemokine that predicted the risk a nd progression of SSc.  This landmark study 
demonstrated that high plasma CXCL4 levels were associated both with skin and lung 
fibrosis, as well as PAH. For this reason, we  have added serial measurement of CXCL4 to 
the current study [40]. 
 
 Current Treatment for Systemic Sclerosis-Associated PAH 
1.1.1
 
Standard treatment for PAH includes therapeutics that address three major pathways 
involved in the abnormal proliferation and cont raction of the smooth-muscle cells of the 
pulmonary artery including the endothelin pathwa y, nitric oxide pathway and prostacyclin 
pathway ( Figure 2 ) [41]. Chronic prostacyc lin infusion therapy does not provide a cure for 
PAH [42].  
 
Figure 2. The Three Major Pathways Targeted by Conventional PAH Therapies [41] . 
 Previously, the continuous infusion of th e potent vasodilator prostacyclin has been 
considered maximum therapy for severe P AH [43-47]. More recently, the concept of 
combination therapy, such as an endothelin receptor blocker, or a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, with prostacyclin, is  being evaluated. In addition, patients receive anticoagulation

attempts to give prednisone or cytoxan,  immunotherapy has rarely been used or 
systematically studied in SSc-PAH [46-49]. Unfo rtunately, currently offered medical therapy 
will usually fail in time and can only serve as a bridge to lung transplantation. Another major 
limitation of current medical therapies is cost , which can be more than $100,000 per year. 
Thus, the need for a new therapeutic regimen in SSc-PAH is significant. 
 
 Summary of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Studies 1.2
 Pre-Clinical Studies 1.2.1
 
CD19, a critical cell-surface sign al transduction molecule of B cells, is the most positive 
response regulator of B cells and has been implicated in SSc. Transgenic mice which 
overexpress CD19 lose self tolerance and gene rate autoantibodies s pontaneously [50]. CD19 
overexpression in the tight-skin mouse model of SSc results in increased autoantibody 
production [51] whereas CD19 deficiency signifi cantly decreases skin fibrosis [52]. B cell 
depletion in the tight-skin mous e model was recently noted to be effective in reducing skin 
fibrosis and autoimmunity during the initiation of disease, but was not effective in established disease [53]. This has led Dr. Te dder and colleagues to hypothesize that chronic 
B cell activation due to augmented CD19 signali ng leads to skin fibrosis and enhanced 
autoimmunity in SSc [54, 55].  The preclinical studies from our group, which we re an impetus for the development of the 
current trial, broadly describe the phenomena of autoimmunity in PAH [56]. Inbred athymic 
nude rats treated with the Vascular Endothelial  Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, 
SU5416, develop significant vascular remodelin g and severe PAH at Denver altitude [57]. 
Our experimental model of PAH occurs because of the absence of regulatory T cell activity . 
Unlike most published experimental models, th is model does not require hypoxic conditions 
for disease initiation and progression.  However, athymic animals uniquely devel oped severe PAH following SU5416 treatment 
when exposed to chronic hypoxia. The data shown in Figure 3  demonstrate that T cells play 
a protective role following vascular injury. Immune reconstitution of T cells with regulatory function prevents the development of PAH in athymic nude rats treated with SU5416 as well as the accumulation of B cells  and anti-endothelial cell antibodies in the lungs of these 
animals.

activity, inflammation with macrophages and B cells are significant, and systemic 
inflammation is detectable in  the peripheral circulation.

Version 8.0  24 April 2017  
Figure 5. Model of immune regulation contri buting to vascular health and immune 
dysregulation favoring vascular dise ase following endothelial injury . In this model of 
PAH, endothelial injury, causes a local immune  response. With normal immune regulation, 
vascular injury does not culminate in pulmona ry vascular remodeling and PAH. The absence 
of normal immune regulation resu lts in an inappropriately exube rant inflammatory response, 
accelerated endothelial cell apoptosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and increased pulmonary 
vascular resistance.  
 
To summarize, in T-cell defi cient animals an accumulation of B cells and macrophages was 
noted within one week of SU 5416 administration. These findings were not seen in athymic 
nude rats that underwent immune reconstitu tion prior to SU5416 administration. These 
results are concordant with the fact that the loss of self-tolerance in animals missing normal 
Treg populations is associated with the appearance of variou s autoantibodies and 
autoimmune disease [59, 60]. With  complete elimination of CD4+CD25hi cells, systemic 
autoimmunity occurs as manifested by multiorgan inflammation and autoantibody production [61]. Thus a loss of Treg-mediated self toleranc e leads not only to a loss of T cell tolerance 
but also to a breakdown in B ce ll tolerance. This latter princi ple suggested that a therapy 
which addressed autoreactive B cells and possibl y self-directed antibodie s could be effective 
in PAH associated with immune dysregulation. As  noted, this finding is relevant in SSc-PAH 
patients who likely have abnormal Treg functionality.  Dysregulated B cell immunity, as a direct consequence of diminished regulatory T cell 
control in the T-cell deficient athymic rat model,  is important because at this time B cells can 
be more easily targeted with a therapeutic in tervention than can abnor mal Treg activity. To

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 this end, the effect of B cell depletion is cu rrently being characterized in the athymic rat 
model using SU5416. Other animal models rele vant to SSc-PAH have already been treated 
with B cell depletion, and results are promising.  In addition to the studies of B cell depletion 
in the tight skinned mouse discussed above, at  the 2011 American Thoracic Society Meeting 
in Denver, Dr. Norbert Voelkel, an internat ionally-recognized PAH investigator, presented 
data showing that anti-CD20 therapy amelio rates severe PAH in a unique inflammatory 
model of PAH. In this model, PAH is i nduced by exposing immunocompetent rats to 
ovalbumin sensitization and vascular injury wi th a VEGF receptor antagonist. This regimen 
leads to significant inflammatory PAH associat ed with Th2 inflammation. This exciting new 
model may be directly relevant to SSc-PAH because of the noted Th2 skewing. Data using 
this model of PAH shows that B cell depletion ca n be significantly protective against severe 
PAH [62]. 
 Clinical Studies 1.2.2
 Considered generally, therapies for localized scleroderma have tended to yield more positive 
results than those for SSc. However, treatments for localized scleroderma have also been less vigorously investigated in randomized, cont rolled trials [63]. Molecular analysis 
demonstrates the involvement of CD20-positiv e cells in SSc [64] although histochemical 
evidence has been more inconsistent [64, 65]. Investigators comparing skin biopsy samples from four scleroderma patients with samples from matched controls by micro-array gene 
analysis found that B-lymphocyte-specific gene s were up-regulated in skin from patients 
with SSc [64]. Immunohistochemistry of patients’ skin showed a predominance of CD20-positive cells in a perieccrine distribution in one of the patients. In contrast, stains for CD3 
and CD138 were negative, indicating a relativ e absence of T cells and plasma cells, 
respectively.  
Lafyatis et al. treated 15 SSc patients with di ffuse skin thickening with rituximab. They 
showed that, as expected, peripheral blood B cells  were depleted, but also that the modest B 
cell infiltrates present in most of the skin biopsies at baseline were markedly reduced or 
completely absent on repeat skin biopsy 6 mont hs after treatment (mean B cell score declined 
from 10.4 to 3.4). Thus, rituximab was able to deplete B cells not only in peripheral blood 
but also in affected tissues [66].  There is very little published data on the use of rituximab in SSc lung disease. A compelling 
case report of SSc-PAH was recently published [67] . The patient presented with interstitial 
lung disease, but on closer review of the case the principal and potenti ally life- threatening 
manifestation was SSc-PAH. This patient improved dramatically after rituximab therapy and would likely have qualified for the current trial.  In these and othe r unpublished cases, the 
effect of B cell depletion has been striking w ith reversal of advan ced and life-threatening 
disease. While a specific antigenic target has not been identified in SSc-PAH, platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF)-specific antibodies  have recently been identified as highly 
prevalent in SSc [68]. SSc pati ents who received rituximab had lower titers of anti-PDGF 
antibodies, less skin fibrosis, significantly improved health assessment questionnaire scores, decreased Type I collagen production, and decreased production of fibroblast-reactive

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 oxygen species in vitro. Further, skin biopsie s from 11 patients treated with rituximab in a 
Phase I study showed no progression of fibros is; sequential biopsies were remarkable for a 
significant reduction of derm al myofibroblasts [69]. 
 
In PAH, even partial reversal of disease has th e potential to be life-saving. In this respect, 
some patients have shown clinical improvement  in their PAH with rituximab. In several 
unpublished cases (e.g. a case of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia-associated PAH in Denver, Colorado), patients have enjoyed significant clinical improvement following 
rituximab therapy. The following is an example of one such case from Stanford University Medical Center: A 30 year old patient with SLE presented with Class IV heart failure 
symptoms, along with necrotizi ng digital ulcers. An echocardi ogram revealed an RVEF of 
10% and an LVEF of 35% along with evidence of myocarditis. While the patient's left 
ventricular function improved with diuresis a nd pulse steroids, the patient's right heart 
systolic pressures were systemic. The patien t did not respond to cyclophosphamide and was 
subsequently treated with several doses of rituximab. Within weeks, the patient's symptoms improved dramatically with a fall in the pulmona ry artery pressures from the 80s-90s to 25 
mmHg and Class II heart failure symptoms (Dr. Roham Zamanian; personal communication). Another illustrative case at Stanford involved a woman with PAH 
secondary to the antiphospholipid anti body syndrome. The patient had suffered 
thromboembolic disease, and despite havi ng undergone thromboendarterectomy twice, 
continued to have worsening symptoms of PAH. The patient was anticoagulated with coumadin and was treated with prostacyclin . The patient also suffered from severe 
thrombocytopenia and developed intracranial hemorrhages necessitating discontinuation of 
coumadin. The patient was treated with rituxi mab and enjoyed a significant improvement in 
her clinical findings with nor malization of her platelet c ounts and downgrading to Class II 
symptoms. This improvement, attributed to ritu ximab, led to the conversion from intravenous 
prostacyclin to oral therapy. In summary, while there has been relatively little published to date on the use of rituximab in SSc, there appears to be a strong scientific and clinical basis for exploring this potential therapy, which is well studied in other diseases, in SSc patients who otherwise do not have much hope for long-term survival. 
 Rituximab/Treatment Background 
1.3
 Current Licensing of Rituximab 1.3.1
 In 1997, rituximab was approved for treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory low-
grade or follicular, B cell non-Hodgkin’s ly mphoma. Rituximab is also approved for 
retreatment of lymphoma patients who have relapsed following initial rituximab therapy. 
Approved dosing is 375 mg/m
2 each week for 4 or 8 doses. In March 2006, rituximab in 
combination with methotrexate was approved fo r use in the treatment of moderately to 
severely active rheumatoid ar thritis (RA) patients who have had an inadequate response to 
one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. The approved dosing for RA is two infusions of 1000 mg given two weeks apart. In April 2011, the indications for rituximab (with dosing similar to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) were expanded to include

 Other Diseases in Which Rituximab Use Has Been Described 1.3.2
 
This IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody was originally developed and approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In addition,  rituximab has been used in the treatment 
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [70] and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia [71-73]. Post-approval experience has been estimated to in clude more than 2,484,131 (Genentech, 2011) 
patient exposures.  Although reactions frequently occur with  the first infusion, most are Grade 
1 toxicity and respond to slowing or temporarily  interrupting the infusion. In general, the 
drug has proven to be well tolerated, and seriou s reactions are very rare  [74]. The period of B 
cell depletion with standard regimens of rituxi mab frequently averages 4 to 7 months [75, 
76]. A total of 8.4% of patients from the A ll Exposure RA population demonstrated a CD19 
count < lower limit of normal for 2 years or more following their last rituximab exposure. 
1.5% of these patients had CD19 counts below th e lower limit of quantification for at least 2 
years. These patients are generally representa tive of the RA population with long-standing 
disease, previous use of multiple DMARDs, and high use of oral corticosteroids. Of note is the proportion of patients with low peripheral B- cell counts at baseline, prior to rituximab 
treatment, which correlates with those pa tients whose counts showed prolonged B cell 
depletion. The clinical relevance of prolonged peripheral B-cell depletion beyond two years following rituximab treatment is unknown; no safety signal has been identified in the prolonged B cell monitoring trials. The pattern of  peripheral B cell depletion and repletion in 
granulomatosis with polyangi itis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients 
included in the RAVE study was similar to that prev iously observed in patients with RA [77].  
Effects on total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels have  been much less striking, and evidence of 
immunodeficiency related to hypogammaglobulinemia  has been rare. While rituximab results 
in the near-complete depletion of  circulating B cells, the exact mechanism(s) of this effect 
remains poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms  include induction of apoptosis, cellular 
clearance by the reticuloendothelial system  through bound antibodies, complement mediated 
cell lysis, and antibody-d ependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via Fc -bearing effector 
cells. One of the Fc receptors that may be involved in anti-CD20 mediated ADCC is Fc 
gamma receptor 3A (Fc RIIIA), and FCGR3A  polymorphisms have been shown to influence 
the response to rituximab [78, 79]. In studies of patients with lymphoma and SLE, homozygosity for the 158V allele predicted more complete depletion than homozygous 158F or heterozygous 158VF alleles.   In addition to the treatment of hematologic malig nancies, rituximab has been used to treat a 
variety of autoimmune disorders. Rituximab has been licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis 
refractory to TNF antagonists in combination with  methotrexate after several large clinical 
trials demonstrated a reduction in disease activity [80-82]. Rituximab has recently been 
investigated as a treatment for SLE (renal and extrarenal) in ra ndomized, double-blind, 
placebo controlled trials. However, these studies failed to meet their primary efficacy

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 endpoints [83, 84]. Small studies and case series  have examined the use of rituximab in a 
variety of the autoimmune diseases includi ng SLE [85-88], autoimmune hemolytic anemia 
[89], immune or idiopathic  thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [90, 91], and Sjogren’s 
syndrome [86, 92-99]. Early phase uncontrolled studies have also reported on the use of 
rituximab in other types of autoimmune dis ease, including, pemphigus vulgaris [100-103], 
dermatomyositis [104], polymyositis  [105, 106], and others not reviewed in this document. In 
small, uncontrolled clinical studies investigating the use of rituximab in a total of 420 
patients with pemphigus vulgaris overall clin ical response rates ranging from 30-90% (with 
variable definitions of response have been report ed [77]. A recent report of a phase II trial in 
relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis suggested th at rituximab had beneficial effect even 
though traditionally MS is not felt to be pr imarily an autoantibody me diated disease [107]. 
Recently, rituximab has been demonstrated to be efficacious in inducing disease remission in 
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmi c autoantibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis [108, 109]. 
 
 Known and Potential Risks of Rituximab Treatment 1.4
 
The label for rituximab includes four “black  box” warnings: infusion reactions, severe 
mucocutaneous reactions, progressive multifocal  leukoencephalopathy (PML), and hepatitis 
B virus reactivation.   
1. Infusion reactions :   Rituximab is associated wi th infusion-related/acute infusion 
reactions, which may be due to release of cy tokines and/or other chemical mediators. 
Rituximab-induced reactions and sequ elae include urticaria, hypotension, 
angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventri cular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, 
anaphylactoid events, or death. Severe in fusion-related reactions with fatal outcome 
have been reported during clin ical trials and post-marke ting use in oncology patients 
at a rate of approximately 0.04-0.07% (4 to  7 patients per 10,000). These deaths have 
primarily been related to th e large B cell burden in oncology patients with resultant 
tumor lysis and cytokine storm after rituxi mab treatment. Approximately 80% of fatal 
reactions occur after the firs t infusion of rituximab, with time to onset of 30-120 
minutes. While approximately 32% of R ituxan-treated patients in RA placebo-
controlled trials experienced an adverse infusion reaction during or within 24 hours 
following their first infusion, less than 1% were serious reactions. Since rituximab was first approved in February 2006, there have been four cases of fatal infusion-
related reactions in RA patients treated with this agent.   
2. Severe mucocutaneous reactions:  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
have been reported in patients treated with  rituximab. These reactions are rare, and 
the causal relationship to rituximab is difficult to determine, especially given the multiple medications these patients receive  and the various autoimmune syndromes 
associated with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [110]. Reports of these events show 
variable onset time relative to rituximab e xposure, with onset occu rring as early as the 
day of first infusion. Some mucocutaneous re actions have been fatal. These reactions 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 34 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 have been reported very rare ly in patients with autoi mmune diseases treated with 
rituximab.  A fatal outcome was reported in  less than 1 in 100,000 patients in the 
post-marketing setting [77]. 
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):  PML has been reported in 
patients with autoimmune disease after receiving rituximab. PML is a demyelinating 
disease caused by the JC virus, a human polyoma virus. Approximately 80% of the population is seropositive for JC virus, which persists in a latent form but can reactivate in immunosuppressed patients. PM L has been reported in a variety of 
immunosuppressed or immunodeficient patients in cluding transplant patients, patients 
receiving chemotherapy, and HIV-infected pa tients independent of treatment with 
rituximab, and most recently in patients receiving natalizumab [111, 112]. Fatal cases 
of PML have also been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies and a variety of autoimmune diseases, includ ing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, 
lupus), RA, and vasculitis following rituximab treatment. In general, the patients with 
autoimmune diseases had prior or concu rrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases 
of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of  the last infusion of rituximab. There 
have been 3 fatal reports of PML in patient s with RA who had received rituximab (3 
reports in 100,000 patients with RA exposed to  rituximab), with one case in a patient 
exposed to rituximab who had not receive d prior TNF antagonist therapy but had 
been treated with leflunomide. The role of  rituximab alone in the development of 
PML is unclear. The risk of developmen t of PML is unknown for individuals with 
SSc-PAH treated with rituximab. Recogni tion of PML requires a high index of 
suspicion. Patients who are considering or  who have taken rituximab should be 
informed about the risks of developing PM L, including that there is no effective 
treatment for PML. Patients who have been treated with rituximab should contact their doctor if they present with new neur ological manifestati ons (including, but not 
limited to: confusion, dizziness, lo ss of balance, difficulty ta lking or walking or visual 
problems). Consultation with a neurologist , brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should 
be considered as clinically indicated.  
4. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation : HBV reactivation has been reported in patients 
treated with CD20-directed cytolic antibody drugs, which include rituximab. In some 
cases this has resulted in fulminant hepati tis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases are not 
limited to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, but have also been reported in patients who are HBsAg negative but  hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) 
positive. Additionally, reactivation has occurred in patients with apparent resolved hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and hepatitis B surface 
antibody [anti-HBs] positive). 
 In addition to risks communicated explicitly by the “black box” warnings, the package insert for rituximab reports adverse reac tions observed in controlled tria ls. Events that seem to be 
specific to use in malignancy are Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), severe  renal toxicity, and 
bowel obstruction/perforation. Cases of acute  renal failure, hyperk alemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia,  some fatal, have been re ported within 24 hours after 
first infusion.  The risk of TLS correlates with  number of circulating malignant cells or high

Version 8.0  24 April 2017 tumor burden. Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation have occurred in patients 
receiving rituximab in combination with chem otherapy. Some of these cases were fatal. 
 
Adverse reactions observed in tr ials with RA patients have b een reported separately from 
those observed in malignancy trials. Informati on to date reflects experience in 2578 RA 
patients treated with rituximab in controlled and long-term studies (total exposure of 5014 patient-years). RA patients are lik ely to be more similar to the patients with SSc-PAH studied 
in this protocol due to the autoimmune association of the disease.  Adverse events (AEs) 
occurring at a rate > 2% in RA patients w ho were given rituximab (or 1% greater than 
placebo), per the package insert are listed below:   
1. The common adverse events occurring in rit uximab treated patients (greater than 10%) 
included infusion reactions, upper respirator y infection, nasophar yngitis, urinary tract 
infection, and bronchitis.     
2. Infusion reactions – In studies enrolling subjects with RA , 32% of rituximab-treated 
patients experienced an adverse reaction dur ing or within 24 hour s following the first 
infusion, compared to 23% of placebo-treated patients. This freque ncy decreased to 11% 
for rituximab-treated patients and 13% for placebo-treated patients for adverse events occurring within 24 hours following the second infusion. Serious acute infusion reactions 
were experienced by < 1% of patients in either  the rituximab or placebo treatment groups. 
Acute infusion reactions requiring dose modi fication (stopping, inte rrupting, or slowing 
the infusion) occurred in 10% of rituximab treated patients and 2% of placebo treated 
patients. Acute infusion reactions (fever, chills, rigors, prurit is, urticaria/rash, 
angioedema, sneezing, throat irritation, cough, and/or bronchospasm with or without 
hypotension or hypertension) occu rred with the first infusion in 27% of the rituximab 
treated patients and 19% of the placebo treated patients. Severe infusion reactions 
typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset 30 to 120 minutes after 
starting the infusion. These reactions may include hypoxia and cardiovascular collapse, 
angioedema or bronchospasm, pulmonary infilt rates including acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiog enic shock. Milder 
infusion reactions include fever and chills, flushing, fatigue, pallor, headache, rhinitis, 
nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, chest pressure, and back pain. 
These reactions are similar to those describe d for IV immunoglobulin  (IVIG). With IVIG, 
some patients are more sensitive to in fusion reactions but “sensitivity” and “non-
sensitivity” are relative terms since slow infu sions are tolerated by “s ensitive” individuals 
[113]. Moreover, “sensitive” patients can beco me desensitized to the infusion reaction, 
i.e. if several infusions were given over a short period of time the infusion reaction 
disappeared or at least became less severe . There are some data indicating that 
prophylactic glucocorticoids may ame liorate these reac tions [114, 115].  
3. Infections – In the pooled studies, infections occurred in  39% of rituximab treated 
patients and 34% of placebo tr eated patients. Serious infect ions occurred in 2% of 
rituximab treated patients and 1% of control patients. The most common infections were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infecti ons, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and 
sinusitis. The numbers of upper respiratory tract and rhinitis  infections were slightly 
higher in the rituximab group (showed an absolu te increase over place bo of at least 1%). 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 36 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 In the experience with rituximab in RA pa tients the most common serious infections ( ≥ 
0.5%) were pneumonia or lower respiratory trac t infections, cellulitis, and urinary tract 
infections. Fatal serious infections incl uded pneumonia, sepsis and colitis [116].  
4. Cardiac events – Serious cardiovascular events occurred in 1.7% of rituximab treated 
patients and 1.3% of placebo treated patients (pooled data ). Cardiovascular deaths 
occurred in 0.4% of rituximab treated patient s and 0% of placebo treated patients. Three 
cardiovascular deaths occurred during RA studi es (all rituximab regimens) as compared 
to none in the placebo group. Myocardial infarction (MI) rates were consistent with rates in the general RA population. Patients with significant PAH may have baseline hypotension. In addition, the therapies used to treat PAH can cause hypotension. Exacerbation of hypotension in subjects with SSc-PAH treated with rituximab should be 
anticipated given the potential for the infu sion itself to precipitate cardiac events.  
5. Hypophosphatemia and hyperuricemia – In the pooled data, newly occurring 
hypophosphatemia was observed in 12% of patient s receiving rituximab compared to10% 
of patients on placebo. Newly occurring hyperuricemia was observed in 1.5% of patients receiving rituximab and 0.3% of patients on placebo. The RA specific data showed 
newly-occurring hypophosphatemia in 21% of patients, with newly occurring 
hyperuricemia in 2% of patients. The majo rity of observed hypophosphatemia occurred at 
the time of the infusions and was transient. 
6. Immunogenicity – Approximately 11% of ritu ximab treated RA patients tested positive 
for human anti-chimera antibody (HACA). Of  8 patients who had a serious infusion 
reaction, 2 were HACA positive. Approximate ly 12% of HACA positive patients who 
were re-treated with rituximab ha d a subsequent infusion reaction.  
 The implications of these observed events  call for further discussion. For example, 
determining the effect of rituximab on infecti ons is problematic sin ce patients treated with 
rituximab often have concomitant immunodefi ciency and/or are on immunosuppressive 
drugs. In patients treated for B cell lymphomas, the incidence of serious infections (grade III 
or IV including sepsis) is about 2%. One reassuring finding has been the observation in 
several studies that total serum IgG and leve ls of protective IgG an tibodies are generally 
maintained after treatment with rituxi mab [117, 118]. Cases of hypogammaglobulinemia 
have been reported [119-122]. Cr iteria supporting the use of IV IG should probably be similar 
to those used for other patients with seconda ry humoral immunodeficien cy, for example: (i) 
low levels of protective antibodies to encapsula ted organisms, viruses, or bacterial toxins 
without a response to immunization; (ii) severe hypogammaglobulinemia (serum IgG < 200 
mg/dL); and (iii) increased rate, severity, or duration of infections, especially infections of 
the respiratory system or with encapsula ted organisms including, but not limited to, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria meningitides [123, 124]. 
 Serious viral infections, either new, reactivated, or exacerbate d, have been reported after use 
of rituximab including CMV, herpes simplex virus,  West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. Some of 
these infections resulted in fatal outcom es up to 1 year following discontinuation of 
rituximab [116]. Most of these se rious viral infections occurred in patients with hematologic 
malignancies receiving combinati on chemotherapy with rituximab.

__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 An expected complication of rituximab therapy is failure to respond to vaccines. This was 
originally described in non-human  primates treated with rituximab but has been confirmed in 
lymphoma patients, patients on dialysis, and patients with SLE [125- 128]. Additional studies 
are needed to determine when this effect re solves. Inhibition of hu moral immune responses 
poses a special problem with unusual pathogens including, but not limited to, parvovirus B19 
or infections where toxins are important. Subjects in this trial will be vaccinated against 
pneumococcal pneumonia before entry. Subjects enroll ed in this trial will continue to receive 
annual influenza vaccines and will be informed that the vaccine may not be fully protective. 
Vaccination with live vaccines is  not recommended, as the safety of immunization with live 
vaccines following rituximab treatment has not  been studied. Non-liv e vaccinations should 
be given at least 4 weeks prior to administration of rituximab. 
 Although neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been associated with rituximab, cases are 
generally transient and do not cause clinically significant probl ems. Late onset neutropenia 
(LON) with rituximab has been described in patients treated with aggressive chemotherapy 
for hematological malignancies, but no such cases have been reported in patients with 
autoimmune disease.  LON may also predispose one to infections. There are a number of reports of LON after 
treatment of lymphomas with rituximab [129]. In a recent report, LON was investigated in 
130 patients with B cell lymphoma  receiving chemotherapy with or without rituximab [130]. 
LON was detected in 6 of 76 patients receivi ng rituximab and 0 of 54 patients not receiving 
rituximab. The median nadir neutrophil count for the patients who developed LON was 200; 
the lowest counts were 23 and 32. Onset occu rred at an average of 175 days (77-204 days) 
post treatment and lasted an av erage of 14 days (11-16 days). One patient developed a buccal 
cellulitis; the other 5 patients were asymptoma tic. Neutropenia responded to growth factors. 
Preliminary data suggests an association betw een B cell recovery and granulocyte decline. 
These changes in B cell recovery and granulocyt e decline were also correlated with changes 
in the level of SDF-1, a chemokine affecting both B cell and granulocyt e homeostasis. Since 
blood counts were only checked every 3 months, the authors estimated that they probably 
missed more cases of neutropenia than th ey found. Whether LON will be seen in non-
malignant disease treated with rituximab is unc lear, but until we have more data, neutrophil 
counts should be carefully monitored.    Rituximab is a humanized antibody but its vari able regions are stil l of mouse origin. 
Therefore an immune response against rituximab (HACAs) can be seen. The clinical relevance of HACAs as a result of treatment w ith rituximab is unclear. Infusion reactions and 
rapid clearance have been li nked to HACAs against other hu manized monoclonal antibodies, 
including infliximab [131]. With inflix imab, higher dose and/or combination with 
methotrexate reduced the occurrence of HACA s. However, 2 studies have been performed 
suggesting that subjects who develop serum an tibodies to infliximab bind unique epitopes 
that do not cross-react with other antibodies, including rituximab [132, 133]. Anti-rituximab 
HACAs are rare among patients with lymphomas treated with this drug, and these HACAs 
are generally of low titer [134]. However, in a phase I/II dose escalation study of rituximab 
for SLE, high titer HACAs were detected in 6 of 17 patients [86]. Several factors may have 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 38 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 contributed to this unusual rate of HACA forma tion including the low dose of rituximab in 
the first two dose groups, the use of oral rather  than IV steroids as prophylaxis for infusion 
reactions, and the use of low dose or no immunos uppressive drugs in many of the patients. In 
summary, while it is possible that recipients of rituximab may develop hypersensitivity, 
which may extend to other proteins of mouse or igin, and thus may not be able to use other 
chimeric monoclonal antibodies or mouse-derive d antibodies in the fu ture, it has not been 
definitively shown that hypersensitivity to one chimeric molecule precludes someone from 
receiving another. For additional information on AEs observed to date with study drug and active controls, see the Rituxan Prescribing Information at http://www.rituxan.com/rituxan/pi.  
 Rare serious adverse events (SAEs) have o ccurred in patients following completion of 
rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of bl ood vessels (vasculitis and lupus-like syndrome), 
lung disorders (including pleur itis, scarring of the lung and br onchiolitis obliterans), and eye 
disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis). Patient s with pre-existing cardiac conditions, including 
arrhythmia and angina pectoris, have had recurrences of these cardiac events during 
rituximab infusions. Abdominal pain, bowel obstr uction, and perforation have been reported 
in patients receiving rituximab in combin ation with chemotherapy for malignancy.  
 Serum sickness, a syndrome consisting of one or more of the following has been reported: fever, joint pain, skin rash or hives, hematuria, or hypocomplementemia. The syndrome may 
occur as long as several weeks after the first infusion. This syndrome is believed to be caused 
by deposition in tissues of rituximab-anti-rituximab immune complexes [135-138].   Rituximab is a Category C drug. Reproduction studies in primates at human maternal 
exposure dose levels showed no teratogenetic effects. There are no adequate and well-
controlled studies of rituximab in pregnant wo men. Postmarketing data indicate that B cell 
depletion can occur in infants exposed in-utero to rituximab, which gene rally resolves in less 
than six months. Rituximab has been detected in the serum of infants exposed in-utero. 
 Rationale for Study 
1.5
 
The most effective treatments for SSc target the vascular complicati ons and inflammatory 
processes that characterize this disease [139]. One of the most feared complications of SSc, 
SSc-PAH, demonstrates both vascular and inflammatory pathology [140], and yet, a 
randomized clinical trial specifica lly directed at this process ha s not been performed. Of note, 
the findings of a major study have just been published demonstrating that patients with SSc-
associated interstitial lung disease enjoy a m odest but significant beneficial effect with 
cyclophosphamide treatment [141]. SSc-PAH is a ssociated with disabling dyspnea as well as 
significant mortality. An increa sing body of experimental and clinical evidence is implicating 
dysregulated B cells and pathogenic autoantibodies  in the pathogenesis of SSc [25, 54, 55, 
142]. A recently described animal model of PAH has shown that autoimmune injury, 
characterized by pulmonary B cell accumula tions and anti-endothelial cell antibody 
deposition on pulmonary vasculature, results in  severe PAH that is similar to the human 
condition [57]. In another related preclinical model, correcting immune dysregulation 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 39 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 attenuates pulmonary B cell accumulation and antibody deposition, and greatly ameliorates 
PAH [143]. Finally, in clinical  practice, rituximab has been anecdotally reported to be 
effective in several forms of PAH [144, 145] including SSc-PAH [67]. Given the strong 
scientific evidence implicating autoimmune vascular injury in disease pathogenesis, the 
expanding number of cases where rituximab has been highly effective in autoimmune-
associated PAH, the poor overall prognosis of patients with SSc-PAH, the acceptable risk-
benefit ratio of rituximab in this patient population, and the newly emerging and promising 
pre-clinical data, there is strong rationale for a trial testing the efficacy of B cell depletion in 
SSc-PAH.  Change in 6MWD has been chosen as the prim ary efficacy endpoint for this study as it is a 
commonly used functional measure of disease severity that has been previously used by the FDA for licensure which will make it more compar able to past trials.  For more information 
about the change in primary endpoint from pul monary vascular resistance (PVR) to 6MWD, 
see Section 8.1, Sample Size. A recent analysis was performe d by Mathai (2012) to find the 
minimally important difference in 6MWD at 16 w eeks. An analysis of 405 subjects enrolled 
in the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Res ponse to Tadalafil trial showed the estimated 
consensus minimally important difference (MID ) at 16 weeks was 33m in subjects with 
PAH; therefore 33m was chosen as a minimally im portant distance for this trial. This study is 
also of longer duration than many previous tria ls in the field. Unlike vasodilating agents, B 
cell depletion may not have an immediate eff ect on PAH. Twenty four weeks after B cell 
depletion, vascular remodeling may have occu rred resulting in dise ase stabilization or 
improvement or skin involvement could be im proved, which could result in an increased 
6MWD. Measurement of the clinical endpoi nts at this time, distant from study drug 
administration, may permit detection of the la rgest difference in the study endpoints between 
the 2 arms. In addition, measurement of the clinical and hemodynamic endpoints at 24 weeks 
will allow an assessment of durability of res ponse to the study intervention. A relative 
increase of 20% in 6MWD or decrease of 30%  in PVR (i.e. compared to placebo-treated 
controls) would suggest disease remission a nd could translate into improved survival. 
 Rationale for the Entry Criteria 
1.5.1
 
The objective of this trial is to determine if rituximab has a beneficial effect on clinical 
disease progression with an acceptable level of toxicity in subjects with SSc-PAH. 
The inclusion criteria are designed to ensu re that all subjects have well documented, 
relatively recent onset PAH.   
 Early in disease, the vascul ar lesion is assumed to have an inflammatory component 
potentially responsive to rituximab. It is unclear how long the inflammatory component persists. However, there is pers istent B cell dysregulation as evidenced by 
the persistence of autoantibodies. Because lung diseas e in these patients may be 
heterogeneous with some areas being more actively inflamed than others, it is possible that B cell depletion may impact individual patients in a heterogeneous 
fashion. Patients that have more advanced and possibly irreversible  disease in certain 
areas of their lungs may also have activ ely inflamed regions in other anatomic 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 40 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 pulmonary locations; these latter areas may be more susceptible to benefit from B cell 
depletion. 
 In order to optimize the ability to detect  a treatment effect, subjects should have 
sufficient disease burden attributable to SSc-PAH to cause at least mild symptoms 
manifested by some limitation of physical ex ertion with maximal effort. However, the 
need to also include subjects with early  SSc-PAH implies that an upper limit of the 
six minute walk distance should not be defi ned. The entry criteria attempt to balance 
the need to include subjects with early SSc-PAH and the need to detect a treatment 
effect of rituximab in additi on to standard therapy. Therefore, subjects with Class II 
as well as Class III and IV heart failure are included in this trial. In an attempt to include subjects with early disease but with definitive SSc-PAH and poor prognosis, 
the study entry mPAP has been defined as a lower limit of ≥ 25 mmHg.  
 NYHA functional class IV subjects have b een included in a number of previous 
clinical trials in PAH. These patients are by definition severely impaired functionally, 
and tend to have a poor prognosis. Most subjec ts with functional class IV disease who 
are being considered for enrollment in this study would likely have failed other 
currently available therapies. Even understanding that such patients may be at increased risk for complications during or immediately following the infusion of 
rituximab, the risk/benefit ratio in this setti ng is acceptable, especially in light of the 
additional precautions being taken to optimize the safety of these severely ill patients. 
 Subjects must be on stable doses of standard of care to ensure the changes seen during the study do not reflect the confounding effect of ch anges in concurrent PAH 
therapy, but rather use of the study drug.  
 Subjects should be competent adults able to  understand the risks of participation in 
the study and capable of making medical decisions.  
 The upper age of the subjects permitted to en ter this study is in line with what has 
been deemed safe in other rituximab trials  in RA, but has been limited to 75 in order 
to avoid comorbidities of adva nced age (for a population already at greater risk due to 
pre-existing cardiorespiratory compromise) [116]. 
 The exclusion criteria are desi gned to protect the subjects’ safety by excluding those who are 
at risk for adverse events either because of the severity of their disease, their predisposition to 
infection or to the presence of co-morbid di sease and to ensure a uniform study population.  
  
 Subjects with longer-standing disease (i.e. beyond 5 years) are excluded because it is 
hypothesized that the late fibr oproliferative component of SSc may be less responsive 
to immunotherapy than the early inflammatory vascular lesions. In order to evaluate a change within 6 months of entry, subj ects with steadily progressing disease are 
required. 
 Subjects must have PAH secondary to SSc onl y. Interstitial lung disease is a common 
pulmonary manifestation of SSc that can be associated with “secondary” pulmonary 
hypertension for reasons likely distinct from those factors causing “primary” SSc-PAH. Therefore subjects with significant interstitial lung disease (ILD) resulting in 
secondary PAH are excluded from this trial.  Subjects with mild ILD are permitted in 
the study.  Diagnostic criteria for mild ILD have been developed. Subjects with other 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 41 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 diseases resulting in PAH are excluded from this trial, as are subjects with elevated 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressures whose PAH may be the result of left heart 
failure, pulmonary venous occlusion, or  mitral valve disease and not SSc.  
 Because rituximab is an immunocompromising agent, subjects who have received 
recent live vaccines within 2 months, have a ny evidence of severe bacterial infections 
as defined in the entry criteria or chronic infections (HIV, TB, Hepatitis B or C), will 
be excluded from this trial. 
 Rituximab has been associated with cardiovascular deaths, and cardiac disease is a warning specifically mentioned in the pres cribing information. Therefore, a recent 
history of non-SSc-PAH-related heart disease excludes patients from entry into this 
study.  
 Patients with a prior history of anaphylaxis or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or any compone nt of rituximab will be excluded. In addition, in order 
to keep the population uniform in terms of disease status, the trial is targeting subjects who have not received prior lymphocyte depleting agents.  
 Subjects who are at increased risk for adverse events based on the presence of co-
morbid disease will be excluded from th is trial including renal disease even if 
secondary to scleroderma, recent malignancy, pregnancy, and blood dyscrasias.  
 
Subjects who are unable to comply with the dema nds of this protocol for either physical or 
psychiatric reasons are also excluded.   
 Rationale for Mechanistic Studies   
1.5.2
 Currently serum biomarkers are not  available to reliably follow  the clinical course of SSc-
PAH. The ASC01 mechanistic studies aim to ev aluate several markers of disease and the 
change associated with rituximab treatment: bi ochemical indicators of heart failure severity 
(BNP/NT-proBNP), B cell numbers, and inflammatory markers. Because hyponatremia has recently been demonstrated to predict right hear t failure and poor survival in PAH [146], we 
will monitor serum sodium levels throughout the trial. BNP/NT-proBNP is already an 
established marker useful in following heart failure in SSc-PAH [147] and will be used to follow response to therapy in this trial. Because CD19 is co-expressed on CD20 B cells, we 
expect numbers of CD19+ cells will fall following rituximab therapy. CD19+ cells will be measured to track the repopulation of B cells [148, 149] as well as to determine if B cell 
clones are present in SSc-PAH and what impact rituximab may have on these clones. With falling B cells, it is possible that serum immunog lobulins will also fa ll, and therefore the 
decline and eventual return of immunoglobulin subclasses will be monito red in this trial. 
With regard to following inflammatory biom arkers, both autoantibodies and serum cytokines 
will be measured on a regular basis. Anti-U1RN P, anti-U3RNP, anti-B23, anti-cardiolipin, 
anti-CENP-B have been reported to be elevat ed in SSc-PAH [150, 151] and will be followed 
at several time points to correlate disease ac tivity with autoantibody levels. Because no single 
autoantibody has proven sufficient to track SSc-PAH activity, we will determine whether a panel of autoantibodies provides a more specifi c and sensitive measure. Finally, serum IL-1 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 42 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 and IL-6 are known to be elevated in severe primary pulmonary arteri al hypertension [152] 
and may similarly be elevated in SSc-PAH. Other pro-inflammatory cytokines may be 
similarly elevated. Pilot studies done at St anford University were performed using a 
multiplex analysis of serum. Preliminary eviden ce pointed to distinct inflammatory profiles 
in patients with PAH as compared with hea lthy controls, as well as  sub-groups of PAH 
etiologies as compared to each other. For th is reason, a similar multiplex approach for SSc-
PAH patients could identify an important in flammatory signature, as well as provide 
biomarkers of inflammatory resolution following B-cell depletion. Thus, measures of both an 
autoantibody panel and a panel of cytokines may provide a peripheral (and therefore accessible) assay of systemic inflammation. The mechanistic studies are designed, in a 
straightforward manner, to measure B cells, hear t failure and inflammatory changes over the 
course of the clinical trial.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
 Description of Study Design 3.1
This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi-center, randomized trial to 
evaluate the effect of rituximab on diseas e progression in subjects with SSc-PAH receiving 
concurrent stable-dose standard medical th erapy with a prostanoid, endothelin receptor 
antagonist, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor,  and/or guanylate cyclase stimulators. The 
study will focus on assessment of clinical res ponse and safety measures longitudinally. In 
addition, the effects of treatment with r ituximab on the underlying immune mechanisms 
associated with B-cell dysregulation and pat hogenic autoantibody response in this disease 
will be investigated.     Subjects with SSc-PAH with elevated mean pulm onary artery pressure as measured by right 
heart catheterization wi ll be enrolled. The diagnosis of  SSc-PAH should be confirmed by a 
rheumatologist experienced in the diagnosis  and treatment of systemic sclerosis in 
conjunction with a pulmonologist or cardiologist specializing in  management of PAH. Both 
specialists will be part of the study team at each site.   Rituximab/placebo will be administered as two IV infusions of 1000 mg each, given two 
weeks apart at Day 0 and Week 2. All subjects  will receive 40mg of prednisone orally the 
night before and morning of each infusion, as well as 100 mg methylprednisolone or 
equivalent corticosteroid intravenously approx imately thirty minutes prior to each infusion 
with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen orally approximately thirty to sixty minutes prior to each infusion of rituximab or placebo. Subj ects will remain on their baseline standard 
medical regimen.   Sixty eligible subjects will be accrued. Each potential study subject will provide written 
informed consent prior to screening procedures. All inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 4, Selection of Subjects ) must be met at time of randomiza tion prior to receipt of the first 
dose of rituximab/placebo (Day 0, Treatment Initiation).   Clinical assessments and sample collection wi ll occur at regularly sc heduled visits through 
Week 48 with telephone follow-up conducted in the interim. If a subjec t has not recovered B 
cells by Week 48, B cell studies will be conducte d quarterly until recovery is documented or 
for 2 years after initial treatment (whichever o ccurs first). Recovery is defined as the time 
point at which B cells recover to within 10% of  baseline levels; if a baseline value is not 
available then recovery is defined as a B ce ll level of at least 90% of the lower limit of 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 45 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 normal. During this quarterly monitoring period of B cell recovery, AEs and SAEs will be 
assessed, providing the subject ha s not withdrawn consent, to capture any infectious event ≥ 
Grade 3 using the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). No additional study-related data will be collected. Vital status on all 
subjects will be evaluated ≥  2 years after randomization. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in  6MWD from baseline to 24 weeks after 
treatment initiation. Hemodynamic measures will be assessed  at baseline and Week 24, 
contributing to the understanding of the relationship between PVR and clinical endpoints. Initiation of new PAH therapy due to disease worsening prior to Week 24 will prompt an 
endpoint visit and right heart cat heterization prior to initiation of the new therapy. B cell 
recovery for all will be monitored by serial assessments of B cell counts as determined by flow cytometry.  The total duration of the study is anticipated to be approximately 8 years.  
 Stratification, Randomization, and Masking 
3.1.1
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 infusions 14 days apart of either 
rituximab 1000 mg (treatment arm) or plac ebo (control arm). The automated randomization 
system will implement an adaptive randomizati on procedure to maintain balance between 
treatment groups overall, by study site, with resp ect to disease severity as measured by PVR 
at baseline, and with respect to time since diagnosis of SSc-PAH.  
 To maintain study blind, the a ppearance of the packaging and solutions used to administer 
study drug/placebo will be identical in both study arms.  All clinical and immunology laboratory staff will be masked to the treatment assignments 
until the completion of the study. In additi on, immunology laboratory staff will not have 
access to any clinical results and clinical staff members, including the investigators, will not 
have access to any immunology lab results unti l completion of the study. B cell recovery 
status and the need for quarterly monitori ng visits as defined in Section 6.5.4.12, Visit 16 
[Week 48] will be communicated to clinical sta ff upon completion of Visit 16 or Early 
Endpoint visit. If B cells have not recovered by two years after treatment initiation, B cell 
levels will be provided to the clinical staff.  Individual treatment assignments will not be unmasked until all subjects have completed the study. In the event a treatment assignment needs to be unmasked for safety reasons, the site 
PI will notify the SACCC, who will consult with the DAIT medical monitor. The DAIT 
medical monitor will review the circumstances and grant approval as indicated. In the event 
of a true medical emergency necessitating im mediate unmasking during off-hours, the site 
pharmacist will confer with the study PI or designee prior to release of the treatment 
assignment to emergency treating personnel.

independent blinded panel after reviewing all clinical and, if available, autopsy data. 
5. All-cause mortality, defined as any death occurring at any time after randomization.

 Exploratory Endpoints 
3.2.4
Exploratory analysis of standardization of the PVR calculation will be based on PVR calculated from a standardized Fick calcula tion of cardiac output, which is a function of 
hemoglobin, arterial and mixed-venous saturations, and oxygen consumption according to the La-Farge and Miettinen formula. The cardiac output calculation is a function of assumed oxygen consumption according to the La-Farge calculation of values normalized for age, 
gender, heart rate. Calculation of a standardi zed Fick cardiac output will also allow for 
determination of the pulm onary artery capacitance (PACf). See Appendix E, Exploratory 
Analysis: Standardized Fick-bas ed Pulmonary Vascular Resi stance and Pulmonary Artery 
Capacitance  for details. 
 Additionally, an exploratory analysis of the relations hip between change in PVR and change 
in 6MWD will be addressed. Relationships with  other clinical endpoints, like change in NT-
proBNP, will also be explored.

Version 8.0  24 April 2017  Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects  3.3.2.1
Independent of whether treated subjects have completed the full course of rituximab, the 
following procedures will apply:  
1. If prohibited medications as  defined in Section 5.6, Prohibited Medications and 
Treatments  are not needed for treatment of progressive PAH, the subject will 
complete all scheduled study visits incl uding all exams, procedures, assessments, 
and tests according to the protocol.   
2. If prohibited medications as  defined in Section 5.6, Prohibited Medications and 
Treatments  (i.e. addition of new or a change in the dose of background PAH 
therapies [prostanoid, endothelin receptor  antagonist, PDE-5 inhibitor, and/or 
guanylate cyclase stimulators] or surgical  therapy) are needed for treatment of 
progressive PAH prior to the Week 24 visit,  or if the subject withdraws consent, 
he/she will be asked to complete an Earl y Endpoint Visit as detailed in Section 
6.5.5, Early Endpoint Visit.  
3. In addition, if the subject has not wit hdrawn consent and has not achieved B cell 
recovery, follow-up clinical care must incl ude visits at least quarterly to monitor 
recovery of B cells. Quarterly monitoring visits will continue until B cell recovery 
or for 2 years after initial treatment (which ever occurs first). Recovery is defined 
as the time point at which B cells recover to within 10% of baseline levels; if a baseline value is not available then recovery is defined as a B cell level of at least 90% of the lower limit of normal. During this monitoring period, AEs and SAEs will be assessed, providing the subject has not withdrawn consent, to capture any infectious event ≥ Grade 3 using the NCI-CTCAE. No additional study-related 
data will be collected. 
 Subjects who have discontinued th eir concurrent medications pr ior to Week 24 for toxicity 
only, and not disease progression, will continue  to participate in the study. They will be 
permitted to change medication for PAH in order to maintain control of their disease and will 
complete all exams, procedures, assessmen ts, and tests according to the protocol.  
  Subject Withdrawal from the Study 
3.3.3
When a subject is withdrawn from the study af ter initiating treatment but prior to B cell 
follow-up, protocol-specified treatment requ irements are discontinued and study-related 
visits, exams, procedures, assessments, test s and data collection are terminated after 
completion of an Early Endpoint Vis it as detailed in Section 6.5.5, Early Endpoint Visit. 
However, individual subjects will be withdr awn from the protocol under the following 
conditions: 
1. The subject withdraws consent. 
2. The investigator or DAIT/NIAI D believes it is in the best interest of the subject. 
3. The study is terminated. 
 Subjects who are lost to follow-up will also be regarded as withdrawn from the protocol.

5 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
 Description of Rituximab  5.1
 Product Description 5.1.1
Rituxan® (rituximab) is a genetically engi neered IgG1 kappa chimeric murine/human 
monoclonal antibody containing murine light- a nd heavy-chain variable region sequences 
and human constant region sequences. The ch imeric antibody is produced by mammalian cell 
(Chinese Hamster Ovary) suspension culture in  a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic 
gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product. Rituximab is composed of 
1,328 amino acids, and has an approximate mol ecular weight of 145 kilo Dalton (kD) [116]. 
The antibody reacts specifical ly with the CD20 antigen found on the surface of malignant 
and normal B cells, and established B cell lines. Studies have shown that rituximab binds via 
its Fc domain to human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines by complement-
dependent cytotoxicity through the induction of  apoptosis and via an tibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity [118].  The drug is manufactured by Genentech, Inc.  and by Biogen IDEC, Inc. Rituximab is 
supplied as a sterile, clear, co lorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) 
administration in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials, which must be diluted before administration [116].  
 Packaging and Labeling of Study Product 
5.1.2
Rituximab labeled for investigational use will be  provided without charge by Genentech, Inc. 
or IDEC Pharmaceuticals. The sponsor of the tr ial will ensure maintena nce of complete and 
accurate records of the receipt, dispensation, a nd disposal or return of all trial drugs in 
accordance with Title 21 CFR Parts 312.57 and 312.62 and with Genentech/IDEC requirements.  Placebo will be supplied in packag ing identical to rituximab.  
 Storage and Handling of Study Product 
5.1.3
Rituximab vials will be stored in a refrigerator  at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Rituximab will not 
be used beyond the expiration date stamped on the carton and printed on the vial. Rituximab vials will be protected from direct sunlight . The product will not be frozen or shaken. 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 54 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017  
After dilution to 1-4 mg/mL in normal saline, rituximab is physically and chemically stable 
at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for 24 hours, and s ubsequently for 24 hours at room temperature 
provided that dilution has taken place in c ontrolled and validated aseptic conditions.  
It is strongly recommended that higher concen trations of rituximab (4  mg/mL) be used for 
this patient population in order to  minimize fluid administration. 
 Placebo will be handled in the same  fashion as described above. 
 Dosage Regimen  
5.2
Rituximab (1000 mg) or placebo will be administ ered as 2 infusions given 2 weeks apart.  
 Administration of Rituximab 5.3
The following drugs, safety equipment, and supplies must be available during the rituximab infusions: 
 Oxygen 
 Oral and endotracheal airways and intubation equipment 
 Epinephrine 1:1000 solution for IV  or endotracheal injection 
 Antihistamines 
 Corticosteroids 
 IV infusion solutions, tubing, catheters, and tape 
 Defibrillator with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor 
 Dopamine 
 Atropine 
 Bronchodilators 
 Patients will be closely monitored during the infusions. Guidance for monitoring for infusion 
reactions includes continuous h eart rate monitoring during the infusions, with capability to 
detect early bradycardia. Vital signs should be  monitored frequently as suggested below. 
During the first infusion, vital signs should be  checked every 10 minutes during infusion for 
the first hour, and then every 15 minutes until the subject is discha rged 1 hour after the 
infusion, or as clinically indicated. For the second infusion, vital signs should be checked 
every 15 minutes during infusion for the firs t hour, and then every 30 minutes until the 
subject is discharged 30 minutes after the infusi on, or as clinically indicated. Systolic and 
diastolic pressures should be should be mon itored, with mean arterial pressures (MAP) 
monitored as clinically indicated. Oxygen saturations should be measured at baseline and then every 30 minutes or as cl inically indicated. Study centers may defer to local institutional 
standards of practice for monitori ng hemodynamic and pulmonary status. 
 Patients with significant PAH t ypically do not have systemic hypertension, but rather have 
low blood pressures. Because transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, it is necessary to anticipate an exacerbation of baseline hypotension. Persistent hypotension with a SBP < 90 mmHg is an exclusion criterion for this study. If after randomization on the 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 55 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0  24 April 2017 day of rituximab administration pr ior to beginning the infusion the subject's systolic BP is < 
90 mmHg or, if measured/calcu lated, the  MAP is < 55 mmHg, then the guidance in Figure 
6’s algorithm below is recommended. To summa rize, for a SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 55 
mmHg prior to starting the infu sion a fluid bolus of up to 500 cc normal saline (NS) may be 
administered. If the pressures remain below these parameters and the physician is worried 
about hypotension then the infusion should not be given and the subject should be sent home. 
Another attempt to infuse the study drug may be made within 3 da ys. If on the second 
attempt the subject’s BP remains too low in the opinion of the investigator, then he/she will 
be withdrawn from the study. PAH specific medica tions should not be withheld to increase 
the blood pressure. In summary, study centers may defer to local instit utional standards of 
practice for subject monitori ng and clinical management during study drug infusions. 
 Patients with Class IV or advanced Class III symptoms should receive close nursing attention 
(preferably 1:1 care) during the infusion. Thes e patients are at high risk for hemodynamic 
compromise should they suffer a hypersensitiv ity reaction. Therefore,  each participating 
institution will have an established algorith m for acceleration of care should a patient 
hemodynamically decompensate. It is essential that a code team can rapidly and directly 
respond to the patient’s hemodynamic deteriorati on and immediately transfer the patient to 
an inpatient unit for accelerated care (i.e. an off-site infusion center w ould not be appropriate 
for these patients).  Research coordinators will contact subjects by phone within 24 hours after discharge from 
the infusion center to assess for adverse events.

Since transient hypotension may occur during th e rituximab infusion, all subjects taking 
antihypertensive(s) will be instructed to hol d their medication(s) for 12 hours before each 
infusion in order to decrease th e risk of hypotensive events. If  a subject has a systolic blood 
pressure > 180 mm mercury (Hg)  or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg at screening, then 
the antihypertensive(s) will not be withheld prior to the infusion. However, it is uncommon 
for patients with PAH to be hypertensive. Ra ther, systemic hypotension is more commonly 
found in this patient group. For hypotensive patients, management will be conducted as 
outlined in Section 5.4.3.2, Cardiovascular  and in Figure 6.  
 Preparation for Administration 5.3.2
Appropriate aseptic technique will be used . The necessary amount of rituximab will be 
withdrawn and diluted to a final concentra tion of 1 to 4 mg/mL into an infusion bag 
containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP. It is strongly recommended that higher concentrations of rituximab (4 mg/mL) be used for this patient population in order to 
minimize fluid administration. The bag will be ge ntly inverted to mix the solution, and any 
unused portion left in the vial will be discarded. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolorat ion prior to administration and should not be 
used if either is present. No incompatibili ties between rituximab and polyvinyl chloride or 
polyethylene bags have been observed. 
 Pre-medication for Rituximab Infusion 
5.3.3
All subjects will receive the following pre-me dication prior to each rituximab infusion to 
prevent hypersensitivity reactions  and to reduce the frequency of infusion-related reactions: 
 Night before and morning of each study drug infusion: 
o Prednisone 40mg PO (or equivalent) 
 Approximately thirty minutes prior to each study drug infusion: 
o Methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent). 
 Approximately thirty to sixty minutes  prior to each study drug infusion: 
o Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO (or equivalent). Dose may be repeated every four hours, as needed.  
 Note: Subjects should be advised th at this pre-medication given for 
the prevention and treatment of infusion-related reactions may cause drowsiness and impairment of driving ability prior to 
discharge. 
o Acetaminophen 650 mg PO (or equivalent ). Dose may be repeated every 
four hours, as needed. 
 Administration

amount of solution to be discarded. 
 Identify the site for IV access. Prepare for venipuncture per institution standards of 
practice. 
 Introduce the angiocatheter into  the vein, and attach to th e male port of the precision 
regulator extension set. 
  Guidance for NYHA Class II or III Subjects 5.3.4.1
 Open the roller clamp of the IV tubing, and set the precision regulator drip rate to an 
initial rate of 50 mg/hour. 
 Do not mix or dilute ritu ximab with other drugs. 
 If hypersensitivity or infusion-related events do not occur, escalate the infusion rate 
in 50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
Subsequent infusions of rituximab can be administered at an initial rate of 100 
mg/hour, and increased by 100 mg/hour increm ents at 30-minute intervals, to a 
maximum rate of 400 mg/hour as tolerated.

 Allow the study medication to infuse until the line of fluid is at the needle insertion 
site, ensuring that all of the medication is infused. 
  Guidance for NYHA Class IV Subjects 5.3.4.2
Given the greater concern for potential card iovascular events related to rituximab 
administration in this sub-group of subjects, the starting infusion rate and algorithm for titration of rate should be reduced to half of the standard rate outlined in Section 5.3.4.1, 
Guidance for NYHA Class II or III Subjects . Strict adherence to the 30 minute intervals of 
rate titration will be dependent upon subject tolerability of the infusion. 
 Criteria for Permanent Discontinu ation of Rituximab Infusion   
5.3.5
If a subject experiences any of the events listed below, rituximab infusions will be 
discontinued, and procedures for discontinuation of protocol-specified treatments and follow-
up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for all Treated 
Subjects):  
 Syndrome resembling tumor lysis syndrome 
 NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) hypersensitivity reaction 
 NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or higher (severe/ life-threatening) cytokine release 
acute infusion reaction 
 NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or higher (severe/lif e-threatening) cardiac arrhythmias. 
In addition, see Protocol Section 3.3.2, Discontinuation of Protocol-Specified 
Treatment Requirements for significant cardio-pulmonary disease progression 
events warranting discontinuation of  protocol-specified treatment 
requirements. 
 NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or higher (severe/life-threatening) mucocutaneous 
reactions

medical intervention 
 Events listed in Section 3.3.2, Discontinuation of Protocol-Specified 
Treatment Requirements  
 Criteria for Withholding Rituximab Infusion 5.3.6
Rituximab infusions are to be withheld if th e subject is experiencing any of the following: 
 Fever > 38  C 
 Symptoms of an upper respiratory infection 
 Acute diarrhea 
 Signs or symptoms of intercurrent infecti on or serum sickness such as fever, joint 
pain, skin rash or hives, hematuria, or hypocomplementemia 
 Cytopenia as defined as ANC < 1500/mm3 (or < 1.5 x 109/L), platelets < 
100,000/mm3 (or < 100 x 109/L), or hemoglobin < 9.0 g/dL 
 Hypotension prior to in itiation of infusion  
 
The infusion may be given if a subject has been afebrile for 2 days and has clear lungs. If the 
subject has been started on antibiotics, the infusion may be given after 2 days, provided 
cultures are negative. If  initiation of rituximab was withheld for hypotension, the subject may 
return within 3 days for rituximab administration, as long as the return  visit is within the 
windows specified below. 
 If a subject has a rituximab infusion withheld, the following time windows for infusion will 
be applicable: 
 First Infusion: The first infusion must be given within 7 days of randomization.  
 Second Infusion: The infusion must be given 2 – 4 weeks after the first infusion; otherwise the subject will not receive the second infusion. 
 Criteria for Temporarily Interrupting and Restarting Rituximab Infusion 
5.3.7
The rituximab infusion should be interrupted if the patient develops worsened hypotension or symptomatic bradycardia. SSc-PAH patients may have baseline low blood pressure which 
the rituximab infusion may exacerbate.  Please refer to Section 5.4.3.2, Cardiovascular  and 
the Algorithm in Figure 6  for the suggested treatment of hypotension during rituximab 
infusions. Sinus bradycardia during rituximab infusion should be quickly responded to as 
described in Section 5.4.3.2, Cardiovascular . If additional measures seem safe and 
appropriate in order to continue the rituximab infusion, they may be implemented by the clinical site. In all cases, clinical judgment regarding the safety of the individual subject should prevail. If there is adequate response of the bradycardia and/or hypotension and the subject is hemodynamically stable, the infusi on may be restarted The rituximab infusion 
should be interrupted for NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or  higher cytokine releas e reactions or Grade 
2 hypersensitivity reactions. In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hour to 50 mg/hour) wh en symptoms have completely resolved. 
Additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated. Most subjects who

have been able to complete the full course of rituximab therapy. Epinephrine, antihistamines, 
and corticosteroids should be available for imme diate use in the event of an infusion reaction 
to rituximab (e.g., anaphylaxis). Rituximab ther apy should be discontinued in the event of an 
NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 hypersensitivity or anaphylact ic allergic reaction or in the event of an 
NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 cytokine release acute infu sion reaction. Please refer to Section 5.4.3, 
Management of Infusion Reactions /Known Toxicities to Rituximab , for treatment guidelines. 
 Toxicity Management Plan for Rituximab 5.4
 Known Toxicities to Rituximab 5.4.1
Refer to Protocol Section 1.4, Known and Potential Risks of Rituximab Treatment .  
 Prevention of Known Toxicities to Rituximab 5.4.2
1. In the absence of known alle rgies, all subjects will be pre-medicated orally 
approximately 30 – 60 minutes prior to infu sion of rituximab with acetaminophen 650 mg 
and diphenhydramine 50 mg. The pre-medication will be repeated every 4 hours, as needed. Subjects administered an antihistamine for th e treatment or preventi on of infusion-related 
reactions should be given appropriate warnings  about drowsiness and impairment of driving 
ability prior to discharge.  In order to reduce the frequency of infusion-relate d reactions, subjects will also be asked to 
take prednisone 40 mg PO (or equivalent) th e night before and morning of each infusion. 
Additionally, they will be given 100 mg IV methylprednisolone (or equivalent) 
approximately thirty minutes prior to each  rituximab infusion. Procedures for the 
management of infusion reactions are discussed in Section 5.4.3.1, Infusion Reactions . 
Additionally a member of the research staff will follow up with subjects within 24 hours after discharged from the infusion cen ter to assess their condition. 
 
2. Although neutropenia and thrombocytopenia  have been associated with rituximab, 
cases are generally transient and do not cause clinically significant problems. Late onset 
neutropenia with rituximab has been descri bed in patients treated with aggressive 
chemotherapy for hematological malignancies but no such cases have been reported in 
patients with autoimmune disease. Nevertheless , to minimize the risk of potential cytopenias, 
a complete blood count will be performed and adequacy of the differential and platelet count will be checked prior to starti ng the second rituximab infusion. Counts will be re-checked as 
required in the Schedule of Events and when ever the subject develops any infection. 
Procedures for the management of cytopenias  will be according to institutional practice. 
  3. Most subjects at high risk for infections or viral reactivation  will have been 
excluded from participation in this study. Howe ver, the following additional precautions will 
be taken to minimize the potential for significant infections and/or viral reactivation in this 
study [153-156].

immunocompetency including: 
 decreased response to immunization;  
 possible increased rate of infection;  
 possible neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, and  
 possible reactivation of viral infections (including HBV and JC virus). 
b. Subjects and study physicians will be  given the following information 
regarding immunizations:  Live virus vaccines are c ontraindicated within 8 weeks prior to beginning 
rituximab therapy. 
 All other immunizations must be co mpleted at least 4 weeks prior to 
starting rituximab. This includes the pneumococcal vaccine, unless subject 
was vaccinated within 5 years of study entry. If vaccination occurred 
greater than 5 years prior to study entry, the subject must be revaccinated at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy. 
 After rituximab, recommended vaccines, including yearly influenza 
vaccine, are to be administered as la te as possible after the last dose of 
rituximab. If possible, influenza vaccin e should be administered at least 4 
weeks prior to dosing with rituximab. 
c. Subjects will be educated about th e need to recognize and report the 
symptoms of infection. Speci fically, subjects will be: 
 educated about the importance of ear ly recognition of  infections and 
instructed to call the study coordinator or their health care provider if they 
have questions or if they are ill; 
 instructed to be seen by their study phys ician and/or local physician if they 
are having shaking chills, fever greate r than 101° F, respiratory illness 
other than a mild cold, symptoms of  a urinary infection, severe or 
prolonged diarrhea or abdominal pain , or if they think they may be 
developing the flu; 
 educated about symptoms of hepatitis (nausea, loss of appetite, dark urine, 
light stools), herpes zoster (new, seve re, unexplained pain on one side of 
the body especially if th ere is a rash), and PML (confusion, lethargy, 
dizziness, difficulty talking or walk ing, and vision disturbances).  
d. Study physicians will administer appropria te prophylaxis for infections such 
as anti-viral chemotherapy for influenza during flu outbreaks according to 
individual institutional practice.

mucocutaneous reactions, or symptomatic hypotension) develops, the symptoms will be 
treated, and the infusion slowed or stopped as  warranted. The infusion may be continued at 
one-half the previous rate once the symptoms have resolved. Hemodynamic fluctuations can 
have significance for patients with PAH and phy sicians trained in the care of PAH patients 
should be available in the event of an infusi on reaction. For this reason, patients in this 
protocol will receive study drug with hem odynamic monitoring as described under Section 
5.3, Administration of Rituximab. For subjects who experience  asymptomatic hypotension, 
the infusion rate will be temporarily slowed pe r the investigator’s discretion until symptoms 
resolve.  The rituximab infusion should be interrupted for NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 cytokine release or Grade 2 hypersensitivity reactions. In most cas es, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% 
reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hour to 50 mg/hour) when symptoms have completely 
resolved. Treatment of infusion-related symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended. Additional treatment with bron chodilators or IV saline may be indicated. 
Most subjects who have expe rienced non-life-threatening (N CI-CTCAE Grade 2 or less) 
hypersensitivity infusion reactions or (NCI-C TCAE Grade 2 or less) cytokine release 
reactions have been able to complete the full course of rituximab therapy.   In the event of a NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) or higher hypers ensitivity reaction, or a NCI-
CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) or higher cytokine release acute infusion reaction, the infusion 
should be permanently discontinued and the subject should receive medical treatment. 
Epinephrine, antihistamines, co rticosteroids, albu terol, oxygen, and emergency resuscitation 
equipment should be kept at the bedside during the infusion of rituximab for immediate use in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction to  rituximab (e.g., anaphylaxis). Subjects who 
experience an NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) or higher hypersensitivity reaction, or an NCI-
CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) or higher cytokine release acute infusion reaction will receive no additional rituximab, and procedures for discont inuation of protocol-sp ecified treatments and 
follow-up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All 
Treated Subjects). If it is medically indicated, a s ubject will be hospitalized for infusion-
related reactions. 
 Cardiovascular 
5.4.3.2
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of an NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (serious) or Grade 
4 (life-threatening) cardiac ar rhythmia. For subjects who develop an NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or 
higher arrhythmias, rituximab will be permanently discontinued, and procedures for discontinuation of protocol-specified treatments and follow-up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ). In addition, see Protocol 
Section 3.3.2, Discontinuation of Protocol-Sp ecified Treatment Requirements  for significant 
cardio-pulmonary disease progression events  warranting discontinuation of protocol-
specified treatment requirements.   Sinus bradycardia can be dangerous in PAH pa tients whose cardiac outpu t can be heart rate-
dependent. A vasovagal response to rituximab infusion can result in sinus bradycardia and

evidenced by lightheadedness, change in c onsciousness, worsening hypotension or other 
symptoms, then the subject should receive 0.5 mg  of atropine IV with repeat dosing not to 
exceed 3 mg. If patient develops symptomatic bra dycardia, that is unresponsive to atropine, 
then the infusion should not be resumed. Duri ng a period of bradycardia the infusion should 
be suspended. If the bradycardia resolves the infusion may be re-started at 50% the original 
infusion rate. 
 If during the rituximab infusion the SBP dr ops below 90 mmHg or MAP drops below 55 
mmHg, then the guidance in algorithm in Figure 6  may be followed per the investigator’s 
clinical judgment. Different interventions may be utilized depending on the individual 
investigator’s clinical judgment. To summarize the algorithm, the infusion may be interrupted and a fluid bolus of up to 500 cc nor mal saline administered. If the SBP rises to > 
90 mmHg and MAP rises to ≥  55 mmHg the infusion may be resumed at half the infusion 
rate. If the SBP does not ri se to > 90 mmHg and MAP to ≥ 55 mmHg, another fluid bolus of 
up to 500 cc, and/or low dose dopamine may be considered. If the BP does not stabilize, 
clinical judgment should prevail as to when to discontinue study drug infusion. At any time if 
clinically indicated, the subject should be st abilized and the infusion withheld, slowed, or 
discontinued as appropriate per the guidance provided. Consideration must be given to 
administration of multiple fluid boluses ( ≥ 1 Liter) dependent on subject’s cardiopulmonary 
status. Procedures for follow-up per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated 
Subjects  should be followed. 
 In addition to hypotension, subjects with SSc -PAH may be sensitive to fluid overload. 
Investigators need to be cogni zant of the total fluid load wh en administering the rituximab 
infusion. It is strongly recommended that higher concentrations of r ituximab (4 mg/mL) be 
used to minimize fluid administration.  As stated in Section 5.1.3, Storage and Handling of Study Product , rituximab is physically 
and chemically stable at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for 24 hours after dilu tion and subsequently 
for 24 hours at room temperature after diluti on provided that dilution has taken place in 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. The interventions listed above and in the 
Algorithm in Figure 6  to manage cardiovascular complications once the infusion has begun 
may take place over a 24 hour period. Subjects should be continuously monitored until they 
have completed the infusion or until it is dete rmined that the infusion must be discontinued 
for toxicity. 
 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions 
5.4.3.3
Subjects experiencing an NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (s evere) or higher mucocutaneous reaction 
(to be reported under such categories as Dermatology/Skin, Gastrointestinal, or Renal/Genitourinary in the NCI-CTCAE depend ent upon manifestations) should not receive 
additional rituximab and should seek prompt medical evaluation. Skin biopsy may help to distinguish among different mucocutaneous react ions and to guide subsequent treatment. 
Severe mucocutaneous reactions may require topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. The safety of re-administration of study drug to subjects with mucocutaneous reactions has not

mucocutaneous reaction, rituximab will be discontinued, and procedures for discontinuation 
of protocol-specified treatments and follow-up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ). 
 Hepatitis 
5.4.3.4
If an enrolled subject develops hepatitis B, rituximab will be discontinued, and procedures for discontinuation of protocol-specified treatments and follow-up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ). Patients may have 
elevated transaminases secondary to endothelin antagonists. Hepatit is attributed to this class 
of agents should be responded to acc ording to manufacturers’ suggestions. 
  Hematologic Malignancy 
5.4.3.5
If an enrolled subject develops a hematologic malignancy, rituximab will be discontinued, and procedures for discontinuation of protocol -specified treatments and follow-up will be 
implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ).  
  Serum Sickness 
5.4.3.6
Should serum sickness occur, the infusion will  be stopped permanently, and procedures for 
discontinuation of protocol-specified treatments and follow-up will be implemented (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ). The subject will be given, 
if judged clinically appropriate, antihistamine s for symptomatic relief of urticaria and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dr ugs for relief of pain. In so me cases, a short course of 
moderate dose corticosteroids may be required for relief of joint pain or fever. If a serum sickness-like reaction occurs, then additional studie s will be performed at the time of clinical 
presentation to evaluate its possible mechanis ms. These studies may include measurement of 
serum cytokines, C3 and C4 levels, a urin alysis, and a skin biopsy with indirect 
immunofluorescence (if appropriate). 
  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
5.4.3.7
In the event a syndrome resembling tumor lysi s syndrome, the rituximab infusion should be 
discontinued. The subject should not be retreated with rituximab, and procedures for discontinuation of protocol-specified treatm ents and follow-up should be implemented (as 
per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects ). 
  Infection  
5.4.3.8
Subjects will be instructed to contact study personnel and be seen by their study physician 
and/or local physician if they have a fever ≥101 F or other signs and symptoms of an 
infection. For subjects who develop severe or frequent infections, the need for IVIG will be evaluated by each investigator (see Section 5.6, Prohibited Medications and Treatments ). 
Local institutional policies for the use of IVIG will apply. Physicians will use their discretion 
to treat infections accordi ng to standard of care.

the following medications, for the purposes of this study, are prohibited and will be 
considered either protocol deviations or re asons for early endpoint unless otherwise noted 
below or in Section 5.7, Concurrent Medications and Therapy: 
 
 Addition of new medical ther apies for PAH or a change in the dose of background 
PAH therapies (prostanoid, endothelin receptor antagonist, PDE-5 inhibitor, and/or guanylate cyclase stimulators) unless the change in therapy is due to toxicity of prior medications prior to week 24 except for an increase of up to 10% in prostacyclin therapy as described in Section 5.7, Concurrent Medications and 
Therapy  
 Surgical therapy for PAH        
 Any systemic corticosteroids, except for o prednisone (or equivalent) de tailed in Section 5.7.2.1, Corticosteroids , or  
o corticosteroid premedications as specified in Section 5.3.3, Pre-medication for Rituximab Infusion, or 
o the methylprednisone (or equivalent) administered for the treatment of severe mucocutaneous reactions as per Section 5.4.3.3, Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions and of serum sickness manifestat ions as per Section 5.4.3.6, Serum 
Sickness.    
*Corticosteroid doses may be adjusted within the 0-10 mg daily range, as clinically indicated, as long as they are stable for 4 weeks prior to Weeks 24 and 48 endpoint assessments.  
 Any biologic immunosuppressive agent,  including rituximab or other CD20 
depleting agents. 
 IVIG between 4 weeks prior to Day 0 and 4 weeks after Week 2 
 New non-biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drug therapy prior

 Background PAH Therapy 5.7.1
From the time of study entry, subjects are to remain on background PAH medical therapy 
with either a single agent or a combination of  prostanoid, endothelin  receptor antagonist, 
PDE-5 inhibitor, and/or guanylat e cyclase stimulators as per the entry criteria. Doses must 
remain stable through the week 24 primary endpoint visit.  
 
Investigational prostanoids, endothelin rece ptor antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are 
permitted if the drugs are already in use for the treatment of PAH but are not currently 
licensed for this use by the FDA.  Permitted Dose modifications: 
 Toxicity management for any of  the four classes of drugs 
 Increase in prostacyclin dose of up to 10% for worsening disease independent of 
route of administration. 
 Other PAH medications, such as diuretics a nd anti-coagulation, should be managed by the 
treating physician according to institutional practice. Changes in diuretics and anti-
coagulants are permitted throughout the duration of the study.  Stabilization/clinical improvement in PAH s hould result in no change to background therapy 
for the duration of the subject’s  participation in the study. 
 If a change in medical (beyond the 10% increase in  prostacyclin dose) or surgical therapy is 
necessary for the treatment of  progressive PAH before the week 24 primary endpoint visit 
then the subject will complete an Early Endpoint  visit (see Section 6.5. 6) and procedures in 
Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects  numbers 2 and 3 will be 
followed.  After the week 24 endpoint vi sit, the doses of background therapies for PAH may be 
increased and other agents may be added as needed to treat worsening PAH if the subject experiences any one of the following: 
 a deterioration in func tional class and a decrease in 6MWD by > 20%, 
or 
 the development of signs and symptoms of  clinical right heart failure, such as 
worsening edema, ascites, and/or weight gain,  or 
 other objective data sugg esting clinical deterioration, such as worsening 
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics as evidenced by a ≥ 20% decrease in cardiac 
output, a ≥  20% increase in mPAP, or a ≥  20% increase in PVR.

5.7.2.1
Concurrent therapy prednisone (o r equivalent corticosteroid) at ≤ 10mg daily is permitted. 
 Corticosteroid doses may be adjusted with within the 0-10 mg daily range, as 
clinically indicated, as long as they are stable for 4 w eeks prior to the weeks 24 and 
48 endpoint assessments. 
 Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may be administered. 
 To accommodate the occasional use of extra corticosteroids by patients for reasons 
not associated with SSc, increases of up to 60 mg/day that are decreased back to the 
baseline dose within 2 weeks are permitted. Only 2 such increases are permitted during the study. Subjects must be back to  baseline doses of corticosteroid by 4 
weeks prior to the week 24 and week 48 visits. 
 Toxicity Management Plan for Concurrent Therapy: 
5.8
If discontinuation of an agent is required due to toxicity, the study physician will exercise clinical judgment in terms of whether to pres cribe another agent within the same therapeutic 
class, add an agent from a nother therapeutic class, or continue with other background 
therapies already in place. 
 Known Toxicities of Concurrent Therapy 
5.8.1
Endothelin receptor antagonists ha ve the potential to induce severe liver injury and damage 
to the fetus. Elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin are markers for potential 
serious liver injury. It is sugge sted that these laboratory te sts be measured prior to the 
initiation of any of the endothelin receptor antagonists. ERAs are classified by the FDA as 
Category X drugs; pregnancy must be excluded prior to treatment initiation and prevented once treatment has begun. Endothelin receptor antagonists cause a dose dependent decrease 
in hemoglobin. In individuals with severe CHF, endothelin receptor antagonists have been associated with increased fluid retention a nd hospitalization for ex acerbation of CHF.  
 Phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate the hypote nsive effects of nitrates and therefore are 
contraindicated in patients taking organic nitrates either regularl y or intermittently. This class 
of medication has vas odilator properties and may result in transient decreases in blood 
pressure and nose bleeds. Caution should be ex ercised in prescribing PDE-5 inhibitors in

pigmentosa. 
 Epoprostenol is a potent vasodilator and addition al reductions in blood pressure may be seen 
when an individual receives concurrent antihypertensives, diuretics or other vasodilators. There is the potential for epoprostenol to increase bleeding in individuals on anti-platelet 
agents or anticoagulants. Most of the a dverse events experienced by subjects using 
epoprostenol are related to its vasodilatory effect and include nausea, vomiting, headache, 
hypotension, foot/bone pain, and flushing.  Riociguat is a guanylate cyclase stimulator indicated for the treatment of adults with PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity, clin ical worsening and WHO functional class.  
Riociguat is a pregnancy Category X drug and as such is contraindicated for during pregnancy as it may cause fetal harm. Females of reproductive capacity must be enrolled in 
the Adempas REMS program. Pregnancy tes ting should be performed monthly during 
treatment and female patients must agree to acceptable methods of contraception while taking this medication. Co-administration of rioc iguat with nitrates or nitric oxide donors is 
contraindicated as is concomitant administrati on of riociguat with PD E inhibitors, either 
specific PDE-5 inhibitors or nonspecific PDE inhibiters. Riociguat may cause hypotension. 
Serious bleeding was observed in clinical trials  in individuals receiv ing riociguat compared 
to placebo including serious hemoptysis. Sm oking, strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors 
have the potential to change the exposure to riociguat. 
 Prevention and Management of Know n Toxicities to Concurrent Therapy 
5.8.2
It is suggested that subjects receiving endot helin receptor antagonists have liver enzymes and 
a bilirubin tested monthly and a CBC checked ev ery 3 months for anemia. If a subject is 
found to have elevated liver enzymes or falling hemoglobin, the subject will be managed in 
accordance with common clinical practice. Guidelines may be found in the package inserts of 
the relevant medications. The study physician will exercise clinical judgment in determining whether it is necessary to discontinue a medication for toxicity. Study physicians should be aware and subjects should be educated on the drug interactions with endothelin receptor 
antagonists including hormonal contraceptives, ketoconazole, warfarin, rifampicin, and 
statins. If subjects become pre gnant during the course of the trial they will be withdrawn. 
Procedures for withdrawal as detailed in Sections 3.3.3, Subject Withdrawal from the Study  
and 6.5.5, Early Endpoint Visit will be followed. The pregnancy will be reported as detailed in Section 7.6, Pregnancy Reporting . 
 Female subjects receiving rioc iguat therapy should have mo nthly pregnancy testing and 
agree to acceptable methods of contraception.  If a subject becomes pregnant during the 
course of the trial, they will be withdrawn. Proc edures for withdrawal as detailed in Sections 
3.3.3, Subject Withdrawal from the Study  and 6.5.5, Early Endpoint Visit  will be followed. 
The pregnancy will be reported as detailed in Section 7.6, Pregnancy Reporting .  Study 
physicians should be aware and subjects should be educated on the drug interactions with 
riociguat. Co-administration of nitrates, ni tric oxide donors and phophodiesterase inhibitors 
are contraindicated. Blood pressu re should be monitored and doses adjusted as needed if

such as azole anti-mycotics or HIV protease inhibitors. Subjects should be educated on the 
possibility of serious bleeding.  
 Right Heart Catheterization Risk s and Management Guidelines 5.9
Most published reports of advers e events related to RHC have been based on single-center 
experiences with relatively small sample si zes. In the 1980s, Fuster and colleagues [157] 
conducted a long-term, retrospective, follow- up study on 120 patients, and reported a 4.2% 
fatality rate associated with RHC in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In the same decade, a national registry of 187 pa tients with PAH from 32 centers reported a 
complication rate of 5.3%, with no deaths or sustained morbid events related to RHC diagnostic procedures [158].  Two decades later, a study was conducted to in vestigate the complication rates from RHC in 
patients with PAH from 15 experienced PAH cen ters, in both the United States and Europe 
[159]. This 5-year retrospectiv e and a 6-month prospective ev aluation of serious adverse 
events related to RHC procedures in patients with PAH, defined as mean pulmonary artery 
pressure > 25 mmHg at rest, revealed that  the safety of the procedure has improved 
significantly. A total of 7218 RHC procedures  were performed (21%  prospective). The 
overall number of serious adverse events was 76 (1.1%). There were 4 fatalities reported associated with the procedure (0.055%). The re maining 74 nonfatal incidents were classified 
as mild or moderate in severity and reso lved either spontaneously or with minor 
interventions. The most fre quent complications were hematoma at venipuncture sites, 
pneumothoraces, arrhythmias, vasovagal episodes, and hypotensive episodes. The most frequent complications were related to venous access (n = 29, 38%). Internal jugular (IJ) was reported to be the preferred access site (73%) that was associated with a low rate of 
complications (0.3%). 
 
Measures to minimize the risks associated wi th RHC include the use of the IJ approach 
whenever feasible, with ultrasound guidance for direct visualization of the vein. The use of 
fluoroscopy should also be implemented whenev er feasible. Direct visualization under 
fluoroscopy can minimize arrhythmic events, which are more prevalent in patients with an enlarged right atrium or ventricle, including those with PAH. Measurement of the pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure is safer if performe d using fluoroscopy for direct visualization. 
Fluoroscopy does involve exposure to radiati on. Although the radiati on exposure can vary 
from person to person, the whole-body radia tion will be about 200 mrem during each RHC. 
 Other Protocol Standard of Care Recommendations 
5.10
Supplemental oxygen should be provided to subjec ts in order to keep their oxygen saturation 
at or above 90% at all times.  
 Subjects should receive influenza vaccines annu ally per institutional practice preferably not 
within 4 weeks of study drug infusion.

Since the medication is administered as an  IV infusion, study personnel will assure 
compliance with treatment. Personnel who administer the drug will document its 
administration. Study personnel will also monito r patients for compliance with baseline PAH 
stable dose medical therapy.  
6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
 Assessments of Safety 6.1
To assess safety in this population, periphera l blood cell counts, liver  function, and serum 
creatinine will be monitored before enrollment an d at frequent intervals thereafter. Physical 
examinations will be conducted before enrollment and at frequent intervals thereafter. The information from these assessments and subject interviews will be used to characterize the 
frequency of all adverse events Grade 2 or above, all serious adverse events, 
granulocytopenias, and treatment-related adve rse events of NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or higher 
(see Section 7, Safety Monitoring and Reporting ). 
 Recovery of B cells will be monitored by assessi ng B cell levels at baseline and serially post-
treatment until reconstitution is documented. In  addition, quantitative immunoglobulin levels, 
including IgG subclasses, will be serially monitored. Urine or serum pregnancy tests per institutional policy will be performed for all women of child-bearing potential at screening 
and prior to each rituximab infusion.  
 Assessments of Disease Activity and Clinical Response 
6.2
Change in 6MWD as a measure of exercise capacity is the primary efficacy assessment in this trial. Disease activity will be monito red by checking autoantibodies and evaluating 
clinical outcomes including change in PVR measured by right heart catheterization and 
measuring room air oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at screening and serially throughout 
the trial. Changes in severity of Raynaud phe nomenon as measured by the VAS scale of the 
SHAQ, and change in digital ulcer count will be  evaluated. Change in DLCO, a measure of 
disease activity as well as safety, will be followed. BNP/NT-proBNP and serum Na
+ will be 
followed as non-invasive means of assessing heart failure. Change in quality of life will be determined by serial administration of the SF-36 and the SHAQ.  
 Assessments of Mechanistic Endpoints  
6.3
The CD19+ B cell assays will be performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC) at Stanford University. B cell panels may include, but are not limited to IgD FITC, CD24 PE, CD19 PerCP-Cy5.5, CD28 PE-C y7, CD27 APC, CD20 APC-H7, CD3 V450, 
CD45 Pacific Orange.

study will measure and monitor B cell clonal ity utilizing massively parallel V-D-J 
pyrosequencing.   IL-1 and IL-6 concentrations, as well as othe r cytokines, will be measured using multiplex 
assays [40].   Quantitative immunoglobulin levels, including IgG subclasses, will be measured using a Luminex kit on the same instrument. Viable cells  will be assayed by flow cytometry to assess 
the number of CD19+ cells in the phenotyping panel using a LSRII platform.   The autoantibody biomarkers and RF will be analyzed by the Immunoassay Core Laboratory 
at the University of Pittsburgh.   Subjects will be consented for permission to store any leftover blood samples to be used for future IRB-approved research to study the disease SSc-PAH, the immune system, and the 
effect of treatment on this disease.  
 Other Assessments  
6.4
Rituximab serum levels (PK) and HACA levels will be collected at baseline, Week 24, and Week 36, and analyzed by Genentech. 
 Evaluations by Study Visit

Subjects who complete the Week 48 visit or  who reach endpoint early after receiving any 
study drug, but whose B cell numbers have not rec overed, will be followed at least quarterly 
to monitor recovery. Quarterly monitoring visits (12 weeks ± 14 days from the last visit) will 
consist of obtaining a B cell count (at both the central lab and at Stanford Human Immune 
Processing Center for the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center) and CBC (at the 
central lab), and will continue until recovery or for 2 years after initial treatment (whichever 
occurs first). Recovery is defined as the time poi nt at which B cells recover to within 10% of 
baseline levels; if a baseline value is not availabl e then recovery is defined as a B cell level of 
at least 90% of the lower limit of normal. During this monitoring period, AEs and SAEs will 
be assessed, providing the subjec t has not withdrawn consent, only to capture any infectious 
event > Grade 3 using the NCI-CTCAE. No add itional study-related data will be collected. 
 Early Endpoint Visit 6.5.6
Subjects who withdraw early from  the Baseline to Week 48 portion of the study will be asked 
to complete an Early Endpoint Visit. All scheduled exams, procedures, and laboratory tests scheduled for Week 24 will be performed at this visit, unless the early withdrawal is after 
that time, in which case all scheduled exams, procedures, and laboratory tests scheduled for 
Week 48 will be performed. If prohibited medications or treatments as defined in Section 5.6, Prohibited Medications and Treatments  are required for treatment of progressive PAH, the 
Early Endpoint Visit, including th e repeat right heart catheteri zation if withdrawal occurs 
prior to 24 weeks, should occur prior to th e change in medication or therapy.   
 If the subject received any study drug prior to early endpoint and his/her B cell numbers have 
not recovered, that subject requires quarterl y monitoring as described in Section 6.5.5, 
Quarterly Monitoring Visits.   
 
Data from subjects who initiate rituximab ther apy, but do not complete all study visits, will 
still be included in the Intent-t o-Treat (ITT) and safety analyses. 
 Visit Windows 
6.5.7
The screening visit has a window of 28 days between signing of the informed consent 
document and initiation of study treatment. This visit may be divided into several visits as 
scheduling dictates to comple te all assessments and procedures. The baseline/randomization 
visit must be performed within 7 days of star t of study treatment (Day 0). These assessments 
are not required for eligibility evaluation a nd so may be completed after randomization. 
Assessments and procedures listed under th e baseline/randomization visit may be done on 
Day 0 as scheduling allows, so long as all assessm ents are completed prio r to the first dose of 
rituximab treatment. The Week 2 visit (second infusion of rituximab) must be completed 
within 14 ± 4 days of Day 0. All monthly follo w-up visits and phone assessments have a visit 
window of ± 7 days.

The coordinating center should be notified if the study proced ures for any scheduled visit 
cannot be performed within  the designated window. 
 Unscheduled Visits 6.5.8
If disease activity increases or  other concerns arise between  regularly scheduled visits, 
subjects should be instructed to cont act study personnel to determine whether an 
“unscheduled” visit should be completed. Th e following evaluations will be performed at 
each unscheduled visit: 
 
 Adverse Event Assessment 
 Concomitant medication assessment 
 Physical Examination 
 Oxygen Saturation (forehead or ear probe must be used for saturations < 95% by 
finger probe). Measure first at room air, then add/titrate oxyg en if needed to maintain 
O2 saturation ≥  90%. The room air oxygen saturation measurement will be conducted 
at the discretion of the study physician. Th e measurement should not be performed if 
subject safety will be compromised. 
 Other evaluations may be performed at the investigator’s discretion 
 If the unscheduled visit is due to an increase in SSc-PAH disease activity , these additional 
evaluations should also be performed:  
 NYHA Functional Class Assessment 
 6MWT: The subject should complete the assessment with the same amount of 
supplemental oxygen used to complete the Screening 6MWT unless safety will be 
impacted (if the 6MWD decreased from the Screening 6MWD by more than 20%, 
repeat the 6MWT within 7 days, but not on the same day) 
 SF-36 
 SHAQ 
 Digital Ulcer Count 
 Hematology: CBC with differential count and platelet count (hematocrit, hemoglobin,

 Overview 7.1
This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and 
outlines the procedures for appropriately collec ting, grading, recording, and reporting that 
data. Adverse events that are classified as serious according to the definition of health 
authorities must be reported promptly (per Section 7.5, Reporting of Adverse Events ) and 
appropriately to the investigational new dr ug application (IND) sponsor (DAIT/NIAID), 
principal investigators in the trial, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and health authorities. 
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Ex pedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E-6: 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice,  and applies the standards set forth in the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE), Version 
4.0: http://ctep.cancer.go v/reporting/ctc.html. 
 Definitions 7.2
 Adverse Event (or Adverse Experience) 7.2.1
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s particip ation in the research 
(modified from the definition of adverse ev ents in the 1996 Intern ational Conference on 
Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinic al Practice)." [From OHRP "Guidance on 
Reviewing and Reporting Unanticip ated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and 
Adverse Events (1/15/07)" < http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.pdf>  
 Adverse Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction 7.2.2
An adverse reaction means any adverse even t caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event. 
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR ) means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse ev ent. For the purposes of safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means th ere is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event. A suspected advers e reaction implies a lesse r degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 
CFR 312.32(a)). 
 Unexpected Adverse Reaction 7.2.3
A SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not li sted in the investigator brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity  or severity that has been observed. 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 87 of 135 Confidential

Version 8.0                                                          24 April 2017  Serious Adverse Event 7.2.4
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
DAIT/NIAID, it results in any of th e following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Death 
2. A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or DAIT/NI AID, its occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include  an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or subs tantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above. 
  Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 
7.3
 Investigational Product 7.3.1
The primary investigational product in this pr otocol is rituximab/placebo. In addition, 
subjects in this protocol are required to  receive background medical therapy for PAH 
(prostanoid, endothelin receptor antagonist, PD E-5 inhibitor, and/or guanylate cyclase 
stimulators [riociguat (Adempas)]). For purpos es of reporting safety information on the 
MedWatch form, these drugs will be consid ered concurrent study mandated therapy.  
 Collection Period 7.3.2
Adverse events NCI-CTCAE grade 2 and above will be collected from the time the subject 
signs the informed consent until he/she ini tiates study intervention or until he/she is 
determined to be ineligible to receive study inte rvention, if the investig ator determines that 
the adverse event is related to a study-mandated procedure, treatment, or change in treatment . 
 
For all participants, adverse events NCI-CTCAE  grade 2 and above will be collected from 
the time of initiation of study intervention (i.e., the administration of the first dose of study 
drug/study drug as defined in Section 6.5.3.1, Visit 3 [Day 0] ) until he/she completes study 
participation or until 30 days after he/she  prematurely withdraw s (without withdrawing 
consent) or is withdrawn from the study. 
 Collection of Adverse Events 7.3.3
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be  discovered through any of these methods:

electrocardiogram) can also indicate an a dverse event, as defined in Section 7.4, 
Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events.  
 Recording Adverse Events 7.3.4
Throughout the study, the investigator will r ecord and grade adverse events NCI-CTCAE 
grade 2 and above on the appropriate AE elect ronic case report form (AE eCRF) regardless 
of their severity or relation to study medication or study procedure.  
 
Once recorded, an AE will be followed until it re solves with or without sequelae, or until the 
end of study participation, or until 30 days after the subject prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn fr om the study, whichever occurs first. 
 Recording Serious Adverse Events 
7.3.5
Serious AEs will be recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF and on the SAE eCRF. All requested information on the AE eCRF and SAE eCRF should be provided, if available, for 
submission to the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SACCC) and DAIT/NIAID. 
New SAEs will be recorded until end of study participation OR for 30 days after premature 
withdrawal OR as in Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects  for 
subjects for whom B cells have not recovered.  
Once recorded, an SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae OR until 
30 days after the end of study pa rticipation UNLESS it is a Grade 3 or higher infection in an 
individual for whom B cells have not recovered (as per Section 3.3.2.1, Follow-up 
Requirements for All Treated Subjects ), in which case it will be followed until resolution. 
 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 
7.4
 Grading Criteria 7.4.1
The study site will grade the severity of adve rse events experienced by the study subjects 
according to the criteria set forth in  the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events Version (CTCAE) 4.0. This document (referred to herein as the 
NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze 
and interpret data, and to articulate the clinic al significance of all adverse events. The NCI- 
CTCAE has been reviewed by the Protocol Chair( s) and has been deemed appropriate for the 
subject population to be studied in this protocol. 
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in 
the NCI-CTCAE manual: 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 89 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0                                                          24 April 2017 Grade 1 = mild adverse event. 
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event. Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event. Grade 4 = life-threatening or disabling adverse event. Grade 5 = death. 
If NCI-CTCAE criteria are defined for grading an abnormal value or result from a clinical or 
laboratory evaluation (including,  but not limited to, a radiog raph, an ultrasound, or an 
electrocardiogram), then a treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an increase in 
grade from Baseline (Day 0) or from the last post-baseline value that doesn’t meet grading 
criteria. Changes in grade from screening to Baseline (Day 0) will also be recorded as 
adverse events but are not treatment-emergent.  If a specific event or result from a given 
clinical or laboratory evaluation is not in cluded in the NCI-CTCAE manual, then an 
abnormal result would be considered an advers e event if changes in therapy or monitoring 
are implemented. 
 Attribution Definitions 
7.4.2
The relation, or attribution, of an adverse event to an investigational pr oduct will initially be 
determined by the site investigator. The site investigator will also record the initial 
determination of attribution on the appropriate AE eCRF. The relation of an adverse event to 
the study intervention will be determined using the descriptors and de finitions provided in 
Table 7.4.2. Final determination of attribut ion for safety reporting will be decided by 
DAIT/NIAID.

 Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIT/NIAID 7.5.1
This section describes the respons ibilities of the site investigat or to report adverse events to 
the SACCC. Timely reporting of adverse ev ents is required by 21 CFR and ICH E6 
guidelines. For this study, adverse events  of NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 and higher will be 
reported. 
 Unless otherwise noted below in Section 7.5.1.1 as requiring 24 hour reporting, AEs must be recorder on the appropriate AE eCRF within five (5) days of the site learning of the event(s).  
 Procedure for Adverse Events Requiring 24 Hour Reporting 
7.5.1.1
The adverse events that are bulleted below must  be reported by site investigators to the 
SACCC regardless of relationship or expectedness to study interven tion within a 24 hour 
period of discovering the adverse event: 
 All SAEs per 21 CFR 312.32 definitions (see Section 7.2.4, Serious Adverse 
Event). 
 All clinical events with  a NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or greater deemed possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to rituximab; 
 Note: clinical events include clinical signs/symptoms and diagnoses and laboratory abnormalities with clinical consequence (defined as the requirement for intervention, corr ection, increased monitoring, or 
further evaluation). 
 Administration of atropine, dopamine, or ot her inotropic agents  within 24 hours of 
rituximab/placebo infusion; 
 Any event that the site considers Se rious but is not easily categorized. 
Elective hospitalizations or hos pital admissions for the purpose of conduct of protocol-
mandated procedures are not to be reported as  an SAE unless hospita lization is prolonged 
due to complications. 
The following process for reporting of the adve rse events bulleted above ensures compliance 
with the ICH guidelines and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) CFR regulations. 
When an investigator identifies such an adve rse event, he or she must notify the SACCC 
within 24 hours of discovering the adverse event, and complete and submit the AE/SAE 
eCRF within 1 business day following initial notification. The SACCC is responsible for 
notifying DAIT/NIAID upon receipt of the site’s  notification of the adverse event and 
sending a SAE report form to DAIT/NIAID with in 2 business days after receipt of the 
AE/SAE eCRF from the site.

All other adverse even ts (Section 7.3.3, Collecting Adverse Events ) must be recorded by the 
site on the appropriate AE eCRF within 5 busine ss days of the site learning of the adverse 
event(s). 
 DAIT/NIAID Reporting to the Health Authority 7.5.2
After an adverse event requiring 24 h our reporting (per Section 7.5.1.1, Procedure for 
Adverse Events Requiring 24 Hour Reporting ) is submitted by the site investigator and 
assessed by DAIT/NIAID, there are two options for DAIT/NIAID to report the adverse event 
to the appropriate health authorities: 
 Annual IND Report. This option applies if the adverse event is classified as one of 
the following: 
o Serious, expected, suspected adverse reactions (see Section 7.2.2, Adverse 
Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction, and Section 7.2.3, Unexpected 
Adverse Reaction ). 
o Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 7.2.2, Adverse 
Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction ). 
Note that all adverse events (not just  those requiring 24 hour reporting) will be 
reported in the Annual IND Report. 
 Expedited Safety Report. This option applies if the adverse event is classified as one 
of the following: 
o Serious and unexpected suspected ad verse reaction (see Section 7.2.2, Adverse 
Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 7.2.3, Unexpected 
Adverse Reaction ). 
o Aggregate analysis of adverse events that suggests a causal relationship to rituximab. 
o Any findings from clinical or epidemiological studies, analysis of data pooled across multiple studies, published or unpublished scientific papers, or from animal or in vitro testing that would re sult in a safety-related change in the 
protocol, informed consent, investigat or brochure or ot her aspects of the 
overall conduct of the trial will be reported. 
Safety Reports must be reported by DAI T/NIAID to the appropriate health 
authorities within 15 calendar days; fatal or immediately life-threatening serious, 
unexpected, suspected adverse reactions mu st be reported within 7 calendar days. 
 Safety reports will be provided to Genentech, Inc. per the terms negotiated in the 
Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA). 
 Reporting of Adverse Events to IRBs 
7.5.3
All investigators must report adverse events, in cluding expedited reports, in a timely fashion 
to their respective IRBs in accordance with  applicable regulations and guidelines. 
All IND Safety Reports to the FDA will be distributed by the DAIT/NIAID or designee to all 
participating institutions for site IRB submission.

This study includes pregnancy information as sa fety data. Information about any pregnancy 
should be reported promptly to the SACCC on the same timeline as an SAE (Section 7.5.1.1 , 
Procedure for Adverse Events  Requiring 24 Hour Reporting). 
All pregnancies identified during the study must  be followed to conclusion and the outcome 
of each must be reported. The investigator shou ld be informed immediately of any pregnancy 
in a study subject or a partner of a study subjec t. A pregnant subject s hould be instructed to 
stop taking study medication. The investigator should report to the SACCC all pregnancies 
within 1 business day (as described in Section 7.5.1.1, Procedure for Adverse Events 
Requiring 24 Hour Reporting) using the Pregnancy eCRF. The investigator should counsel 
the subject and discuss the risk s of continuing with the pregna ncy and the possible effects on 
the fetus. Monitoring of the pregnant subject should continue until the conclusion of the 
pregnancy, and an updated Pregnancy eCRF deta iling the outcome of the pregnancy should 
be submitted to the SACCC. When possible, similar information should be obtained for a pregnancy occurring in a partner of a study subject. 
Information requested about the delivery will include: 
 Subject’s enrollment ID 
 Gestational age at delivery 
 Birth weight, length, and head circumference 
 Gender 
 Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute, 
5 minutes, and 24 hours after birth, if available 
 Any abnormalities. 
Should the pregnancy result in a congenital a bnormality or birth defect, an SAE must be 
submitted to the SACCC using the SAE reporting procedures described above. 
 Reporting of Other Safety Information 
7.7
An investigator should promptly notify the SACCC when an “unanticipated problem 
involving risks to subjects or others” is identif ied, which is not otherwise reportable as an 
adverse event. 
 Review of Safety Information 7.8
 Medical Monitor Review 7.8.1
The DAIT Medical Monitor will receive mont hly reports from the SACCC compiling new 
and accumulating information on AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies recorded by the sites on 
appropriate eCRFs. 
In addition, the Medical Mon itor will receive SAE and preg nancy reports for review and 
triage after the SACCC is made aware of these events (See Sections 7.5.1, Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIT/NIAID , and 7.6, Pregnancy Reporting ).

The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review accumulating safety data at least 
yearly during planned DSMB Data Review Me etings. Data for the planned safety reviews 
will include, at a minimum, a listing of all repo rted AEs and SAEs. To ensure patient safety 
between Data Review Meetings, the DSMB will be informed of all Expedited Safety Reports in a timely manner. 
In addition to the pre-scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may 
be called upon for ad hoc reviews or emergency meetings. The DSMB will review any event that potentially impacts safety at the request of the protocol chair or DAIT/NIAID. In addition, the following events will trigger both a comprehensive DSMB Emergency Safety 
Review and a temporary halt in enrollment: 
a. Any immediately life threaten ing event or death that occurs in the study which is 
unexpected and possibly, probably, or defi nitely related to study intervention. 
b. Any event, including those listed in Section 3.3.2, Discontinuation of Protocol-
Specified Treatment Requirements , that results in perm anent discontinuation of 
infusion of study intervention occurring in 2 of the first 5 subjects, 4 of the first 15 subjects, 6 of the first 30 subj ects, or a total of 8 events after 30 subjects have been 
enrolled in the trial. 
c. Any occurrence of PML. 
d. Clinical Grade 3 or higher events or SAEs which are possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment but do not result  in discontinuation of study treatment will 
be reviewed whenever the ratio of events to enrolled subjects is 20% (e.g. 9 events for 47 subjects, 10 events for 48-52 subjects, 11 events for 53-57 subjects, etc.).  
o Note: clinical events include clinic al signs/symptoms and diagnoses and 
laboratory abnormalities with clinical  consequence (defined as the 
requirement for intervention, correcti on, increased monitoring, or further 
evaluation). 
The DSMB will have discretion to recommend actions regarding study conduct and 
continuation as a consequence of any planned or unplanned monitoring activity. 
 Temporary Halt in Enrollment for Emergency Safety Review 
7.8.2.1
A temporary halt in enrollment will occur for the events listed in Section 7.8.2, DSMB 
Review  with the exception of 7.8.2. d. For events falling under 7. 8.2.d, a halt in enrollment 
will occur if the DSMB Emergency Safety Review is not completed within 2 weeks. In the event that the study temporarily halts enrollme nt, no new subjects will be consented or start 
on therapy with rituximab or placebo; and s ubjects already on rituximab or placebo will 
continue on therapy unless they are the focus of  the DSMB review. Subjects in the screening 
phase of the study may continue to undergo minimal risk procedures (e.g. blood tests), but more than minimal risk procedures should be deferred. Randomization will not occur until the DSMB review is complete. The FDA will be  notified of any halt in enrollment. After

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIO NS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
 Sample Size 8.1
As of May 2014, 30 subjects had enrolled in the study.  The slow pace of enrollment 
prompted a redesign of the trial with the obj ective of reducing the sample size to enable 
completion of the study within 2 years while still retaining the pot ential to address a 
clinically relevant question. Sixty was the larges t sample size felt to be attainable (down from 
80).   
 Through version 5.0 of the protocol, the prim ary endpoint was the change in PVR from 
baseline to Week 24, defining a 20-30% im provement from baseline as clinically 
significant. Assuming a baseline mean of 810 dyne-s/cm
5, a drop at Week 24 equal to 251 
dyne-s/cm5  would be considered clinically signif icant.  Power was 85% for a design with 80 
subjects, assuming the baseline mean was the same for both arms (i.e. 810 dyne-s/cm5), a 
standard deviation in the change from base line of 350 dyne-s/cm5, and the percent change 
from baseline equals 0% and 30% for pl acebo and rituximab arms, respectively. 
 Contrary to the original assumption that  the mean baseline PVR was 810 dyne-s/cm
5, review 
of the data revealed that the mean baseline PVR for the enrolled subjects was approximately 
553 dyne-s/cm5.  Hence, relative to an assumed p opulation baseline m ean of 553 dyne-s/cm5, 
the difference of 251 dyne-s/cm5 used in the original power/sample size computation would 
equate to an improvement of 46%.  The magnit ude of the drop is much larger than the 
clinically meaningful effect and is overly optimistic (or completely unrealistic). This degree of change is not needed to demonstrate clinic al efficacy. Further, if the baseline mean is 
smaller than originally anticipated, a larger (n ot smaller) study would be needed to detect a 
clinically meaningful effect.    The 6MWD has been the most utilized endpoint  in PAH trials, and a 33m improvement from 
baseline is considered clinica lly significant [160].  For sample  size calculations, we assume a 
change from baseline of 0m for the placebo arm and 33m for the rituximab arm.   An effect size of this magnitude is attainable in a 24 week  period, and has been seen in as little as 12 
weeks in studies using vasodilators.  Assuming a standard deviation of 58m (a best guess 
based on prior studies) and a 20% drop out rate, ASC01 would be powered at 50% to detect a 
treatment group difference of 33m for this phase II study.  If a significant result is found for 
this primary efficacy endpoint and no safety signals emerge, this study could provide a definitive conclusion about this treatment.  In order to achieve 80% power, the true 
difference between treatment groups would have to be at least 50m.  While other studies 
evaluating other drugs have seen this magnitude of difference in similar timeframes, we have 
no data on rituximab to suggest the true differe nce is at least 50m. Furthermore, rituximab 
would be interesting as a therapy option if  the effect size is as small as 33m.

 Safety Population 8.2.1
The Safety Population (SP), which will be used  for all safety analyses, will include all 
subjects for whom study treatment is initiated. 
 Intent-to-Treat Population  8.2.2
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) popul ation will include all randomi zed subjects who initiate 
rituximab therapy and meet entry criteria. Randomized subjects who withdraw from the trial 
prior to starting rituximab infusion will be excluded from the ITT analysis set and replaced. The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population, as will key secondary efficacy and mechanistic analyses. Subjects who,  for whatever reason, do not complete their 
assigned therapy will be incl uded in the ITT population in th e groups to which they were 
randomized. 
 Per Protocol Population 
8.2.3
The Per Protocol (PP) population will be defined as those subjects who comply with the assigned treatment protocol by comple ting two IV infusions of 1000mg of 
Rituximab/Placebo at Visit 3 and Visit 4 as well as completing primary endpoint evaluation (6MWD ) at Visit 10 with no major protocol deviations that would affect their efficacy outcome. Subjects who are withdrawn from follow-up prior to Visit 10 will not be included in the PP population. A masked data review panel will evaluate deviations from the protocol including, for example, violations of entry criteria, departures from assigned treatment 
regimen, or administration of study procedur es outside the specified visit windows. The 
panel may exclude subjects with serious protoc ol deviations from the PP population. Both the 
primary analyses and all secondary analys es will be replicated on the PP population. 
 Statistical Methods 
8.3
In presenting data from this trial, continuous data will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard deviation or standard error, median, and number of subjects in a group. 
Categorical data will be summarized in tables listing the frequency and the percentage of subjects in a group. These summaries will be presented separately for subjects on the two 
treatment arms.  
 Safety Analysis 
8.3.1
All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population.  
AEs including changes in laboratory values will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events Version (CTCAE) 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html). The frequency of AEs will be summarized by 
system organ class, preferred term, severity (grade), and relationshi p to study treatment. For 
each of these summaries, subjects will be coun ted at most once within each organ class or

Version 8.0                                                          24 April 2017 preferred term at the greatest severity. For these summaries, relationship to study treatment 
will be categorized as either treatment related (possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
study medication) or unrelated. Similar analyses will be performed for SAEs.  
For all reported adverse events and SAEs, the risk of the event in each arm will be described 
using event rates and an analysis based on a Poisson regression model will be conducted to 
compare the rate of each type of event in the treatment groups. The proportion of subjects experiencing at least one even t will be reported and the trea tment groups compared based on 
Fisher’s Exact Test.  
Treatment-related mortality, defined as deat h occurring at any time after randomization and 
possibly, probably, or definitely resulting from study treatment, and all-cause mortality, 
defined as any death occurring after randomiza tion, will be summarized. The proportion of 
subjects dying in each treatment group will be reported and the treatment groups compared 
based on Fisher’s Exact Test. Laboratory parameters will be summarized both overall and by treatment group using 
appropriate descriptive statisti cs. For quantitative safety parameters, change from the last 
pre-randomization assessment to the final vi sit assessment will be summarized overall and by 
treatment group. For qualitative pa rameters, descriptive informati on on shifts in pre- to post-
randomization findings will be provided. In a ddition, abnormal and clinically significant 
abnormalities will be summarized and listed separately. All safety comparisons and associated p-values  are considered exploratory, not as formal 
tests of hypothesis. As such no adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons and all p-
values must be interpreted cautiously. 
Detailed listings of AEs, deaths, and safety-r elated laboratory values  will be generated as 
specified in the Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP). 
 Efficacy Analysis 
8.3.2
  Primary Efficacy Analysis 8.3.2.1
The primary efficacy analysis for this study is designed to test the sc ientific hypothesis that 
rituximab has a beneficial clinical impact  on SSc-PAH as measured by improvement or 
stabilization in 6MWD between baseline to 24 w eeks in patients treated with standard of care 
plus rituximab than in patients treated with st andard of care plus placebo. Operationally for 
this study, this scientific hypothesis will be  examined by formally testing the following 
statistical hypothesis: 
 
H0: The mean change in 6MWD between baseline and 24 weeks does not differ 
between individuals treated with ritu ximab and those treated with placebo 
 (δrituximab  = δ placebo where δx = mean 6MWD at 24 weeks – mean 6MWD at 
baseline) 
 versus

Version 8.0                                                          24 April 2017  
HA:  The mean change in 6MWD between baseline and 24 weeks is more 
beneficial in those indivi duals treated with rituximab than in those treated 
with placebo 
 (δrituximab  < δ placebo where δx = mean 6MWD at 24 weeks – mean 6MWD at 
baseline) 
 
While this hypothesis is inherently one-sided, two-sided tests will be used in the analysis. 
This primary hypothesis will be tested using a repeated measures random effects model to 
model change from baseline in 6MWD as the primary outcome and treatment as the primary 
predictor, controlling for visit day, limitations by musculoskeleta l disease, baseline measures 
of 6MWD, and a treatment by visit day interactio n  A random slope and in tercept will be fit 
for each subject.  An unstructured covariance ma trix will be assumed for the random effects. 
More details on this analysis and sensitivity analyses will be defined in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population. 
  Secondary Efficacy Analysis 8.3.2.2
All secondary analyses will be conducted in an exploratory fashion with p-values and confidence intervals presented as descriptive statistics with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. Tests will be two-sided and inte rval estimates will be generated at the 95% 
confidence level. As part of secondary analys es, appropriate contrast s will be constructed 
using model-based approaches. Larger models will be constructed for these comparisons with consideration of additional covariates that are found to differ between the treatment groups. 
Covariates may include, but are not limited to: study center, method of cardiac output, 
gender, disease duration and severity, and conc omitant therapy use. All analyses will be 
repeated using the Per Protocol Population.   
Change from baseline in PVR at Week 24 and pe rcent change from baseline in PVR at Week 
24 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance, adjusting for treatment, method of 
cardiac output, and baseline PVR.  For the outcome time to clinical worsening, th e two groups will be compared using survival 
approaches. Graphical summaries of time to clinical worsening will be generated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with a log-rank test  used to test for differences in the two arms. 
The two arms will also be compared after control of appropriate covariates using a Cox proportional hazards model.  For the proportion of subjects who changed or added PAH therapeutic agents, the treatment 
two arms will be compared using a logistic regression model, controlling for appropriate 
covariates. This will be done at the following time points: prior to week 24 and after week 
24.  Longitudinal changes in continuous outcome meas ures including the subscales of the SF-36, 
the SHAQ, and DLCO will be co mpared across the two arms using linear mixed models.  
Initially the models will be used to describe changes between baseline and 24 weeks and

and an indicator if the measurement was affect ed by changed or new PAH therapeutic agents, 
with added models developed to asse ss the effect of other covariates. 
 
Longitudinal changes in the six-minute walk distance at week 48 will be assessed using a 
similar model as the primary endpoint, but incl uding all data through 48 weeks. This model 
will address any subject who had their 6MWD affected by new or changed PAH therapeutic agents after the 24 week time point.  Additiona lly, the analysis will be conducted on the ITT 
population will additionally add limited by any musculoskeletal disease (yes/no) as a 
covariate. Additional models may be developed to assess the effect of other covariates.  Longitudinal change in the oxygen saturation w ill be compared across the two arms using 
generalized estimating equations. An ordinal response variable will be used to account for the subjects that cannot perform the room air a ssessment. Initially the model will be used to 
describe changes between baseline and 24 w eeks and baseline and 48 weeks including only 
treatment, baseline levels of oxygen saturation, and an indicator if the measurement was affected by changed or new PAH therapeutic ag ents, with added models developed to assess 
the effect of other covariates. However, if al l subjects can perform the room air assessment, 
the data will be analyzed as  a continuous model, following the method described above for 
the six-minute walk distance.  Longitudinal change in number of new digital ulcers will be compared across the two arms 
using Poisson marginal models for longitudinal data. Initially the models will be used to 
describe changes between baseline and 24 w eeks and baseline and 48 weeks including only 
treatment, baseline levels of the outcome of interest, and an indicator if the measurement was affected by changed or new PAH therapeutic agen ts , with added models developed to assess 
the effect of other covariates. 
 Mechanistic/Immunological Analysis 
8.3.3
Because of the exploratory nature of the analys es, descriptive statistics and plots (including, 
but not limited to, those described subsequently) will be used to gain an understanding of the 
data prior to developing any statistical models. Means, medians, standard deviations, 
minimums and maximums will be computed for each continuous biomarker at each time 
point for placebo and rituximab groups and separately for treatment responders / non-
responders. For dichotomous biomarkers, frequenc ies and percents will be computed at each 
time point for placebo and rituximab groups an d separately for trea tment responders / non-
responders. Treatment response, to be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), will be 
based on PVR, exercise capacity as measured by 6MWD, or quality of life as measured by SF-36 and SHAQ. To gain a better understandin g of trends over time, summary statistics 
(e.g. means, medians, or percents) will be plot ted versus time at the relevant time points. 
Plots for individual subjects may also be useful.

Version 8.0                                                          24 April 2017  Exploratory Analysis 8.3.4
Agreement between a secondary endpoint (PVR calculated by site-based  standards) and the 
standardized Fick-based calculation of PVR (PVRf) will be assessed using the method of 
Bland and Altman, separately for baseline and Week 24 right heart cathe terization. Analyses 
will also be subset on method of calculation of  cardiac output (thermodilution vs. Fick) if 
found to be a significant pred ictor in the ANCOVA model. 
 
This secondary efficacy analysis will be repeat ed for PVRf. Change from baseline in the 
standardized Fick-based calculation of pulmonary artery capacitance (PACf) will also be analyzed in the same manner as the PVR efficacy analysis.  Additionally, the relationship between change in PVR and change in 6MWD at Week 24 will be analyzed using a Spearman’s rank corre lation coefficient. Relationships between 
additional clinical outcomes and 6MWD or PV R can also be provided.  These clinical 
outcomes will be addressed in the SAP.  The analyses of Treatment Satisfaction responses will also be considered exploratory.  Questions will include: 
1. Do you think you benefited by being in the study? 
2. Have you noticed any long term benefits from study treatment?  
3. Do you think you received rituximab or placebo? 
 All exploratory analyses will be conducted on subjects in the ITT population with available data. 
 Interim Analysis 
8.4
Results of interim analyses will be reported to the DSMB for planned Data Review Meetings. 
Reports prepared for these meetings will focus on study conduct and subject safety and may 
include information on enrollment, randomization, site activation status, protocol deviations, 
subject status and demographi cs, and safety analyses.  
 Interim Analysis of Efficacy Data 8.4.1
There will not be any interim analysis on efficacy data for this trial. 
 Interim Analysis of Safety Data 8.4.2
The DSMB will periodically review safety data as described in Section 7.8.2, DSMB Review . 
The safety analyses for this trial will be descrip tive rather than inferential. Detailed listings 
and summary tabulations of adverse events and safety-related laboratory values will be generated as specified in the Statistical Analys is Plan. The safety analyses will be completed 
using the safety population without stratification. 
No formal stopping rules for safety endpoints are specified.

 Covariates 8.5.1
The primary analysis will be adjusted for as stated above. 
If the analyses described in Section 8.5.4, Examination of Subgroups yield covariates that 
differ significantly between treatment groups, then, as a secondary analysis, these covariates 
may also be considered for adjustment in the models specified for the primary analysis. Covariates that may be considered include, but are not limited to: age,  study center, gender, 
race, duration of SSc-PAH disease, baseli ne and concomitant medication use, undergoing 
cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (yes/no) , non-biologic immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulating drug use (yes/no), a nd non-biologic immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulating drug change after 6 months (yes/no). 
 Multi-center Studies 
8.5.2
Due to the small sample size and large number of sites needed for th is study, study center 
will not be included as a covariate in the anal ysis.  However, if evidence of a study center 
effect exists and there are appropriate sample si zes at each site, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed including study center in the efficacy analyses. All safety analyses will be based 
on data pooled across all centers with no adjustment or stra tification by center. 
 Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity 8.5.3
This study has a single primary analysis desi gned to assess the efficacy of rituximab in 
clinical response as measured by change in PVR. Consequently, no adjustments for 
multiplicity are needed for Type I error protection. The secondary efficacy analyses are considered to be descriptive with p-values a nd confidence intervals presented as descriptive 
measures of strength of evidence rather than  formal statistical inference. Therefore, no 
multiplicity adjustments are needed for this study. 
 Examination of Subgroups 
8.5.4
Secondary analyses of the primary and sec ondary objectives may be conducted for the 
following subgroups: 
 Race 
 Ethnicity 
 Gender 
 Baseline PVR 
 Baseline 6MWD 
 NYHA Functional Class 
 Duration of SSc-PAH disease 
 
Additionally, exploratory analyses of res ponder subgroups and subgroups defined through 
the mechanistic and immunological  studies will be conducted.

Standard procedures will be used to ensure that data are as complete and accurate as possible. 
In analyses, a full accounting will be made for all data items. Because this is a Phase II trial 
that is underpowered, there will not be a ny additional handling of  missing data for the 
primary analysis.  However, sensitivity analyses  will be performed to assess the robustness of 
the conclusions under different assumptions. For example, missing data due to death of a 
subject prior to Week 24 would be handled di fferently than missing data due to a missed 
visit. 
As described in Section 3.3.3.1, Follow-up Requirements for All Treated Subjects , every 
effort will be made to obtain 6MWD for patient s withdrawing prior to the 24 week visit. For 
the primary analysis, this observation will be included in the repeated measures model and 
will contribute to the estimated mean change from baseline at Week 24.  
Secondary analyses will be performed on all av ailable data; no imputation will be performed 
on missing data, recognizing that these explorator y analyses could be biased in an unknown 
direction by non-ignorably missing data.  
If data are missing for the primary endpoint, se nsitivity analyses will be conducted to assess 
whether conclusions are robust to alternative an alytic approaches for handling these data. If 
data are missing for other key endpoints, sensit ivity analyses could al so be conducted, if 
deemed appropriate. Details of the sensitivity analyses will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
 Changes to the Statistical Analysis Plan 8.5.6
A detailed description of the planned analyses will be provided in a SAP to be completed and 
signed off prior to the completion of the trial. Major changes from this protocol will be noted 
in the SAP. If there is sufficient reason to do so, revised plans may be issued during the course of the study. Changes to the SAP that ar e made subsequent to database lock will be 
documented in the clinical study report. 
9 ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA AND DOCUMENTS 
Each participating site will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality permitted for the clinical and research information obtained from subjects participating in this clinical trial. Medical and research records should be maintained at each site in the strictest confidence. However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, each 
site must permit authorized representatives of  the IND sponsor, the SACCC, Genentech, Inc., 
and health authorities to examine (and when re quired by applicable law,  to copy) clinical 
records for the purposes of quality assurance re views, audits, and evaluation of the study 
safety and progress. Unless required by the laws permitting copying of records, only the 
coded identity associated with documents or ot her subject data may be copied (obscuring any 
personally identifying information). Authorized representatives as not ed above are bound to 
maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals. Participating sites will normally be notified in advance of auditing 
visits.

All subject records and study documentation will be kept after the protocol is completed. 
This will include all documenta tion of AEs, records of study drug receipt and dispensation, 
and all IRB correspondence. All study records wi ll be kept for at l east 2 years after the 
investigation is completed. 
10 DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY 
ASSURANCE 
The investigator is requ ired to keep accurate records to ensure the conduct of the study is 
fully documented. The period of record retent ion should be consiste nt with the record 
retention policies of the sponsoring agency or applicable regulatory agencies. However, in 
certain instances, documents should be retain ed for a longer period if required by the 
applicable regulatory agency or by the National Institutes of Health. 
 The investigator will report all protocol deviations to DAIT and the SACCC per the instructions in the ACE Manual of Operations . The SACCC will forward reports of protocol 
deviations to the responsible DAIT/NIAID medical officer for review as specified in the 
ACE Manual of Operations.  The SACCC is responsible for re gular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying 
adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency and accuracy of all documented data.  Data will be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not limited to laboratory notebooks, automated instrument output files, an d clinical subject char ts. Data from these 
source materials will be transmitted to th e SACCC via one of two mechanisms. Data 
collected electronically at central laboratories w ill be transferred electronically directly from 
the laboratory to the SACCC using standard secure data transfer procedures. Data collected at the clinical sites will be transmitted to the SACCC using an internet-based remote data entry system. Clinical site personnel use an inte rnet browser to key data  into electronic CRFs 
(eCRFs); each eCRF page is submitted to the SACCC data server electr onically as the page 
is completed. Univariate data validation tests are performed as the data  are keyed. The central 
database, which resides on the SACCC server, is backed up nightly; backup tapes are saved in a secure, off-site location. At any time, aut horized site personnel may log in to the remote 
data entry system, review and correct previously entered data , or key additional data. The 
data will be further validated per the study data validation plan via a series of computerized 
and manual edit checks, and all relevant data queries will be raised and resolved on an 
ongoing basis. Complete, clean data will be frozen to prevent further inadvertent 
modifications. All discrepancies will be review ed and any resulting queries will be resolved 
with the investigators and amended in the database. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, 
date, verbatim text, and the person performing the data entry) will be recorded in an 
electronic audit trail to allow al l data changes in the database to be monitored and maintained 
in accordance with federal regulations.

Vascular Resistance and Pulmonary Artery Capacitance 
Standardized Fick-based pulmonary vascul ar resistance (PVRf, in Woods Units) and 
pulmonary artery capacitance (PACf, in mL/mmHg) are calculated as follows: 
 PVR = TPG / CO  where TPG = Transpulmonary Gradient (mmHg)   CO = Cardiac Output (L/min)  TPG = mPAP – PCWP  where mPAP = mean pulmonary artery pressure (mmHg)   PCWP = mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mmHg)  Thus, the Fick-based calculation of PVR is:  PVRf = (mPAP – PCWP) / COf  where COf = Fick cardiac output (L/min) 
 
COf = VO
2 / ((Ca – Cv) x cHb x 13.6) 
 where VO 2 = oxygen consumption according to LaFarge and Meittinen 
(mL/min)[161]   Ca = arterial oxygen saturation (%) (systemic) 
  Cv = venous oxygen saturation (%) (pulmonary artery) 
  cHb = hemoglobin concentration (g/L) 
 VO
2(males) = (138.1 – 11.49 lnAge + 0.378 HR) x BSA 
VO 2(females) = (138.1 – 17.04 lnAge + 0.378 HR) x BSA 
 where lnAge = natural log of age in years   HR = heart rate (beats/min)   BSA = body surface area (m
2) 
 The DuBois and DuBois formula is used to calculate body surface area. BSA (m²) = 0.20247 x Height(m)
0.725 x Weight(kg)0.425 
 Pulmonary artery capacitance is calculated as follows. PACf = SVf / PP  where SV = stroke volume (mL)   PP = pulse pressure (mmHg)   SVf = COf x 1000 / HR  
PP = systolic PAP – diastolic PAP  where PAP is the pulmonary artery pressure

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 Sub-study Protocol Synopsis 
Title of Sub-study Protocol:   Right Ventricular Response to Rituximab in Systemic Sclerosis Associated Pulmonary Arterial 
Hypertension – A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-study (RESTORE Sub-Study) 
Investigators:    David N Rosenthal, MD; Roham T Zamani an, MD, FCCP; Jeffrey A Feinstein, MD, MPH 
Objectives :  
The primary objective of the RESTORE sub-study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of rituximab on the right ventricle (RV) 
in patients with SSc-PAH. Changes in right ventricular end diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and stroke volume (SV) 
determined by cardiac MRI will be used as surrogates of RV function and prognosis. We hypothesize that RVEDVI and SV 
will reduce 24 weeks following rituximab therapy as compared to the placebo control. 
Criteria for Evaluation : 
All cardiac MRI (CMRI) endpoints will be assessed at baseline and at the Week 24 follow-up (or at time of discontinuation 
from the study) in 20 patients from each arm (80 studies total). The change in RVEDVI, RV ma ss, and SV will be analyzed 
and compared between placebo and rituximab cohorts. These sub-study endpoints will be used to augment the hemodynamic 
findings of the main study (ASC01). It is likely that comparison between hemodynamic response and surrogates of RV 
function by cardiac MRI will be valuable. Correlation of hemodynamic and CMRI parameters may allow for further determination of mechanisms  of therapeutic effect of  rituximab in this study. 
Study Design : 
Enrollment for the RESTORE sub-study will parallel that of th e ASC01 protocol. The sub-study will enroll patients who have 
consented for the primary clinical study across all centers th at participate in the RESTORE sub-study. The sub-study is 
designed to compare 20 rituximab with 20 placebo treated patients at baseline and at the Week 24 follow up. All ASC01 study 
inclusion and exclusion criteria apply. Furthermore, there are additional exclusion criteria that  pertain only to the RESTORE 
sub-study: 1) known hypersensitivity to Gadolinium, 2) inability to tolerate or cooperate with MRI, 3) morbid obesity, and 4) 
presence of metallic objects or pacemakers.  
 
Efficacy Endpoints: 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be change in RVEDVI measured by cardiac MRI from baseline to 24 weeks after 
treatment initiation. 
The secondary efficacy endpoi nts will be as follows: 
1. Change in RV mass measured by cardiac MRI from ba seline to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. 
2. Change in SV measured by cardiac MRI from baseline to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. 
Images and Analyses: 
Cardiac MR imaging will be performed on an y 1.5 T scanner (standard clinical equipment will meet these specifications) with 
simultaneous ECG recording. Image acquisition is based on routine MR protocols for traditional volumetric parameters 
supplemented with a delayed enhancement perfusion protocol (gadolinium). The detailed MRI protocol is specified in the 
Manual of Procedures (MOP), but will include short axis and four chamber views of the heart, and MRI angiography in the 
pulmonary artery and aorta. This will be followed by contrast enhanced imaging using gadolinium to determine myocardial perfusion in a four chamber view, and to evaluate for late enhancement using four chamber and short axis views.  
Image analysis will be carried out off-line by investigators at Stanford University who are bl inded to treatment arm, using 
validated MRI software tools such as QMass/QFlow (Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Raleigh, NC).  
Sample Size and Statistical Analyses :  
This sub-study will include 20 subjects treated with  rituximab and 20 subjects treated with placebo. 
The primary efficacy analysis of change in RVEDVI from baseli ne to 24 weeks will be perform ed on the intention-to-treat 
(ITT) population. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to model baseline to Week 24 change in RVEDVI as the 
primary outcome and treatment as the primary predictor, controlling for center and baseline value of RVEDVI. 
Secondary analyses will include repeati ng the primary analysis for the following outcomes: change in RV mass from baseline

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 1     Hypothesis 
Primary Hypothesis:  Right ventricular end-diasto lic volume index (RVEDVI), as 
determined by cardiac MRI, will reduce 24 week s following rituximab therapy as compared 
to placebo control, in su bjects with SSc-PAH participa ting in ACE Protocol ASC01. 
 
Secondary Hypotheses:   
 Right ventricular mass, as determined by cardiac MRI, will reduce 24 weeks 
following rituximab therapy as compared to  placebo control, in subjects with SSc-
PAH participating in ACE Protocol ASC01. 
 Stroke volume, as determined by cardiac MRI, will reduce 24 weeks following 
rituximab therapy as compared to place bo control, in subjects with SSc-PAH 
participating in ACE Protocol ASC01. 
 Exploratory Hypotheses: 
 Cardiac output, as determined by cardi ac MRI, will agree with the main study 
assessment of cardiac output as well as th e standardized Fick-based calculation of 
cardiac output 
 Right ventricular end diastolic volume, as  determined by cardiac MRI, will correlate 
with the standardized Fick-based calcul ation of pulmonary artery capacitance 
2     Background and Rationale 
2.1     Background 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating, progressive, and fatal complication 
of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Epidemiologic data  show that patients with SSc-associated PAH 
(SSc-PAH) have a poor prognosis. While hemodyna mic parameters such as right atrial 
pressure and cardiac index are predictors of  survival in WHO group I PAH, they are 
relatively crude and indirect markers of RV performance in PAH [ 162, 163]. Interestingly, 
we have recently demonstrated that in comparison to other diseases with associated PAH, SSc-PAH is characterized by less severe hem odynamic perturbation, but also a more robust 
neurohormonal activation and wors e 1-year survival [164]. Thes e findings suggest that the 
right ventricular response to PAH in systemic sclerosis may differ from that seen in other 
etiologies of PAH and potentially plays an impor tant role in shaping the natural history of 
this form of PAH.   Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of  MRI based protocols for evaluation of right 
ventricular performance in PAH [165, 166]. Pr otocols which evaluate RV structure and 
function supplement the routine hemodyna mic measures obta ined during cardiac 
catheterization and add additional dimensions to the evaluation of disease and response to therapies. On the one hand, the measures fr om MRI are more directly related to the 
pathophysiology of right ventricular injury than are the less direct (but widely employed) measures of right atrial pressure and cardiac index, or the even further removed index of 6-
minute walk distance (6MWD). Thus, these MRI measures, while perhaps less directly clinically applicable than 6MWD, do offer the potential for a more precise delineation of the 
cardiac impact of a given therapy such as rit uximab. These data will be complementary to 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 127 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0 24 April 2017 pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which is  a more pure vascular measure. Additionally, 
the reproducibility of the MRI measures of RV  function is very high, so relatively small 
changes can be detected and t hus MRI offers the hope of det ecting early cardiac remodeling 
changes even if a full clinical im pact is not yet demonstrable.  
2.2     Rationale 
PAH is a cardiopulmonary disease manifest ed by increased PVR due to obliterative 
arteriopathy. The increase in PVR creates incr eased pressure work for the right ventricle. 
Clinical evidence suggests that the capacity of th e right ventricle to resp ond to this increase 
in afterload by remodeling may be a critical determinant of disease progression and overall 
prognosis [167-169]. Although right heart catheterizati on (RHC) is the gold standard for 
diagnosis of PAH, the hemodynamic measures which are obtained during RHC do not appear 
to provide comprehensive evalua tion of RV function no r do they offer accurate prognosis for 
all forms of PAH [170]. For ex ample, patients with PAH resulting from congenital heart 
diseases are typically charac terized by very poor hemodynamics, yet these patients have 
among the best survival of any PAH cohort. On e potential explanation for this is the long-
standing and early onset of a dverse hemodynamics in such patients, which may allow for 
more effective right ve ntricular remodeling. 
 
Specifically relevant to the ASC01 study is the role of RV performance in SSc-PAH. Using a 
large multicenter PAH registry, we have recently demonstrated that SSc-PAH (Chung, Zamanian unpublished data) patients had the most favorable hemodynamics as demonstrated 
by lower mean pulmonary artery pressure , higher cardiac index and lower PVR when 
compared to idiopathic PAH and other autoimmu ne-associated PAH. Despite this apparently 
favorable hemodynamic profile, th e 1 year survival for SSc-PAH was worse when compared 
with the other cohorts. This again supports the idea that it is not hemodynamic profile alone 
that determines prognosis, but rather the cardiac response to these hemodynamics in the form 
of RV remodeling. 
 Cardiac MRI allows for a comprehensive non- invasive evaluation of RV chamber size, 
myocardial mass and systolic function, providing information which is complementary to 
that obtained by cardiac cathete rization. Evaluation of baseline RV status using cardiac MRI 
in SSc-PAH and the response to rituximab will help determine the role which RV remodeling plays in shaping the overall patient outcome in  PAH, and may also demonstrate a mechanism 
by which rituximab affects disease ou tcome, if such effect is found. 
 The RESTORE sub-study will further help delineate the utility of cardiac MRI in studying treatment response in PAH. While there have been  some data evaluating this, there is not yet 
adequate data to specify which markers of RV  remodeling will be most useful in evaluating 
the evolution of patients with PAH. The RESTORE sub-study, by providing MRI data in a well-characterized set of patients, will help  better define this  question as well. 
2.3     Significance  
This sub-study is likely to e nhance the capacity of the ASC01 study in evaluation of response 
of SSc-PAH to rituximab therapy by evaluati ng a set of outcomes which are complementary 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 128 of 135 Confidential

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 to secondary study aims, but which are more fo cused on right ventricular performance. This 
will assist in evaluating the factors contributing to the clinical outcomes observed in the main 
study by providing data which help clarify the cardiac responses during therapy. These data 
will help clarify the contribution to outcome that  arises from the vascular outcome of PVR. 
3     Study Overview 
3.1     Overall Study Design 
The RESTORE sub-study will include all sites pa rticipating in the primary ASC01 study that 
have the capability to perform the required  MRI studies. Enrollment within the RESTORE 
sub-study will consist of consecutive ASC01 st udy subjects at each site, provided that the 
subject provides consent for this separate s ub-study. This should diminish any unintentional 
bias in patient selection at each site. Thus, both placebo and rituximab arms will be included 
in the RESTORE sub-study. Twenty subjects from  each arm will be recruited into this sub-
study. Each subject will be studied at baseline (i.e. prior to in itiation of study drug) and at 
Week 24, or at time of discontinuation. S ubjects in RESTORE will undergo comprehensive 
cardiac MRI evaluation. Given that the primary comparison is a pre/post match, and that the 
MRI interpretation is performed by individuals b linded to the treatment assignment, it is not 
likely to introduce bias if one or more site s cannot participate in the RESTORE sub-study. 
However, should this be the case, the overall  study population will be compared to the sub-
population captured at these sites with resp ect to baseline characteristics. Since the 
RESTORE sub-study will use the same entry criter ia as the parent protocol, there should not 
be a problem with differential pa tient selection, with the excep tion of the additional exclusion 
criteria specified below that relate to the cont ra-indications to MRI. While it does not appear 
likely that these criteria will bias the sub-st udy population, the data analysis will again 
compare the baseline characterist ics of study subjects for the pare nt protocol to that of the 
RESTORE sub-study. 
3.2     Study Population 
3.2.1     Inclusion Criteria  
Each participant included in this sub-study must  be a participant in and meet the inclusion 
criteria for the ASC01 clinical protocol.  In addition, written informed consent for the 
RESTORE sub-study must be provided. 
3.2.2     Exclusion Criteria   
Each participant included in this sub-study must not meet any of the exclusion criteria for the 
ASC01 clinical protocol. In a ddition, subjects who meet any of  the following are disqualified 
from enrollment in the sub-study:  
 Known hypersensitiv ity to Gadolinium 
 Inability to tolerate or cooperate  with MRI (small spaces/claustrophobia) 
 Morbid obesity 
 Presence of metallic objects or pacemaker

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 3.3     Recruitment 
Recruitment for this sub-study will be limited to  subjects who have c onsented and elected to 
participate in the ASC01 clinical protocol. Replacement of subjects in this sub-study will 
occur in the same manner as the parent prot ocol. Randomized subjects  who withdraw from 
the trial prior to starting rituximab infusion will be replaced. Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment or withdraw from the trial after initia ting the first treatment may not be replaced.     
4     Study Design  
4.1     Description of Study Design 
Twenty subjects from each treatment arm, distri buted among all participating sites, will be 
recruited for this sub-study. Each subject will be studied at baseline (i.e . prior to initiation of 
study drug) and after 24 weeks, or at time of  discontinuation. In addition to the data 
collection and testing specified  in the ASC01 protocol, subjects in RESTORE will undergo 
comprehensive cardiac MRI evaluation as descri bed in the RESTORE Manual of Procedures 
(MOP). In brief, this will include short ax is, body axial, four-chamber and three-chamber 
cardiac-gated MRI sequences; pu lmonary and aortic angiography in the proximal main 
pulmonary artery and each of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries; and the ascending 
aorta; measurement of myocardi al perfusion using gadolinium enhanced cardiac MRI in the 
same views specified above, and measurement of delayed gadolinium enhancement in those 
views. 
4.2     Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be change in RVEDVI measured  by cardiac MRI from 
baseline to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. 
 The secondary efficacy endpoints will be as follows: 
 Change in RV mass measured by cardi ac MRI from baseline to 24 weeks after 
treatment initiation. 
 Change in SV measured by cardiac MRI from  baseline to 24 weeks after treatment 
initiation. 
 An exploratory endpoint is also defined: 
 Cardiac output measured by cardiac MRI 
5     Study Objectives 
The primary objective of the RESTORE sub-study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of 
rituximab on the right ventricle (RV) in patie nts with SSc-PAH. To achieve this objective, 
we have developed the following hypotheses:

6     Treatment of Subjects and Study Measurements 
6.1     Subject Clinical Considerations 
Consideration must be given to  the need for rate adjustment of intravenous Flolan® during 
the MRI procedures for those subjects requiring this c oncomitant background SSc-PAH 
therapy. Given the requirement for IV extensi on tubing from the subj ect to infusion pump 
while in the MRI scanner, Flolan® flow rate adjustment (i ncrease) will be required to 
compensate for the longer tubing length  to allow for consistent dosing.  
 
Further guidance on this  issue may be found in the RESTORE MOP. 
6.2     Imaging Process 
Cardiac MR imaging will be performed using any 1.5 T scanner with simultaneous 
ECG recording, according to a protocol for correc tion of phase offset errors. All images will 
be obtained using breath-hold in end-expira tion. Acquisition will be performed including the 
following sequences: 
 Short-axis cine images of the heart fro m apex to base, covering the whole LV 
and RV.  
 Body axial cine images of the heart, extending from the surface of the diaphragm to the superior margin of the pulmonary valve. 
 Long axis cine images of the heart, exte nding from the surface of the diaphragm to 
the superior margin of the pulmonary valve. 
 Angiography (flow imaging) will be obtai ned in the aorta from an imaging plane 
located perpendicular to the long axis of the ascending aort a, with the plane located 
just distal to the sino-tubular ridge, and distal also to the origin of the coronary arteries. 
 Angiography (flow imaging) will be obtained in the main pulmonary artery from an 
imaging plane located perpendicular to the long axis of the main pulmonary artery, 
with the plane located midway between th e pulmonary valve and the bifurcation of 
the pulmonary artery into the branch pulmonary arteries.

Version 8.0 24 April 2017  Angiography (flow imaging) will be obt ained in each of the branch pulmonary 
arteries from an imaging plane perpendicular to the long axis of the applicable artery, 
with the plane located midway between the origin of the artery and the origin of the 
first branch from that artery. 
 Myocardial perfusion imaging during gado linium infusion will be obtained using 
short axis views of the heart, as per the baseline cine imaging. 
 Delayed imaging after injection of gadolinium will be performed using both short 
axis and axial views of the heart. 
 
Full details of the procedures can  be found in the RESTORE MOP. 
6.3     Imaging Analyses 
All cardiac MRI images obtaine d during the RESTORE sub-study will be provided to the 
Stanford laboratory for interpretation as de scribed in additional detail in the following 
section. Images will be shipped on digital media (CD/DVD).  
 All cardiac MRI studies will be analyzed in th e same fashion, using commercial software. 
MRI studies will be analyzed at one time after the conclusion of the study (after last patient 
last visit).  Studies will be analyzed by one interpreter, either one of the sub-study investigators or 
personnel trained directly by these investigators.  A test set of images will be completed in 
duplicate and intra-observer variability will be calculated. If this variability is not acceptable (i.e. coefficient of variation < 15%) [171], the in terpreter will review interpretation criteria 
and then repeat the intra-observer variability using the test set (these images will be obtained using the sub-study protocol, but may not incl ude sub-study subjects).  The interpreter of 
images will not have access to treatment assi gnment nor to the sequence of the studies, but 
the 2 studies for each subject will be reviewed as a pair.  For interpretation of the MRI, diastole and systole will be assigned manually using the 
largest and smallest volume of both the RV and LV (this may result in separate assignment of 
diastole and systole for the 2 ventricles). The diastolic endocardial and epicardial contours of 
both the RV and LV will be traced manually by one of the study interp reters, and will be 
processed using software to obtain RV and LV  mass, and end-diastolic volume. The chamber 
volumes will also be manually traced at end-sy stole, yielding end-systolic volumes. In the 
LV, papillary muscles will be traced separately, and thus incorporated into the mass rather 
than volume calculation. Due to difficulties in obtaining consistent tr acings with this method 
in the RV, the RV tracings will exclude papill ary muscles. LV and RV volumes/mass will be 
determined using short axis images. Ejection fraction will be calculated by determining the 
difference between diastolic and systolic volume for each chamber, and dividing by the diastolic volume of the corre sponding chamber. For measurem ent of flow, the angiography 
(phase contrast) images will be used, with fl ow measured in the ascending aorta and main 
pulmonary artery. For all parameters, the values will be normalized by body surface area (i.e. expressed as indexed values).

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 For each study, a data collection form will be completed and signed by the study interpreter 
at the time of the interpretation. This form will be retained at Stanford, with the information 
entered in an Excel spreadsheet and tr ansferred to the SACCC electronically. 
7     Data Management 
7.1     Tracking Images and Quality Control Procedures  
Clinical sites are responsible for collecting, labeling, tracking,  and shipping the images to 
Stanford University as specified in the RESTORE MOP. The exception is the first cardiac 
MRI study conducted at each site for this sub-study, which will be sent to the SACCC to forward to Stanford without awaiting protocol  completion, to allow a blinded quality control 
review. After an image is collected for a subject,  the clinical site is responsible for entering 
the subject ID and accession numbers into the web-based tracking system (RhoLAB) operated by the SACCC. The RhoLAB tracking sy stem will notify the Stanford laboratory 
that a CD/DVD is being shipped. The information supplied to Stanford by the SACCC will contain accession numbers, but not  subject ID numbers. The only links between subject ID 
numbers and accession numbers will  be at the clinical site and at the SACCC. These links 
will allow cardiac MRI results to be linked to clinical ou tcomes through the SACCC. As 
CDs/DVDs are received at Stanfo rd, the receiving facility must log into the RhoLAB 
tracking system and verify that the CDs/DVDs were received and document the condition of 
the CDs/DVDs at the time of receipt. After anal yses are completed at Stanford, the analysis 
results will be supplied by St anford to the SACCC electronically using accession numbers as 
unique identifiers.   Upon arrival at Stanford the images will also be  logged and stored in a dedicated, locked file. 
The actual CD/DVD will be retained at Stanfo rd in the event that re-interpretation is 
required. In addition, this image may be  required for quality control purposes. 
 
The intra-observer variability will be determin ed at the onset of th e sub-study interpretation. 
This will be accomplished by having the reader interpret a set of 5 studies in duplicate, 
allowing two weeks between the initial and repeat interpretation. For th is purpose, the 2 
interpretations will be sent to  the SACCC for measurement of the coefficient of variation 
between the duplicate readings. If this does not  meet the standard sp ecified in Section 6.3, 
Imaging Analysis , then the individual will re view interpretation criteria and repeat the quality 
control process.  
7.2     Database Management  
All data will be maintained in hard copy form at Stanford and transmitted to the SACCC 
electronically. Upon receipt of su ch data, the SACCC will store it in a central database on the 
SACCC network that provides protection of subject confidentiality and allows the cardiac 
MRI study data to be merged with the clinical data from the ASC01 study.  
7.3     Retention of Documents 
The Stanford database ensures integrity of the data through multiple levels of password 
protection and routine backups of all data. All data and subject material will be password 
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 133 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0 24 April 2017 protected on the local database, which will only be accessible to the Protocol Chair and Co-
Chairs. All data will be subs equently stored on the SACCC network, which will allow the 
RESTORE sub-study data to be merged with  the clinical data from the ASC01 study. 
 
All study-related documents will be maintained in the core facility for 6 years, or longer if 
required by the FDA. 
8     Statistical Considerations and Analytic Plan 
8.1     Subject Selection or Allocation 
The RESTORE sub-study will include all sites pa rticipating in the primary ASC01 study that 
have the capability to perform the required  MRI studies. Enrollment within the RESTORE 
sub-study will consist of consecutive patients at e ach site, provided that the patient provides 
consent for this separate sub-study. With regard to patient treatment assignment, all data will 
be analyzed on the basis of inte ntion-to-treat, in the identical manner as the parent protocol. 
Any patient excluded from analysis  in the parent protoc ol will also be excluded from analysis 
in the RESTORE sub-study. 
8.2     Sample Size 
The sample size for this sub-study is determin ed in large part by the size of the parent 
protocol and budget considerations. With these factors in mind, a sample size of 20 subjects 
in each arm (40 total subjects) is feasible.  
 Data from van Wolferen indicate that in  subjects with pulmona ry hypertension, RVEDVI 
determined by cardiac MRI was 85 +/- 25 ml/m2. Assuming that the stan dard deviation does 
not change during the sub-study, an d that there is a 10% (8.5 ml/m
2) mean reduction in right 
ventricular volume index over the placebo group, one obtains the fo llowing relationship 
between the percent reduction and the expected power:   
Clinical Protocol: ASC01 Page 134 of 135 Confidential 
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Version 8.0 24 April 2017  
 A mean reduction of 10% would power th is sub-study at 27.8%. A recent study of 
resynchronization therapy for le ft ventricular failure demons trated a reduction in left 
ventricular systolic volume index of approximately 15% of the base line value; if this level is 
found, the power would incr ease to 47.6% [172]. 
 
Since the main purpose of the RESTORE sub-st udy is to get a better understanding of how 
rituximab affects RVEDVI for subsequent research studies, this level of power will suffice. 
8.3     Statistical Analys is of Study Objectives 
The primary aim of this sub-study is a compar ison of the change in RVEDVI between the 
rituximab and the placebo arm of the parent tr ial, in subjects who have cardiac MRI at 
baseline and at Week 24, or at time of disc ontinuation. This comparison will be made using 
an ANCOVA model with change in RVEDVI as  the response and treatment, center, and 
baseline value as covariates. It is not anticip ated that non-parametric tests will be required, 
but the data distribution will be evaluated and suitable data transformation will be performed 
as needed. However, based upon experience in ot her studies using similar outcomes, such is 
not likely to be required [165, 166]. A p-value of 0.05 will be taken as the threshold for 
significance. For the secondary outcomes of RV mass and stroke  volume, a similar analysis 
will be performed.

Version 8.0 24 April 2017 Monitoring and reporting of any adverse events associated with MRI procedures for this sub-
study will be the responsibility of the clinical sites and will  be reported to the IND holder 
using the standard mechanisms implemented as described in Section 7, Safety Monitoring and Reporting, of the ASC01 clinical protocol which is incorporated by reference for this sub-study. 
9.1     Risk Analysis 
This is an observational protocol that presents the incremental risk associated with 
performing 2 cardiac MRI studies in the study population. This is  substantially the same as 
the risk of the administration of gadolinium,  as the other MRI risks are minor (although 
claustrophobia is not uncommon, an d may require termination of the protocol). For subjects 
with normal renal function, adverse effect s from gadolinium are reported in 0.48% of 
subjects [173]. Most reactions were minor; th ere was one case of anaphylactic shock in 9528 
doses of gadolinium. In patients with pre-existi ng renal failure, there is a risk of provoking 
renal toxicity. However, this risk is low at th e doses of gadolinium proposed in this protocol 
and is extremely low in the patient populati on specified in the parent protocol, which 
excludes subjects with significan t renal pathology. Of concern regarding use of gadolinium 
are reports of the development of nephrogenic syst emic fibrosis in subjects with severe renal 
failure who receive gadolinium. However, this risk is again low or absent in the subjects targeted by the parent protocol, as the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis emerges only when the creatinine clearance is in the 15-29 mL /min range, or in patients who are dependent 
upon dialysis.

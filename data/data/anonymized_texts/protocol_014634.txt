research, it can be called a clinical trial, research study or research protocol.
If you are still interested in taking part in the WHOOP research study, more detail will be 
provided in the following pages.Key Information 
To start we want to highlight the risks and study requirements that we think you should know 
before deciding if you want to take part in this research study. If you're still interested, we'll then get 
into more detail.
A. Why are you being asked to volunteer in this study?
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a St. Jude Life Study 
participant with a history of mantle radiation for management of Hodgkin lymphoma. 
B.  What is the usual approach to this condition/cancer?
This is not a treatment study so there are no usual approaches. 
C.  Why is this study being done?
This study is being done to determine whether we can measure heart rate and heart rate 
variability using the commercially available WHOOP® wrist monitor compared to in-office 
measurements (AtCor Medical SphygmoCor heart rate variability [HRV] Software).
D. What will happen if you decide to take part in this study?
If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to download the WHOOP app to 
your smartphone and wear the WHOOP wrist monitor for 48 hours. You will bring the 
WHOOP with you to your SJLIFE appointment. While on campus you will have a 10-minute 
electrocardiogram (ECG) recording of your heart while lying down. At the end of this 
appointment you will return the WHOOP wrist monitor to the study team.  
E. What are the research risks and benefits of taking part in this study?
There is a slight risk of an allergic reaction to the sticky tape in the ECG electrodes or wrist 
monitor. 
F.  How many people will take part in this study?
About 40 people will be asked to take part in this study. 
G. What are your options?
a. Taking part in this research study is completely your choice. 
b. If you decide to take part in this study, you can change your mind and stop at any 
time.
c. If you decide not to take part in this study, you may still able to receive care at St. 
Jude.

Consent document date: 12-19-2018                                                                                                                           The principal investigator (researcher) in charge of this study is Dr. Ness, who can be 
reached by phone at 901-595-3300, if you have any questions or concerns about this 
research.
3. What is the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study is to determine whether heart rhythms can be measured using a 
wrist monitor called WHOOP®. These measures will be compared to heart measures taken 
during your study visit using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and AtCor Medical 
SphygmoCor HRV Software. We are also interested in whether the WHOOP® wrist 
monitor is comfortable to wear and whether patients like you are willing to wear the 
monitor for several days. 
4. What will be done in this study?
After signing the consent form and returning the signed consent by e-mail or fax, you will 
be asked to wear a wrist activity monitor and add an appointment to your SJLIFE visit. 
All tests, procedures and activities in this study are done for research purposes only.  If 
you agree to take part in this study, we will conduct the following measurements:
WHOOP® wrist monitor: you will be provided with a wrist monitor and 
instructions for use, including a username, password, and email for the WHOOP 
app; once the account is activated, the wrist monitor will be worn for 48 hours. 
You will need to leave this monitor on during all activities except showering, 
bathing, or swimming. Please wear the wrist monitor at all other times including 
during sleep.
10-minute electrocardiogram recording: you will have sensors placed on your 
torso to measure your heart signal. This will be done while you are lying down (in 
a supine position), with a regular and calm breathing pattern in a quiet room. 
Resting heart rate and HRV parameters, including standard deviation of normal to 
normal R-R intervals (SDNN), will be derived from SphygmoCor HRV Software. 
Follow-up appointment: you will then return the wrist monitor to a member of 
the research team following your electrocardiogram recording. You will be asked 
about your experience wearing the wrist monitor.  
End of study: your participation in the study will end after your second 
appointment when you turn in your wrist monitor and answer the researcher’s 
questions.

Consent document date: 12-19-2018                                                                                                                           9. How much will it cost you?
If you have health care coverage, we will bill your health care insurer for all standard of 
care services, tests, and procedures.  Billing your health care insurer impacts your annual 
deductible and life-time maximum, if any. This may affect your health care coverage to 
some extent if you go to another health care provider or institution in the future. 
At St. Jude, you will not be responsible for or receive bills for co-pays, co-insurance, 
deductibles, or similar patient-liability amounts, or for the cost of medical care not 
covered by your health insurer. This includes research-only costs.   Research-only tests 
and procedures (such as optional biopsy or blood samples for biomarker testing) will not 
be billed to you or your health care insurer. 
10. Will you be paid for your time or expenses?
You will not be paid beyond the compensation for the St Jude LIFE study. 
11. What if there is a problem?
If you have any questions about this study or if you are injured because of this study, 
contact Dr. Kirsten Ness, at 901-595-3300 immediately. If you are injured from being in 
this research study, St. Jude will offer you reasonable and necessary medical treatment 
for that injury. If you need more care than St. Jude can provide or if you prefer to seek 
treatment elsewhere, we will help you find medical care somewhere else. St. Jude may 
bill your insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate. It is not the hospital’s 
policy to provide payment for other types of costs, such as lost wages, disability, or 
discomfort if you are injured from being in this study. You are not giving up any of your 
rights by signing this consent form. 
12. How will new findings related to your participation in this study be shared with 
you?
You will not receive the results of your ECG or wrist monitor procedures. The researcher 
will tell you of any new information learned during your study participation which might 
cause you to change your mind about continuing the study.
13. How will you find out the results of this study?
The researcher will give you information about the overall results of this study. Whether 
you will know your personal test results will be discussed in another part of this 
document. St. Jude researchers share information with people in studies in many ways 
including:
Articles on www.stjude.org

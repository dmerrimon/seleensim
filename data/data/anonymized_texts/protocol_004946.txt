All
outcome
measures
will
be
primarily
compared
between
Mindfulness
Meditation
group
and
Breathwork
groups
combined.
If
statistically
significant
differences
are
detected,
individual
Breathwork
groups
will
be
compared
to
the
Mindfulness
Meditation
group
as
a
secondary
objective.
Outcome measures: State Anxiety, PANAS Positive, PANAS Negative
Changes
in
STAI
state
anxiety
and
PANAS
positive
and
negative
affect
scores
will
be
calculated
by
subtracting
the
pre-condition
score
from
the
post-condition
score
daily
for
each
participant.
Average
daily
change
scores
will
be
calculated
by
averaging
the
daily
changes
in
state
anxiety
and
PANAS
scores
of
each
participant
over
the
number
of
days
they
followed
the
protocol,
then
averaging
this
across
all
subjects
within
a
group.
For
each
group,
average
daily
post-scores
per
person
will
be
compared
to
average
daily
pre-scores
with
a
paired
Wilcoxon
test
or
t-test
(
depending
on
normality
of
the
distribution)
to assess if there was a significant change between pre- and post- conditions.
A
mixed
modeling
approach
will
be
used
to
compare
changes
across
groups
using
protocol
type
as
a
fixed
categorical
effect.
Daily
change
between
pre
and
post
protocol
for
each
subject
will
be
used
as
the
main
unit
for
modeling.
All
variables
will
be
centered
by
subtracting
the
mean
before
feeding
into
the
model. Data analysis will be performed in R and MATLAB.
Outcome measures: Trait Anxiety, Daytime Sleep Related Disturbance
Changes
in
both
trait
anxiety
and
sleep-related
daytime
disturbance
will
be
calculated
by
subtracting
the
pre-score
from
the
post-score
and
comparing
across
groups
with
unpaired
t-test.
Pre-scores
will
also
be
compared to post-scores within each group with a paired t-test.
Outcome
measures:
Resting
Heart
Rate,
Heart
Rate
Variability,
Respiratory
Rate,
WHOOP
Sleep Score, Sleep duration, Sleep Efficiency
Daily
resting
heart
rate
(RHR),
respiratory
rate
(RR),
and
heart
rate
variability
(HRV,
root
mean
square
of
successive
differences
between
normal
heartbeats,
RMSSD),
sleep
duration,
sleep
efficiency
and
sleep
scores
will
be
obtained
from
WHOOP.
Changes
in
these
measurements
will
be
calculated
by
calculating
the
slope
of
the
regression
line
over
the
course
of
the
study.
Differences
in
slope
between
groups
will
be
compared using unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon test.
Secondary Exploratory Outcome Measures: Adherence to Protocol
Number
of
days
subjects
did
their
exercises
out
of
the
28
days
assigned
will
be
counted
based
on
the
number
of
days
they
will
fill
in
their
pre
and
post
exercise
surveys
(STAI
State-Trait
Anxiety
and
PANAS
Positive
Negative
Affect.).
Percentage
of
days
exercises
were
completed
will
be
compared
across
groups
with
unpaired
t-tests.
For
modeling
purposes,
the
number
of
days
exercises
were
completed
up
to
each
day will be used as a measure of adherence in the model.
Other Pre-specified Outcome Measures: Debriefing survey
The
de
novo
survey
is
composed
of
11
items
regarding
participants'
perspectives
on
the
quality
of
the
interventions
and
their
experience
with
the
interventions.
For
four
of
the
items,
participants
rate
their
response
on
a
Likert
scale
and
seven
of
the
items
are
open-ended
measures.
The
Likert
scale
answers
will
be
analyzed
by
calculating
the
percentage
of
responses
at
each
Likert
level
and
comparing
the
percentages
across
groups.
For
open-ended
measures
categories
(e.g.
Grounding,
Focusing,
Some
Challenges)
and
sub-categories
(e.g.
for
Grounding:
Centering,
Leveling,
Stabilizing,
Steadying)
will
be
created
based
on
emerging
themes
from
the
participants’
responses.
Three
raters,
blind
to
the
rating
of
the
other
raters,
will
place
participants'
responses
to
the
emerging
categories.
Percentages
in
each
category
will
be
calculated.
T-tests
will
be
used
to
compare
across
groups
if
sufficient
number
of
responses are received to this optional survey. Otherwise the analysis will be qualitative.

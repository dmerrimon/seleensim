1.0 Introduction  
Lead durability and integrity depend on several factors, such as lead design, lead 
material, and mechanical stress. More than half of all lead complications are 
insulation defects,  most frequently due to subclavian crush syndrome, abrasion of 
the lead by direct contact to the  pulse generator  (i.e. pacemaker, ICD, or CRT -D), 
or abrasion of the lead against adjacent leads. Often these present clinically with 
evidence of imped ance changes or inappropriate ventricular sensing and 
defibrillation1. 
 
St. Jude Medical Riata® and Riat a® ST family of leads are high voltage 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) endocardial leads with Silicone 
insulation.  QuickSite® and QuickFle x® left ventricular leads also utilize silicone 
rubber for insulation. Silicone rubber, while representi ng the industry’s most 
commonly used defibrillation lead insulation material over the past 20 years, has 
been observed to be vulnerable to abrasion2,3,4. Abrasion of silicone defibrillation 
leads is acknowledged within the clinical community as a well know n clinical risk 
and is well documented in the literature as the number one cause of lead failure 
across the industry with reported failure rates ranging  from 3 to 10 %5,6,7.  
 
A more recently reported manifestation of Riata lead insulation and 
QuickSite/Qu ickFlex lead abrasion involves conductors that are outside the lead 
body as detected by x -ray, fluoroscopy, or post -explant physical examination.  
This phenomenon, known as inside -out abrasion with externalized conductors, 
occurs when internal abrasion pro cesses produce an outer insulation breach 
significant enough to allow the conductor to separate from the lead body in 
isolated regions.  Such a separati on does not guarantee an electrical abnormality 
because the conductors themselves are insulated with a r obust layer of 
ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) polymer.  
 
The prevalence of externalized conductors proximal to the RV coil in Riata/Riata 
ST leads has been reported to vary from 0.5%  to 33.3%  depending on the lead 
model8-11. Some of these cases of exter nalized conductors have been accompanied 
with inappropriate shocks, oversensing, increased pacing impedance/ threshold 
and lead noise.  It remains unclear whether externalized conductors caused these 
electrical problems , as approximately 85% of the returne d leads with externalized 
conductors do not have their ETFE insulation compromised and therefore should 
not be the cause of a ny reported electrical problem.  
 
The Durata® family of ICD leads utilize s a silicone polyurethane co -polymer 
insulation known as Op tim which has been associated with a significant reduction 
in abrasion  when compared to Riata and Riata ST silicone insulated leads . 
Although the incidence of these insulation abrasion issues is extremely low in 
Durata leads, the  Durata  leads are being inc luded in this study for comprehensive 
  Study Protocol

60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
analysis ac ross all St. Jude Medical ICD lead types.  This study aims to 
prospectively determine the prevalence and incidence of lead compromise  
evidenced by imaging (includes externalized conductors and other visual le ad 
anomalies , by each subcategory,  as listed in A ppendix A) and electrical 
dysfunction in patients with Riata , Riata ST silicone ICD, QuickSite/QuickFlex 
CRT and Durata ICD leads.  Prevalence as well as i ncidence of externalized 
conductors and other visual lead anomalies  will be separately analyzed and 
reported .  In addition, t his study will provide information to the physicians 
regarding the possibility that an observation of externalized conductors  with 
normal electrical function may progress to an electri cal malfunction.  Th e SJM 
Cardiac Lead Assessment Study  is sponsored by St. Jude Medical (SJM)  and 
constitutes the modification of the  “Riata Lead Evaluation Study”.  
2.0 Purpose  
The objectives of the study are:  
1. To determine the prevalence of externalized c onductors  at enrollment in 
Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads  
2. To determine the prevalence of other visual lead anomalies  by each 
subcategory per Appendix A  at enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, 
QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads  
3. To determine the pr evalence of electrical dysfunction§ at enrollment in 
Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads  
4. To determine the incidence of externalized conductors  after enrollment in 
Riata®, Riata® ST Sil icone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads  
5. To determine the incidence of other visual lead anomalies  by each 
subcategory per Appendix A  after enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, 
QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads  
6. To determine the incidence  of electrical dysfunction§ after enrollment in 
Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and  Durata® leads . 
7. To evaluate the 30-day adverse event rate associated with lead revision 
procedures  (include lead extractions or abandonments with or witho ut lead 
replacement)  in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and  
Durata® families of leads  
8. To determine the prevalence of “other insulation anomalies” in “returned 
leads ” for Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and  Durata® 
families of leads . “Other insulation anomalies ” include  any of the following : 
o Internal abrasion short under RV shock coil  
o Internal abrasion short under SVC shock coil  
o Exposed conductors defined as a breach  of the outer insulation  
o Breach of the internal s ilicone lumen tubing,  but the conductor cable 
is contained within the lead  body  diameter .  
 
§”Electrical dysfunction ” is determined to be present after adjudication of the 
following cases of potential electrical failures that led to the lead being either 
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 3 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
surgically capped/extracted or electrically abandoned. Potential electrical failures 
include the following:  
▪ Presence of non -physiologic noise not due to external interference  
▪ Rise in pace/sense (p/s) conductor impedance to > 2000 Ω or increase of 
more than 200 Ω over previous 6 months  or increase of 400 Ω over any 
period of time  
▪ Decrease of more than 200 Ω over previous 6 months or to impedance < 
200 Ω from baseline impedance > 300 Ω  or decrease  of 400 Ω over any 
period of time  
▪ Change in any high voltage coil i mpedance of > 25 Ω or to > 125 Ω or < 
20 Ω  
▪ Capture threshold > 5 V or an increase of > 2 V from baseline (all 
measurements) of < 1 V  
NOTE: In all cases, external sources of “noise” and other header -connector 
causes would be excluded. Functional abnormaliti es, including exit block and 
physiologic ove rsensing in the presence of an electrically intact lead are not 
electrical failures.   
3.0 Clinical Protocol  
3.1 Study Design and Scope  
This study is a prospective, non -randomized, multi -center , international  post mar ket 
study that will determine the prevalence  and incidence of externalized conductors  and 
other visual lead anomalies (as evidenced by imaging) and the risk of progression to 
electrical dysfunction in a large series of ICD/ CRT -D/CRT -P devices containing o ne or 
more of the following SJM leads: Riata  leads, Riata ST silicone leads, Durata leads, 
QuickSite/QuickFlex CRT  leads. A patient that has at least one market released lead 
implanted in time period indicated in Table 1 is eligible for enrollment in the s tudy. Each 
lead group will be considered sep arately for independent analysis.

60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
 
In order to determine the prevalenc e and incidence of externalized 
conductors, other visual lead anomalies  as well as electrical dysfunction in 
the population of leads being evaluated, a minimum of 1500 leads listed 
above will be enrolled at up to 60 sites. This will comprise a minimum of 
300 leads in the Riata lead group and a minimum of 200 leads in the Riat a 
ST lead group  to make a combined total of at least 500 Riata and Riata ST 
silicone leads . The study will also include at least 500 leads in  the 
QuickSite/QuickFlex and Durata  lead gro ups. All patients will be followed 
every six months for three years.  
 
Adequate representation across the different ages of the leads is also 
needed to understand the lead population being studied.  Therefore, the 
leads from each group of leads will be comp romised of subgroups based 
on the age of  lead (at enrollment)  being stu died. The required minimum 
enrollment for each subgroup per lead group is indicated in Table 2. Even 
if the minimum enrollments indicated in Table 2 are met, extra 
enrollments may be re quired to ensure a minimum of 500 leads in each 
lead group.  
 
Expected A ttrition in patients with high voltage leads  
Withdrawals due to death  
 
Assuming an annual mortality of 7% in the ICD patient population, the 
mortality at 3 years is 20% [1 – (1-0.07)^3 ]  In the recent RHYTHM 
ICD/QuickSite 1056K left heart lead study, the annual mortality was 
12.8%, which would result in  a mortality  of 33.7 % [1 – (1-0.128)^3] at 3 
years.   If the ICD:CRT -D device mix is 60%:40% then the expected 
overall mortality in this  study  at 3 years is 25.5% (=0.6×0.20+0.4×0.337).  
  
Withdrawals due to reasons other than death  
 
In an ongoing St. Jude Medical post -approval study  (SJ4 PAS), the 
attrition rate due to reasons other than death at 22 months of follow -up is 
9%.  Thus, it is  anticipated that the attrition rate at 3 years for reasons 
other than death will be 15%.    
   
Assuming that deaths and withdrawals are independent events, the total 
attrition is expected to be approximately 37% (= 1 -(1-0.255)×(1 -0.15)) 
over 3 years.  
  
Since the Riata/Riata ST leads are recalled, it is more likely that some  
physicians will explant them, even when electrical function is normal . For 
this reason, an additional 10% of the patients are expected to be 
prematurely withdrawn. This leads to a tota l attrition of approximately 
43% (= 1-(1-0.255)×(1 -0.15)×(1 -0.10)) over 3 years.

Expected Attrition in patients with left ventricular leads  
Withdrawals due to deaths  
 
In the RHYTHM ICD/QuickSite 1056K left heart lead study, the annual 
mortality was 12.8% , providing an estimated  mortality  rate of 33.7 % [1 – 
(1-0.128)^3] at 3 years.  
  
Withdrawals for reasons other than death  
 
In the ongoing St. Jude Medical post -approv al study , the attrition rate due 
to reasons other than death at 22 months of follow -up is 9%.  Thus, it is 
anticipated that the attrition rate at 3 years for reasons other than death will 
be 15%.   
 
Assuming that deaths and withdrawals are independent even ts, the total 
attrition is expected to be approximately 43.6% (= 1 -(1-0.337)×(1 -0.15)) 
over 3 years.

*Expected attrition in each of the lead groups is based on the rationale

At enrollment, medical history, demographic data and lead measurement 
data will be collected. Additionally, cinefluoroscopy (AP, LAO 45° or the 
best possible LAO view, RAO 45° or the best possible RAO view) will be 
performed to determine the prevalence of lead compromise . A copy of 
  Study Protocol

cinefluoroscopy performed as part of separat e screening can be used to 
determine the prevalence of lead compromise  as long as all three views 
(AP, LAO 45° or the best possible LAO view, RAO 45° or the best 
possible RAO view) are available.  In patients with evidence of 
externalized conductors  or oth er visual lead anomalies (fracture, 
subclavian crush, kink, broken filars on a shocking coil and other 
irregularities)  the following chest x -rays or other available imaging studies 
will be collected  (if available ): a) earliest imaging study  showing evidenc e 
of externalized conductors  or other visual lead anomaly  and b) latest 
imaging study  that does not show any evidence of externalized conductors  
or other visual lead anomaly  
 
Data will be collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months post enrollment 
and du ring any unscheduled follow -up visits due to patient symptoms  
suggestive of or with evidence of  lead electrical problems. Additionally, 
cinefluoroscopy (AP, LAO 45° or the best pos sible LAO view, RAO 45° 
or the best possible RAO view) will be performed in all patients to 
determine the incidence and mechanical progression of externalized 
conductors  at the 12, 24, and 36  month visits.  
 
During any follow -up visits, device data and stor ed electrograms will be 
collected. All clinical events such as hospitalizati ons, emergency room 
visits, and adverse events will also be collected. All study data, including 
device data and stored electrograms will be sent to SJM electronically. If 
any lead  being followed in this study develops a significant electrical 
abnormality suggestive of lead malfunction and x -ray or cinefluoroscopy 
would be performed as per the site standard of care then copies of x -ray or 
cinefluoroscopy should be submitted to SJM.  
 
During the course of the study, any explanted leads should be returned to R eturned 
Goods, St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, for analysis.

conductors  at the 12 , 24, and 36  month visits for all patients  and at 
the 48  month visit for only those eligible QuickSite/QuickFlex 
patients that consent for extended follow -up. 
 
If the Riata, Riata ST, QuickSite  (1056T/1058T), QuickFlex  
(1156T/115 8T), or Durata lead develops a significant electrical 
abnormality suggestive of lea d malfunction and x -ray or 
cinefluoroscopy would be performed as per the site’s standard of 
care.  The x -ray or cinefluoroscopy should be submitted to SJM.  
 
All patients wil l be required to attend the in -clinic follow -up visits 
at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36  months.  Only those eligible 
QuickSite/QuickFlex patients that consent for extended follow -up 
will be required to attend the 42 month in -clinic follow -up visit.  
Data to be  captured includes the following:  
 
• RV lead capture threshold, lead pacing impedance  and signal 
amplitude (only required if RV lead model and implant date is 
listed in Table 1) *  
• LV lead capture threshold, lead pacing impedance in a bipolar 
configuration (o nly required if LV lead model and implant date 
is listed in Table 1)  
• High Voltage L ead impedance (HVLI) testing – mandatory for 
Current/ Promote or later ICD and CRT -D, optional for devices 
before Current/Promote ICD and CRT -D, and not applicable to 
CRT -P 
 
* Note:  If patient is pacer dependent or R -wave is not available 
then RV signal am plitude is not required.  
 
Upon completion of the follow -up above visits, complete the 
applicable CRFs using the EDC system and submit the supportive 
data listed below to St.  Jude Medical.  
• Follow -up CRF  
• Product Out of service ( if applicable)  
• Electronic dev ice session records  
• Cinefluoroscopy (AP, LAO 45º or best possible LAO view,  
RAO 45º or best possible RAO view)  
  Study Protocol

60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
• System Revision (if applicable)  
 
If an adverse event, hospita lization, death, or deviation occurs during 
the course of study testing and data collection, as applicable, also fill 
out and submit the following:  
 
• Adverse Event CRF  
• Hospitalization CRF  
• Deviation CRF  
• Death CRF  
• Withdrawal CRF  
• Supporting documentation of ad verse events, deviation(s) from 
the protocol, and/or death  
 
3.4.3  System Revision  
All pulse generator and lead related system revisions should be 
reported. If a patient’s existing Riata, Riata ST, QuickSite 
(1056T/1058T), QuickFlex (1156T/1158T), or Durat a lead is 
extracted  or capped , and no other of the above mentioned  leads are 
still implanted then the patient will be followed for 30 days and 
withdrawn from the study.   It is recommended to provide 
fluoroscopy data, RV (if applicable) and LV (if applicabl e) capture 
threshold, pacing impedance and signal amplitude measur ements, 
and session records at system revision.  
 
Upon completion of system revision, complete the following case 
report forms using the EDC system and submit the supportive data 
listed below : 
 
• System Revision  
• Product Out of service (if applicable)  
• Device s ession records  
• Fluoroscopy/ CXR images (if applicable)  
• Adverse Event CRF  
• Withdrawal CRF  (if applicable)  
• Supporting documentation of adverse events, deviation(s) from 
the protocol, and/or dea th 
 
3.4.4  Unscheduled Follow -up 
Unscheduled follow -up visit data w ill be captured if patients 
present in the clinic with any symptoms suggestive of or with 
evidence of lead related electrical problems for non protocol 
specified visits. It is recommended to  do all the applicable RV and 
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 24 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
LV (if applicable) lead measurements  at that time. A follow -up 
CRF must be submitted for these unscheduled visits.  
 
3.4.5 Extended Follow -up (Eligible QuickSite/QuickFlex 
patients only)  
The purpose of e xtending follow -up for e ligible  
patients with QuickSite/QuickFlex leads  is to address challenges  
with fulfill ing the minimum number of leads to enroll for th e  
QuickSite/QuickFlex lead group/subgroups as shown in Table 2.   
 
The extended follow -up will help address th is issue  since the data  
from patients with extended follo w-up will contribute to 2 separate  
sub-group cohorts  for the primary and secondary outcome measure  
analyses . 
 
For example, a patient who was enrolled with  a  
QuickSite/QuickFlex lead that was implanted for 5 years at the  
time of enrollment will contribute to the ≥ 5 to <6 year  age of lead  
subgroup cohort (data from lead 5, 6, 7, and 8 years implanted ).    
After this patient provides consent and completes the additional  
year of follow -up, this patient will  also contribute  to the ≥ 6 year  
age of lead subgroup cohort (data from lead 6, 7, 8, and 9 years  
implanted) as shown in Table 5 below.

Patients eligible for extended follow -up are those already enrolled 
with QuickSite/QuickFlex leads that have not previously 
withdrawn and  have a  QuickSite/QuickFlex lead that will 
contribute to a second sub group cohort with an additional year of 
follow -up.   
 
In order to maintain an unbiased study design, all eligible patients 
will be approached to provide consent  for extended follow -up.  
SJM will  provide study sites with a list of all eligible patients  upon  
approval of this protocol.   After  eligible patients have been 
approached to  consent  for extended follow -up, complete the 
Extended Follow -Up Consent CRF using the EDC system.  

  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 25 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
 
Eligible patients must provide consent for extended follow -up prior 
to completin g the 42 and 48 month follow -up visits (See Section 
14.0).  Refer to Table 3 and Section 3.4.2 for the requirements for 
these additional follow -up visits.  
 
4.0 Protocol Deviations  
Investigators are required to adhere to the investigational plan, signed 
Investi gator’s Agreement, applicable federal (national) or state/local, laws and 
regulations, and any conditions required by the IRB/MEC or applicable regulatory 
authorities.  
 
A proto col deviation is used to describe situations in which the study protocol was 
not followed.  All deviations from the study protocol  must be reported to St. Jude 
Medical as soon as possible but no later than 10 working days of notification of 
event.  In addi tion, all deviations must be reported to the reviewing IRB per the 
IRB’s reporti ng requirements.   
5.0 Hospitalization  
Hospitalization for any reason other than a system revision must be reported to St. 
Jude Medical via the Hospitalization Case Report Form usi ng the EDC system 
within 10 working days of the center becoming aware of the pat ient’s admission 
to the hospital.   
6.0 Adverse Events  
Adverse events are any unfavorable clinical event which impacts, or has the 
potential to impact the health or safety of a pati ent caused by or associated with a 
study device or intervention. Adverse events will be classified as complication or 
observations.  
 
Complications:  Adverse events that require invasive intervention (e.g. lead 
dislodgment requiring repositioning).  
 
Observa tions:  Adverse events that can be managed without invasive intervention 
(e.g., o versensing or loss of pacing capture, which is remedied by reprogramming 
of the pulse generator).  
 
HV and CRT lead related adverse events along with other adverse events like 
cardiac tamponade, hematoma, high DFTs, infection and therapy for non -
ventricula r rhythm will be collected in the study  
 
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 26 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
If the patients with no evidence of externalized conductors  by imaging at 
enrollment show evidence of externalization later in the study, please submit an 
adverse event form for lead insulation damage (i.e. external ized conductors).  
 
Should an adverse event occur, an Adverse Event Form must be completed and 
submi tted to St. Jude Medical. Report the adverse event to the IRB/MEC per the 
IRB/MEC policy. Any explanted devices or leads should be returned to St. Jude 
Medi cal for analysis.  
7.0 Other Reported Events  
Other Reported Events is any other clinical event that is s ubmitted by the 
investigator which is not caused by or associated with the study device and/or 
system component(s) and/or defined as an Adverse Event in sec tion 6.0.  
8.0 Deaths  
All patient deaths that occur during this study must be reported to St. Jude 
Medic al within 10 working days of the center being notified. Notification of death 
should include a detailed statement of the pertinent events and be signed by t he 
investigator in addition to the appropriate case report forms (Patient Death  form, 
Withdrawal  form, and Product Out of Service form ). It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to notify the IRB/MEC per the IRB/MEC policy. The CEC  will 
review and classify all patient deaths.  Details of death and the following 
information, if available, should be provided  in a letter to St. Jude Medical by the 
investigator summarizing the patient’s course since enrollment in the study:  
 
• Date of death  
• Place death occurred (e. g. hospital, nursing home, patients home)  
• If death was witnessed  
• Identification of the rhythm at the time of death, if known  
• Cause of death  
• Any other circ umstances surrounding the death  
• Approximate time interval to death from the initiating event  
• Autopsy report (if performed)  
• Whether it was device and/or procedure rela ted 
• Whether it was related to the study  
• Device configuration at the time of death  
 
Provide clinical notes and witness statements. If possible, interrogate the pulse 
generator. Retrieve and pr int all episode diagnostics, IEGMs, and programmed 
parameters. If  applicable, the pulse generator should then be programmed OFF.   
 
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 27 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
Every attempt should be made to explant the pulse generator and/or leads intact. 
Any explanted devices or leads should be ret urned to St. Jude Medical for 
analysis promptly. In the event tha t the device is not explanted, the above 
procedure must be followed to retrieve the data. The reason the pulse generator 
and/or lead(s) are not being returned to St. Jude Medical must be stat ed clearly on 
the case report form.  
9.0 Withdrawals  
Withdrawal is def ined as termination of participation of a patient from a clinical 
trial. All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subject in the clinical trial 
until completion of the clinical tri al. Reasons for withdrawal include, but are not 
limited to the fo llowing:  
 
• Patient Lost to Follow -up - must be documented by two documented phone 
calls and one certified letter  
• Death  
• Patient had an explanted  or abandoned  Riata/ Riata ST RV lead and no othe r 
lead under investigation is currently implanted  
• Patient had an explanted  or abandoned  Durata RV lead and no other lead 
under investigation is currently implanted  
• Patient had an explanted  or abandoned  QuickSite/QuickFl ex 1056T, 1058T, 
1156T, or 1158T lea d and no other lead under investigation is currently 
implanted  
• Patient/Family request  
• Participation terminated by Physician  
 
Patient Relocation : If a patient moves from the geographic area of the 
investigator, then SJM w ill first attempt to place the patie nt with another St. Jude 
Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment  Study investigator.  If it is not possible to place 
the patient with another St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment study 
investigator, SJM will request that the  patient’s new physician forward the  
patient’s study information to the investigator.   
 
Complete and submit a copy of the Withdrawal form to St. Jude Medical  using 
the EDC system . Contact and address information is available on the Withdrawal 
form. If the re is a potential withdrawal in the study, please contact a member 
of the study team to see if there is anything that can be done to keep the 
patient in the study.  
 
10.0 Risks and Benefits  
The risks involved with this study are similar to those associated with other 
commercially available ICD or CRT -D systems.   
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 28 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
 
In addition, patients in this study will receive a minimum of 4 fluoroscopic 
procedures where each procedure is taken in 3 different views.  Although these 
fluoroscopic procedures are short in duration (approximately 45 seconds) they do 
provide a minimum dose of radiation to the patient which may increase their risk 
of cancer.  
 
Patients who enroll in this study may encounter an additional benefit if the 
incidence of externalized conductors  is identified.  All patients may also be more 
close ly monitored by their physician.  
11.0 Committees  
11.1 Clinical Events Committee  
The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be comprise d of at least three 
Electrophysiologists or Cardiologists. The  CEC will review and adjudicate 
all Adverse Events and Deaths .  The  CEC will base their final  adjudication 
on the information provided on the case report forms, medical records, and 
their clinica l knowledge and experience.  
11.2 Cinefluoroscopy Adjudication Committee  
Cinefluoroscopy Adjudication Committee (CAC) will be comprise d of at 
least three Electrophysiologists or Cardiologists specially trained in using 
Cinefluoroscopy in this patient popula tion. The role of the CAC is to 
adjudicate the cinefluoroscopy videos/images to determine the presence of 
lead compromise in the  SJM Cardiac Lead Assessment study patient 
population. Committee members will be reviewing the cinefluoroscopy 
videos/images for  the enrollment, 12, 24, and 36 month follow -up visits 
and any additional cinefluoroscopy videos/images received during the 
course of the study. Data will be sent either electronically or on a disk to 
the committee members. Once the adjudication is complet e, a 
cinefluoroscopy adjudication form will be collected per patient per study 
visit. If the presence of externalized conductors  is deemed to be 
‘indeterminate’ then the cinefluoroscopy will be further reviewed by two 
other CAC members. Sample pictures/flu oros/x -rays and other examples 
of “other visual lead anomalies” will be provided to the adjudication 
committee to aid the commit tee members  in identifying these “other visual 
lead anomalies ” on the cinefluoroscopy videos/images received from the 
site. 
 
Only the adjudicated imaging data will be included in the post market 
surveillance reports. Percentage of leads with compromise, ev idenced by 
imaging, will be presented in the report. The type, extent and location of 
  Study Protocol  
St. Jude Medical Cardiac Lead Assessment   Page 29 September 18, 2015  
60039775/K -Clinical  Confidential  
lead compromise, as described in Append ix A, will also be included. As 
detailed in Appendix A, each region of the HV as well as CRT leads is 
divided into different region s. Both the proximal as well as distal ends of 
externalization will be recorded by the cinefluoroscopy adjudication 
committee . The distribution of externalization ( both absolute number and 
percentage ) by each region of the lead will be presented for both p roximal 
and distal ends of externalization . The distribution of “other visual lead 
anomalies” (both absolute number and perce ntage) by each region of the 
lead and each individual subcategory of “other visual lead anomalies” will 
be presented.  The frequenc y (both absolute number as well as percentage) 
of individual subcategories will be reported  for “other visual lead 
anomalies” .  
 
11.3 Electrical Data Adjudication Committee  
Electrical Data Adjudication Committee (EDAC) will be comprise d of at 
least three E lectrophysiologists or Cardiologists experienced  in analyzing  
and interpreting  device data. The role of the EDAC is to adjudi cate the 
device session records to determine the presence of electrical dysfunction 
in the SJM Cardiac Lead Assessment study patien t population. Committee 
members will be reviewing device session records for all leads taken out 
of service during the course  of the study.  Data will be sent either 
electronically or in a paper binder to the committee members. Once the 
adjudication is comp lete, an electrical data adjudication form will be 
collected per patient.  
 
Only the adjudicated cases of electrical dysfunct ion will be included in the 
post market surveillance reports. Percentage of leads with electrical 
dysfunction (based on the definit ion in section 2.0) will be part of the 
reports.  
12.0 Investigator Information  
This clinical investigation will be conducted by investigators with experience 
and/or willingness to be trained in the use of the device therapy for the treatment 
of these patients.   A principal investigator should have experience in and/or will 
be respons ible for:  
 
• Conducting the clinical investigation in accordance with the signed agreement 
with St. Jude Medical, the investigational plan, all applicable, GCP guidelines, 
and any con ditions of approval imposed by the IRB/MEC  
• Providing signed Investigator/Co -Investigator(s) Agreement

• Collection and archiving of data obtained pursuant to the requirements of the 
investigational plan during th e course of the study and after the study has been 
completed  
• Screening and selecting appropriate patients  
 
It is acceptable for the principal investigator to delegate one or more of the above 
functions to an associate or co -investigator, however, the princ ipal investigator 
remains responsible for the proper conduct of the clinica l investigation, 
complying with the investigational plan and collecting all required data.  
13.0 Monitoring Procedures  
St. Jude Medical will serve as the “sponsor” of the Cardiac Lead Ass essment 
Trial.  It is the responsibility of St. Jude Medical as the “sponso r” of the study to 
ensure proper monitoring of the investigation and to see that all the clinical 
requirements are met.  
 
A St. Jude Medical monitor may visit the investigator or des ignee periodically 
during the study to monitor progress, assist in gathering the required data, verify 
study endpoints, clarify data discrepancies and answer any questions. During 
these visits, the clinical monitor will review the patient’s records to veri fy that all 
records and files are up to date, and to assure complia nce with all requirements of 
the protocol,local IRB procedures and applicable FDA regulations. A monitoring 
report following the on -site visit will be provided to the site to document 
monit oring findings.  
 
The investigator will make patient and study recor ds available to the clinical 
monitor for periodic inspection. Clinical monitoring will be conducted as defined 
in the St. Jude Medical Monitoring Plan for this study.  
 
Responsibility for o verall study management will be held by the Director of

Introduction  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because your doctor has 
determined that you may qu alify to take part in the St. Jude Medical (SJM) Cardiac Lead 
Assessment Study . The SJM Cardiac Lead Assessment Study is sponsored by SJM and 
constitu tes the modification of the “Riata Lead Evaluation Study”.   This form explains 
why this research is being done and what your role will be if you decide to participate.  
This form also talks about the possible risks that may happen if you take part in this 
study.  This study is sponsored by St. Jude Medical.  
 
Please read this form, and ask your study doctor any  questions about the study so that you 
can have your questions answered before you decide if you want to take part in the study.  
Please take your tim e and talk about this information with your family, friend, or family

This consent form may conta in some words that you do not understand.  Please ask the 
study doctor or the study staff to explain any words or information that you do not 
understa nd. 
 
If you agree to be in the study, you will need to sign this form.  Taking part in this study 
is entir ely voluntary.  You may decide not to participate without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
 
What is the purpose of the study?  
The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of wires being visible outside the 
lead insulation body (externalized conductors) or other forms of visual compromise in the 
Riata®, Riata® ST silicone ICD, QuickSi te®/QuickFlex® CRT and Durata® ICD leads .  In 
order to evaluate the prevalence of externalized conductors or other forms of visual 
compromise in the Riata , Riata ST silicone ICD, QuickSite/QuickFlex CRT and Durata 
ICD leads , cinefluoroscopy (i.e. video or x-ray) will be taken to determine the prevalence 
of externalized conductors or other forms of visual compromise of the lead.  This s tudy 
does not  involve any investigational product (medical device) or procedures.  
 
Approximately 1500 patients (500 with Ria ta or Riata ST  leads, 500 with 
QuickSite/QuickFlex leads and 500 with Durata leads) will be enrolled in this non -
randomized, multi -center, international post market study at up to 60 sites.

In order to determine the risk that externalized conductors will result in an electrical 
malfunction, all patients will be followed every 6 months for a three -year period (36 
months) in the study.  
 
What will happen if you take part in the research study?  
If you decide to take part in this study, some tests will be don e to help your doctor 
determine if you qualify. You must have a market released SJM ICD or CRT -D already 
implanted and also have a m arket released Riata  ICD,  Riata ST silicone ICD, 
QuickSite/QuickFlex CRT or Durata ICD lead .  Once all of the tests have been 
completed, your doctor will decide if you qualify to take part in the SJM Cardiac Lead 
Assessment Study .  If you do not qualify fo r the study, your partici pation will end.  
 
If your doctor determines that you qualify, and you decide to take part in this study, the 
following procedure(s) will be performed.  You will be screened for evidence of 
externalized conductors forms of vi sual co mpromise of the lead thro ugh cinefluoroscopy 
(i.e. X -ray, video, etc.), demographics (gender, age, medical history, history of electrical 
malfunctions in the past, etc.) and lead electrical performance will also be evaluated.  
 
There may be a representative  of the sponsor at your s tudy visits and the representative 
may carry out some of the study procedures.  The study doctor may direct a representative 
from the sponsor to collect the signal information .  At the study doctor’s direction, the 
sponsor represent ative may also program yo ur device or run tests to see if your device is 
working as expected.  The sponsor’s representative will work under the direction of your 
study doctor or other care provider.  
How long will study last?  
You will be followed for a peri od of three years. Data w ill be collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 
30 and 36 months post enrollment.  
 
You will be screened for evidence of externalized conductors or other forms of vi sual 
compromise of the lead through cinefluoroscopy (i.e. X -ray, video, etc.) every 12 months  
including  the final study visit at 36 months.  
What are possible discomforts or risks?  
There may be risks associated with (a small amount of radiation) exposure to 
cinefluoroscopy which may increase your risk of cancer. The estimated fluoro scopy time 
required is ap proximately 45 seconds per visit.

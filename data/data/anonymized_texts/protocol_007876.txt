2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Agent s 
Docetaxel and cetuximab are FDA approved for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN).  Cisplatin and carboplatin, while not FDA approved for SCCHN, have been for 
several decades used as a standard of care in patie nts with SCCHN in combination with taxanes and 
more recently in combination with cetuximab. 2 Please refer to their respective package interes ts for 
details concerning pharmacology and expected adverse events.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
Rationale/Hypothesis:  
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) region is one of the more chemotherapy 
sensitive human neoplasms. Response rates approaching 70% have been reported with single agent 
treatment, and recent reports demonstrate that overall response rates and complete response rates 
approaching 90% and 60%, respectively  are achievable. 3-5  Despite the advances made in the treatment 
of patients with SCCHN c onfined to the primary and neck region, many of these patients still relapse 
and are not candidates for salvage surgery or radiation treatment. Most of these patients die as a result of 
complications of their cancer. 6-9 Additionally, up to  one third of  patients present with metastatic disease 
and are therefore not eligible for multimodality potentially curative treatment. Because pat ients with 
recurrent or metastatic disease are generally incurable, the goals of treatment are more limited, and 
include prolongation of overall survival (OS) or progression -free survival (PFS), palliation of existing 
symptoms, and prevention of new cancer -related symptoms. Improvement in survival has been the holy 
grail of treatment in this setting.  Platinum - based chemotherapy has been the standard treatment in this 
setting, based in the fact that platinum based combinations have demonstrated the highest  response rates. 
10 If overall survival is the benchmark standard, there have been only tw o trials to date demonstrating 
superiority of one regimen versus others.  Morton et al. compared cisplatin and bleomycin in a 2x2 
design, and only the cisplatin arm s in aggregate demonstrated a statistically significant survival 
advantage of 4.3 versus 1.8  months to the CDDP containing arms. 11 
 
More recently, Vermorken and colleagues demonstrated in a landmark study that the addition of 
cetuximab to a platinum and 5 -FU (PF) backbone was as sociated with an approximately 3  month 
improvement in median survival. 2  Unfortunately, because the design of the trial was such that patients 
in the cetuximab arm received the agent not only with PF but as a maintenance in non -progressors,  it is 
theoretically possible that the survival benefit may be obtained by sequential rather than concurrent 
dosing. The higher response rate in the cetuximab arm would argue that the concurrent treatment was at 
least a contributor to the OS advantage ; however, it is also worth noting that this trial, dubbed 
“EXTREME”, was notable for significant clinically relevant toxicity in both arms. Over 30% of the 
patient s experienced grade 4 AEs.  It is also noteworthy that there were no grade 3 or higher diarrhea or 
mucositis toxicities reported in this trial, when in ECOG 1395, a 31% high grade stomatiitis rate was 
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 8 of 31 reported for an identical PF regimen, leading one to won der why so few AEs were reported on the 
EXTREME study. 12 Additionally, the standard of practice in Belgium is to hospitalize all patients for 
the administration of PF, whereas in the US, patients are typically treated in outpatient infusion centers. 
(Jan Ve rmorken, personal communication ASCO annual meeting 2009)  
 
To further put the EXTREME trial into context, note that Burtness and ECOG colleagues studied 
cisplatin +/ - cetuximab in SCCHN patients in a smaller RCT. 13  Because the trial was much smaller 
than the Vermorken study, they were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant survival 
advantage to t he addition of cetuximab, but   the survival  hazard rates in the Burtness and Vermorken 
trials were similar, suggesting that the benefit from the cetuximab was not largely due to a combination 
effect with 5 -FU.  Vermorken and colleagues have also  performed  a global phase 3 trial of PF +/ - 
panitumumab in patients wi th recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with a similar design to the EXTREME 
trial which will answer whether this anti- EGFR MOAB from another IGG class will also improve 
survival .14 In this trial, AEs, including stomatitis and mucosal inflammation were substantial as well. 
Initial re ports of this trial, not yet available in the peer reviewed literature, claim that the survival benefit 
associated with the EXTREME trial using cetuximab were not reproduced using panitumumab.  
 
PF’s use as the backbone regimen used for the addition of new agents in the palliative setting is largely 
driven by the large amount of data of PF in the induction setting, combined with the fact that in some 
European countries, taxanes remain unapproved for use on patients with head and neck cancer, 
precluding its u se as part of an acceptable backbone regimen in the EORTC trials (Vermorken, personal 
communication ASCO 2009) . 
 
Therefore, the use of PF as the backbone for the addition of cetuximab  is largely due to historical and 
drug availability issues rather than wh at has been defined as the best therapeutic combination.  Another 
combination shown to be of equal efficacy as PF in this setting is the combination of paclitaxel and 
cisplatin (PC). A RCT comparing PF versus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 days 
demonstrated no significant difference in RR or OS, but the high grade AEs in the PF arm were more 
common than in the PC arm. 12 Granulocytopenia rates were similar but anemia. Infection, vomiting, 
diarrhea, stomatitis, metabolic disturbances and fati gue were more prominent in the PF arm.  Therefore, 
if access to paclitaxel is not at issue, PC could be considered, based upon therapeutic index, a  superior 
doublet to use in  this setting. Similar regimens of docetaxel and cisplatin ( TC) have also been s tudied in 
this setting, yielding high response rates and similar duration of response as PC. 15 16 17 
 
A major difficulty with the PC and TC regimens administered on a q 21 day schedule is the 
unpredictability of the hematological AE profile.  In many other oncological diseases, the use of  weekly 
treatment regimens has been used to circumvent this problem without the loss of efficacy, and there are 
data specific to SCCHN which suggest that weekly taxane and cisplatin combinations are very well 
tolerated and are associated with similar respo nse rates and OS as the q 21d regimens. 18  In the initial 
treatment  setting, platinum plus taxane plus cetuximab regiments have been shown to be highly active, 
feasible and well tolerated in SCCHN patients but when the platinum and taxanes are given on the q 21 
day schedule, toxic ity is substantial. 19,20,21 While docetaxel, c isplati n, and cetuximab have been given in 
the recurrent or metastatic setting, on a q 21 day schedule toxicity has been substantial but response rates 
as high as 49% in this setting are very high relative to other combinations whose response rates are 
usually in  the 30 -40% range in this setting.  22 
 
2.4 Study Design

4. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Patients will be treated weekly with cisplatin, docetaxel, and cetuximab according to the specifics designed 
below.  If a dose is held during weeks 1 -3, the dose may be given during the 4th week. The next cycle should 
then begin with Triplet 1 the following week.  
 
STANFORD - NOTE THAT USE OF EPIC BEACON TEMPLATE #2161, ITA HEAD AND NECK 
DOCETAXEL / CISPLATIN / CETUXIMAB QWEEK(ONC)   IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.

Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 11 of 31 over 120 minutes  
Then for all subsequent and /or 
maintenance doses (starting at cycle 1, 
day 8) will be given as 250 mg/m2 IV 
over 60 minutes  
Carboplatin  (only if 
substituting for cisplatin)  AUC ** = 2,  
IV over 30 minutes  Days 1,  8, 15 
*In order to facilitate timely infusion of agents, cetuximab may be administered +/ - 8 day of the cisplatin and 
docetaxel infusions  since in some cases the duration of infusion on day 1 cycle 1 may be prohibitively long.  In 
cases where  the loading dose of cetuximab was  given alone and it has been more than 5 days since the 
cetuximab was given, cetuximab may be given at the weekly dosing per protocol during the next treatment day, 
unless treatment must be held due to AE.  
In cases where cetuximab treatment has been held for more than 2 scheduled treatment visits [14 days] the 
patient may be given an additional loading dose of cetuximab. In addition, if the last treatment is > 2 weeks ( 14 
days) from last dose, then the c ycle shall begin again starting at Triplet 1 to match the loading dose of 
Cetuximab.    
 
Cycle ONE Clarification : 
 Cycle one is to include the loading dose of Cetuximab (alone) and three doses of the triplet 
(Platinum/Docetaxel/Cetuximab) when the loading dose of cetuximab was given more than 5 days from 
scheduled triplet #1 dose. [Day 1: Cetuximab Alone … Day 8: Triplet dose # 1]  
OR  
 Cycle one is to include the loading dose of Cetuximab (alone) and two doses of the triplet 
(Platinum/Docetaxel/Cetuximab ) when the loading dose of cetuximab was given < 5 days from 
scheduled Platinum/Docetaxel dose. [Day 1: Cetuximab Alone … Day 5: Platinum/Docetaxel only (dose 
#1)]   
 
**Calculated using Cockcroft -Gault GFR = (140 -age) * (Wt in kg) * (0.85 if female) / (72 * Cr) . Therefore by 
Calvert formula, Carboplatin dose  (mg) = AUC x (GFR +25)  
 
Duration of treatment: Patients may receive up to 12 cycles of cisplatin and docetaxel treatment. All c onfirmed 
complete responders will be treated with cisplatin and/or docetaxe l for an additional 2 cycles beyond 
confirmation of CR. Cetuximab will be continued until progression of disease.  
 
4.1 Premedications  and Supportive Care Guidelines

Cetuximab dose reduction guidelines:  
 
Patients developing dermatologic toxicities while receiving cetuximab should be monitored for the 
development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae, and appropriate treatment of these symptoms 
initiated. Dose modifications of any future cetux imab infusions should be instituted in case of severe 
acneiform rash. Treatment with topical and/or oral antibiotics should be considered; topical 
corticosteroids are not recommended. If a patient experiences severe acneiform rash, cetuximab 
treatment adju stments should be made according to the following table. In patients with mild and 
moderate skin toxicity, treatment should continue without dose modification. NO dose reductions below 
dose level minus two.

Cetuximab infusion reactions  
 
In clinical trials, severe, potentially fatal infusion reactions were reported.  These events include the 
rapid onset of airway obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), urticaria, and/or hypotension. 
Severe infusion reactions occurred wi th the administration of Cetuximab in approximately 3% of 
patients, rarely with fatal outcome (<1 in 1000). Approximately 90% of severe infusion reactions were 
associated  with the first infusion of cetuximab despite the use of prophylactic antihistamines. These 
reactions were characterized by the rapid onset of airway obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, 
hoarseness), urticaria, and/or hypotension. Caution must be exercised with every cetuximab infusion, as 
there were patients who experienced their first seve re infusion reaction during later infusions.

           Page 14 of 31  
Management of cetuximab infusion reactions  
 
Severe infusion reactions require the immediate interruption of cetuximab therapy and permanent 
discontinuation from further treatment. Appropriate medical therapy including epinephrine, 
corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen should be available for use in 
the treatment of such reactions. Patients should be carefully observed until the complete resolution of all 
signs and symptoms. M ild to moderate infusion reactions should be managed by slowing the infusion 
rate of cetuximab and by continued use of antihistamine medications (e.g., diphenhydramine) in 
subsequent infusions.  If the patient experiences a mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) infusion reaction, the 
infusion rate should be permanently reduced by 50%. Cetuximab should be immediately and 
permanently discontinued in patients who experience severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions.  
 
GRADE OF Cetuximab infusion reaction  Response  
Grade 1 or 2, flushing, rash, feverm dyspnea, 
urticaria  Stop infusion, administer appropriate therapy, 
restart at 50% of prior infusion rate.  
Grade 3 or 4, brochospasm requiring parenteral 
medications, angioedema, hypotension, 
anaphylaxis, stridor  Stop in fusion. Permanently discontinue 
cetuximab.  
Administer epinephrine, bronchodilators, 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous 
fluids,  vasopressor agents, oxygen, etc, as 
medically indicated

7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Docetaxel, cisplatin , carboplatin and cetuximab are all commercially available.  
Please refer to t he approved package ins erts for  these agents to see  the complete list of reported AEs. Below 
is a brief summary of common AEs with these agents:  
 
Cisplatin:  
1.Renal: A dose -related, cumulative renal tubular injury can occur; adequate  
hydration and diuresis usually minimize the risk. Salt -wasting nephropathy  
and/or orthostatic hypotension with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism can  
occur in up to 10% of patients.  
2. Neurologic: A dos e-related ototoxicity, manifested by high -frequency hearing  
loss and tinnitus, occurs in about 30% of patients. Paresthesias, decreased  
vibratory, position, and touch sensations are less common; particularly at  
cumulative doses <400 mg/m2.  
3. Hematologic: Mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur in 25 -30% of  
patients, but are rarely dose -limiting; anemia is less common. A potentially  
fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported.  
4. Gastrointestinal: Severe, dose -limiting nausea and vomiting occur in almost  
100% of patients unless adequate antiemetic prophylaxis is given. Even with  
successful prophylaxis of acute nausea a delayed (72 -96 hour) reaction,  
requiring additional therapy may occur. Anorexia and taste changes may also  
occur.  
5. Hypersensitivit y: Allergic reactions are reported in up to 20% of patients  
Symptoms include: rash, facial edema, wheezing, hypotension, and  
tachycardia. Severe anaphylaxis is rare.  
6. Other: Electrolyte wasting (magnesium, potassium and sodium), papilledema,  
optic neurit is, retrobulbar neuritis are reported  
 
Carboplatin:  
1. Myelosuppression is the major dose -limiting toxicity.  Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and 
anemia  are common . 
2. Allergic Reactions: Hypersensitivity to carboplatin has been reported in 2% of  
patients receiving t he drug. Symptoms include rash, urticaria, erythema, prurit us, and rarely bronchospasm 
and hypotension.  
3.  Neurologic: Peripheral neuropathies have been observed in 4% of  patients receiving carbopla tin with 
mild paresthesia being the most common.  
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 16 of 31 4.  Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting are the most common GI events; both  usually resolve within 24 
hours and respond to antiemetics. Other GI events include diarr hea, weight loss, constipation, and 
gastrointestinal pain.  
5. Hepatic Toxic ity: Elevated alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and SGOT  
have been observed.  
6. Other: Pain and asthenia are the most common miscellaneous  adverse events. Alopecia  has been reported 
in 3% of the patients taking carboplatin.  
 
     Docetaxel:  
1. Myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,  
anemia).  
2. Hypersensitivity: Minor symptoms include hypotension, flushing, chest pain, abdominal or extremity  
pain, skin reactions, pruritus, dyspnea, and tachycardia. More severe reactions  
include hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea with bronchospasm,  
generalized urticaria, and angioedema. The majority (53%) of the reported  
reactions occurred within 2 -3 minutes of initiation of treatment and 78%  
occurred within the first 10 minutes. Reactio ns usually occurred with the first  
and second doses.  
3. Cardiovascular: Atrial arrhythmia (sinus bradycardia [usually transient and  
asymptomatic], sinus tachycardia, and premature beats); significant events  
include syncope, hypotension, other rhythm abnorm alities (including ventricular  
tachycardia, bigeminy, and complete heart block requiring pacemaker  
placement), and myocardial infarction. Hypertension, possibly related to  
concomitant administration of dexamethasone, may also occur.  
4. Neurologic: Sensory changes (taste changes); peripheral neuropathy; arthralgia  
and myalgia (dose -related, more common when colony -stimulating factors are  
also administered); seizures; mood alterations; neuroencephalopathy; hepatic  
encephalopathy; motor neuropathy; and autonom ic neuropathy (paralytic ileus  
and symptomatic hypotension).  
6. Dermatologic: Alopecia, universal, complete, and often sudden, between days  
14-21; injection site reactions (erythema, induration, tenderness, skin  
discoloration); infiltration (phlebitis, cel lulitis, ulceration, and necrosis, rare);  
radiation recall; and rash.  
6. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, pharyngitis, typhlitis  
(neutropenic enterocolitis), ischemic colitis, and pancreatitis.

  7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is 
unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and 
related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution or until 
30 after the last dose of the study tre atment.  
 
Any Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events experience from the following list will be clearly noted  in 
source document ation  during each treatment cycle and will be captured  on the study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) : Neuropathy, Cetuximab Ras h, Hearing Loss, low Absolute Neutrophil Count 
(ANC), low Platelet Count (PLT), low Hemoglobin (Hgb), and worst Creatinine levels .  
 
SAEs CTCAE v 4.0 Grade 3 and above, and all subsequent follow -up reports will be reported to the 
CCTO Safety Office regardl ess of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by the 
CCTO Safety Officers , any events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be 
reported to the IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of the review, or within 5 working days for 
deaths or life -threatening experiences.

           Page 19 of 31 10. MEASUREMENT  
 
Antitumor Effect :  PRIMARY ENDPOINT IS RECIST DEFINED RESPONSE RATE  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8  weeks  +/- 1 week.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmator y scans should also be obtained not less than 4  weeks 
following initial documentation of objective response.   
 
All measurements  will be noted on a tumor measurement log and will have screenshots  of relevant 
imaging or clinical findings  available to support measurements.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed 
by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) . 
1Changes in the  largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment 
with TPC.  
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, 
have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified accor ding to the definitions 
stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will 
also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that ar e 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target disease.  
The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
 
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x -ray or as >10 mm with CT scan, 
MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered 
measurable.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longe st 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 20 of 31 measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease,  and abdominal masses (not followed by CT 
or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurabl e) since they are, by definition, 
simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the 
same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total,  
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured 
at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves 
to reproducible repeated m easurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not 
lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest fo r non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  
The baseline sum diamet ers will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and 
above the 5 target lesi ons should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by c linical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of 
the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions  on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumption  that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 21 of 31 the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availabi lity of MRI is variable globally.  
As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should 
be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality 
used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and di seases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as 
possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if 
possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, t he low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not 
always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can 
document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic q uality to a diagnostic 
CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer 
lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET  portion of the CT introduces additional data which may 
bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at 
a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be gua ranteed that the same technique 
and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by 
ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response 
(CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above 
the upper nor mal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487 -488, 2 004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 
1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has 
developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for 
use in first -line trials in ov arian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the 
measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiat e between response or stable 
disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.

Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes  
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At leas t a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 
mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:    Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representati ve of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a 
later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 23 of 31 progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

** Only for non -randomized trials with response as primary 
endpoint.  
*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -
target lesions may be accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note : Patients with a  global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progressi on even after discontinuation of treatment.

*  ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease 
since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is n ot 
advised  
 
Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the 
first date tha t progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
  Response Review  
  All response assessments rendered by radiologists or sub -investigators must be confirmed by site PIs.  
 
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever 
occurs first.  
Overall survival is defined as time from start of treatment until death from any cause. Patients will be 
followed for progression on study after treatment completion quarterly with clinic visits or until another 
treatment  is initiated.  
 
 
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the study 
(e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the Stanford IRB and 
Stanford Cancer Institute’s  Scientific Review Committee (SRC).  Any changes made to the protocol will 
be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  The Protocol 
Director will disseminate the protocol amend ment information to all participating investigators.  
Investigators will be expected to obtain IRB approval within 90 days for all amendments.  
 
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The Stanford Cancer Institute’s  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will be the monitoring 
entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study -related activities to determine whether the study has 
been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, 
and Good Clinical Practice  (GCP).  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events 
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 25 of 31 and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results 
of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regu latory authorities at the 
time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
 
11.3 Data Management Plan  and Study Documentation  
 
Electronic case report forms for specified protocol related information on each trial patient, using the 
REDCap  system, will be created.  The Protocol Director and participating site investigators must 
maintain adequate and accurate participant case histories with observations and other data pertinent to 
the study. Original source documents should be transcribed to  Case Report Forms (CRFs) and used to 
communicate study data to the lead site. Source documents include hospital records, clinical charts, 
laboratory and pharmacy records, and recorded electronic data.  
 
Participating  Center’s PIs will be responsible for m aintaining the clinical protocol and  subjects’ study 
charts, reporting adverse events, assuring that consent is obtained and documented, and reporting the 
status of the trial in continuing renewals submitted to their IRB and trials monitoring group(s) as p er 
their facility protocol. A chart with all the relevant research patient information will be maintained for 
each patient at each institution by the research coordinator and/or responsible P D for that specific 
institution. Paper copies of the documentation from the medical record which support the data entered 
into REDCap will be kept in patient specific binders in a secure, locked, and HIPPA compliant 
environment. Patient charts will be revie wed by Stanford PI and/or Study Coordinator.  
 
Participating Institutions  will complete all electronic CRFs in REDCap within 2 weeks of a patients’ 
visit and provide paper source documents supporting the data entered to Stanford for monitoring via 
secure e mail to rlira@stanford.edu . Note the subject line of the email is required to first include 
“secure:” in it . The research coordinator or participating center’s investigator will be responsible for 
database records of patient data and providing them to Stanford . Any electronic data will be kept on a 
secured server file system.  
 
11.4 Site Communication  
 
When all participating institutions have successfully received IRB approval and have started enrolling 
patients, tel econferences to discuss participants and study -related matters will be held once per quarter, 
although call may occur more frequently if necessary. Teleconferences will be coordinated by Research 
Staff at a participating institution (PIs, Research Coordina tors, Nurses, and Co -Investigators if needed 
will participate). Any issues will patient compliance, database entry, or other items will also be 
discussed in these calls. Calls will include review by PIs  of subject data to assure validity as well as the 
safety of subjects; and the progress of the trials may also be discussed. At times of study renewals or 
more frequently if needed, PIs will review safety reports and clinical trial efficacy endpoints and 
confirm that the safety outcomes favor continuation of the study.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Statistical d esign  and trial size  
This treatment trial is a single arm, unblinded, two staged Simon 23design to evaluate the RECIST 
response rate to weekly TPC in patients with recurrent or metastatic  SCCHN. Patients must have 
received at least one cycle of weekly TPC in order to be evaluable for response.   The assumption is that 
we wish to distinguish b etween a response rate of 25% which would be uninteresting and a response rate 
Version 8          02/06/2014 
           Page 26 of 31 of 50% which would merit further testing, based on response rates of trials with similar agents on 
different schedules.22 Choosing an alpha type error probability of 0.1 and a beta type error probability of 
0.1 would mean that in order to proceed beyond the first stage, at least  3 of 10 patients would have to  
have responses, and at least  10 of up to 27 patients would have to respond in order declare this regimen 
of interest.   The expected sample size would be 18 patients to see at least 10 responders and the 
probability of early termination if the true response rate is 25% would be 0.52.  
 
12.2 Descriptive Statistics and Exp loratory Data Analysis  of secondary endpoints:  
Overall survival (OS)  (the time from registration to death or date of last  
contact) and progression free survival  (PFS) (patients alive without RECIST progression) are  
secondary endpoints of the study. Kaplan -Meier estimates of overall and progression -free survival rates 
will be calculated, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The median, 12 -month and 
24-month overall and progression free survival rates will be estimated.  AEs attribut able to ATO will be 
collected according the study calendar and tabulated for cumulative evaluation.

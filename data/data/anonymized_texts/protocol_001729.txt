1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date 
Original 22 December 2014
Amendment 1 03 April 2015
Amendment 2 19 July 2016
Amendment 2.01 (UK Only) 19 January 2017
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Section 1.2, Synopsis, update the phase of the study from Phase 2 to Phase 2/3 
to be consistent with the rest of the document.
Rationale:   To make the update to this page that was not made in previous 
version of the document.
●Section 1.2, Synopsis – Objectives, Section 4.0– Study Objectives, 
Section 5.3.1 – Clinical Laboratory Tests, Clinical Laboratory Tests Table 1 , 
Section 5.3.3.1 – Clinical Variables:  Remove collection of alpha fetoprotein.
Rationale:   Alpha fetoprotein is an unreliable test for screening for liver 
disease including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is no longer 
recommended in the AASLD HCV guidelines (2017)29for this purpose. 
●Section 1.2, Synopsis, Main Inclusion:  Incorporate language from 
Administrative Change 1 for Inclusion Criterion 3 to clarify the criterion by 
adding a sentence to note that subjects who have been retreated with a 
commercially available anti-HCV treatment are able to enroll in the study 
greater than 2 years after the last dose of the AbbVie DAA therapy from the previous AbbVie clinical study.
Rationale:   The 2 year timeframe should not apply to subjects who have been 
retreated, for whom we will not be collecting blood samples to evaluate the 
persistence of resistance substitutions.  The additional text clarifies the intent 
of Protocol Amendment 2, which allowed the enrollment of these retreated subjects.  The inclusion criteria should have been amended at that time but

3
was not, therefore this administrative change is necessary.  The change will 
not have impact on the safety or well-being of subjects enrolled in the study.
●Section 5.2.1 , Inclusion Criteria:  Incorporate clarification language from 
Administrative Change 1 for Inclusion Cri terion 3 – Clarify the criterion by 
adding a sentence to note that subjects who have been retreated with a 
commercially available anti-HCV treatment are able to enroll in the study 
greater than 2 years after the last dose of the AbbVie DAA therapy from the 
previous AbbVie clinical study.
Rationale:   The 2 year timeframe should not apply to subjects who have been 
retreated, for whom we will not be collecting blood samples to evaluate the 
persistence of resistance substitutions.  The additional text clarifies the intent 
of Protocol Amendment 2, which allowed the enrollment of these retreated subjects.  The inclusion criteria should have been amended at that time but 
was not, therefore this administrative change is necessary.  The change will 
not have impact on the safety or well-being of subjects enrolled in the study.
●Section 5.3.1.1 , Collection of Liver Diagnostic Results:   Screening for 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by liver ultrasound has been added to the final study visit for cirrhotic subjects, in order to screen them for development 
of HCC as part of long-term follow-up.
Rationale:   Subjects with cirrhosis may be at-risk for developing HCC, and 
therefore will be screened for HCC by liver ultrasound testing at the final visit.
!Section 5.3.4 , Safety Variables, Incorporate language from Amendment 2.01 
(UK only):  Revise wording to clarify that the investigator is responsible for 
collecting Serious Adverse Event data.
Rationale:   To clarify the language to say that the investigator collects Serious 
Adverse Event data.  The previous language was redundant.
!Section 6.0, Adverse Events, Incorporate language from Amendment 2.01 (UK 
only):  Revise wording to clarify that the investigator is responsible for 
collecting Serious Adverse Event data.
Rationale:   To clarify the language to say that the investigator collects Serious 
Adverse Event data.  The previous language was redundant.

Methodology:   
At the Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide written (signed and dated) informed consent prior to any study 
specific procedures being performed.  The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria prior to enrollment in this rollover study.
Subjects will have completed the post-treatment period of the prior AbbVie HCV clinical study.  All 
subjects will be followed for approximately 3 years following their last dose of DAA in the previous AbbVie HCV clinical study, with the exception of re-treated subjects who will be followed through post-treatment Week 12.  The 3 years will be inclusive of any post-treatment period in the prior study, as well as any gap between the end of the prior study and enrollment into this study.
Subjects who are not re-treated will return to the study site for their scheduled visits on an outpatient 
basis at Month 3, Month 6 and every 6 months thereafter for approximately 3 years after the last dose of DAA in the previous clinical study.  Subjects with virologic failure who receive re-treatment will only have one additional outpatient visit subsequent to beginning re-treatment, at post-treatment Week 12 to assess the SVR
12result, and then they will discontinue from the study.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:
Main Inclusion:   
1. The subject has received at least one dose of an ABT-493- and/or ABT-530-containing regimen in a 
prior AbbVie HCV Phase 2 or 3 study which has been conducted under a US IND (see Appendix D for list of eligible prior studies).
2. The interval between the last dose of the AbbVie DAA therapy from the previous clinical study and 
enrollment in Study M13-576 must be no longer than 2 years for subjects who have not been retreated.  Subjects who have been treated with  a commercially-available anti -HCV treatment may be 
enrolled greater than 2 years after the last dose of the AbbVie DAA therapy from the previousclinical study.
3. The subject must voluntarily sign and date the informed consent form approved by an Independent 
Review Board or Ethics Committee prior to the initiation of any study-specific procedures.
4. Subject completed the post-treatment period of an eligible prior study.
Main Exclusion:   
1. The investigator considers the subject unsuitable for the study for any reasons (e.g., failure to comply 
with study procedures in the prior AbbVie clinical study).
2. Receipt of any investigational HCV antiviral treatment after receiving ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in 
the prior study.
3. Subjects who experienced non-virologic treatment failures due to premature discontinuation of study 
drug in the prior study of ABT-493/ABT-530.
4. Participation in AbbVie's Study M15-942 protocol for re-treatment for virologic failures in the prior 
Phase 2 or 3 study.
Investigational Products: There is no AbbVie Investigational Product administered.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Virologic response will be assessed by HCV RNA in log 10IU/mL at various time points.
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
8
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Resistance:
The persistence of amino acid variants associated with drug resistance will be assessed by population, 
and/or deep sequencing at the Day 1 Visit, and at various subsequent time points, as appropriate, for a period of up to 3 years after the subject's last dose of DAA therapy in the prior AbbVie clinical study.
Liver Disease Progression:
Liver Disease progression will be assessed by laboratory test results (FibroTest and APRI) and the 
recording of medical events related to progression of liver disease including, events of hepatic decompensation (per Section 5.3.1.1), change in Child-Pugh classification, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, death.
Safety:
Only serious adverse events related to study procedures or those considered by the investigator to be 
reasonably related to exposure to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 in a prior study will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoints are the percentage of subjects who maintain a sustained virologic 
response and the percentage of subjects who relapse or have new HCV infection at any time up to the last follow-up in this study out of subjects who achieved SVR
12in the previous study and enroll in this study.  
The summary will be separate for subjects who have probable relapse as distinguished from subjects who have probable new HCV infection based on DNA sequence phylogenetic analysis of HCV drug target genes.  In addition, the time to relapse or new infection from the end of DAA treatment for subjects who achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ at the end of treatment in the previous study and from SVR
12time point for 
the subset of subjects who achieved SVR 12in the previous study will be displayed graphically using 
Kaplan-Meier curves.
Resistance:
The variants at each amino acid position by population and/or deep sequencing at available post-baseline 
time points compared to baseline and prototypic reference standard sequences will be summarized by DAA target genes and accompanying listings will be provided.
Safety:
Serious adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  A summary of medical events related to the progression of liver disease and shifts in laboratory measurements will be provided.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 170 million 
individuals infected worldwide.1  There are 6 major HCV genotypes, with genotype 1 
(GT1) being most prevalent worldwide, including in the United States.  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2,3  Recent data suggest that HCV GT3 causes 12% 
of HCV infections in the United States.4  HCV GT4 is commonly found in parts of Africa 
and the Middle East, particularly in Egypt, GT5 is primarily found in South Africa, and GT6 is primarily found in south-east Asia.
5  Depending on various risk factors, between 
10% and 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.6  Death 
related to the complications of cirrhosis  may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% 
per year; hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
6  Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma have a 33% 
probability of death during the first year.6  Successful treatment of HCV has been shown 
to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
7,8
Since the identification of HCV in the early 1990's, the mainstay of tr eatment,  until the 
recent development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs), had been interferon alpha (IFN).  Despite multiple advances in treatment with IFN, including co-administration with ribavirin (RBV), development of pegylated interferon (pegIFN), suboptimal efficacy in many populations and poor safety and tolerability limit widespread use of these therapies for HCV-infected patients.
Further advances in treatment for HCV GT1 infection have been the addition of DAAs,
such as an HCV nonstructural (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) (telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir), the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, or the HCV nucleotide NS 5B RNA polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) to pegIFN/RBV (PR).  This latter regimen demonstrated increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in PR treatment-naïve (TN) HCV GT1-infected patients from 55% to 90%; however, response rates are lower in 
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
14
a number of subpopulations including blacks, Hispanics, PR-experienced patients, and 
cirrhotics.9-14  Many of the current approved treatments for HCV GT1 include use of PR, 
which is associated with considerable, often treatment limiting toxicities (fever, chills, rigor, fatigue, depression, and anemia).  The addition of first generation PIs to a PR regimen has resulted in additional toxiciti es (anorectal discomfort) and augmented others 
(anemia, rash).
15,16
As of October 2014, an IFN- and RBV-free co mbination of SOF plus NS5A inhibitor 
ledipasvir has been approved in the US for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 infection, including an option of 8-week therapy in non-cirrhotic p atients with HCV viral load 
< 6 million at baseline.
17  As of late December 2014, an IFN-free combination of 
ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor), paritaprevir (protease inhibitor), dasabuvir (non-nucleoside NS5b polymerase inhibitor) and ritonavir, given with or without RBV, has been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 infection.
18  These newest pegIFN free treatments 
provide a significant advance over all prior HCV treatment options.
Additionally, subjects that have failed DAAs with or without PR are likely to have mutant HCV variants and therefore have limited future treatment options.  Current data on DAA resistance are generally limited to clinical trials of telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, and the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir.  In the telaprevir Phase 3 clinical trials, treatment-emergent NS3 resistance substitution s emerged in the majority of isolates from 
subjects who did not achieve SVR
12.  Further, these resistance-associated substitutions 
persisted following treatment failure.19  HCV replicon variants with patient-derived 
telapravir-associated resistance showed a wide variation of in-vitro resistance to telapravir, depending on the amino-acid substitutions involved.  Generally, the in vitro replication capacity of telapravir-resistant variants was lower than that of wild-type virus
20
suggesting reduced viral fitness.  For subjects treated with daclatasvir-containing regimens, daclatasvir resistance-associated NS5A substitutions emerged in almost all subjects who failed these treatments while some of these substitutions were detected in a small number of baseline samples.
21-23  Replicons with these substitutions demonstrated 
various level of resistance to daclatasvir in vi tro.  Many of the NS5A resistance-associated 
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
15
substitutions also persisted after treatment.22,23  Emergence of resistance to DAAs may be 
even more common in the clinical setting where adherence may be lower than what has 
been observed in the clinical trials.
The aim of treatment of chronic HCV infection is to achieve a sustained virologic 
response (SVR).  HCV infection is cured in more than 99% of patients who achieve an undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after treatment completion.
6  The validity of using 
undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR 12) has been 
accepted by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe given that the concordance with 
SVR 24approaches 99%.6The long-term durability of SVR has been demonstrated among 
subjects with HCV infection with multiple different genotypes treated with IFN-based regimens (i.e., IFN alone or IFN plus RBV).  For example, among the first 103 patients 
treated at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 100 patients, or 97%, maintained SVR at 
a median follow-up of 7.5 years.
24
Although achievement of an SVR has been associated with laboratory and histological improvements in chronic HCV,
25the SVR endpoint is a surrogate for the ultimate aim of 
therapy, which is prevention of progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and death from liver disease.24  These "hard" clinical endpoints, 
however, generally take years to decades to occur, making them impractical and unethical primary endpoints for clinical trials of HCV therapies.  Thus the relationship between SVR to clinical outcomes must be evaluated through long-term follow-up studies.
In contrast to what is known from studies from IFN-based regimens, little data is available 
to date for SVR and long-term clinical outcomes for subjects who have been treated with 
DAA plus IFN and RBV, or IFN and RBV-free all DAA regimens.  Such studies are needed in order to demonstrate the long-term benefits of DAAs, whether given with IFN and/or RBV, or given as all-DAA regimens.
AbbVie is currently developing 2 "next generation" DAA drugs for use together or in 
combination with a third DAA or Ribavirin.  AbbVie's next generation DAAs, including ABT-493, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor and ABT-530, an NS5A inhibitor are denoted 
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
16
"next generation" compounds because each demonstrated potent antiviral activity against 
all major HCV GTs in vitro with no or little loss of potency against known common 
single resistance mutants.
ABT-493
ABT-493, (3aR,7S,10S,12R,21E,24aR)-7-tert-butyl-N-[(1R,2R)-2-(difluoromethyl)-1-
{[(1-methylcycl opropyl)sulfonyl] carbamoyl}cycl opropyl]-20,20-difluoro-5,8-dioxo-
2,3,3a,5,6,7,8,11,12,20,23,24a-dodecahydro-1H,10H-9,12 -methanocyclopenta[18,19] 
[1,10,17,3,6]trioxadiazacyclononadecino[11,12-b]quinoxaline-10-carboxamide, is an NS3/4A PI with potent, pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance with activity against common variants that emerge following exposure to first generation PIs.  In the HCV subgenomic replicon assay, ABT-493 is act ive against replicons with NS3 from 
GT1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  ABT-493 activity against  GT5 NS3 is unknown because a replicon 
with GT5 NS3 is not available.  Based on findings that each of 5 well characterized HCV PIs, including 2 linear and 3 macrocyclic PIs, demonstrated similar activity against GT2a, 5a, and 6a NS3 protease,
26it is predicted ABT-493 would inhibit NS3 protease of GT5a 
with activity similar to that of GT2a and 6a.  In resistant colony selection experiments with chimeric replicons containing GT1-4 or GT6 NS3, ABT-493 selected fewer resistant colonies than ABT-450 in most replicons, indicating overall it has a higher genetic barrier to resistance than ABT-450 in vitro.  Furthermore, in GT1-4 replicons, the over all 
resistance profile of ABT-493, which selects mos tly A156 variants, is different from that 
of ABT-450, which selects predominantly R155 and D/Q168 variants.  ABT-493 maintains most of its activity in vitro against common HCV GT1-4 R155 or D/Q168 variants that are resistant to ABT-450.  AbbVie is developing ABT-493 to be used in combination with other AbbVie DAAs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
In Phase 2a Study M13-595, preliminary results showed the ABT-493 exposures in 
subjects with HCV-infection were 2- fold of healthy subjects following 100, 200 or 
700 mg QD dosing and 4.9-fold of healthy subjects following 400 mg QD dosing.  ABT-493 exposures following 200 mg QD dosing in cirrhotic patients were approximately 5- to 6-fold of the exposure in non-cirrhotic HCV- infected patients.

Antiviral activity of ABT-493 monotherapy for 3 days was evaluated in treatment-naïve 
HCV genotype 1-infected patients over a range of doses up to 700 mg QD of ABT-493.  
Preliminary data show that the 200 mg dose of ABT-493 provides strong anti-viral activity (e.g., greater than 3 log
10decline of HCV plasma RNA in all available patients) 
and was selected as ABT-493 dose to be further evaluated in this study.
In general ABT-493 has been well-tolerated when administered to over 320 healthy 
volunteers and 49 HCV GT1-infected subjects.
Preliminary data are suggestive of possible dose/responsive transaminase and bilirubin 
elevations.  ABT-493 doses of 700 mg and 1200 mg have been associated with few incidences of asymptomatic Grade 2 (n = 1) and Grade 3 (n = 2) ALT elevations in healthy volunteers.  One sub ject experienced a Grade 3 ALT elevation at the 1200 mg 
dose level (Study M13-586) which resulted in treatment discontinuation, and another subject experienced a Grade 3 ALT elevation at the 700 mg dose level in Study M14-066 which resolved after dosing was concluded without intervention.  Based on the integrated pharmacokinetic exposures of ABT-493 and safety data in Phase 1 studies, a shallow trend was observed for ALT elevation when ABT-493 AUC was higher than 60000 ng•h/mL, which is approximately 64× higher than projected mean AUC exposures at ABT-493 200 mg in non-ci rrhotics and 12× higher – for  cirrhotics.
Bilirubin elevations (primarily indirect hyperbilirubinemia) initiated independently and did not mirror the course of ALT elevations.  Ob served few total bilirubin elevations were 
asymptomatic and likely contributed by th e known ABT-493 inhibition of organic anion 
transporter polypeptides, including OATP1B1, which is the transporter responsible for clearing indirect bilirubin from blood.  Based on integrated pharmacokinetic exposures of ABT-493 and safety data in Phase 1 studies, a shallow trend was observed for bilirubin elevations when ABT-493 AUC was higher than 25,000 ng•h/mL, which is approximately 27× higher than projected mean AUC exposures at ABT-493 200 mg for non-cirrhotics and 5× higher – for cirrhotics.  A ll ALT, AST and bilirubin elevations 
improved/normalized following completion or discontinuation (n = 1) of ABT-493 dosing.

In summary, ABT-493 is a potent, pangenotypic NS3/4A PI with potential for treatment 
of chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

ABT-530
ABT-530, Methyl {(2S,3R)-1-[(2S)-2-{6-[(2R,5R)-1-{3,5-difluoro-4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)piperidin-1-yl]phenyl}-5-(5-fluoro-2-{(2S)-1-[N-(methoxycarbonyl)-O-methyl-L-threonyl] py rrolidin-2-yl}-1H- benzimidazol-6-yl) pyrrolidin-2-yl]-5-fluoro-1H-
benzimidazol-2-yl}pyrrolidin-1-yl]-3-methoxy-1-oxobutan-2-yl}carbamate, is an NS5A inhibitor with pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance.  ABT-530 is highly 
active against HCV replicons containing wild-type HCV NS5A from GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  ABT-530 retains activity against all common single nucleotide change resistance associated variants in NS5A in all GTs.  ABT-530 is > 100-fold more active than the first generation NS5A inhibitors (ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir) against key resistance-associated variants selected by these inhibitors in the clinic at NS5A amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, and 93.  ABT-530 selected very few or no resistant colonies in HCV replicons with NS5A from GTs 1 – 6 at 10-fold or 100-fold over its EC
50value 
indicating it has a high genetic barrier to resi stance in vitro.  Measured in this way, the 
genetic barrier to resistance for ABT-530 is higher than ombitasvir across all GTs.  AbbVie is developing ABT-530 to be used in combination with other AbbVie DAAs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
Pharmacokinetics of ABT-530 has been evalu ated up to 600 mg QD.  ABT-530 reached a 
T
maxaround 3 to 5 hours, with an elimination half-life of 12 to 17 hours.  ABT-530 
exposures increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner across the 1.5 mg to 
120 mg dose range and approximately dose proportionally from the 120 mg to 600 mg 
single doses.  The mean percentages of the ABT-530 dose excreted as unchanged drug in urine were less than 0.004%, indicating minimum renal elimination for ABT-530.
In Phase 2a Study M13-595, preliminary results showed same dose ABT-530 exposures 
in subjects with HCV infection were similar to those observed in healthy subjects.

19
Antiviral potency of ABT-530 monotherapy f or 3 days in HCV GT1-infected patients was 
evaluated over a range of doses up to 400 mg QD of ABT-530.  Preliminary data show 
that the 40 mg and 120 mg doses of ABT-530 provide similar strong anti-viral potency (e.g., greater than 3 log
10decline of HCV plasma RNA in all available patients) and were 
selected as ABT-530 doses to be further evaluated in Phase 2 studies.
In general ABT-530 has been well tolerated when administered to over 320 healthy 
volunteers and 40 HCV GT1-infected subjects.  To date, most AEs reported were Grade 1 in severity, demonstrated no pattern or resulted in study drug discontinuation.  Additionally, no pattern of laboratory  abnormalities ha s been observed.
In summary, ABT-530 has the potential to address an unmet need in the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

ABT-493 and ABT-530
Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530.
When ABT-493 was given in combination with ABT-530 in healthy volunteers, 
preliminary results showed ABT-493 exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with ABT-530 ( ≤ 31% difference); however, the exposure of ABT-530 
increased in an ABT-493-dose-dependent manner (from 1.5-fold at 100 mg ABT-493 up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg ABT-493).
Drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies ha ve also been conducted to evaluate the 
co-administration effects of ABT-493 and ABT-530 on substrates of P-gp, BCRP, 
OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 and CYP3A4.  Studies are summarized in the investigator brochures.

3.1 Differences Statement
This is the first study evaluating the long-term durability of SVR, persistence of DAA 
resistance, and clinical outcomes for subjects who received AbbVie Next Generation DAA regimen compounds (ABT-493 and/or ABT-530) in efficacy trials.  In addition, the duration of follow-up in this study is significantly longer than the follow-up duration for current and planned phase 2 and 3 studies for ABT-493 and ABT-530.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
There are no expected direct benefits for subjects who enroll in this study, except that 
early identification of relapse may allow  initiation of other treatment.  Subj ects may 
experience discomfort or inconvenience related to study procedures.
4.0 Study Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are as follows:
●Assess the durability of response for subjects who achieved SVR 12with a 
regimen including ABT-493 and/or ABT-530.
●Assess the persistence of specific HCV amino acid variants associated with 
drug resistance in subjects who experienced virologic failure.
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:
●Summarize medical events related to progression of liver disease including but 
not limited to:  events of hepatic decompensation, change in Child-Pugh 
classification, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma and/or, death.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This Phase 2/3, multicenter study will be offered to subjects who received at least one 
dose of an ABT-493- and/or ABT-530-containing regimen at any dose level in an eligible 
prior AbbVie Phase 2 or 3 study for the treatm ent of chronic HCV and elect to enroll in 
this study.  The subject must have completed the follow-up period of the prior eligible AbbVie study.
It is anticipated that approximately 400 subjects will participate in this study.  An attempt 
will be made to enroll all virologic failures who will not receive immediate re-treatment 
with a regimen containing ABT-493/ABT-530.
At the Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures being performed.  The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and 
Section 5.2.2 prior to enrollment in this rollover study.
Subjects will be followed for a total of a pproximately 3 years after their last dose of DAA 
in the previous HCV clinical study.  The 3 years will be inclusive of any post-treatment period in the prior study, as well as any gaps between the end of the prior study and enrollment in this study.  Subjects must  complete the full post-treatment period of the 
prior study before enrolling into Study M13-576.  Once a subject has reached 3 years 
post-DAA therapy, participation in this study will be completed, except for subjects enrolled with virologic failure who receive re-treatment with a HCV antiviral regimen 
other than investigational ABT-493/ABT-530.  Subjects who are retreated with investigational ABT-493/ABT-530 are not allowe d in this study.  Subjects who are re-
treated with HCV regimens other than investigational ABT-493/ABT-530 will have only one further assessment for treatment outcome 12 weeks after stopping that therapy or earlier if already known (in cases of treatment failure).  (See Appendix C , Table B, Study 
Activities for Virologic Failures Receiving Re-Treatment).
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24

Subjects who have not been re-treated will return to the study site for their scheduled 
visits on an outpatient basis as described in Section 5.3.1 until approximately 3 years after 
their last dose of DAA in the previous clinical study (See Appendix C , Table A, Study 
Activities for SVR and Non-SVR Subjects Not Receiving Re-Treatment).
Some of the study visits and visit activit ies (including but not limited to clinical laboratory 
tests and concomitant medication assessment) may be optionally conducted in the home 
or non-hospital/clinic environment as arranged by the Investigator with the agreement of 
the subject, and with the prior approval of the sponsor. 
5.2 Selection of Study Population
Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and w ho do not meet any of the exclusion criteria 
will be eligible for enrollment in the study.
5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria

24
investigationally known as ABT-493/ABT-530), initiated after the completion of a 
subject's participation in the previous clinical study (either prior to or during participation in this study) are permitted, and the regimen received and duration will be recorded in the eCRF.  Subjects enrolled with virologic failure who undergo re-treatment with a HCV 
antiviral regimen not containing investigational ABT-493/ABT-530 will be followed until completing the post-treatment Week 12 visit after receiving their re-treatment regimen, after which they will discontinue from the study.  If a subject with virologic failure is enrolled into this study and later enrolls in the AbbVie Study M15-942, such subjects will discontinue from Study M13-576.
The use of investigational medications is not allowed during participation in this study.  
Subjects who are enrolled in the Study M13-576 and who take an investigational medicine as a participant in a separate trial will be required to discontinue participation in 
the Study M13-576.
Information regarding medication or vaccine use (including over-the-counter medications, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) will not be collected in this study with the exception of: 
●Prescription medications taken for the treatment of HCV since the completion 
or discontinuation of the previous clinical study (either prior to or during this 
study).
●Any medications taken for treatment of an SAE as defined in Section 6.0.
This information will be collected at each study visit and will be recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  The medication name along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency will be recorded.
The AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted if there are any 
questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy(ies).

Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any study procedures 
are performed.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical History Relating to Liver Disease or HCV Infection
Documentation of any significant changes in the medical history related to liver disease 
and/or HCV infection that are considered to be clinically significant by the investigator and occur since the completion of the prior AbbVie clinical study will be collected at the Day 1 Visit and recorded on the appropriate Medical Events eCRF for all subjects, except for those subjects entering the study on a re-t reatment regimen.  For subjects entering the 
study on a re-treatment regimen, this information will be collected for changes that occurred since the prior AbbVie clinical study but before the start of the re-treatment regimen only.  Significant events related to liver disease progression include the development of cirrhosis, events indicative of hepatic decompensation, (including:  variceal bleeding, new ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-renal syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax or other evidence of  hepatic decompensation considered to be significant by the investigator), change in the Child-Pugh category (e.g., change from Child-Pugh Class A to Child-Pugh Class B), the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver transplantation.  See Appendix E for details of 
Child-Pugh score and classification.  In addition, history of past HCV drug treatment during the prior study and before the prior study will be collected at the Day 1 Visit.

Recording Medical Events Related to Liver Disease, HCV Infection or the Event of 
Death
Any events (i.e., diagnoses) related to liver disease progression and/or HCV infection that 
are considered to be clinically significant by the investigator and begin or worsen after 
Day 1 will be captured on the appropriate Medical Events eCRF until the end of the study 
or initiation of re-treatment for HCV (if applicable).  Significant events related to liver disease progression include the development of cirrhosis, events indicative of hepatic decompensation, (including:  variceal bleeding, new ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepa to-renal syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax or other 
evidence of hepatic decompensation considered to be significant by the investigator), change in the Child-Pugh category (e.g., change from Child-Pugh Class A to Child-Pugh Class B), the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation and/or death.
Collection of Liver Diagnostic Results
Any results from liver diagnostic testing perf ormed outside of the study (i.e., FibroScan, 
Liver U/S, and/or Liver Biopsy) will be collected at the study visits indicated in 
Appendix C for all subjects, until the end of the study or initiation of re-treatment for 
HCV (if applicable).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening:  Liver Ultrasound
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the Final 
visit, as indicated in Appendix C , for subjects with cirrhosis only.  At any other time 
during the study, HCC screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Final visit, subjects with cirrhosis will be required to perform a liver ultrasound to 
screen for HCC, unless the subject has a liver ultrasound, CT or MRI performed for HCC screening within 3 months prior to that visit, in which case the result of that US, CT orMRI will be used as the result for the Study Visit assessment.  A positive ultrasound result 
suspicious of HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., MRI or CT) at a study visit should be discussed with the TA MD.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator 
considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of a serious adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.  In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study, the reasons for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRF and an assessment of serious adverse events as described in Section 6.0will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study.
Subjects who experienced virology failure in  the prior study and have received HCV re-
treatment will be followed until the Post-Treatment Week 12 visit for assessment of 
SVR
12, and then discontinued from the study.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing serious adverse event as described in Section 6.0, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a 
satisfactory clinical resolution of the serious adverse event is achieved.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, ei ther in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.

5.5 Treatments
Treatment will not be provided to subjects as part of this study.
5.5.1 Method of Assigning Subject ID Numbers
For subjects enrolling from a Phase 2 study, subjects will receive a new subject number 
for this study which will be composed of a single digit (1, 2, 3, …) used to identify the prior AbbVie study and the subject number assigned to them from the prior AbbVie clinical study.  For subjects enrolling from the Phase 3 studies, subjects will retain their subject number as assigned to them from the prior AbbVie clinical study.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is a rollover study to assess resistance and durability of response to ABT-493 and/or 
ABT-530 in subjects who have participated in Phase 2 or 3 clinical studies with these agents for the treatment of chronic HCV.  No AbbVie study drug will be administered in this study.  As such, the absence of randomization, blinding or control groups is appropriate.  No quantitative analyses or tests of statistical significance are planned; statist ical analyses w ill be purely descriptive.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
The intention of this study is to assess the durability of response in subjects who had 
previously achieved SVR and the emergence and persistence of resistance-associated amino acid variants selected by exposure to AbbVie DAA treatment in subjects who fail previous treatment.  Therefore, subjects who received at least one dose an ABT-493-and/or ABT-530-containing regimen in a prior eligible AbbVie Phase 2 or 3 trial (Appendix D ), for the treatment of HCV are eligible to participate.  This population is 
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
33
appropriate because all such subjects will have been well described clinically and 
virologically prior to starting AbbVie DAA treatment and the duration and magnitude of their exposure to AbbVie DAA treatment will be well documented.
6.0 Adverse Events
As this is a non-drug interventional study, only serious adverse events that the investigator considers reasonably related to interventio nal study procedures (i.e., venipunctures) or 
those considered reasonably related to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in the prior study ( Appendix D ) by the investigator will be collected.  Events that are considered 
related to underlying disease, events that are accidental (i.e., road traffic accidents), and elective procedures (i.e., hip replacement) would not be routinely considered related to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 drug exposure.
The investigator will assess and record any such serious adverse event in detail including 
the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), and any action(s) taken.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Serious adverse events related to study procedures or reasonably related to exposure to ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in the prior study, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be collected.
These serious adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) in this study is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject that occurs as a result of a study procedure, or is considered by the investigator to be reasonably related to exposure to ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in the previous study.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
34
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria and is causally related to study 
procedures (i.e., venipunctures) or those consider ed by the investigator to be reasonably 
related to exposure to ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in the previous study, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "Nati onal Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.
Grading system for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade.

Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninva sive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.
6.3 Relationship to Study Procedures or Study Drug Exposure 
in the Prior Study
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to a study procedure or to exposure to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 in the previous study:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study procedure or ABT-530 and/or 
ABT-493 exposure in the previous study and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study procedure or ABT-530 and/or 
ABT-493 exposure in the previous study and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to a study procedure, or to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in the previous study will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to a study proce dure or ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 exposure in 
the previous study will be considered "not associated."

6.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events that occur during the current study period, and are considered 
related to a study procedure (like an SAE r elated to venipuncture), or reasonably related to 
exposure to ABT-530 and/or ABT-493 that was administered during the previous study period (note:  no study drugs are administered during the current study period) will be collected from the time of the Day 1 Visit of the current study period through the last study procedure or discontinuation from study, whichever is later.
Serious adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1. Serious Adverse Event Collection
* Serious adverse events considered related to study procedures (like an SAE due to venipuncture), or considered 
related to drugs that were administered during the prior study period (no study drugs administered during the 
current study period).
6.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event (as described in Section 6.4), the Investigator will 
notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the 
serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system or if RAVE is not operable should be faxed to AbbVie Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event.

Authority(ies), if required by local regulations, as a serious breach of GCP and the 
protocol.  Protocol waivers are not permitted.
8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Analyses will be conducted on all subjects who enroll in this study without receiving re-
treatment prior to enrolling in this study, denoted as the full analysis set.  Subjects who are virologic failures who receive re-treatmen t prior to enrollment in this study will be 
summarized separately and are excluded from the full analysis set.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for demographic variables for all subjects in the full 
analysis set.
8.1.1 Efficacy
Efficacy analyses will be conducted in all enrolled subjects as specified above including 
data up to the last follow-up in this study pri or to any HCV re-treatment.  The number and 
percentage of subjects in the full analysis set who maintain SVR in this study will be summarized out of subjects in the full analysis set who achieved SVR
12in the previous 
study.  The number and percentage of subjects who relapse or have new HCV infection will be summarized out of subjects in the full analysis set who achieved SVR
12in the 
previous study.  The time to relapse or new infection from the end of DAA treatment for subjects who achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ at the end of treatment in the previous study will be displayed graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves.  Similarly, the time to relapse or new infection from SVR
12time point for the subset of subjects who achieved SVR 12in the 
previous study will also be displayed graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves.  These summaries will be separate for subjects who have probable relapse as distinguished from subjects who have probable new HCV infection based on AbbVie's evaluation of DNA sequence of HCV drug target genes.
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
41
For subjects in the full analysis set, HCV RNA measurements taken after the start of 
another anti-viral HCV treatment (after completion of AbbVie DAA treatments in previous study) will be excluded from the analyses.
A listing of subjects who are re-treated will be provided summarizing HCV treatment 
regimen and SVR outcome.
8.1.2 Resistance
The following subjects in the full analysis set will have resistance testing conducted:  
(1) those with on-treatment virologic failure (VF) in the previous study; (2) those with 
post-treatment relapse prior to enrollment in Study M13-576; and (3) those who become 
viremic (with HCV) during Study M13-576.
A listing by subject will be produced for all subjects entering Study M13-576 who 
experienced VF (as defined above) that includes HCV subtype, IL28B genotype, time point of VF, HCV RNA level at each evaluated time point, time point(s) sequenced, and assessment of possibility of new infection.  The study report will include a description of 
the methods and results used to distinguish between virologic relapse and new infection in subjects suspected to have a new infection.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of the products of amplification.  For subjects who 
experience VF before or during Study M13-576, the sample closest in time after the failure with an HCV RNA level ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be used if the HCV RNA level at the 
time of VF is < 1000 IU/mL.
The regions of interest for population and/or deep sequencing from all evaluated time 
points in this study are those encoding complete NS3/4A, and/or NS5A (based on regimen received in the earlier study).  Subtype-specific prototypic reference strains for sequence analyses will be utilized.
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
42
For each DAA target, signature resistance-associated amino acid positions will be 
identified by AbbVie Clinical Virology.
The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline sample:  sample collected before the first dose of DAA study drug in 
the previous study.
●Baseline variant:  a variant (by population or deep sequencing) in the baseline sample determined by comparison of the amino acid sequence of the baseline 
sample to the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●Post-baseline variant by population or deep sequencing:  an amino acid variant 
in a post-baseline time point sample that was not detected at baseline and is 
detectable by population or deep sequencing in a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
For all subjects who experience VF (whether before or during enrollment in 
Study M13-576), a listing by subject of all bas eline variants relative to prototypic 
reference sequence at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions will be provided for each DAA target (NS3 and/or NS5A as appropriate).
For all subjects who experience VF (whether before or during enrollment in 
Study M13-576), the HCV amino acid sequence as determined by population or deep sequencing at available post-baseline time points (including previous study and Study M13-576) with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be compared to the 
baseline and appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequences.  A listing by subject and time point of all post-baseline variants detected by population or deep sequencing relative to the baseline amino acid sequences will be provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A and/or NS5A as appropriate).  A listing by subject and time point of all post-baseline variants (by population or deep sequencing) at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequences will be provided.
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
43
The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline variants at signature amino acid 
positions by population or deep sequencing, listed by amino acid position and variant within a DAA target at Post-Treatment Week 24, 48 or time points up to Post-Treatment 
Week 144 (3 years) compared to baseline will be summarized, along with the number of subjects for whom sequence information was obtained for each DAA target and overall.  Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects in whom a signature variant persisted at Post-Treatment Week 24, 48 or time points up to Post-Treatment Week 144 (3 years), out of the total number of subjects with that variant at the VF time point and at Post-Treatment Week 24, 48 or time points up to post-treatment Week 144 (3 years) will be summarized by DAA target (NS3 and/or NS5A, as appropriate), and variant.  If a signature variant is detectable in a sample by population or deep sequencing at a later time 
point, then the variant is imputed as being detectable at earlier time windows even if the sample from the earlier time window from that subject is not sequenced.
If no resistance-associated variants are detected by population or deep sequencing in a 
given target for a subject either at the time of failure or in a post-treatment sample, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
Time to loss of key resistance-associated variants will be summarized.
8.1.3 Safety
Serious adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).
1  A summary of medical events related to the progression of liver disease and shifts 
in laboratory measurements will be provided.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
No sample size determination was conducted for this study.  The objective of the study is 
to characterize the persistence of amino acid variants in subjects enrolled in AbbVie DAA studies who experienced virologic failure, and the durability of response in subjects who achieved SVR.  Thus, the number of subjects enro lled in the current trial will be partially 
ABT-493, ABT-530
M13-576 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2015-000452-24
44
based on the number of subjects who experienced virologic failure in prior studies with 
AbbVie DAA therapies and subsequently agree to participate in the current trial.
The sample size is being increased under protocol Amendment 2 to allow for inclusion of 
a representative sample of subjects from additional studies as listed in Appendix D .

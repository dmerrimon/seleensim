 Page 3 of 122 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 6.0: RATIONALE  
Protocol BGB -3111_GA101_Study_001 has been updated:  
 To introduce the use of the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of “zanubrutinib” 
for “BGB -3111 .” 
 To add  the Sponsor ’s address  to the Protocol Title Page . 
 To change the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  
 To update the Sponsor Medical Monitor’s address on the Protocol Title Page . 
 To remove the protocol amendment rationales for previous protocol amendments to 
align with the current BeiGene protocol format  to show only the current protocol 
amendment rationale . 
 To update Section 1.2 (Overview of Clinical Pharmacology) with the results of a 
thorough QT study (BGB -3111 -106) that was recently completed in healthy 
volunteers and has shown that both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of 
zanubrutinib had no clini cally relevant effect on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters, 
including QTc intervals  and other ECG intervals . As a result, drug guidance and ECG  
monitoring for QT/QTc prolongat ion were  removed from the protocol  in Section 7.3 
(Medications to  be used with Caution), Section  8.4 (Electrocardiogram), and 
Section  16.5 (Appendix  5). 
 To update Section 1.2 (Overview of Clinical Pharmacology) with the results of a 
drug-drug interaction study ( BGB -3111 -104) that was recently completed in healthy 
volunt eers and showed that co -administration of zanubrutinib with a strong CYP3A 
inducer (rifampin ) decreased AUC 0-∞ of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold a nd 
co-administration of zanubrutinib with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole ) 
increased AUC 0-∞ of zanubrut inib by 3.8 -fold. As a result, Section 7.2 
(Prohibited/Restricted Medications) and Section 7.3 (Medications to be used with 
Caution)  were updated , and dose modification guidance for zanubruti nib when 
co-administered with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and ind ucers  was provided . 
 To update Section 1.2 (Overview of Clinical Pharmacol ogy) with the results of a 
drug-drug interaction study using a cocktail approach (BGB -3111 -108) that was 
recently completed in healthy volunteers and  showed that zanubrutinib does not  
significantly affect drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (warfarin) or transported by P -gp 
(digoxin) and BCRP (statins); however, z anubrutinib has a mild induction effect on 
CYP3A and CYP2C19 enzymes. Section 7.3 (Medications to be used with Caution) 
was updated  accordingly.  
 To update Section 1.5 (Benefit and Risk Conclusions for Zanubrutinib) with the number 
of patients treated with zanubutinib and add a reference to the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for more information.  
 To update  the zanubrutinib treatment duration so that treatment can continue until 
disease progression, intolerance, death, subject withdraws from the study, or study 
closure , whichever occurs first . 
 To change tumor imaging frequency after Week 48 from investigator’s discretion to 
every 24 weeks  to ensure consistent data are collected to assess response and 
progression in this study .

Page 4 of 122  To change the Week 52 assessment/visit to Week 48 in order to align the updated tumor 
imaging frequency  with the assessment/visit schedule. To also reduce the frequency  of 
visits after Week 48 of the  study  (from every 8 weeks [±7  days] to every 12 weeks 
[±10 days]) .  
 To update Section 8.5 (Computed Tomogr aphy) to allow more flexibility around the 
timing of CT scans  when a subj ect’s scan may fall outside the  specified imaging 
procedure window (eg, due to out -of-town travel or other unforeseen circumstances) .  
 To add a new Section 8.7 (Minimal Residual Disease for Subjects with CLL)  that 
outlines samples to be taken for minimal residual disease testing in subjects with 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ); all subsequent sections were renumbered.  The 
Study Assessments and Procedures Schedule for Part 1 (Table 1) and Part 2 (Table 2) 
were updated for this testing as well . 
 To clarify procedures for an optional post -progression biomarker assessment sample 
for all patients at the Safet y Follow -up Visit  (added in Protocol Amendment, 
Version  5.0) and to upda te the associated exploratory endpoint . 
 To update the Study Assessments and Procedures Schedule for Part 1 (Table 1) and 
Part 2 (Table 2) to clarify when response assessments are performed and how response 
is assessed.  
 To update the Study Assessments and Procedures Schedule for Part 1 (Table 1) and 
Part 2 (Table 2), as well as Appendices 16.1 and 16.2, to remove coagulation testing 
after screening , and to remove  selected hematology and clinical chemstry tests  that were 
deemed unnecessary  given the experie nce wi th zanubrutinib to date . In addition, the 
frequency of  hematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, immunoglobulins, and 
serum EPG laboratory assessments were reduced after Week 25.  
 To update the Study Assessments and Procedures Schedule for Part 1 (Table 1) and 
Part 2 (Table 2) , as well as Section 8.4 (Electrocardiograms), to remove ECGs after 
screening  (post-screening ECGs will be performed at the investigator’s discretion  if 
medically indicated ).  
 To add clarifications in Section 6.2.1 (Dosage and Administration, Zanubrutinib) 
regarding zanubrutinib dosing and reference to the patient diary and Pharmacy Manual.  
 To add language in Section 7.1 (Permitted Medications ) about the potential for  
opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), in patients 
with hematologic malignancies, particularly those having received prior 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure, and 
guidance  to consider  prophylaxis treatment per insti tutional standa rds. 
 To clarify in Section 7.2 (Prohibited/Restricted Medications) that limited duration doses 
≤20 mg of prednisone are allowed  for malignant indications , not just doses <20 mg . 
 To change the collection of adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
from 120 days after the last dose of obinutuzumab to 90 days after the last dose of 
obinutuzumab . 
 To revise text in Section 10 .9 (Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events) to update  
the serious adverse event  reporting process.  
 To clarify and reduce  redundancy in text regarding the analysis sets.  
 To delete text that is included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 To clarify that the hematological improvement analysis is for CLL  patients only.

Page 5 of 122  To clarify in Table 9  (Safety Laboratory Assessments) that bands are optional , and to 
remove selected  hematology and clinical chemstry tests that were deemed unnecessary  
given the experience with zanubrutinib to date . 
 To update and align language in Section 12 (Regulatory and  Ethical Issues) and 
Section  13 (Study Management) with current BeiGene p rotocols . 
 To update Section 14 (References) with new references added to the protocol.  
 To update the format of Section 15 (Protocol Signatures).  
 To clarify the  Categorical Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia Response Definition for 
“very good partial response” in Appendix 16.3. In addition, to align with other BeiGene 
protocols, the repeat IgM level for determining progressive disease in the case of a drug 
hold was c hanged from 6 weeks to 10 weeks after restarting study administration, and 
“≥ 25% increase in serum IgM ” was added for total increase from lowest nadir (to the 
already specified criterion of “at least 500mg/dL from lowest nadir”).  
 To incorporate  the follow ing updates to  the protocol per administrative memos that 
have been issued since Protocol Amendment Version 5.0: 
o Correction of typo (ie, d eletion of stray text ) in Appendix 16.3, Response 
Criteria, Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (including SLL; excluding WM)  
o Administrative change to Appendix 16.3 Guidelines for specific clinical or 
laboratory circums tances: Changed any reference of  “central ” laboratory  to 
“local ” laboratory  because a central laboratory is not used in this study  
o Clarification change made to foo tnote 2 under Tables 1 and 2 Study assessments 
and Procedures Schedule to remove the restriction to perform biopsy at relapse 
for selected si tes only, and this is now open to all sites and subjects  who consent 
to have this procedure done  
o Addition of clarifying text regarding tumor assessments after Week 48  
 
 To note the following changes that were implemented in Protocol Amendment 
Version  5.0 but were omitted in error in the “Protocol Amendment, Version 5.0: 
Rationale” section of the previous protocol  version : 
o To modify the adverse events and  serious adverse events reporting period in 
Section 10.5.1.

Methodology:  
This is a two part, open label Phase 1b clinical trial designed to determine the safety, tolerability and 
preliminary antitumor  activity of zanubrutinib  in combination with obinutuzumab : Part 1 (safety 
evaluation) and Part 2 (indication specific expansion cohorts).   
Part 1: Safety Evaluation  
Part 1 is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zanubrutinib  in combination with 
obinutuzumab in subjects with relapse d/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), R/R non -germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), R/R follicular lymphoma (FL), R/R mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), R/R 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM), and R/R margina l zone  lymphoma (MZL).  
Two dose regimen s of zanubrutinib , 320 mg once daily [QD]  and 160 mg twice daily [BID]  (added per 
Amendment Version 3.0 ), will be evaluated in combination with obinutuzumab , consistent with the 
U.S. label regimen  as specified below, in a cohort of 6 subjects  for each dose regimen . It is anticipated 
based on available data that both regimen s will be well tolerated. However , if there appear 2 or mo re 
dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in a 6 -subject cohort  in either regimen , the dose level is cons idered to 
have exceeded the MTD  and a reduced dose level of zanubrutinib  (160 mg QD  or 80 mg BID ) will be 
evaluated in combination with obinutuzumab in anothe r cohort of 6 subjects  in that regimen . Further 
reduction of the zanubrutinib  dose level will be allowed until a safe dose combination is identified. The 
period for DLT assessment is 29 days from first administration of zanubrutinib . In the event that a 
MTD is not exceeded, the Sponsor will select both 320 mg QD and 160 mg BID for the Part  2 of the 
study .  
Zanubrutinib  will be administered orally with or without food every day in each cycle (29 days for 
Cycle 1 , and 28 days for Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter ) until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity , other reason for treatment discontinuation , or study closure , whichever occurs 
first.  
Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously for up to 6 cycles consistent with the US label 
regimen:  
• Day 2 Cycle 1: 100 mg obinutuzumab,  
• Day 3 Cycle 1: 900 mg obinutuzumab,  
• Day 9 and Day 16 Cycle 1: 1000 mg obinutuzumab.  
• Day 1 Cycles 2 to 6: 1000 mg obinutuzumab.  
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) 
composed of the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s medical delegate, the coordinating investigator, up to 
2 additional  investigators, and the contract resea rch organization (CRO) medical monitor. The SMC 
composition and responsibilities will be further detailed in the SMC Charter. The SMC will be 
responsible for the determination of dose levels and regimens to be administered during the study.

Page 13 of 122 The Sponsor, in  consultation with investigators, may decide to explore alternative zanubrutinib  and/or 
obinutuzumab dosing regimens. If this decision is made, the protocol will be appropriately amended.  
Part 2: Indication Specific Expansion  
In Part 2, the RP2D and the 2 regimen s will be investigated in 5 expansion cohorts  (revised per 
Amendment Version 4.0) with histology type of tumor defined as below. Based on the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and antitumor activity data from the safety evaluation part (Part 1) 
of the study, additional cohorts may be enrolled:  
• Cohort 1: treatment -naïve CLL/S LL subjects (approximately 20 subjects  divided by the 
2 regimens ) 
• Cohort 2: R/R CLL/SLL subjects (approximately 20 subjects  divided by the 2 regimens ) 
• Cohort 3: R/R non-GCB  DLBCL, defined by Hans algorithm (approximately 20 subjects  
divided by the 2 regimens ) 
• Cohort 4: R/R FL, MCL, MZL, and WM (approximately of 20 subjects  divided by the 
2 regimens ) 
• Cohort 5 : R/R FL (approximately of 40 subjects  in 160 mg BID  regimen . Among them,  10-15 
should meet  double -refractory  criterion , defined as refractoriness to both rituximab and an 
alkylating agent, whether administered together or in successive treatment regimens. 
Refractoriness was defined per protocol as less than a partial response or progression of 
disease within 6 months after completion of a prior therapy , added per Amendment Version 
4.0).   
In Part 2 , once the SMC confirms that the 6 subjects in 160 mg BID regimen passed Part 1 DLT test, all 
new eligible subjects will be enrolled into 160 mg BID  regimen in each of the 5 cohorts until the  total 
number of that cohort reaches the pre -specified number (revised per Amendment Version 4.0).  
Subjects enrolled in zanubrutinib  320 mg QD dose regimen will have the option to switch to 160 mg 
BID once Amendment 4.0 is active.  
Zanubrutinib will be administered orally with or without food every day in each cycle (28 days for each 
cycle ) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, other reason for treatment 
discontinuation , or study closure , whichever occurs first.  
Obinutuzumab w ill be administered intravenously for up to 6 cycles consistent with the US label 
regimen:  
• Day 1 Cycle 1: 100 mg obinutuzumab,  
• Day 2 Cycle 1: 900 mg obinutuzumab,  
• Day 8 and Day 1 5 Cycle 1: 1000 mg obinutuzumab.  
• Day 1 Cycles 2 to 6: 1000 mg obinutuzumab.  
The safety evaluation by the SMC will be performed on as needed basis (see the SMC Charter) but at a 
minimum  of every 6 months  to review  all subjects enrolled, or when there is any significant safety 
finding . Any treatment -related death will also trigger review by the SMC. The SMC will determine 
whether it is safe to proceed with the study.    
If the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 toxicities or other unacceptable chronic toxicities in the indication 
expansion cohorts suggests that the MTD of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab has been 
exceeded at that dose level, any remaining accrual at that dose level will be halted. Consideration will 
then be given to enrolling an expansion cohort at a lower dose level or at a different schedule. The 
protocol will be appropriately amended.

Page 22 of 122 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.1 Background and Pharmacology  
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a member of the tyrosine  kinase expressed in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family kinases, is a critical component of the B-cell 
receptor (BCR) signalling cascade. Inhibition of BTK has emerged as a promising 
strategy for targeting B-cell malignancies. Ibrutinib has demonstrated  promising 
anti-tumor activity in several B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM), 
follicular lymphoma (FL), multiple myeloma (MM), and activated B-cell like (ABC) 
subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).1,2,3,4 It was recently approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of subjects with MCL and CLL who 
had received at least one prior therapy , and subjects with WM and CLL with 17p deletion 
at any line .  
While ibrutinib treatment frequently generates objective responses in these diseases , few 
of them are complete responses, thus management requires continuous treatment.5,6 In 
addition, though ibrutinib is well -tolerated in comparison to traditional chemotherapies, it 
is associated with adverse reactions that in some cases can be life -threatening or 
treatment -limiting. These adverse reactions, including but not limited to skin rash, nausea, 
vomiting, thrombocytopenia, bleeding and atrial fibrillation, are believed to be related to 
ibrutinib’s off -target activities against epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)/janus 
kinase 3 (JAK3)/TEC.  
Thus there is a clear medical need for a more potent, more specific, and better -tolerated 
secondary generation BTK inhibitor.  
Zanubruti nib (also known as BGB -3111 ) is a potent, specific and irreversible BTK 
inhibitor with a favorable pharmacology/toxicology profile. Preclinical data suggests that 
zanubrutinib is differentiated from ibrutinib in the following aspects:  
1. Zanubrutinib is mo re selective than ibrutinib in the inhibition of BTK versus 
epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), Gardner -Rasheed feline sarcoma viral 
(v-fgr) oncogene homolog (FGR), Fyn -related kinase (tyrosine protein kinase 5) 
(FRK), human epidermal growth factor r eceptor (HER)2, HER4, interleukin -2-
inducible T cell kinase (ITK), JAK3, lymphocyte -specific protein tyrosine kinase 
(LCK), and TEC. The predicted efficacious dose of zanubrutinib in subjects is 
much lower than ibrutinib. Accordingly, off -target kinase inhibition potentially 
associated with common, and occasionally severe, adverse effects seen with 
ibrutinib therapy, such as thrombocytopenia, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, rash, and  
gastrointestinal toxicities may be reduced relative to ibrutinib.

Page 23 of 122 2. Zanubrutinib  has better oral bioavailability than ibrutinib .   
3. Due to its weaker ITK inhibitory activity, zanubrutinib  displayed significantly less 
inhibitory effect on rituximab -induced antibody dependent cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) than ibrutinib7,8 in preclinical studies and is therefore 
unlikely to adversely impact the anti -tumor effects of agents such as 
obinutuzumab.  
In vivo studies demonstrated that zanubrutinib  had dose dependent anti -tumor activity 
against R ec-1 MCL xenografts engrafted either subcutaneously or systemically in mice. 
Zanubrutinib  was significantly more effective than ibrutinib in bot h models. In 
pharmacokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic  (PD) studies, oral administration of 
zanubrutinib  resulted in time dependent occupancy of BTK in both blood and spleen of 
mice.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on the 
background of zanubrutinib .9 
1.2 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology  
In the Phase  1, first -in-human  trial of zanubrutinib  as monotherapy (A Phase 1, 
open-label, multiple -dose, dose escalation and expansion study to investigate the safety 
and pharmacokinetics of the BTK inhibitor zanubrutinib  in subjects with B -cell lymphoid 
malignancies; protocol number BGB -3111 -AU-003)10, interim PK data in a limited 
number of subjects showed that zanubrutinib  is rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral 
administration. The maximum plasma  concentration and t he drug exposure (area under 
the concentration -time curve [AUC]) increased in a n early dose -proportional manner  
from 40 mg to 320 mg both after the single dose and at steady state . The terminal  half-life 
(t1/2) ranged from 1.8 hours to 3.7  hours. At 320  mg once daily (QD) and 160  mg twice 
daily (BID), the means for maximum observed pla sma concentration (C max) and the area 
under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h) are around 646 ng/mL 
and 2,704  ng/mL*h , and  282 ng/mL and 3,006  ng/mL*h , respectively , at the steady state .  
In the same Phase 1 trial , the pharmacodynam ic activity  of zanubrutinib  as measured by 
BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was determined in a 
limited number of subjects. The data indicates that even at the starting dose (40 mg), 
zanubrutinib  achieved rapid, durable, and near complete inhibition of BTK, which is 
comparable to the reported effect of ibrutinib at 560 mg  in clinic4. These data suggest that 
zanubrutinib  is a very potent BTK inhibitor.  
The QT interval prolongation potential of zanubrutinib was evaluated in healthy subjects 
in a tho rough QT study (BGB -3111 -106). Results from this study demonstrated that 
single oral doses of zanubrutinib at a th erapeutic dose of 160 mg and a supratherapeutic 
dose of 480 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters, including

Page 24 of 122 QTc intervals and other ECG intervals. Because of the short half -life and no accumulation 
seen upon multiple -dosing, these  results are also applicable for steady -state conditions . 
Results from a dedicated drug -drug int eraction study (BGB -3111 -104) indicate that 
co-administration of zanubrutinib with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampin (600 mg 
every day for 8  days) decreased exposure of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 
12.6-fold for C max, in healthy subjects.  Co -administration of zanubrutinib with the strong 
CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg every day for 4 days) increased exposure of 
zanubrutinib  by 3.8 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 2.6 -fold for C max.  These results are consistent 
with the role for CYP3A isoenzymes as the principal metabolic pathway for zanubrutinib . 
Based on the in vitro study, a clinical drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -108) was 
conducted to assess the effect of zanubrutinib on the PK of substrates of CYP3A 
(midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), P -gp (digoxin), BCRP 
(rosuvastatin) using a cocktail approach.  The results show that zanubrutinib does not 
significantly aff ect drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (warfarin) or transported by P -gp 
(digoxin) and BCRP (statins).   Zanubrutinib has a mild induction effect on CYP3A and 
CYP2C19 enzymes.  AUC 0-t and C max values were approximately 47% and 30% lower, 
respectively, when midazo lam was coadministered with zanubrutinib.  AUC 0-t and C max 
values were approximately 36% and 20% lower, respectively, when omeprazole was 
coadministered with zanubrutinib . 
1.3 Overview of Efficacy  
As of 3 0 July 2015, the preliminary results from the Phase 1 tr ial of zanubrutinib  
demonstrates promising anti -tumor activity in subjects with B -cell malignancies, 
including CLL, WM, MCL, hairy cell leukemia (HCL) , DLBCL, MZL,  and FL. Among 
the twenty -five ( 25) subjects enrolled in the dose -escalation phase of the study , the best 
response s are: one (1) subject with MCL achieved complete response/remission (CR); 
fifteen (15) subjects achieved partial responses/remission (PR), including six (6) subjects 
with CLL, five ( 5) subjects with WM, three (3) subjects with MCL , and one (1) subject 
with HCL ; six (6)  subjects achieved stable disease (SD), including two ( 2) subjects with 
CLL, one ( 1) subject with MCL, one (1)  subject with MZL, one (1) subject with DLBCL, 
and one (1)  subject with FL. Three (3) subjects, including on e (1) subject with WM, one 
(1) subject with MCL, and one (1)  subject with DLBCL, presented with progressive 
disease.  
1.4 Overview of Safety of Zanubrutinib  
Zanubrutinib  has also demonstrated a favorable toxicology and safety pharmacology 
profile in non -clinical experiments compared to ibrutinib in terms of the overall tolerance 
and severe toxicities in single and repeat dose toxicity studies.

Page 25 of 122 The preliminary results from  the ongoing first-in-human Phase 1 trial demonstrates that 
zanubrutinib  is well tolerated in subjects with advanced B -cell malignancies. As of 3 0 
July 2015, except for 4 subjects who had disease progression, all the other 21 subjects 
enrolled in the dose-escalation part  of the zanubrutinib  study have received zanubrutinib  
treatment for more than 100 days. No dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were encountered, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. There were no drug -related 
SAEs, AEs leading to  drug discontinuation, or AE -related deaths. Of 21 >grade 3 AEs, 3 
were assessed by investigators as potentially drug -related - all were self -limiting 
neutropenia in CLL subjects , two of whom had neutropenia at baseline. No G3/4 bleeding 
events were record ed. Four subjects had a baseline history of atrial fibrillation/flutter 
(AF); no exacerbation or new event of AF was reported. All subjects have received 
regular  electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and none has demonstrated  any clinically 
significant cardio -electric change s such as QTc prolongation.  
1.5 Benefit and Risk Conclusions for Zanubrutinib  
Zanubrutinib  has demonstrated a very favorable toxicology and safety pharmacology 
profile in the ongoing Phase 1 study. The dose escalation portion of the study has been 
completed. Preliminary data from the current Phase 1 study showed that zanubrutinib  has 
been well t olerated and has demonstrated promising anti -tumor activity in advanced 
B-cell malignancies, including CLL, MCL, WM, HCL, DLBCL, FL, and MZL. The study 
is currently ongoing to further evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of zanubrutinib .  
Zanubrutinib  is an investigational drug with safety data in more than 600 patients  as of 
15 September  2017 . Refer to the IB for more detailed information. Subjects  enrolled in 
clinical studies with zanubrutinib  must be closely monitored by means of AEs, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory safety tests of blood and urine.  
1.6 Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab  (Gazyva®)11,12 is a recombinant monoclonal humani zed and 
glycoengineered Type  II anti -CD20 antibody of the IgG1 isotype. It specifically targets 
the extracellular loop of the CD20 transmembrane antigen on the  surface of 
non-malignant and malignant pre -B and mature B -lymphocytes, but not on hematopoietic 
stem cells, pro -B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. Glycoengineering of 
the Fc part of obinutuzumab results in higher affinity for Fc ɣRIII rec eptors on immune 
effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes as compared 
to non -glycoengineered antibodies. Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil has 
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Austr alia Therapeutic 
Goods Administration (TGA) to treat patients with previously untreated CLL. 
Obinutuzumab  in combination with bendamustine followed by GAZYVA monotherapy, 
is indicated for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who relapsed

details.  
1.7 Rationale for the Combination of Zanubrutinib  and 
Obinutuzumab  
As noted above, signaling via the aberrantly activated B -cell receptor (BCR) has a critical 
role in the pathogenesis of B -cell tumors by promoting survival and clonal expansion of 
malignant B-cells. Ibrutinib, a FDA -approved BTK inhibitor, h as demonstrated objective 
responses among different B -cell malignancies in clinical trials, including CLL/SLL, 
MCL, DLBCL, FL and WM. Zanubrutinib , differentiated from ibrutinib, is a more potent, 
more specific second -generation BTK inhibitor. An ongoing  Phase 1 trial 
(BGB -3111 -AU-003) has shown zanubrutinib  to be very well tolerated, safe and active in 
B-cell malignancies of various histologies.  
Anti-CD20 antibodies are widely used in treating B -cell malignancies and their 
anti-tumor activities are largel y dependent on ADCC effect. Ibrutinib was tested in 
combination with rituximab, an anti -CD20 antibody, in a Phase 2 trial of CLL.8,13 After a 
follow -up of 6 months, the overall response rate (ORR) was 83% with a large and rapid 
reduction in lymph -node and spleen sizes. 13 However, most of the responses were partial 
responses (PR s). A recent pre-clinical study also showed that ibrutinib could antagonize 
rituximab induced ADCC by inhibiting ITK.14 Since zanubrutinib  is more selective than 
ibrutinib against off -target kinases including ITK, zanubrutinib  did not show any 
interfere nce with the ADCC effect  induced by anti-CD20 antibodies in the pre -clinical  
studies. In addition, zanubrutinib  has demonstrated good combination activity with 
rituximab or obinutuzumab in preclinical xenograft models.  
Obinutuzumab is a humanized anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody which demonstrated 
clinical superiority compared with rituximab in a recent Phase 3 study. This is a type II 
glycoengineered monoclonal antibody, with an enhanced ADCC  and direct -cell killing 
activity,  but without  complement -dependent cytotoxicity . Obinutuzumab alone or in 
combination with other chemo -therapy drugs , as well as with other BTK inhibitors, ie, 
ibrutinib and ACP -196, are being evaluated in different B -cell malignancies.  
Based upon these background data and the promising results from the combination of 
ibrutinib and rituximab, this combination study offers a path to evaluation of the promise 
of an improved therapy for these subjects.  
This trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile as well as 
preliminary evidence of the anti -tumor activity of zanubrutinib  in combination with 
obinutuzumab in subjects with B -cell malignancies.  The starting doses and regimens of 
zanubrutinib , 160 mg BID and 320 mg QD , are the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D s) 
for monotherapy that have been determined  based on  the PK, safety and tolerability , PD

Page 27 of 122 and preliminary efficacy  in the ongoing zanubrutinib  trial (BGB -3111 -AU-003). The dose 
and regimen of obinutuzumab was selected based on the US label  to treat patients with 
untreated CLL . The Phase 1/2 experiences with ibrutinib in combination with other anti -
CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab and ofatumumab, has shown  that the combinations 
are active, lack overlapping toxicity, and can be combined at full monotherapy doses of 
the respective agents.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines, the Declaration of H elsinki and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
1.8 Rationale to Change Zanubrutinib  Dose  from 320 mg QD to 
160 mg BID (a dded per Amendment 4.0)   
Before Amendment 3.0, zanubrutinib  was administrated 320 mg QD. Starting from 
Amendment 3.0, zanubrutinib  will be administrated 160 mg BID for new subjects enrolled. 
The change is based on lymph node (LN) BTK occupancy findings in study 
BGB -3111 -AU-003. Thirty subjects from the study were evaluated for BTK occupancy in 
LN tissue using a fluorescent probe assay o n paired lymph node biopsies . Median 
occupancy was 100% in subjects receiving zanubrutinib  160 mg BID (n=18) vs 94% in 
subjects receiving zanubrutinib  320 mg QD (n=12) (p=0.002, Wilcoxon). The proportion 
of subjects with > 90% BTK occupancy was 94% (160 mg B ID) vs 58% (320 mg QD) 
(p=0.027, Fisher’s exact). Occupancy did not appear to differ amongst histologic subtype. 
BTK occupancy in LN tissue by dose/schedule is shown in the following Figure 1.

Subjects enrolled in zanubrutinib  320 mg QD dose regimen will have the option to switch 
to 160 mg BID once Amendment 4.0 is active.  
 
1.9 Rationale to Remove Food Restriction for  Zanubrutinib  
(added per Amendment 4 .0) 
Before Amendment 4.0, food was restricted 2 hours before and 1 hour after zanubrutinib  
administration . Starting from Amendment 4.0, this food restriction will be removed for all 
subjects. T his is based on the preliminary result from a dedicated food -effect study, 
BGB -3111 -103, which indicated that zanubrutinib  plasma exposure was not affected by a  
high-fat breakfast  and was increased by 37% and 56% for AUC and C max, respectively , by 
a standa rd breakfast, as compared to fasting. Since the increase fall within the variability 
of zanubrutinib  clearance (approximately 50% coefficient of variation) and that a wide 
therapeutic index was observed on zanubrutinib , it is recommended that all food restriction 
on zanubrutinib  administration be removed from this trial, and subjects may take 
zanubrutinib  with or without food.

4.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a two -part, open -label Phase 1b clinical trial designed to determine the safety, 
tolerability , and clinical activity of zanubrutinib  in combination with obinutuzumab : Part 
1 (safety evaluation) and Part 2 (indication specific expansion cohorts).   
Part 1: Safety Evaluation   
Part 1 is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zanubrutinib  in combination 
with obinutuzumab in subjects with R/R CLL/SLL, R/R non -GCB DLBCL, R/R FL, R/R 
MCL, R/R WM, and R/R MZL.  
Two dose regimen s of zanubrutinib  (320 mg QD  and 160 mg BID  [added per 
Amendment Version 3.0] ) will be evaluated in combination with obinutuzumab 
consistent with  the US label  regimen  (as specified below), in a cohort of 6 subjects  for 
each dose regimen . If there appear 2 or more DLTs in a 6 -subject cohort  in either 
regimen, the dose level is considered to have exceeded the MTD; and a reduced dose 
level of zanubrutinib  (160 mg QD  or 80 mg B ID) will be evaluated in combination with 
obinutuzumab in another cohort of 6 subjects  in that regimen . Further reduction of 
zanubrutinib  dose level will be allowed until a safe dose combination is identified. The 
period for DLT assessment is 29 days from first administration of zanubrutinib . In the 
event that a MTD is not exceeded, the Sponsor will select both 320 mg QD and 160 mg 
BID for the Part  2 of the study.  
Zanubrutinib  will be administered orally with or without food every day in each cycle 
(29 days for Cycle 1 , and 28  days for Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter ) until disease 
progression, death, unacceptable toxicity , other reason for treatment discontinuation, or 
study closure , whichever occurs first.  
Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously for up to 6 cycles consistent with the 
U.S. label regimen:  
• Day 2 Cycle 1: 100 mg obi nutuzumab  
• Day 3 Cycle 1: 900 mg obinutuzumab  
• Day 9 and Day 1 6 Cycle 1: 1000 mg obinutuzumab  
• Day 1 Cycl es 2 to 6: 100 0 mg obinutuzumab  
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by a Safety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) composed of the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s medical delegate, the coordinating 
investigator, and up to two (2) additional  investigators, and the contract  research 
organization (CRO) medical monitor. The SMC composition and responsibilities will be

Page 33 of 122 further detailed in the SMC Charter. The SMC will be responsible for the determination 
of dose levels and regimens to be administered during the study.  
The Spons or, in consultation with investigators, may decide to explore alternative 
zanubrutinib  and/or obinutuzumab dosing regimens.  If this decision is made, the protocol 
will be appropriately amended.  
Part 2: Indication Specific Expansion Cohorts  
In Part 2, the RP2D and the 2 regimen s will be investigated in 5 expansion cohorts  
(revised  per Amendment Version 4.0) with histology type of tumor defined as below. 
Based on the safety, tolerability, PK, and antitumor activity data from the safety 
evaluat ion part (Part 1) of the study, additional cohorts may be enrolled:  
• Cohort 1: treatment -naïve CLL/SLL subjects (approximately 20 subjects  divided 
by the 2 reg imens) 
• Cohort 2: R/R CLL/SLL subjects (approximately 20 subjects  divided by the 
2 regimens) 
• Cohort 3: R/R non-GCB  DLBCL, defined by Hans algorithm (approximately 
20 subjects  divided  by the 2 reg imens)  
• Cohort 4: R/R FL, MCL, MZL, and WM (approximately of 20 subjects  divided  by 
the 2 reg imens) 
• Cohort 5: R/R FL (approximately of 40 subjects  in 160  mg BID. About 10-15 of 
them should meet  double -refractory  criterion , defined as refractoriness to both 
rituximab and an alkylating agent, whether administered together or in successive 
treatment regimens. Refractoriness was defined per protocol as less than a partial 
response or progression of disease within 6 months after completion of a prior 
therapy , added per Amendment Version 4.0).   
In Part 2, once the SMC confirms that the 6 subjects in 160 mg BID regimen passed 
Part 1 DLT test, all new eligible subjects will be enrolled into 160 mg BID regimen in 
each of the 5 cohorts until the total number of that cohort reaches the pre -specified 
number  (revised per Amendment Version 4.0).  
Subjects enrolled in zanubrutinib  320 mg QD  dose regimen will have the option to switch 
to 160 mg BID once Amendment 4.0 is active.  
Zanubrutinib  will be administered orally with or without food every day in each cycle 
(28 days for each cycle ) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity , other 
reason for treatment discontinuation, or study closure , whichever occurs first.  
Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously for up to 6 cycles consistent with the 
U.S. label regimen:

• Day 8 and Day 15 Cycle 1: 1000 mg obinutuzumab  
• Day 1 Cycl es 2 to 6: 1000 mg obinutuzumab  
The safety evaluation by the SMC will be performed on as needed basis (see the SMC 
Charter)  but at a minimum  of every 6 months  to review  all subjects enrolled, or when 
there is any significant safety finding . Any treatment -related death will also trigger 
review by the SMC. The SMC will determine whether it is safe to proceed with the study.   
If the frequency of Grade  3 or 4 toxicities or other unacceptable chronic toxicities in the 
indication expansion cohorts suggests that the MTD of zanubrutinib  in combination with 
obinutuzumab has been exceeded at that dose level, any remaining accrual at t hat dose 
level will be halted. Consideration will then be given to enrolling an expansion cohort at a 
lower dose level or at a different schedule. The protocol will be appropriately amended.  
4.2 Safety Evaluation  
Two dose regimen s of zanubrutinib  will be evaluated , 320 mg QD  and 160 mg BID . The 
plan is to dose 6 subjects  in each of the 2 dose regimen s with the plan modified as 
necessary by DLT experience.  The DLT assessment period is defined as  29 days from 
the first administration of zanubrutinib . If 2 or more of the subjects in either of the 
6-subject cohort s develop a DLT during the DLT assessment period, the MTD is 
considered to have been exceeded and no further subjects will be treated in that dose 
regimen.  
In the event that a MTD is not exceeded, the Sponsor will select both 320 mg QD and 
160 mg BID for the P art 2 of the study.  
If the starting regimen (320 mg QD or 160 mg BID of zanubrutinib  in combination with 
obinutuzumab) is not tolerated, 160 mg QD or 80 mg BID of zanubrutinib  in combination 
with obinutuzumab may be tested (as determined by the SMC and the Sponsor) to define 
a potential RP2D. The period for DLT assessment is 29 days from the first administration 
of zanubrutinib . 
Depending on the decisi on of the SMC and on review of available data, an additional 
intermediate dose level may be explored prior to a final decision on a RP2D . 
4.2.1  Safety Monitoring Committee  
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by a SMC composed of the Sponsor, 
the Sponsor’s medical delegate, the coordinating investigator, up to two (2) additional 
investigators, and the CRO medical monitor. The SMC composition and responsibilitie s 
will be further detailed in the SMC Charter. Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed

SMC will be responsible for the determination of dose levels and regimens t o be 
administered during the study.  
4.2.2  Dose Limiting Toxicity  
For Part 1 subjects only. The period for DLT assessment is 2 9 days from first 
administration of zanubrutinib . 
All toxicities or AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 .18 Subjects 
who initiate treatment with an ANC <1000/μl will not be considered evaluable for 
neutrophil toxicity as outlined in the 2008 IWCLL guidelines .15 
Dose limiting toxicities  are defined as a toxicity or AE occurring during the DLT 
assessment period (first 29 days of treatment), which is not cl early attributable to a cause 
other than zanubrutinib  and/or obinutuzumab (such as disease progression, underlying 
illness, concurrent illness or concomitant medication) and meets one of the following 
criteria:  
• Grade 3 or 4 drug -related non -hematologic toxicity (exclu ding Grade 3 nausea , 
vomiting , hypertension , and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities ).  
• Grade 4 drug -related hematologic t oxicity persisting for >14 days.  
•  Any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator or Sponsor requires 
removal of the subject from the study.  
Resumption of zanubrutinib  and obinutuzumab administration for subjects experiencing 
DLTs is permitted, if clinically appropriate and after discussion with the Sponsor medical 
monitor, contingent on the retur n of the DLT to ≤  Grade 1 severity within 14 days and 
interruption or delay of treatment for no more than 21 days. Resumption of treatment 
after resolution of a DLT will be at the 50% decreased dose level of zanubrutinib . The 
administration of obinutuzumab  will be resumed at the same dose according to the 
original schedule . 
If a subject could only receive 75% of the expected dose of either component of the 
combination for reasons other than treatment related toxicity, then an additional subject 
will be enro lled in the cohort.   
4.2.3  Dose Continuation and Dose Reduction  
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor , the CRO medical 
monitor, the investigators and the SMC (see Section 4.2.1  above). At the conclusion of 
the dose regimen safety evaluation part (Part 1), the SMC will determine the RP2D  to be 
further investigated.

Page 36 of 122 In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease pro gression, or subject withdrawal, 
subjects may continue with daily administrations of zanubrutinib  at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Subjects with disease progression may continue study drug treatment if they 
are benefit ting from the treatment in the judgment  of the investigators  and approved by 
Sponsor medical monitor . 
In the event of a DLT, treatment with both investigational drugs will be stopped and 
supportive therapy administered as required. If the toxicity resolves or subsides to 
Grade  0 or Grade 1 (or baseline) within 14 days of the onset of the DLT and the subjec t is 
showing clinical benefit in the investigator’s opinion, treatment of zanubrutinib  may be 
restarted at the 50% decreased  dose level (at the investigator’s discretion after discussions 
with the Sponsor’s medical monitor). The administration of obinutuzu mab will be 
resumed at the same dose according to the original schedule.  
If the toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0 or Grade 1 (or baseline) within 14 days of 
onset, the subject must be withdrawn from further investigational drug treatment. Any 
exception to this must be agreed upon by the investigator and the Sponsor’s medical  
monitor.  
4.2.4  Dose Interruption and Modification   
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the Sponsor, the CRO medical 
monitor, the coordinating investigator, and investigators.  W hen at least 6 or more 
subjects have been treated with zanubrutinib  in an expansion cohort  and ≥ 33% of the 
treated subjects experience a DLT during the first cycle, study accrual will be held 
pending data review by the SMC.  
Dosing of zanubrutinib  will be held for individual subjects under any of the following  
conditions:  
 Grade 4  neutropenia related to zanubrutinib  lasting > 7 days or Grade ≥ 3 febrile  
neutropenia  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  related to zanubrutinib  lasting > 7 days or Grade ≥ 3 
thrombocytopenia associated with Grade ≥ 2 bleeding   
 Any Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity related to zanubrutinib  except for 
asymptomatic laboratory  abnormalities  
After the subject’s toxicity improved to Grade ≤ 1 or to baseline values within 14 days, 
the investigator may elect to have the subject restart the treatment.  If the subject’s toxicity 
improves to Grade 1 or baseline within 15 to 28 days of study drug discontinuation and if, 
in the investigator’s opinion, it is in the subject’s best interest to restart treatment after 
more than 14 days, then a written approval must be obtained from the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor.  
The causality of the toxicity should be assessed by the investigator.

Page 37 of 122 If, in the investigator’s opinion, the toxicity is unrelated to zanubrutinib , the subject may 
be restarted at the preceding dose, zanubrutinib  320 mg QD  or 160 mg BID . However, if 
the toxicity recurs, the dose must be reduced to 160 mg QD  or 80 mg BID (revised per 
Amendment Version 3.0 ). If in the investigator’s opinion, the toxicity is related to 
zanubrutinib , the subject may restar t therapy at a reduced dose of 160 mg QD  or 80 mg 
BID (revised per Amendment Version 3.0) . A second dose reduction to 80 mg QD  for both 
regimen s (revised per Amendment Version 3.0) , based on the criteria outlined above, may 
be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Any subjects, who do 
not tolerate 80 mg QD  (revised per Amendment Version 3.0) , must be removed from the 
study.  
If, in the investigator’s opinion, the toxicity is related to ob inutuzmab,  ob inutuzmab may 
be interrupted or discontinued. There will be no dose modification for ob inutuzmab.  
If a non -disease related surgery  is requir ed during the study , zanubrutinib  should be 
interrupted 3 days before and 7  days after the su rgery.  Obinutuzmab shoul d also be 
interrupted , if applicable.

Assessments scheduled on study drug administration days should be performed predose, unless otherwise specified.  
1. Perform within 28 days prior to Day 1. Assessments performed as standard of care may be used for screening.  
2. Perform 28 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib  (± 7 days). Subjects  who have disease relapse at any time will be asked to undergo biopsies of representative 
tumour sites and/or blood collection to obtain samples for studying mechanisms of resistance (see Section 8.14.1 ).  
3. Subjects who discontinue study drug due to reasons other than disease progression will remain on study and be followed every 3 month s until subject exhibits first 
progression , withdraws consent, starts new anti-cancer therapy, death or study closure, whichever occurs first. Once subjects progress or start use of alternative anti -
cancer therapy,  subjects will not return to the study center  but will be contacted every 3 months by telephone, to assess survival until death , withdrawal of consent or 
study closure, whichever occurs first  (see Section 8.10.2 ). 
4. Windows: days allowed for reschedule of an entire visit due to  logistic reasons (eg, public holidays). In all cases elements relating to medical assessment s may be 
performed 48 hours prior to the scheduled day. These are: B symptoms, physical examination, ECOG, concomitant medications, AE, hematology,  clinical chemis try, 
coagulation, pregnancy test and urinalysis.  
5. Written informed consent form(s) must be signed by the subject before any study specific procedures are performed.  
6. Unexplained weight loss >10% over previous 6 months, fever (>38°C), and/or drenching  night sweats.  
7. Complete physical examination includes all systems described in the body of the protocol. Targeted physical exams should be l imited to systems of clinical 
relevance (ie, cardiovascular, respiratory, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen), and t hose systems associated with clinical signs/symptoms.  
8. Perform a single 12 -lead ECG. Subjects should be in the semi -recumbent or supine position. Additional ECGs will be performed at the discretion of the investigator  
if medically indicated .  
9. Administer one dose of zanubrutinib  in the study center , review and dispense diary.

11. A bone marrow examination must be performed at screening for all participants and within 7 da ys of the end of week 12  for subjects with baseline marrow disease . 
In those subjects who had evidence of bone marrow disease at the time of enrollment , upon achieving a possible CR (eg, physical examination or CT /MRI  scan 
indicating a possible CR), a bone  marrow aspirate and biopsy will be obtained to confirm the CR. Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with flow 
cytometry assessment(s) for minimal residual disease should be done at least 3 months after the last dose if there is evidenc e of CR in all of the response parameters

dehydrogenase , alkaline phosphatase and uric acid. In the event of ≥  Grade 3 clinical chemistry toxicity, these assessments will be conducted as frequent ly as the 
physician feels needed until toxicity resolves to ≤  Grade 2.   
15. Serum EPG on first  test for WM subjects  only, and if a paraprotein is present, repeated on all subsequent immunoglobulin assessments. IgA, IgG and IgM tests 
should be performed for all subjects at screening and only for those with significant  abnormal findings at subs equent  visits.  
16. All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at scree ning. Urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed at specified subsequent visits. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  
17. Viral serology  include hepatitis B (HBsAg and total hepatitis B  core antibody [anti HBc] as well as HBV DNA by PCR if the subject is HBcAb positive), HCV 
antibody (as well as HCV RNA by PCR if the subject is HCV antibody positive), and HIV1/2 antibodies .  
18. Collect urine dipstick, as well as urine microscopy if dips tick is abnormal. If urine protein is ≥2+ by dipstick, a 24 hour urine for total protein and a random urine for 
total protein and creatinine will be obtained and evaluated (see Section 8.2). 
19. Subjects with CLL should have a blood sample sent at screening for interphase FISH for chromosomal abnormalities including 17p, 11q, 13q, and +12. Other 
analysis, including IgVH and P53 mutational status , is optional.

Page 43 of 122 20. Subjects with non -GCB DLBCL must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for confirmation of the DLBCL subtype and for explorato ry biomarker 
analysis . 
21. Serial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodyamic blood samples will be collec ted at the time points specified in  Table 3. 
22. PK blood samples will be collected only on Day 1 of Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and Cycle 6.  
23. Subjects (except CLL) who have disease relapse at any time will be asked to undergo biopsies o f representative tumor sites (bone marrow  will be collected for WM 
patients). These procedures are optional . 
24. Subjects who have disease relapse at any time will be asked to undergo blood collection to obtain samples for studying mechan isms of resistance. Thi s procedure is 
optional . 
25. Response should be assessed against baseline per disease relevant instructions in Appendix 16.3. Physical exam should be used at any time points where  
imaging is not required, but physical exam revealing disease progression or potential progression may require confirmation vi a imaging. Visits that contain  
components sufficient to determine a change in ove rall response in the patient (ie,  unscheduled CT scans and labs, IgM -based change response between  
scheduled efficacy assessments for WM patients) should complete an overall efficacy res ponse assessment as needed . 
26. For Weeks 25 through 48, hematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, immunoglobulins , and serum EPG  assessments will  be conducted  every 12 weeks. After 
Week 48, hematology and  clinical chemistry  assessments and urine analysis, will continue ever y 12 weeks ; however , immunoglobulins  and serum EPG  assessments 
will be conducted every 24  weeks  until disease progression . 
27. Samples will be taken from subjects with CLL to assess MRD at the following time points:  
• Peripheral blood sample at Cycle 18, or at the earliest opportunity after Cycle 18, in all CLL subjects on study; a bone marr ow sample is requested if the peripheral 
blood sample is MRD negative  
• Peripheral blood sample at the time of newly attained CR,  and at each CR assessed timepoint thereafter, for continuing CLL subjects; a bone marrow sample is 
requested if the peripheral blood sample is MRD negative

Page 47 of 122 1. Perform within 28 days prior to Day 1. Assessments perfo rmed as standard of care may be used for screening.  
2. Perform within 28 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib  (± 7 days). Subject s who have disease relapse at any time will be a sked to undergo biopsies of 
representative tumour sites and/or blood collection to obtain samples for studying mechanisms of resistance (see Section 8.14.1 ).  
3. Subjects who discontinue study drug due to reasons other than disease progression will remain on study and be followed every 3 month s until subject exhibits first 
progression, withdraws consent, starts new anti -cancer therapy, death or study closure, whichever occurs first. Once subjects progress or start use of  alternative anti -
cancer therapy, subjects will not return to the study center but will be contacted every 3 months by telephone, to assess sur vival until death , withdrawal of consent or 
study closure, whichever occurs first  (see Section 8.10.2 ). 
4. Windows: days allowed for reschedule of an entire visit due to logistic reasons (eg, public holidays). In all cases elements relating to medical assessments may be 
performed 48 hours pri or to the scheduled day. These are: B symptoms, physical examination, ECOG, concomitant medications, AE, hematology, clinical  chemistry, 
coagulation, pregnancy test and urinalysis.  
5. Written informed consent form(s) must be signed by the subject before a ny study specific procedures are performed.  
6. Unexplained weight loss >10% over previous 6 months, fever (>38°C), and/or drenching night sweats.  
7. Complete physical examination includes all systems described in the body of the protocol. Targeted physic al exams should be limited to systems of clinical 
relevance (ie, cardiovascular, respiratory, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen), and those systems associated with clinical signs /symptoms.  
8. Perform a single 12 -lead ECG at screening. Subjects should be in t he semi -recumbent or supine position. Additional ECGs will be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator  if medically indicated .  
9. Administer one dose of zanubrutinib  in the study center, review and dispense diary.   
10. Tumor assessments must be performed within 7 days of the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 , every 24 weeks after Week 48, and at disease progression. Computed 
tomography scans must encompass neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis and use intravenous contrast  or follow investigators’ decision . A CT scan of diagnostic quality 
performed as part of positron emission tomography (PET)/ CT is acceptable, provided bidimensional nodal and liver/spleen measurements can be made. MRI may be 
used in place of CT, at investigator discretion. If the subject h as no ass essable disease by CT /MRI  at study entry (eg, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia without 
nodal enlargement), repeat scans are not required  during the study . For the early termination visit, CT /MRI  and response assessment are  required if the previous scan 
was performed more than 3 months ago.  
11. A bone marrow examination must be performed at screening for all participants and within 7 days of the end of week 12  for subjects with baseline marrow disease . 
In those subjects who had evidence of bone marro w disease at the time of enrollment , upon achieving a possible CR (eg, physical examination or CT /MRI  scan

5.3 Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations  
To assess any  potential impact on subject eligibility with regard to safety, the investigator 
must refer to the IB for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, 
contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the study drug being used 
in this study.  
5.4 Subject Completions and Withdrawals  
5.4.1  Subject Completion  
A subject will be considered complete if he/she has completed at least one full cycle of 
zanubrutinib  plus obinutuzumab  treatment  and has not withdrawn from the study prior to 
completing the first cycle  (29 days for subjects in Part 1 a nd 28 days for subjects in 
Part 2). 
5.4.2  Subject Withdrawal  
A subject may voluntarily discontinue participation in this study at any time. The 
investigator may also, at his/her discretion, discontinue the subject fro m participating in 
this study at any time. If a subject is prematurely discontinued from participation in the 
study for any reason, the investigator must make every effort to perform the following 
evaluations 28 days from the last administration of zanubru tinib: physical examination, 
vital signs, computed tomography (CT) scan (if it has been more than 3 months since the 
previous CT scan), B symptoms, ECG, laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, and serum protein), and AE a ssessment. These data will be 
recorded as they comprise an essential evaluation that needs to be done prior to 
discharging any subject from the study.  
In the event that a subject is prematurely discontinued from the study at any time due to 
an AE (as defin ed in Section 10.1), the procedures stated in Section 10 must be followed.  
In addition to the post study assessments, if a DLT occurs, the investigator will obtain, 
when possible, a 4 mL blood sample for analysis of plasma zanubrutinib  concentration.  
Subjects who drop out or are withdrawn for any reason which does not fall under a DLT 
will be considered for replacement after due consideration from the Sponsor and safety 
committee.

6.1 Description of Invest igational Produc ts 
6.1.1  Zanubrutinib  
Zanubrutinib  is available as 20 mg blue opaque capsules (size 3), or 80 mg white opaque 
capsules (size 0), depending on the dose level. Zanubrutinib  is intended for oral use.  
6.1.2  Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab is provided as a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly brown, preservative free 
liquid concentrate for intravenous administration in 1000 mg/40 mL (25 mg/mL) single 
use vials.  
Obinutuzumab is for intravenous use and should be administered as an intravenous 
infusion through a dedicated line after dilution. The U.S. label indicates a duration of 
treatment of 6 cycles, each 28 days duration.  
6.2 Dosage and Administration  
6.2.1  Zanubrutinib  
Zanubrutinib  (either 320 mg or 160 mg based on QD or BID) will be administered orally , 
at least 30  minutes before obinutuzumab infusion  on the day obinutuzumab  is 
administ ered, in each cycle ( Cycle 1: 29 days for subjects in the Part 1 and 28 days for 
subjects in the Part 2; Cycle 2 and each cycle thereafter : 28 days ). Treatment with 
zanubrutinib  will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity , 
withdrawal from the study,  other reason for treatment discontinuation , or study closure , 
whichever occurs first . 
Zanubrutinib will be dispensed by the st udy center personnel to subjects  at scheduled 
study visits to ensure adequate drug supply for administration at home throughout the 
treatment phase as detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. The investi gator is to instruct the 
subject  to take the study drug exact ly as prescribed and at approximately the same time 
each day of dosi ng. Subjects  will be asked to complete a patient diary that records dates 
and times of dosing between clinic visits.  
If a dose of the study drug is not taken at  the scheduled time, the sub ject should skip the 
study drug if the time to next dose is 8 hours or less and return to normal dos ing with next 
dose. If a subject  vomits after taking the zanubrutinib capsules, that dose should not be 
repeated.  
6.2.2  Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab will be administ ered at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL as 
an intravenous infusion only for up to 6 cycles, see Table 4.

6.7 Warnings and Precautions  
Warnings and precautions to obinutuzumab include the following adverse reactions: HBV 
reactivation , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, infusion reactions, tumor lysis 
syndrome, infections, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.  
• Infusion reactions: Obinutuzumab can cause severe and life -threatening infusion 
reactions. For subjects with Grade 4 in fusion reactions, including but not limited 
to anaphylaxis, acute life -threatening respiratory symptoms, or other life -
threatening infusion reaction, stop and permanently discontinue obinutuzumab 
therapy. Management of Gazyva -related infusion reactions sho uld be con ducted 
per the Gazyva package insert. It is recommended to closely monitor subjects 
during the entire infusion. Infusion reactions within 24 hours of receiving 
obinutuzumab have occurred. For Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion reactions, interrupt or 
discontinue the infusion (see Section 6.11 initial management of infusion 
reaction ). 
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS can occur within 12 to 24 hours after the first 
infusion. Subjects with high tumo r burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte 
count (>  25x109/L) are at greater risk for TLS and should receive appropriate 
tumor lysis prophylaxis per the Gazyva package insert. In addition, BTK inhibitor  
can also induce  TLS in subjects with high tumor burd en. Even though no 
incidence of TLS has  been observed  in the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy trial 
(BGB -3111 -AU-003), there is a potential ly enhanced  risk of TLS when 
obinutuzumab is administered in combination with zanubrutinib  (see Section 6.13 
for initial management  of TLS ).   
• Infection: Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can 
occur during and followin g obinutuzumab therapy. Do not administer 
obinutuzumab to subjects with an active infection as fatal infections have been 
reported.  
• Neutropenia: Severe neutropenia can occur. Monitor subjects with Grade 3 to 4 
neutropenia frequently with regular laboratory tests until resolution. Neutropenia 
can also be of late onset and/or prolonged.  
• Thrombocytopenia: Fatal hemorrhagic events have been reported. Monitor 
subjects for thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events. In subjects with Grade 3 
or 4 thromboc ytopenia, monitor platelet counts frequently until resolution and 
consider dose delays of obinutuzumab.  11

6.13  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Since obinutuzumab  can induce ADCC, there is a potential risk of TLS.  In addition, 
zanubrutinib  can also induce  TLS in subjects with high tumor burden  although no 
incidence of TLS has  been observed  in the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy trial 
(BGB -3111 -AU-003). There is a potential ly enhanced  risk of TLS when obinutuzumab is 
administered in combination with zanubrutinib .  Should this occur, subjects should be 
treated per the local guidelines and the management algorithm stipulated in Figure 2.19

THERAPIES  
7.1 Permitted M edications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with 
indication, dose information, and dates of administration.  
As vomiting and nausea are the known side effects of obinutuzumab, prophylaxis of 
emesis would be allowed as per institutional standard at the physic ian’s discretion  (added 
per Amendment Version 3.0).  
Patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly those having received prior 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure, are 
pre-disposed to opportunistic infections as a result of disease and treatment -related 
factors. In patients with a high risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), prophylaxis should be considered  as per institutional 
standards.  
7.2 Prohibited /Restricted  Medications  
Subjects should not receive other anticancer  therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, or hormone 
other than for replacement) while on treatment in this study.  
• Other anti cancer therapy should not be administered until disease progression (as 
per clinical practice standards at the study center), unmanageable toxicity, or no 
further clinical benefit occurs which requires permanent discontinuation of the 
study drug.  
• Bispho sphonate use is permitted if the subject has already been on it for 3 or more 
months and on a stable dose.  
• Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks or less) and dose ( ≤20 mg 
prednisone per day, or equivalent) are permitted, if used to tre at a concomitant 
(non-cancer) medical condition , with the exception of glucocorticoids used for 
management of Gazyva -related infusion reaction (see Section 6.7).  
7.3 Medi cations to be used with Caution  
Administration of zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A  
inducers (refer to Table 6 for a list of these medications) and grapefruit juice and Seville  
oranges should be used with caution as they may affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib 
(Section 1.2). If at all possibl e, patients are encouraged not to use strong /moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors and inducers and consider using alternative agents. If these a gents will 
be used, follow the dose modification  in Table 7. The Medical Monito r should be

 Page 67 of 122 Table 7 Dose Modification for Zanubrutinib when Co -Administered with 
Strong/Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers  
CYP3A  Co-administered Drug  Recommended use  
Inhibition  Strong CYP3A inhibitor ( eg, 
ketoconazole, conivaptan, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, 
ritonavir, telaprevir, posaconazole, 
voriconazole)  80 mg once daily  
Moderate CYP3A inhibitor ( eg, 
erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, 
dronedarone, fluconazole, verapamil, 
aprepitant, imatinib, grapefruit products)  80 mg twice daily  
Induction  Strong CYP3A inducer ( eg, 
carbamaz epine, phenytoin, rifampin, 
St. John’s wort)  Avoid concomitant use; Cons ider 
alternative agents with less induction 
potential.  
Moderate CYP3A inducer ( eg, bosentan, 
efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin)  160 mg twice daily, use with caution; 
Monitor for potential lack of efficacy.  
 
Clinical drug -drug interaction study  indicated that zanubrutinib is a mild inducer of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 (Section  1.2). Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are 
metabolized by CYP3A4 (alfentanil, cycl osporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and ta crolimus), and CYP2C19 (eg, 
S-mephenytoin) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma 
exposures of these drugs . For subjects using hormonal co ntraceptives such as birth 
control pills or devices, a second barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) must be 
used.  
In the interests of subject safety and acceptable standards of medical care the investigator 
will be permitted to prescribe treatment( s) at his/her discretion. All treatments must be 
recorded in the subjects’ eCRF (medication, dose, treatment duration and indication).

 Page 68 of 122 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained prior to screening assessments and 
before any study specific assessments are initiated. The study specific assessments and 
procedures are shown in the study assessments and procedures schedule in Table 1 and 
Table 2. The PK and PD sampling time poin ts are presented in  Table 3. 
8.1 Demographic and Baseline Safety Assessments  
Demographic data will include date of birth, race, height (in cm), body weight  (in kg), 
and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2). For height and weight measurements, the subject 
will be allowed to wear indoor daytime clothing with no shoes. This data will be captured 
in the eCRF and database.  
Having given consent, subjects will be requir ed to undergo a medical screen to determine 
whether they are eligible to participate in the study according to the criteria listed in 
Section 5. Screening assessments will be completed within 28 days prior to the first 
treatment. Screening assessments completed within 72 hours of administration can be 
used as Day 1 assessments as indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. 
The screening assessments will include:  
• Demographic data  
• General medical history & baseline conditions  
• Vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], pulse 
rate, temperature, and respiratory rate)  
• B symptoms (unexplained weight loss >10% over previous 6 months, fever 
[>38°C], and/or drenching night sweats)  
• Complete physical examination  
• ECOG performance status  
• Echocardiogram  
• 12 lead ECG  
• Review of concurrent medication  
• Recording of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• Tumor assessment by CT / MRI  scan ( neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis)  
• Bone marrow  evaluation (aspirate or biopsy)  
• Hematology  
• Clinical chemistry

 Page 69 of 122 • Coagulation  
• Immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgM level and serum electrophoresis  
• Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  
• Viral serology (HBV, HC V, HIV)  
• Urinalysis  
The aforem entioned data will be captured in the source documents. Any results falling 
outside the normal range will be repeated at the discretion of the investigator.  
Safety assessments should be performed at all visits to the study center and throughout 
the study. The list of events and the time when they will be performed are presented in 
Table 1 and Table 2.  
Measurements used to evaluate safety will include vital signs, B symptoms, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and 
immunoglobulin assessment and serum EPG), 12 lead ECG, and physical examinations. 
Throughout the study, the study center personnel will be monitoring AEs. Adverse events 
and toxici ties will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03.18 Subjects who 
initiate treatment with an ANC <1000/μl will not be considered evaluable for neutrophil 
toxicity as outlined in the 2008 IWCLL guidelines.15  
8.2 Laboratory Evaluations  
Laboratory assessments should be performed at a local certified laboratory on Day 1 
before the study drug administration. Laboratory assessments need not be repeated on 
Day 1 if these assessments were completed for screening within 72 hours of the first 
administration. Other laboratory assessments will be sent to central laboratory for the 
required procedures. Required assessments are listed in  Table 9. 
Clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and immunoglobulin assessment 
and serum EPG will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 and Table 2. 
All subjects, who have any Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities at withdrawal 
from the study, must be followed up until they have returned to Grade 1 or Grade 2, 
unless these are not likely to improve due to the underlying disease.  
On routine urinalysis, if urine protein is ≥2+ by dipstick, a 24 hour urine sample for total 
protein and a random urine sample for total protein and creatinine will be obtained. If 
urine protein is >2 g/24 hours, the study drug administration will be interrupted until it 
returns to ≤2 g/24 hours. If urine protein is ≤2 g/24 hours, further clinical evaluation 
and/or more frequent testing may be performed as clinically indicated. A random urine 
protein to creatinine ratio can serve as a reliable surrogate for the 24 hour urine protein 
when following subjects with urine protein of ≤2 g, documented by a 24 hour ur ine

 Page 70 of 122 collection. In such cases, the 24 hour urine for total protein should be repeated only if a 
clinically significant increase is observed in the random urine protein to creatinine ratio.  
Serum electrophoresis should be tested during screening for all su bjects, and if a 
paraprotein is present, it should be repeated on all subsequent immunoglobulin 
assessments.  
8.3 Physical Examination, Vital Signs, and B Symptoms  
A complete or targeted physical examination, vital signs (SBP, DBP, pulse rate, 
temperature, and respiratory rate), weight, and B symptoms assessment  will be performed 
at the time points specified in Table 1 and Table 2. 
Complete physical examination includes assessment  of cardiovascular, res piratory, 
abdominal and neurological systems as well as lymph nodes, spleen, skin, oropharynx 
and extremities. Targeted physical exams should be limited to systems of clinical 
relevance (ie, cardiovascular, respiratory, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen)  and those 
systems associated with clinical signs/symptoms. B symptoms include unexplained 
weight loss >10% over previous 6 months, fever (>38°C), and/or drenching night sweats.  
8.4 Electrocardiogram  
Perform a single 12 lead ECG at screening and  as medically indicated . Subjects should be 
in the semi recumbent or supine position. Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the time 
points specified in Table 1 and Table 2. 
8.5 Computed Tomography  
Tumor assessments must be performed within 7 days of the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 
48, every 24 weeks after Week 48, and at disease progression. In rare instances the timing 
of a subject’s scan may fall outside this specified imaging procedure window – for 
example, due to out -of-town travel or other unforeseen circumstances. Rare occurrences  
of missing scans or scans outside the procedure window will not necessarily be 
considered as a protocol deviation; the Sponsor will make the final determination.  
Subjects continue treatment and undergo additional tumor assessments until disease 
progressi on or intolerance, death, subject withdraws from the study, or at the discretion of 
the investigators, or study closure , whichever occurs first.  Computed tomography scans 
must encompass neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis  and use intravenous contrast  or 
inves tigators’ decision . A CT scan of diagnostic quality performed as part of positron 
emission tomography (PET)/CT is acceptable, provided bidimensional nodal and 
liver/spleen measurements can be made. For lesions not amenable to measurement by CT, 
MRI may be utilized after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. If the subject 
has no assessable disease by CT at study entry (eg, WM without nodal enlargement), 
repeat scans are not required  during the study . The CT scan will be used for disease 
assessment by the investigator at each study center. For subjects who discontinue early, a

 Page 71 of 122 CT scan will be performed at the discontinuation visit if the previous scan was more than 
3 months ago.  
8.6 Bone Marrow Evaluation  
A bone marrow examination must be performed at screening for all participants and 
within 7 days of the end of Week 12  for subjects with baseline marrow disease . In those 
subjects who had evidence of bone marrow disease at the time of enrollment , upon 
achie ving a possible complete response (CR) (eg, physical exam or CT scan indicating a 
possible CR ), based on the response criteria of NHL, repeated bone marrow aspirations 
and biopsies are required to confirm CR.  
Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspirate/bi opsy with flow cytometry assessment(s) 
for minimal residual disease should be done at least 3 months after the last dose if there is 
evidence of CR in all of the response parameters ( ie, hematology, CT scan).  
8.7 Minimal Residual Disease for Subjects with CLL 
Chemo -immunotherapy combinations are standard treatments for many patients with 
CLL. Novel targeted agents are being used in front -line and relapsed settings. Minimal 
residual disease (MRD) status has been shown to be a predictor of both progression -free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following chemo -immunotherapy .20,21 In this  
study, samples will be requested  from subjects with CLL to assess MRD  at the following 
timepoints : 
 Peripheral blood sample at Cycle 18 , or at the earliest opportunity after Cycle 18 , 
in all CLL subjects on study ; a bone marrow sample is requested if the  peripheral 
blood sam ple is MRD negative  
 Peripheral blood sample at the time of newly attained CR, and at each CR assessed 
timepoint  thereafter , for continuing CLL subjects ; a bone marrow sample is 
requested if the peripheral blood sample is MRD negative  
 
CLL subjects who do not achieve CR will not have the second set o f peripheral blood and 
bone marrow samples taken.  
Samples will be analyzed at a central lab oratory.  
8.8 Adverse Events  
After informed consent has been signed , but prior to the administration of the study drug,  
only SAEs should be reported.  After initiation of study drug , all AEs and SAEs, 
regardless of the relationship to the study drug, will be collected until 30 days after the 
last zanubrutinib  treatment  or 90  days after the last dose of obinutuzumab , and until 
resolution of all treatment related AEs.

 Page 72 of 122 8.9 Pregnan cy 
8.9.1  Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening and a urine pregnancy test at the 
time points specified in Table 1 and Table 2 in women of childbearing potential. Any 
female subject who is pregnant will not be eligible for the study. A subject who has a 
positive pregnan cy test result at any time after the study drug administration will be 
immediately withdrawn from participation in the study. The results of pregnancy tests 
will not be recorded in the database.  
8.9.2  Action to be taken if a Pregnancy Occurs  
A subject who has a positive pregnancy test result at any time after the study drug 
administration will be immediately withdrawn from participation in the study. All post 
study assessments will be collected at the time of discontinuation as described in 
Section  5.4.1 . 
The investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any female 
subject of childbearing potential or a female partner of a male su bject who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. The investigator, or his/her designee, will 
record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 
2 weeks of learning of a subject’s pregnancy. The subject wil l also be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow up will be no longer than 6 to 
8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE , any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or 
SAE, as described in Section 10.6 and will be followed as described in Section 10.8. 
A spontaneous abortion is always  considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
described in Section 10. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post study 
pregnancy and i s considered reasonably related to the study drug (zanubrutinib  in 
combination with obinutuzumab) by the investigator, will be reported to the Sponsor as 
described in Section 10.11. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former subjects, he/she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.

 Page 73 of 122 8.10 Follow -up Assessments  
8.10.1  Safety Follow -up 
Approximately 28 days after the last administration of the study drug, all subjects should 
return for a final evaluation. Assessments to be performed are presented in Table 1 and 
Table 2. 
Any abnormal finding of clinical consequence and not related to the disease progression 
will be monitored until resolution or baseline status.  
8.10.2  Progression and Survival Follow up  
Subjects who discontinue study drug due to reasons other than disease progression will 
remain in the study and be followed every 3 months until the subject exhibits first 
progression, withdraws consent, starts ne w anti -cancer therapy, death or study closure, 
whichever occurs first. Once a subject progress es or start s use of alternative anti -cancer 
therapy, he/she will not return to the study center, but will be contacted every 3 months 
by telephone, to assess surv ival until death , withdrawal of consent  or study closure , 
whichever occurs first.  
8.11  Efficacy  
The following efficacy endpoints will be assessed:  
• The number and proportion of subjects who achieve objective tumor response 
(CR, PR, PR-L, and CR+PR) or SD . 
• Minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance rate.  
• Hematological improvement.  
• Progression free survival (PFS). It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
determine the date of disease progression.  
• Overall survival.  
• Duration of response for responders (CR or PR). Duration: time from date of first 
occurrence of CR or PR to date of progression.  
Efficacy assessments will use the applicable response criteria (IWCLL for CLL15,22 , NCI 
WG for NHL16, and IWWM for WM17, as shown in Section 16.3) with CT (or PET if 
applicable) scans after Weeks  12, 24, 36 and 48, every 24 weeks after Week 48,  and bone 
marrow aspirate and trephine after 12 weeks (and repeated subsequently if the subje ct 
attains criteria for complete remission in every other respect beyond 12 weeks ).      
8.12  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood will be collected to describe the PK profiles of zanubrutinib  and obinutuzumab and 
may be used for a preliminary analysis of major m etabolites.

 Page 74 of 122 The maximum total amount of blood taken for the PK analysis will be approximately 
150 mL. These samples will be collected at the time points presented in Table 3. Frozen 
plasma samples should be shipped as soon as possible after collection since exposure will 
be monitored while the study is ongoing.  
8.12.1  Pharmacokinetic Blood Samples for Zanubrutinib  and 
Obinutuzumab  
Cannulation for blood sampling for PK will be performed. Blood will be collected via the 
intravenous cannula predose and at the time points specified in Table 3. A 1  mL blood 
sample will be taken (for flush of the cannula) and discarded prior to each blood sample. 
The actual time each sample was collected will be captured to the nearest minute in the 
eCRF and recorded in the database.  
Blood samples (4 mL and 5 mL) for zanubrutinib  and obinutuzumab PK analysis, 
respectively, will be collected according to the Lab Manual. Plasma (for zanubrutinib ) 
and serum (for obinutuzumab) will be separated and immediately frozen. Samples must 
remain frozen in a freezer set at or below -70°C and  in a box with dry ice during shipping.  
Prior to collection, the collection tube and serum or plasma storage tube must be labelled 
with the corresponding labels provided by the Sponsor. The l abels must be placed along 
the length of the tube so they can be read easily. Tape must not be used to secure the 
labels as the tube will not fit into the autoanalyzer test tube rack. The labels are of high 
quality and will not peel off of the tube even un der extreme conditions.  
Samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where all samples will be analyzed for 
plasma zanubrutinib  and obinutuzumab concentrations using a validated method.  
8.13  Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Pharmacodynamics is not a primary ob jective of this study. BTK occupancy in PBMCs 
will be determined and used as direct PD biomarker for BTK inhibition.  This is for the 
subject s enrolled in Part 1 only.  
8.13.1  PBMC Preparation  
Blood samples (8 mL) for PD analysis will be collected into plastic pota ssium EDTA 
collection tubes immediately following PK blood sampling at the time points specified in  
Table 3. PBMCs will be prepared using the peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
preparation kit provided by the Sponsor. PBMC samples will be immediately frozen in a 
freezer at or below -70°C.  
8.13.2  Sample Shipment and Analysis  
Samples must remain frozen in a box with dry ice during shipping. Samples will be 
shipped to the central laboratory where all samples will be analysed for BTK occupancy 
using a validated method.

 Page 75 of 122 8.14  Other Assessments  
8.14.1  Subject Tissue Analysis  
Subjects who have DLBCL must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy 
for confirmation of the DLBCL subtype and further genetic analysis, either prior to 
enrollment  or during/after the study treatment. Either a formalin fixed, paraffin embedd ed 
block with tumor tissue (preferred) or 10 to 15  unstained slides must be sent to the central 
laboratory to confirm the DLBCL subtype and conduct exploratory biomarker analysis.  
Subjects  who have disease relapse at any t ime will be asked for a blood samp le and asked 
to undergo biopsies of representative tumor sites (or BM) to obtain samples for studying 
mechanisms of resistance. These studies may include phosphoprotein analysis of relevant 
pathways, whole exome or genome sequencing, and assessments of RNA  expression.  To 
achieve these goals, at disease progression, subjects who have CLL will be asked to 
provide a peripheral blood sample , subjects who have WM will be asked to provide a 
bone marrow aspirate , and subjects from other indications will be asked to undergo tissue 
biopsies of represe ntative tumor sites . If feasible, samples collected for disease 
progression  confirmation may be used for biomarker testing in lieu of requesting 
additional marrow and biopsy samples from patients.  For non -CLL subjects , while bone 
marrow collection or tumor tissue re -biopsy is preferred, peripheral blood samples are 
acceptable if bone marrow or biopsies are not accessible . 
8.15  Appropriateness of Measurements

 Page 76 of 122 9 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
According to the GCP guidelines, the Sponsor is responsible for implementing and 
maintaining quality assur ance and quality control systems with written Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
• Investigator meeting(s)  
• Certified local laboratories for laboratory measurements and ECGs  
• Study center initiation visit  
• Early study center visits after enrollment  
• Routine study center monitoring  
• Ongoing study center communication and training  
• Data management quality control checks  
• Continuous data acquisition and cleaning  
• Internal review of data  
• Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, the Sponsor and/or the CRO clinical quality assurance department may 
conduct periodic audits of the study processes, including, but not limited to the study 
center, study center visits, central laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and the final 
clinical study report. When audits are conducted, access must be author ized for all study 
related documents including medical history and concomitant medication documentation 
to authorized Sponsor’s representatives and regulatory authorities.  
9.1 Monitoring  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Sponsor procedures, t he Sponsor 
and/or CRO monitors will contact the study center prior to the subject enrollment  to 
review the protocol and data collection procedures with the study center personnel. In 
addition, the monitor will periodically contact the study center, includi ng conducting on 
site visits. The extent, nature and frequency of onsite visits will be based on such 
considerations as the study objective and/or endpoints, the purpose of the study, study 
design complexity, and enrollment  rate.

 Page 77 of 122 During these contacts, the  monitor will:  
• Check the progress of the study  
• Review study data collected  
• Conduct source document verification  
• Identify any issues and address their resolution  
This will be done in order to verify that the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete  
• Safety and rights of subjects are being protected  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol (and any 
amendments), GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements  
The investigator agrees to allow the monitor direct a ccess to all relevant documents and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the monitor to discuss findings 
and any relevant issues.  
At study closure, monitors will also conduct all activities described in Section 13.1. 
9.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs 
of the data management and biostatistics departments of the CRO.  
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for this study, meaning that all 
eCRF data will be entered in electronic forms at the study center. Data collection will be 
completed by authorized study center personnel designat ed by the investigator.  
Appropriate training and security measures will be completed with the investigator and all 
authorized study center personnel prior to the study being initiated and any data being 
entered into the system for any subjects.  
The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations of the subjects participating in 
the study. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after 
the subject’s visit. To avoid inter observer variability, every effort should be made to 
ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes 
all safety evaluations. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are 
accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain informa tion is not 
available or not applicable or unknown, the investigator should indicate this in the eCRF. 
The investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data once 
complete.  
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency. 
The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no

the name of the person who performed  the change, together with time and date will be 
logged. Roles and rights of the study center personnel responsible for entering the clinical 
data into the eCRF will be determined in advance. If additional corrections are needed, 
the responsible monitor or  data manager will raise a query in the EDC application. The 
appropriate study center personnel will respond to any queries raised.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the 
original (or source) medical records unle ss otherwise specified. Source documents are all 
documents used by the investigator or hospital that relate to the subject’s medical history, 
that verify the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and all records 
covering the subjec t’s participation in the study. They include laboratory notes, ECG 
results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made 
available for inspection by the stu dy monitor at each monitoring visit. The investigator 
must submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives the study drug, regardless 
of the duration. All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as 
laboratory or hospital records, shoul d be clearly identified with the study and subject 
number. Any personal information, including subject name, should be removed or 
rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.  
Electronic CRF records will be automatically appended with the iden tification of the 
creator, by means of their unique User ID. Specified records will be electronically signed 
by the investigator to document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the 
data are accurate. This will be facilitated by means of the  investigators unique User ID 
and password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at the time of the 
electronic signature. If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be 
made in accordance with the relevant software procedures.  All changes will be fully 
recorded in a protected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) Version 17.0  or higher . Concomitant medications will be coded using the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO DD). Concomitant diseases/medical 
history will be coded using MedDRA Version 17.0  or higher .

 Page 80 of 122 10 ADVE RSE EVENTS AND SERIO US ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol. During the study, 
when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or study center personnel will be 
responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
Adverse event  and SAE collection is to begin from subject consenting, and continued 
until 30 days after the last zanubrutinib  treatment, and until resolution of all treatment 
related AEs.  
10.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of  a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product ( zanubrutinib  in combination with 
obinutuzumab).  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (ne w or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of study drug.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an 
increase in severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a 
signific antly worse outcome.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or t he clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
drug or a concurrent medication.  
• Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. See 
Section  10.3 for additional information.  
10.2  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life threatening.

 Page 81 of 122 NOTE: The term “life threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation o f existing hospitalization.  
NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriat e in the 
physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalizatio n” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an SAE.  
• Results in disability/incapacity.  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, an d accidental trauma (eg, 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  
10.3  Lack of Efficacy  
“Lack of efficacy” will not be reported as an AE. The signs and symptoms or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the AE or SAE 
definitio n (including clarifications).  
10.4  Abnorma l Assessments as AEs or SAEs  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, 
urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECGs, chest X rays, vital signs, etc.) that 
are judged by the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SA Es if 
they meet the definition of an AE, as defined in Section 10.1, or an SAE, as defined in

 Page 82 of 122 Section 10.2. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal 
assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen following the sta rt of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more 
severe than expected f or the subject’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start 
of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  They should be 
reported as AEs or SAEs if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, need active 
intervention, need d ose interruption or discontinuation or are clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator.  
The investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
10.5 Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting AEs and 
SAEs  
10.5.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period   
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, 
only SAEs  should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, 
will be reported until 30 days after the last study treatment of zanubrutinib  or 90 days a fter 
the last dose of obinutuzumab . After this period, the investigator sh ould report any SAE s 
that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
10.5.2  Eliciting Adverse Events   
The investigator or designee will ask about AEs by asking the following standard 
questions:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical pro blems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the source documents. All AEs and SAEs will be 
reported in the eCRF.  
10.5.3  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events
 and Serious Adverse Events  
10.5.3.1  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF (and 
SAE report, as applicable), rather than the individual signs and symptoms (eg, record only 
hepatitis rathe r than elevated transaminases, bilirubin or jaundice). However, if a

IND Number: 125326  
 
 
 Page 83 of 122 constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual AE should be recorded as 
an SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE report, if applicable). If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should replace the individual signs and/or symptoms as the AE term on the 
eCRF (and SAE report, if applicable), unless the signs/symptoms are clinically 
significant . 
10.5.3.2  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other AEs (eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
AEs) should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe vomiting is 
known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as the SAE or AE 
on the eCRF (and SAE report, if applicable). However, if a subject initially has a non-
serious AE, and it subsequently becomes an SAE, both AEs should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. The onset date of the non -serious AE should be recorded as the start date of 
the non -serious AE. The onset date of the SAE should be recorded as the sta rt date when 
the non -serious AE becomes an SAE.  
10.5.3.3  Persistent or Recurring Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject 
evaluation time points. Such AEs should only be recorded once on the AE eCRF (and 
SAE report, if applicable). If a persistent AE worsens in grade, it should be recorded as a 
new AE on the eCRF (and a stop date should be recorded in the previous AE) .  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, 
and subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded separately on the eCRF 
(and SAE report, if applicable).  
10.5.3.4  Disease Progression  
Disease progression is expected in this study population, and the term “disease 
progression ” should not be reported as  an AE term.  When disease progression is 
identified, the AE that identifies the disease progression should be reported as the AE  
term. For instance, a subject with pleural effusion presents with shortness of breath.  The 
cause of the shortness of breath i s a pleural effusion resulting from disease progression.  
The AE term should be reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease progression  or 
metastasis to lungs.   If a subject has a seizure that is determined to be associated with a 
brain metastasis, t he term “seizure ” should be recorded as the AE  instead of disease 
progression  or brain metastasis. If  a subject experienced multi -organ failure due to 
disease progression, the term “multi -organ failure” should be reported as the AE instead 
of disease progr ession. Deaths that are assessed by the investigator as solely due to 
disease progression should be recorded on Study Completion or Early Discontinuation 
eCRF as efficacy data.  They should not be reported as an SAE. If deaths are attributed by

 Page 84 of 122 the investig ator not solely due to disease progression, whether they are assessed as related 
or not related to the study drug, they should be reported as SAE  immediately.  
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to disease progression, it 
should be reported as an AE.  
10.5.3.5  Death  
When recording a death as an SAE, the AE that caused or contributed to fatal outcome 
should be recorded as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “un explained death”.  
10.6  Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regardin g an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the 
subject’s medical records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the appropriate AE or 
SAE eCRF pages. However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for 
certain cases are requested by the Sponsor. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be 
blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to the Sponsor.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event b ased on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. Adverse events are 
independent components of the study.  
10.7  Evaluating Adverse Events and Ser ious Adverse Events  
10.7.1  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study. When applicable, AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the 
NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.18 Subjects who  initiate treatment with an ANC  <1000/μl will 
not be considered evaluable for neutrophil toxicity as outlined in the 2008 IWCLL 
guidelines.  15 
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL)  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL

 Page 85 of 122  Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity (for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe 
[Grade 3], or life -threatening [Grade 4]), whereas se riousness is classified by the criteria 
based on the regulatory definitions.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations from the Sponsor to applicable regulatory authori ties as 
described in Section 10.2. 
10.7.2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the 
occurrence of each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine 
the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study drug will be considered and investigated. The i nvestigator will also consult the IB 
and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her 
assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial repo rt to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to 
transmission of the SAE report  to the Sponsor. The investigator may change his/her 
opinion of causality in light of foll ow up information, amending the SAE report  
accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements.  
The investigator will provide the assessment of causality (zanubrutinib  in combination 
with obi nutuzumab) as per instructions on the SAE form . 
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” 
or “not related”.  An AE is considered related  if there is “a  reasonable possibility” that the 
AE may have been caus ed by the study drug (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to 
suggest possible causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this 
assessment , including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
 An AE should be considered ‘ related’ to study drug if any of the following are met:

 Page 86 of 122  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely.  
 There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug).  However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the subject’s 
clinical condition  or other concomitant AEs). 
An AE should be considered ‘unrelated’ to study drug if any of the following are met:  
 An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the study drug and 
the onset of the AE (eg, the AE occurred either before or too long after 
administration of the product for it to be considered product -related)  
 A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is biologically implausible 
(eg, death as a passenger in an automobile accident)  
 A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE is present (eg, typical 
adverse reaction to a concomitant drug an d/or typical disease -related AE)  
10.8  Follow Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide further information to the Sponsor on the subject’s con dition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and are designated as ongoing, 
will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until 
the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow up. Once resolved, 
the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated. The investigator will ensure 
that follow up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate 
the nature an d/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
The Sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a subjec t dies 
during participation in the study or during a recognized follow up period, the Sponsor will 
be provided with a copy of any post mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE form. The 
updated SAE form  should be resent to the Sponsor within the time frames outlined in 
Section 10.9.

10.9.2  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse 
Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a subject, he/she will 
report the information to the Sponsor within 24 hours as outlined in Section 10.9.1 . The 
SAE report  will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details 
of the event, and forwarded to the Sponsor within the designated timeframes. If the 
investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event and completing 
the form. The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report as described in Section 10.7.2 . 
The Sponsor will provide a list of project contacts for SAE receipt, fax numbers, 
telephone numbers, and mailing addresses.  
10.10  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Seriou s 
Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the Sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section 10.9.1 . The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as 
appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the 
safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the 
investigator to the appropriate pr oject contact for SAE receipt is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with 
the applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory

 Page 88 of 122 authorities and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC).  
This protocol is being filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the 
FDA. A given SAE may qualify as an IND safety report if the SAE is both attributable to 
the study drug and unexpected. In this case, all investigators filed to the IND (and 
associated INDs for the same compound) will receive an expedited investigator safety 
report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the FDA.  
Expedited investigator safety reports are prepared according to the Sponsor’s policy and 
are forwarded to investigators as necessary. Such a report is prepared for an SAE that is 
both attributable to study drug and unexpected. The purpose of the report is to fulfil l 
specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow up report or other safety information (eg, 
revised IB) from the Sponsor, the responsible person according to local requirements is 
required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
10.11  Post Study  Adverse Events a nd Serious Adverse 
Events  
A post study AE or SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting  period, defined in Section 10.5. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former subjects. However, 
if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the 
study drug  (zanubrutinib  in combination with obinutuzumab) , the investigator will 
promptly notify the Sponsor.  
10.12  Serious Adverse Events Related to Study Participation  
An SAE considered related to study participation (eg, procedures, invasive t ests), even if 
it occurs during the post treatment period, will be reported promptly to the Sponsor (see 
Section 10.9). 
10.13  Expedited Reporting to Heal th Authorities, 
Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and Ethics 
Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to 
identify and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory  authorities, 
investigators , IRBs  and IECs  based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requirements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs  using the following reference documents :

 CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1  Sample Size Considerations  
The number of dose regimens in the safety evaluation part and the emerging zanubrutinib  
and obinutuzumab toxicities will determine the sample size. It is anticipated that 
approximately 12 subjects will be required to establish the selected treatment regimen of 
zanubrutinib  when administered in combination with obinutuzumab in the safety 
evalu ation part.  
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled during the indication expansion period. 
Enrollment  in certain arms may be closed prematurely due to safety intolerability to 
zanubrutinib  at the discretion of Sponsor or SMC.  
11.2  General Considerations for Data Analysis  
The following descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the trial data on the basis of 
their nature unless otherwise specified:  
• Continuous variables:  number of non -missing observations, mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of v ariation ( CV% ) as appropriate , median, minimum, and 
maximum.  
• Categorical variables:  frequencies and percentages.  
• Time to event variables:  number of non -missing observations (N), median, 
minimum and maximum. Kaplan Meier median times, 25th and 75th percentiles 
and associated 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) will also be provided for specific 
time to event variables.  
Further description of the statistical methods and analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
11.2.1  Analysis Populations  
All Subjects Enrolled Set :  
The all subjects enrolled set will include all subjects who provide informed consent for 
this study. The all subjects enrolled set will be used to summarize and describe the 
analysis set.  
Safety Analysis Set :  
The safety analysis set will include all subje cts in the all subjects enrolled set who receive 
at least 1 administration of zanubrutinib  and/or obinutuzumab. The safety analysis set will 
be used for all summaries, including efficacy analyses (except DLTs and PK/PD

The DLT  analysis set includes all subjects who experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 or 
subjects who received at least 80% of the planned doses of zanubrutinib  and missed no 
more than one administration of obinutuzumab during the DLT observation period 
(Cycle  1). DLT summary will be performed for Part 1 only.  
PK Analysis Set :  
The PK analysis set will include subjects who have received at least the first 
administration of zanubrutinib  and provided PK samples as per protocol (without 
significant protocol deviation affec ting the PK blood sample) following the first treatment 
on Day 1 Cycle 1.  
PD Analysis Set : 
The PD analysis set will include subjects who have received at least the first 
administration of zanubrutinib  and provided PD samples as per protocol (without any 
significant protocol deviation affecting the PD blood sample) following the first treatment 
on Day 1 Cycle 1.  
11.2.2  Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study. Since this is a dose regimen safety 
evaluation study, safety, PK and PD data will be  evaluated on an ongoing basis.  
11.2.3  Withdrawal  
Subjects who drop out or are withdrawn for any reason which does not fall under DLT 
will be considered for replacement after due consideration from Sponsor and safety 
committee and will be replaced whenever possib le. 
11.3  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Nominal sampling times will be used for interim PK parameter calculations, while actual 
sampling times will be used in the final PK parameter calculations.  
Plasma samples will be collected at the time points detailed in Table 3. 
Where possible, the following plasma PK parameters will be determined for zanubrutinib  
(Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1) and obinutuzumab:

11.4  Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Pharmacodynamics is not a primary objective of this study. BTK occupancy in PBMCs 
will be summarized and listed if possible.  
11.5  Efficacy Analysis  
Response assessment will be performed per the standard International Working Group 
(IWG) Criteria for each disease as described in Appendix  16.3.  
ORR, MRD clearance rate , hematological improvement:  
The number and percent age of subject along with 95% exact binomial CIs will be 
presented for overall response (ORR defined as CR or PR [C R+PR]]), CR, PR, SD, 
progressive disease , MRD clearance rate and , for subjects with CLL , hematological 
improvement  (HI). 
HI for subjects with CLL will be described by the frequency and number of subject s with: 
1. Erythroid response (HI -E) 
Major response: For subject s with pretreatment hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL, 
greater than 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin; for RBC transfusion -dependent 
subject s, transfusion independence.  The defined improvement in haemoglobin 
levels must be maintained for at least 2 months whi le on study treatment.  
Minor response: For subject s with pretreatment hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL, 1 to 
2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin; for RBC transfusion -dependent subject s, 50% 
decrease in transfusion requirements.  The defined improvement in haemoglobin 
levels must be maintained for at least 2 months while on study treatment.  
2. Platelet response (HI -P) 
Major response: For subject s with pretreatment platelet count less than 
100,000/mm3, an absolute increase of 30 ,000/mm3 or more; for platelet 
transfusion -dependent patients, stabilization of platelet counts and transfusion 
independence.  The defined improvement in platelet levels must be maintained for 
at least 2  months while on study treatment.  
Minor response: For subject s with pretreatment platelet count less  than 
100,000/mm3, a 50% or more increase in platelet count with a net increase greater 
than 10 ,000/mm3 but less than 30 ,000/mm3. The defined improvement in platelet

Major response: For absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/mm3 before 
therapy, at least a 100% increase or an absolute increase of more than 500/mm3, 
whichever is greater.  The defined improvement in neutrophil levels must be 
maintai ned for at least 2 months while on study treatment.  
Minor response: For ANC less than 1500/mm3 before therapy, ANC increase of at 
least 100%, but absolute increase less than 500/mm3. The defined improvement in 
neutrophil levels must be maintained for at le ast 2 months while on study 
treatment.  
RBC and platelet transfusion dependence and independence are defined in Section 16.4. 
PFS and OS : 
Progression -free survival and OS will be analyzed by Kaplan Meier methodology to 
estimate median PFS and OS, and 95% CI. Kaplan Meier curves will be constructed to 
provide a visual description of the PFS and OS change with time.  
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first stu dy treatment to disease progression or 
death whichever occurs first in subjects. As noted previously, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to define the date of progression. Subjects without event (no disease 
progression or death) will be censored at th e date of ‘last tumor assessment’. Subjects for 
whom no post baseline tumor assessments are available are censored at the time of first 
treatment.   
OS is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to death (any cause). 
Subjects without dea th will be censored at the final known date of survival.  
Duration of Response : 
Duration of response for responders (CR or PR) is defined as the time interval between 
the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of progressive disease  or death for 
any cause, whichever occurs earlier. For subjects who are alive without progression 
following the qualifying response, duration of response will be censored on the date of 
last evaluable tumor assessment or last follow up for progression of d isease.  
Duration of response will be analysed by Kaplan -Meier methodology to estimate median 
durations and 95% CI. 
This analysis is planned for the statistical analysis plan.

discontinue this study either at a single study center or at all s tudy centers at any time for 
reasons including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non compliance  
with this protocol, GCP, the clinical study agreement, or applicable laws and regulations . 
If the Sponsor determines such action is needed , the Sponsor will discuss this with the 
investigator (including the reasons for taking such action) at that time. When feasible, the 
Sponsor will provide advance notification to the investigator of the impending action 
prior to it taking effect.  
The Spons or will promptly inform all other investigators and/or institutions conducting 
the study if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform 
the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reaso n(s) 
for the action. If required by applicable regulations, the investigator must inform the 
IEC/IRB promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must still be provided  to the 
Sponsor. In addition, arrangements will be made for all unused study drug(s) in 
accordance with the applicable Sponsor procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement establishe d between the investigator and the Sponsor.  
13.2  Records Retention  and Study Files  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the 
study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These 
documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s 
study file, and (2) patient clinical source documents.

 Page 104 of 122 The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query 
forms, IRB/IEC, and govern mental approval with correspondence, ICF, drug records, 
staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and 
correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually defined by the project in advance to record key 
efficacy/ safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) would include (although not be 
limited to) the following: patient hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, 
appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, electroencephalogram, X -ray, 
pathology  and special assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment 
log, etc . 
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe 
and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, 
when needed (eg, audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent 
review of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and 
personnel. Where permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional p olicy, some or all 
of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (eg, microfiche, 
scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. 
The investigator must assure that all reproductions are legibl e, are a true and accurate 
copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re 
generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an 
acceptable back up of these reproductions and that an a cceptable quality control process 
exists for making these reproductions.  
The Sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to 
comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time will 
meet the  strictest standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by any 
institutional requirements or local laws or regulations, or the Sponsor’s 
standards/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will default to 15 years.  
The investigator  must notify the Sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off site facility, transfer of 
ownership or responsibility for of the records in the event the investigator leaves the study 
center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or 
all of the documents, arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene 
to store these in secure containers outside of the study center so tha t they can be returned 
to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for 
the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of 
the study center.

agreement with the CRO managing the biological samples, for the shorter of: a period of 
up to 10 years or as allowed by your IRB/IEC . 
13.3  Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
When the clinical study report is completed, the Sponsor will provide the major findings 
of the study to the investigator.  
In addition, details of the study treatment assignment will be provided to the investigator 
to enable him/her to review the data to d etermine the outcome of the study for his/her 
subjects.  
The Sponsor will not routinely inform the investigator or subject of the test results, 
because the information generated from this study will be preliminary in nature, and the 
significance and scienti fic validity of the results will be undetermined at such an early 
stage of research.  
13.4  Information Disclosure and Inventions  
All information provided by the Sponsor and all data and information generated by the 
study center as part of the study (other than a subject’s medical records) is the sole 
property of the Sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests in any inventions, know how or other intellectual or 
industrial property rights which are conceived or reduced to practice by the study center 
personnel duri ng the course of or as a result of the study are the sole property of the 
Sponsor, and are hereby assigned to the Sponsor.  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes ownership provisions 
inconsistent with this statement is executed b etween the Sponsor and the study center, 
that contract’s ownership provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
All information provided by the Sponsor and all data and information generated by the 
study center as part of the study (other than a subj ect’s medical records) will be kept by 
the investigator and other study center personnel. This information and data will not be 
used by the investigator or other study center personnel for any purpose other than 
conducting the study.

a For response assessments  that occur during cycles where a CT scan is not required then results from prior scans (up to 12 weeks during the first 48 weeks a nd up to 24 
weeks thereafter) can be carried forward in those subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline  
b Sequential changes  (separated by at least 4 weeks) in IgM levels should  be determined by the IgM value from the quantitative serum immunoglobulin assay, unless for 
assay limitations this is not possible, in which case the M protein level  by densitometry (SPEP) will be used  
c Isolated increase in serum IgM levels during periods of study drug withholding will not be considered as progressive disease unless confirmed by a repeat serum IgM level 
at least 6 weeks after restarting study drug administration and accompanied by a total increase of at least 500mg/dL from lowest nadir.  Please see Guidelines for specific 
clinical or laboratory circumstances below.  
 
Guidelines for specific clinical or laboratory circumstances:  
 
1. Baseline serum total IgM value above the local  laboratory li mit of quantitation.  
If the baseline local  laboratory serum total IgM value exceeds the upper limit of quantitation , the M -protein value, by local  assessment, 
will be used for response determination throughout the study . 
 
2. Baseline serum total IgM value, by local  assessment, is not interpretable due to technical reasons.  
If the baseline local  laboratory serum total IgM value is not interpretable due to technical reasons, the local  laboratory serum M -protein 
value will be use d of response determination throughout the study. In cases where both the local  laboratory total serum IgM and M -protein 
values are not interpretable due to technical reasons, the local serum total IgM (or local M -protein value, in cases where the local se rum 
total IgM value exceeds the upper level of quantitation) will be used for response assessment throughout the study.  
 
3. Subjects with documented cryoglobulinemia.  
For these subjects, serum quantitative immunoglobulin and serum immunoelectrophoresis assay s should be conducted under warm 
conditions in the local laboratory. The local serum total IgM (or local M -protein value, in cases where the local serum total IgM value 
exceeds the upper level of quantitation) will be used for response assessment throughou t the study.

4. Plasmapheresis  
Subjects may undergo plasmapheresis, when clinically indicated, during the first two cycles of study treatment. A pre -plasmapheresis 
serum total IgM and M -protein must be obtained during the screening period, and will serve a s the baseline value for response assessment 
throughout the study. Response determination will commence 4 weeks following the last plasmapheresis procedure and will be ba sed upon 
the baseline pre -plasmapheresis serum total IgM or M -protein value (according  to the guidelines above). Subjects requiring plasmapheresis 
after cycle 2 will be adjudged to have progressive disease.  
 
5. Assigning Response in the Case of Drug Hold  
Isolated increase in serum IgM levels during periods of study drug withholding will not be considered as progressive disease unless 
confirmed by a repeat serum IgM level at least 10 weeks after restarting study drug administration and accompanied by a tota l increase of 
≥ 25% increase in serum IgM and at least 500mg/dL from lowest nadir.  Instead a response of “ IgM Flare ” (IgM -rise of undetermined 
significance) should be selected.  As IgM levels fall , response should be in comparison to the IgM at baseline  
 
6. Missing CT Scans  
During treatment cycles where CT scans are required for subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline that has not resolve d, if a CT 
scan is missed it should be performed as soon as possible.  In cases where a single CT scan is missed a nd the findings remain the same or 
improved from the prior scan, response can be assessed for the intervening cycles using the CT scan obtained prior to the mis sed CT scan.   
If 2 consecutive CT scans are missed, then the best response that can be assessed  during those cycles is an MR (minor response).

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 1.0 Purpose and Objectives  3 
1.1 Purpose  4 
This prospective randomized controlled  trial evaluates  the feasibility of using percutaneous  peripheral nerve 5 
stimulat ion (PNS) to reduce acute post-surgical pain in nontraumatic lower extremity amputation  and 6 
decrease the incidence and/or severity of chronic phantom limb pain (PLP) or residual limb pain (RLP).  7 
The use of a novel, intentionally reversible, single -lead, PNS system has demonstrated promising results in 8 
the management of chronic pain syndromes including PLP and RLP  (7).  This study will apply the same 9 
PNS system to nontraumatic trans femoral or transtibial amputees  (TFA or TTA, respectively) in the post- 10 
operative setting within 5-7 days  after surgery to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of peripheral nerve 11 
stimulation in the management of acute and chronic PLP and  RLP.  12 
1.2 Objectives  13 
The goal of this study is to demonstrate that PNS is a safe, effective method of red ucing acute and chronic 14 
pain in the nontraumatic lower extremity amputee , and can lessen the use of opioid pain medications.  This 15 
pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, 16 
and implementation of PNS in the acute post -operative period to develop a larger, multicent er, blinded, 17 
placebo -controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate  efficacy in reducing acute and chronic PLP and 18 
RLP.   Upon completion, we will assess the reliability and validity of the proposed study design.   In 19 
conducting this investigation, we hop e to a nswer the following questions:  20 
- What is the  feasi bility of placing  a PNS system in a transfemoral or transtibial amputee in the acute 21 
post-operative period?    22 
- Does PNS produce clinically significant reductions in acute PLP or RLP?  23 
- Does the application of PNS in the acute post -operative period  reduce the incidence and severity 24 
of chronic PLP and RLP ?  25 
- Can PNS lessen  the use of opioid and non -opioid pain medications?  26 
- Does  PNS affect time to prosthesis fitting,  function outcomes (F unctional Independence Measure 27 
[FIM]  scores) , wound healing, incidence of neuromas, time to hospital discharge, 30 -day 28 
readmission rate, and hospital discharge survey answers?  29 
1.3 Study Hypothesis  30 
Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation may provide clinically significant relief of acute  post-surgical 31 
pain in nontraumatic lower extremity amputation and decreases the incidence and/or severity of  chronic 32 
PLP and RLP when applied in the ac ute post -operative setting.   33 
2.0 Background  and Significance  34 
2.1 Background  35 
Amputees commonly experience acute and chronic post -amputation pain.  Amputation leads to persistent 36 
pain in up to 70 -90% of patients, resulting in decreased quality of life, increas ed risk of depression, and 37 
negative impacts on interpersonal relationships and ability to work (10).  The prevalence of persistent PLP 38 
or RLP  in amputees is estimated to range from 45 to 74% for RLP and 51 to 85% for PLP (11,  12).  Pain 39 
secondary to loss of limb, rather than the loss of limb itself, has a larger effect on ability to perform activities 40 
of daily living, complete simple tasks, and shows a negati ve correlation with return to work (13).  Post - 41 
amputation pain can also impact the ability to use a prost hesis.  42 
When present, post -amputation pain is difficult to manage. More than 50 different treatments have been 43 
developed for PLP, yet most have been uns uccessful (1).  In many studies, acute PLP intensity was the only 44 
P a g e  3 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 significant independent predictor of chronic PLP intensity at 6 and 12 months after amputation (2).  Liu et 45 
al have demonstrated the most significant risk factor for post -procedure pain (PPP ) for total knee and total 46 
hip arthroplasties to be acute postoperative pain (3).  Increased postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 47 
scores on days 1 to 5 has correlated with PPP at 3 months (4).  48 
Perioperative pain management in lower extremity amputations  commonly involves a multimodal approach 49 
utilizing pharmacologic and interventional therapies  (8).  Both acute and persistent post -amputation pain is 50 
commonly managed with opioids which are associated  with undesirable adverse effects such as nausea, 51 
vomiti ng, sedation, and respiratory depression.  Further, they often result in unsatisfactory reductions in 52 
post-amputation pain and have the potential for addiction and misuse (14).  Several interventional therapies 53 
are available for use in the perioperative se tting, however there is no consistent therapy that has been shown 54 
to prevent the development of persistent post -amputation RLP or PLP (8).  Karanikolas et al demonstrated 55 
that optimized epidural analgesia and/or intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (PC A) in the perioperative 56 
setting decreases PLP intensity, prevalence, and frequency at 6 months  after amputation (23).  This study 57 
did not assess sustained pain relief beyond 6 months, and RLP was not significant in the study population.   58 
Peripheral nerve catheter based pre -emptive analgesia has become  an essential component of  Standard 59 
Medical Therapy  (SMT ) at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center (VA)  in lower extremity 60 
amputations  to prevent onset of chronic pain, decrease opioid use, and decrease health care utilization (both 61 
inpatient and outpatient).  The efficacy of peripheral nerve catheter -based regional anal gesia for pain relief 62 
in the immediate postoperative period is well documented.  However, associated motor, sensory, and 63 
proprioceptive deficits can increase the risk of falling (15) and duration of use is limited due to risk of 64 
infection (16).  This inter vention is limited by the fact that peripheral infusion catheters (typically femoral 65 
and sciatic nerve catheters) must be removed by postoperative day 5 to reduce the risk of  infection.  66 
Furthermore, Apfelbaum demonstrated in a large study that many patient’s worst incidence of postoperative 67 
pain occurs after discharge (5).  Given this safety limitation and the need for continued pain control in the 68 
entire perioperative period, this study seeks  to augment this therapy with a  percutaneously placed PNS 69 
system .  This  is expected to extend the period of perioperative pain control to greater than 30 days  and 70 
beyond . There is convincing evidence  in studies thus far  showing  that when  a PNS system is applied to 71 
chronic pain sufferers, it can extend the treatment effect well beyond the time in which it is implanted.  To 72 
date, the system studied is  the only intentionally reversible , percutaneously placed  PNS system.  More 73 
comprehensive and earlier treatment of acute pain is believed by many in the field to be even more effective 74 
(6,7) . 75 
2.2 Literature Review   76 
PNS has been studied for the treatment of some chronic pain syndromes  (7, 17-19), including persistent 77 
post-amputation pain.  The mechanism of action of peripheral nerve stimulation in pain  relief  is commonly 78 
explained using the “gate control theory” of Melzack and Wall (20).  This theory explains that electrical 79 
current -induced  activation of large -diameter myelinated afferent peripheral nerve fibers inhibits the 80 
transmission of pain signals from small -diameter pain fibers to the central nervous system at the level of 81 
the spinal cord (15).  Rauck et al (7) showed that 9 of 14 sub jects who completed two -week s of PNS therapy 82 
reported reductions in mean daily worst post -amputation pain, average RLP and PLP, and interference from 83 
RLP and PLP at least one month after the end of treatment.  I nterference from  RLP or PLP refers to how 84 
pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, work, relations with others, sleep, and 85 
enjoyment of life.  PNS was shown to be effective in reducing post -amputation pain when most pain is 86 
confined to one or two nerve distributions (7,  21-22).  Results showed that 14 of 16 subjects reported ≥75% 87 
paresthesia coverage  from PNS , obtained clinically significant pain relief, and proceeded to a 2 -week home 88 
trial with this system.  9 subjects completed the 2 -week trial and 5 subjects did not complet e the trial because 89 
P a g e  4 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 of accidental dislodgement (N=2), temporary discomfort near the lead (N=2), and return of post -amputation 90 
pain despite stimulation (N=1). The 9 responders who completed the home trial reported reductions in their 91 
mean daily worst post -amputation pain (56 ± 26%, 56 ± 26%, N = 9), average residual limb pain (72 ± 92 
28%, 42 ± 27%, N = 7), average phantom limb pain (81 ± 28%, 47 ± 48%, N = 7), interference from residual 93 
limb pain (81 ± 27%, 53 ± 17%, N = 6), interference from phantom limb pain  (83 ± 31%, 56 ± 46%, N = 94 
7), and Pain Disability Index  (PDI)  (70 ± 38%, 55 ± 32%, N = 9) during the 2nd week of stimulation and 4 95 
weeks after the end of stimulation, respectively. All 9 responders rated their change in quality of life as 96 
improved at the e nd of stimulation and at the end of the 4 -week follow -up period.  97 
3.0 Scien tific Rationale and Study Design  98 
3.1 Scientific Rationale   99 
The feasibility of using PNS to reduce acute postoperative pain is not currently well documented in medical 100 
literature.  A preliminary report demonstrated the use of PNS to treat pain after total knee arthroplasty in 101 
10 subjects who experienced postoperative knee pain difficult to co ntrol with oral analgesics between 6 and 102 
97 days after surgery.  Nine out of 10 subjects experienced at least 57% decrease in pain, and half had 103 
complete resolution of pain at rest (9).  The application of PNS in the treatment of acute postoperative 104 
amputation pain and the  efficacy of using PNS to prevent or reduce the severity of persistent PLP or RLP  105 
has not been documented . 106 
Current ly, literature documenting the use of PNS in postoperative amputation pain is limited.  The PNS 107 
system in this study has been used previously to evaluat e the reduction in chronic post  RLP or PLP ( 7).  108 
There is an ongoing multi -site investigation evaluating the use of PNS in chronic pain after traumatic lower 109 
extremity amputation.  T o date, there is no study that documents the use of PNS therapy in the acute 110 
postoperative period after TFA or TTA.   This study aims to report on the feasibility and efficacy of using 111 
PNS in this clinical setting to evaluate reductions in acute post -amput ation pain, incidence or severity of 112 
chronic post -amputation pain, and reliance on opioid medications amongst other outcome measures as 113 
described in Section 4 .0: Study Outcomes and Exploratory Measures . 114 
3.2 Study Design  115 
This prospective randomized controlled trial aim s to assess the feasibility of using a novel percutaneous 116 
peripheral nerve stimulator system  to produce clinically significant reductions in acute  post-surgical pain 117 
after nontraumatic lower extremity amputation , and evaluate reductions in  the incidence and/or severity of  118 
chronic  PLP or RLP .  Subjects who have moderate pain 2 to 7 days after transfemoral or transtibial 119 
amputation  surgery  will be enrolled and randomized to Group 1 ( “Treatment  Group ”) or Group 2 ( “Control  120 
Group ”).  Subjec ts in Group 1 will be treated with 30  to 60  days of PNS in addition to SMT .  Subjects in 121 
Group 2 will be treated wi th the SMT  alone.   SMT is defined as the same routine medical care given to all 122 
patients, regardless of whether they  are enrolled in the study.  This may include , but is not limited to non - 123 
opioid and opioid pa in medications, regional  anesthesia  peripheral nerve blockade, daily postoperative 124 
visits by the Acute Pain Service, and follow -up appointments in the Intervention al Pain Clinic.   125 
• Group 1: 30 to 60 days of peripheral nerve stimulation starting within 7 days after surgery and 126 
Standard Medical Therapy  127 
• Group 2: Standard Medical Therapy  only 128 
Subjects are evaluated daily by study investigators from the time of study enrollment to hospital discharge.  129 
Subsequent telephone or outpatient clinic evaluations occur at intervals which are detailed in the Schedule 130 
of Study Procedures  (Appendix ). 131

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 4.0 Study Outcomes and Exploratory Measures  132 
4.1  Primary Outcomes  133 
4.1.1  Effect of PNS on acute pain after lower extremity amputation  134 
The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI)  is a 9 -item questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a 135 
patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning.  The patient is asked to rate their 136 
worst, least, average pain, and rate the degree that pain interferes with gener al activity, mood, walking 137 
ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10 -point scale.  Levels 138 
of PLP and  RLP are re -assessed at follow -up Visits according to the Schedule of Study Procedures .  139 
Questions used to as sess pain or sensati on are listed below.  For BPI  #3, #4, and #5, responses are recorded 140 
on an 11 -point scale from “0” to “10” with “0” defined as “No Pain” and “10” defined as “Pain as Bad as 141 
You Can Imagine.”   142 
• Check yes or no if you experienced any (pha ntom limb or residual limb) sensation in the last 143 
24 hours.  144 
• BPI #3: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by marking the box beside the 145 
number that best describes your pain at its worst  over the last 24 hours.”  146 
• BPI #4: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by marking the box beside the 147 
number that best describes your pain at its least  over the last 24 hours.”  148 
• BPI #5: “Please rate your (phantom limb or residual limb) pain by marking the box beside th e 149 
number that best describes your pain on the average  over the  last week .” 150 
4.1.2  Effect of PNS on the incidence and severity of chronic pain after lower 151 
extremity amputation  152 
Chronic pain (i.e. pain persisting for more than 2 to 3 months after TFA or TTA su rgery will be evaluated 153 
using BPI questions #3, #4, and #5 as above at follow -up Visits according to the Schedule of Study 154 
Procedures.   Data will be compared between groups to assess for differences in the incidence and severity 155 
of chronic pain.   156 
4.2 Secondary Outcomes  157 
4.2.1  Interference due to  Pain  158 
BPI #9 will be assessed at intervals defined in the Schedule of Study Procedures .  This question asks 159 
subjects to rate how pain has interfered with various aspects of life: “Mark the box beside the number that 160 
describes how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with your: (a) General activity (b) Mood (c) 161 
Walking ability (d) Sleep (e) Enjoyment of life.”  Responses ar e recorded on an 11 -point scale from “0” to 162 
“10” with “0” defined as “Does Not Interfere” and “10” defined as “Completely Interferes.”    163 
4.2.2 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale  164 
Participant ratings of global improvement are one of the core ou tcome domains in chronic pain studies 165 
(Dworkin et al. 2005).  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale is assessed at intervals defined 166 
in the Schedule of Study Procedures, which rates perception of change in activity limitations, symptoms, 167 
emotion s, and overall quality of life in relation to pain since beginning treatment.  The scale ranges from 0 168 
defined as “No change” to 7 defined as “A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made 169 
all the difference.”  Responses are collected b y telephone or outpatient office evaluations in the 170 
Interventional Pain Clinic.    171 
P a g e  6 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 4.2.3  Pain Disability Index (PDI)  172 
The Pain Disability Index (PDI) a simple and rapid instrumen t for measuring the impact that pain has on 173 
the ability of a person to particip ate in essential life activitie s. This can be used to evaluate patients initially 174 
to monitor them over time and to judge the effectiven ess of interventions. The index was developed at St. 175 
Louis University Medical Center.   PDI) is assessed at intervals defi ned in the Schedule of Study Procedures, 176 
which measures subjects’ disruption in various aspects of life secondary to chronic pain , including 177 
family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self -care, and life- 178 
support activities.  Each category is rated on an 11 -point scale from “0” to “10” with “0” defined as “No 179 
Disability” and “10” defined as “Worst Disability.”  Responses are collected by telephone or outpatient 180 
office evaluations in th e Interventional Pain Clinic.  181 
4.2.4  Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)  182 
The PCS is a widely -used, validated and reliable 13 -question instrument to assess rumination (4 183 
questions), magnification (3 questions), and helplessness (6 questions) (Sullivan, 2009.; Osman et al. 184 
1997 ). The survey asks participants to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how 185 
often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each question is scored on a 0 -4 scale with 0 = “not at all” 186 
and 4 = “all the time”. Higher scores indicate a greater tendency towards catastrophizing pain, which has 187 
been correlated with worse postoperative pain and response to pain therapies (Riddle et al 2010; Pavlin et 188 
al 2005; Forsythe et al 2008).  189 
4.2.5 Analgesic use and Opioid -related Side Effects  190 
All opio id and nonopioid pain medication use will be assessed at intervals according to the Schedule of 191 
Study Procedures.  The Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program Database will be queried.  Subjects will 192 
be asked if they are taking any medications for pain.  Subjects will be asked to count their remaining number 193 
of pills of narcotic pain medication at each follow -up encounter.  194 
4.2.6  Functional Independence Measure (FIM)  195 
The FIM p rovides a uniform system of measurement for disability based on the International 196 
Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps .  The FIM instrument  measures the level of a 197 
patient's disability and indicates how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities 198 
of daily living.   A baseline m obility FIM will be recorded with the assistance of the Department of 199 
Physical Therapy shortly after amputation but before stimulator placement (Group A) and follow -up FIM 200 
will be recorded at the 4 and 8 -week  outpatient clinic visit s. Improvement in FIM wi ll be evaluated and 201 
compared between groups.    202 
4.2.7 Patient Outcomes and Hospital Discharge Survey  203 
Other secondary outcomes including time to prosthesis fitting, wound healing, incidence of neuromas, time 204 
to hospital discharge 30 -day readmission rate, an d hospital discharge survey will be documented from the 205 
electronic medical record and compared between groups.  206 
5.0 Study Protoc ol 207 
5.1 Study Materials  208 
The SPRINT ™ Peripheral Nerve Stimulator (PNS) S ystem will be used by subjects in Group 1.  Up to two 209 
SPRINT Systems (i.e. 1 lead per stimulator) will be used by each subject.  210 
P a g e  7 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 5.2 Concurrent Medications and Non -Drug Therapies  211 
Subjects in both groups will receive SMT, which may include medication and/o r non -drug therapies.  212 
However, subjects in both groups should not perform any rehabilitation activities that may conflict with the 213 
device Instructions for Use (such as water therapy) during the study.  214 
5.3 Patient Recruitment  215 
Patients planned for nontrauma tic TFA or TTA will be screened at the Vascular Clinic.  A Waiver of 216 
Informed Consent for Recruitment Purposes and  a Waiver of Authorization for Recruitment Purposes will 217 
be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Protected Health Information (P HI) will be used to 218 
locate and review appropriate medical records (CPRS, and paper medical records) to determine study 219 
eligibility.  If a patient  appears to meet all eligibility criteria (see Eligibility, Section 5.4 ), then he/she will 220 
be contacted by study investigators and given information detailing study objectives, procedures, follow - 221 
up encounters, assessments, and potential risks and benefits.  If the patient  agrees to participate, he/she will 222 
be asked to sign the  Consent Form .  Study s taff will explain the process  randomization,  lead placement,  223 
data collection, and follow -up encounters.  All baseline information and outcome measurements will be 224 
collected and recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms.  225 
5.4 Eligi bility  226 
5.4.1  Inclusion Criteria  227 
Inclusion criteria are nontraumatic transfemoral or transtibial amputation (TFA or TTA, respectively) and 228 
age over 18 ..   229 
5.4.2  Exclusion Criteria  230 
Exclusion criteria are systemic infection, immunosuppressive disorder, implanted electronic devices, 231 
pregnancy, previous allergy to skin contact materials and/or anesthetic agent altered mental status, inability 232 
to provide consent, greater than 180 morphine equivalents (MED)  per day.  233 
5.5 Study Plan   234 
The study includes 13 Visits.  Please refer to the Appendix for a schedule of study procedures for both 235 
groups as well as outcomes measured at each visit.   236 
Patients planned for nontraumatic TFA or TTA will be screened  by the study investigators who are working 237 
on the Acute Pain Service (APS) .  APS is usually consulted for all transfemoral and transtibial amputations 238 
to provide perioperative anesthesia, which typically includes placement of a peripheral nerve catheter for 239 
local anest hetic blockade.  When a potential subject is identified, study investigators will begin a chart 240 
review for screening purposes.  The  investigators will review the medical record  of potential su bjects and 241 
complete Form 00  (Screening and D emographic Informati on).  Chart review will include the collection of 242 
name, social security number and date of birth from CPRS, the ORC, and the Vascular Clinic.  Protected 243 
Health Information (PHI) will be used to locate and review appropriate medical records (CPRS and paper 244 
medical records) to determine study eligibility.  If a subject appears to meet all eligibility criteria (see 245 
Section 5.4. Eligibility ), then he/she will be contacted by study investigators and given  recruitment 246 
materials  detailing study objectives, randomi zation, procedures, follow -up encounters, assessments, and  247 
potential risks and benefits.  The subject  will be provided with patient information pertaining to the 248 
peripheral nerve stimulator system under investigation.  If permitted by the subject, a sponso r representative 249 
or their designee may be present at any of the study visits to advise on material handling and answer 250 
questions as needed.  251 
P a g e  8 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 Patients who are interested in participation will be asked to complete a Beck Depression Inventory (see 252 
Form BDI) to be screened for depression (must score 20 or less) prior to enrollment.  Veteran participants 253 
who are evaluated by study staff and suspecte d to be depressed will be further evaluated by a psychiatrist 254 
or psychologist utilizing the Mental Health Consultation and Liaison Service at McGuire VAMC. Research 255 
study staff will page the C&L service at 351 -1067 (Use *601 pager# 9198 after 4pm and on we ekends) and 256 
then walk the participant to the C&L provider to facilitate the evaluation on the day that the par ticipant 257

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 Patients  who agree to participate  in the study  will be asked to sign the Consent Form .  Ideally, patients  262 
should  provide informed consent and be  enrolled in the study prior to surgery.  Typically, th e local 263 
anesthetic peripheral nerve block catheters  (or single shock femoral or sciatic nerve  block ade) are placed 264 
on the day prior to surgery or day of surgery.  Subjects will be given the opportunity to enroll in the study 265 
when the catheter is placed, h owever, those  who wish to decide on enrollment  after their surgery may be 266 
enrolled up until the time in which the ir peripheral nerve  block catheter is rem oved, which is usually by 267 
post-op day 5.  Upon enrollment, subjects will be evaluated by APS daily.   268 
The Consent Form  will be scanned into the electronic medical record .  Consent for photographic and video 269 
recording s will be requested.  If collected, p hotographs and video s are intended for potential use in 270 
publications, future grant applications, and educational purposes.  Subjects will receive a copy of their 271 
consent forms  if requested .  HIPPA Form s will be signed .  The Schedule of Study Procedures  outlines the 272 
baseline information and outcome measures recorded at each “Visit”  on Case Report Forms (CRFs).   All 273 
completed paper documents  will be securely stored  in a locked box placed in a  fixed,  locked file cabinet in 274 
the Interventional Pain Clinic  on 2C .  Only authorized study personnel will have the keys to access study 275 
materials containing protected patient information.  A note may be documented in the patient’s electronic 276 
medical record  to indicate participation in the study.  Subjects will be randomized to Group 1 (“Treatment 277 
Group”) or Group 2 (“Control Group”) (see Section 6. 2. Sampling and Randomization Procedures ). 278 
5.5.1 Visit 1: 24-48 hours  after  removal of  peripheral nerve block  catheter  279 
Subjects will be assessed  at least  24-48 hours after removal of the peripheral nerve catheter  (or after the 280 
effects of a single shot femoral and/or sciatic nerve block have worn off) .  They will be evaluated for post - 281 
surgical complications , and for the presence of phan tom limb sensation or pain and RLP .  Average pain 282 
severity and anatomic distribution will be reported by answering BPI -SF #2 and #5.   283 
Subjects in Group 1 will proceed to Visit 2 and undergo placement of the peripheral nerve stimulator lead(s) 284 
by post -op day 7, in addition to receiving SMT .  Subjects in Group 2 will skip to Visit 3.  They will be 285 
treated with SMT  and followed up by study investigators daily until discharged.  They will subsequently 286 
be followed up by telephone according to the Schedule of Study Procedures.   287 
5.5.2 Visit 2A: Placement of percutaneous peripheral stimulator  leads (Group 1 288 
only)  289 
Subjects randomized to  Group 1 proceed to placement of the stimulator leads  by post -op day 7 to begin  290 
peripheral nerve stimulation therapy  with the SPRINTTM PNS System (Figure 2.1) .  The procedure for 291 
placement of the peripheral nerve stimulator lead  (Figure 2.2)  is similar to placement of a peripheral nerve 292 
catheter for local anesthetic blockade.  The main difference is that instead of delivering medications, 293 
electrical stimulation is applied to the peripheral nerve over a wide range of parameters.  Also, the stimulator 294 
lead do es not need to be placed as close to the nerve as a local anesthetic peripheral nerve catheter.  This 295 
study will evaluate the application o f one or two leads per subject: one for the femoral nerve and/or one for 296 
the sciatic nerve.   Lead placement is expec ted to take up to 2 hours.   297 
Before placement of the lead, test stimulation with a needle electrode is performed to determine an 298 
appropriate location for stimulator  wire lead placement, assess for nerve function, and  to confirm that  the 299 
subject’s pain is responsive to stimulation.  The relevant section of the leg will be cleansed and a test 300 
stimulation needle electrode will be percutaneously inserted within 0.5 -3 cm of th e femoral nerve under 301 
mandatory ultrasound -guidance.  For comfort, l ocal anesthesia may be administered at the insertion site.  302 
The nee dle electrode is connected to the battery -powered electrical stimulator device, which is used to 303 
deliver electrical  stimu lation to confirm electrode placement distance from the nerve trunk.  If the patient 304 
feels subcutaneous sensations proximal to the test needle, which indicates  stimulation of afferent nerve 305 
P a g e  11 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 fibers in the local region superficial to 306 
the electrode, then the needle is 307 
advanced slightly (0.2 -0.5 cm) and test 308 
stimulation is delivered again.  The 309 
process of advancing the needle 310 
electrode and adjusting stimulus 311 
intensity is repeated in small 312 
increments until comfortable 313 
paresthesia  as are evoked in the distal 314 
regions of postoperative amputation 315 
pain without causing uncomfortable 316 
sensations or unwanted motor 317 
contractions .  If this  is not achieved , 318 
the needle electrode is withdrawn , and 319 
the test stimulation procedure is 320 
repeated  until a satisfactory location is 321 
determined .  Once a suitable  entry site is  determined, the fine -wire stimulator lead will be placed. Each 322 
subject in Group 1 may undergo placement of one to two leads  in relation to the femoral and /or sciatic 323 
nerves.  The techniques  and procedures  described below  may be adapted as needed  on a case -by-case basis . 324 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lead placement near the femoral nerve uses an anterior approach guided by anatomic landmarks including 325 
the inguinal ligament, inguinal crease, and femoral artery.  The subject will be in supine position with 326 
ipsilateral extremity slightly (approximately 10 -20o) abducted.  The lead introducer is inserted near but 327 
below the inguinal crease and approximately 1 cm lateral to the pulse of the femoral arte ry.   328

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
  
 
 
 
 
Lead placement near the sciatic nerv e uses the posterior transgluteal or subgluteal approaches that are 329 
commonly practiced in regional anesthesiology.  Landmarks for the transgluteal approach include the 330 
greater trochanter and the posterior superior iliac spine .  The subject is placed in lat eral decubitus position, 331 
and t he lead introducer is aimed  approximately 4 cm distal to the midpoint between the greater trochanter 332 
and the posterior iliac spine to  target the sciatic nerve .  Landmarks for the subgluteal region include the 333 Figure 3.  Example of a percutaneous anterior 
approach that may be used to access the femoral 
nerve. The inguinal crease (noted with dotted 
line), femoral artery (noted with an “A”), and 
needle insertion site (noted with a circled “X”) are 
shown on t he right leg.  Figure 4.  Cross section shows the femoral nerve

 greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity, and the lead introducer is aimed approximately 4 cm distal to 334 
the midpoint between the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity.   335 
 336 
Alternate  anatomic  approaches  for lead placement (e.g. popliteal approach for sciatic nerve) may be utilized 337 
to optimize  safety  and improve patient response.  Once a lead has been placed, stimulus  parameters will be 338 
adjusted to determine the settings  necessary to evoke comfortable sensations that overlap with the regions 339 
of pain associated with  TFA or TTA  surgery .  Parameters which  can be adjusted include amplitude (mA), 340 
duration (μ s), and frequency (Hz).  Study staff will attempt to determine  the parameters which produce the 341 
most comfort as endorsed by the subject.  These parameters will vary from subject to subject and may be 342 
adjusted as needed throughout the study.    343 
Once satisfactory lead placement and stimulus parameters have been achieved, subjects will begin the 30 344 
to 60-day treatment phase.  Subjects will be  provided with a manual  and educated on the use  and care  of 345 
the device .  Stimulation may be delivered continuously up to 24 hours  per day until the end of therapy .  346 Figure 7. Example of a p ercutaneous posterior

 Leads will be indwelling no more than  a total of  60 days.  If a lead is dislodged or broken prior to the end 347 
of therapy, the subject may be offered the opportuni ty for a lead replacement depending on their willingness 348 
to undergo  the lead replacement  procedure  and time remaining in the treatment period .  349 
If the subject provides media consent, photo graph s and video of the lead placement procedure may be 350 
recorded  and are intended for potential use in publications, future grant applications, and educational 351 
purposes. Media may be stored on  VA CAC access computers on a HIPAA -compliant share drive.  352 
5.5.3 Visit 2B: Daily hospital  evaluations until discharge  353 
Subjects in both groups will be evaluated by study investigators daily until they are discharged.  The length 354 
of stay is approximately 14 days for TFA per VASQIP 2016 quarter 4 data (Veterans Affairs Surgical 355 
Quality Improvemen t Program).  Based on this data, subjects in Group 1 will likely be discharged 7 to 14 356 
days after starting peripheral nerve stimulation.  Group 1 subjects w ill be  asked questions to re -assess the 357 
stimulation -evoked paresthesia  coverage of the leg.  Stimula tor devices will be inspected to ensure 358 
appropriate function.  Lead exit sites are inspected for skin irritatio n, infection, and inflammation.  These 359 
risks will be minimized by using sterile leads and sterile technique.  Maintenance, care of the leads and lead 360 
exit sites, and bandage changes will be performed as needed.   Subjects in both groups will be evaluated for 361 
the presence of phantom sensations, as well as least, worst, and average PLP or RLP  according to the 362 
Schedule of Study Procedures.    363 
. 364 
5.5.4 Visits 3, 4 and 5: Wee kly telephone  follow -up evaluations  365 
Visits  3, 4 and 5  consist of weekly telephone  evaluations  at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after starting peripheral nerve 366 
stimulation  (Group 1) or discontinuation of peripheral nerve block (Group 2) .  If issues related to the 367 
peripheral nerve stimulator device or leads occur and cannot be resolved by telephone, subjects may be 368 
evaluated in the Interventional Pain Clinic as needed.   369 
Subjects are asked to rate their worst, least, and average PLP and RLP  (BPI #3, #4, and #5).  A medical 370 
reconciliation will be completed during each phone evaluation by asking the subject how many pills of 371 
narcotic pain medications they have left and querying the Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program 372 
Database.   373 
5.5.5 Visit 6 : First outpatient clinic evaluation  / 30 days after start of PNS  374 
All subjects are asked to return to the Interventional Pain Clinic at 4 weeks after the start o f peripheral nerve 375 
stimulation .  Stimulator devices (Group 1) will be inspected to ensur e appropriate function.  Lead exit sites 376 
are inspected for skin irritation, infection, and inflammation.  Maintenance, care of the leads and lead exit 377 
sites, and bandage changes will be performed as needed.   378 
All s ubjects are asked to rate their worst, least, and average PLP and RLP (BPI #3, #4, and #5).  Subjects 379 
will rate the degree with which pain has interfered with general activity, mood, walking ability, sleep, and 380 
enjoyment of life (BP I #9).  Pain Disability Index (PDI) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 381 
will be assessed.  A medical reconciliation will be completed during each phone evaluation by asking the 382 
subject how many pills of narcotic pain medications they have left and querying the Virginia  Prescription 383

5.5.7 Visit 10: Second outpatient clinic evaluation /  up to  60 days after start of PNS  394 
All subjects are asked to return to the Interventional Pain Clinic at approximately 60 days after starting  395 
peripheral nerve stimulation  (Group 1) or discontinuation of peripheral nerve block (Group 2) .  Stimulator 396 
leads will be removed by gentle traction.  The lead will be visually inspected by study staff to evaluate for 397 
lead fracture   In the case of a retained lead fragment, study staff will determine the most appropriate medical 398 
plan to further evaluate and treat the subject.  In most instances, retained lead fragments do not need to be 399 
removed and are rarely associated with further complications.  Lead exit si tes are inspected for skin 400 
irritatio n, infection, and inflammation.   Both groups will continue to be treated with SMT  as needed until 401 
the end of participation in the study.   Subjects in Group 1 are encouraged to complete the entire 60 -days of 402 
peripheral nerve stimulation, however are free to discontinue treatment at any time during the treatment 403 
phase.   404 
5.5.8 Visits 11, 12, and 13: Phone evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months a fter study 405

5.8 Study Duration  453 
The duration of this investigation is exp ected to be 18 -24 months.  We anticipate enrolling 2 -4 patients  per 454 
month.  Each patient’s  participation will last approximately 12 months.  455 
6.0 Data  Management  456 
6.1 Sample Size  457 
The investigation seeks to broaden the knowledge of the effects of neuromodulation on acute post -operative 458 
pain in nontraumatic lower extremity amputation.  The aim is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing 459 
PNS in TFA or TTA in the acute post -operative p eriod. 16 subjects will be randomized into two groups 460 
with 8 each .  Sampling will not be restricted by race or gender.  The sample size of 16 is expected to allow 461 
the investigators to conduct a cost -effective yet informative pilot study to assess the logistics of placing the 462 
device as described in this protocol, evaluate safety, and report any clinically significant differences in 463 
primary and secondary outcomes between Treatment and Control Groups.  The study outcomes will be 464 
reported in nontraumatic T FA or TTA, many of which are secondary to dysvascular disease.  Although this 465 
is a specific subset of all amputations that are performed, dysvascular disease accounts for a sizeable 466 
proportion of limb loss in the US with an estimated prevalence of 38 -82% ( 24, 25 ).  The results of this 467 
investigation will be used to refine the study design, recruitment, randomization, retention, and assessment 468 
procedures, and ultimately develop a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to further evaluate 469 
P a g e  17 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 treatment e fficacy, adverse effects, and cost efficiency.  To improve generalizability, subsequent 470 
investigations will seek to include a wider subset of amputations which may be accomplished with the 471 
addition of more study sites.  472 
6.2 Sampling and Randomization Proced ures 473 
Based upon historical data on amputations at  the HHM -VAMC, there are  estimated to be one to two 474 
amputations per week that would qualify for enrollment in this study.   Subjects will be screened  for 475 
enrollment  through the vascular surgery  clinic .  A considerable proportion of vascular clinic patients will 476 
require lower  extremity amputation and are usually scheduled for next day surgery due to the urgency  of 477 
presentation .  Study investigators will conduct a chart review of potential subjects and comple te Form 01 - 478 
A (screening and demographic information).  Based on the chart review, if a patient  appears to meet all 479 
eligibility criteria, then they will be contacted by study investigators  for potential enrollment.  If the patient 480 
agrees to participate, the y will be consented and randomized to Group 1 or Group 2.   481 
Prior to the start of this study, a member of the study staff that is not involved with recruitment or data 482 
evaluation will be respo nsible for generating a random string of group assignments long enough to fill all 483 
anticipated spots  in this study.  The numbers will be placed in secure envelopes by blocks of two.  A block 484 
of two will contain one assignment to the Treatment Group and one assignment to the Control Group.  As 485 
subjects are consented and  enrolled in the study, they will be assigned an envelope which randomizes them 486 
to a group.  Subjects are not blinded to their group assignments.  Subjects in the Treatment Group will 487 
receive t he investigational treatment ( 30 to 60-days of peripheral nerve stimulation ) in addition to SMT .  488 
Subjects in the Control Group will be treated with the SMT  alone.  489 
6.3 Data Analysis  490 
A table of outcome measures recorded during the study can be found in Appendix.  Scores rating daily 491 
average, worst, and least pain will be compared between groups.  Changes in pain will be evaluated for 492 
individual subjects and compared between groups.  For each subject, mean pain scores over the first and 493 
second months following TFA or TTA surgery will be calculated.  An ov erall mean across all subjects will 494 
be calculated.  Additionally, sub -analyses will be performed to determine if there is a difference in these 495 
outcomes between groups over different post -operative phases (such as acute (e.g. days 1 -30) or subacute 496 
(e.g., 1-3 months), or chronic (e.g. >3 months)).  Statistical analysis will be performed with two -sample t - 497 
test, and p -values will be reported without adjustment, consistent with feasibility study design and the 498 
number of subjects.   499 
Pain medication usage will b e recorded in subject diaries and obtained during follow up encounters. Opioid 500 
medication use will be analyzed by averaging 24 -hour morphine equivalent dosing (MED) over each 501 
follow -up interval and comparing groups.  Changes in opioid medication use will b e reported for individual 502 
subjects by calculating morphine equivalent dosing (MED).  Average MED will be calculated and 503 
compared between groups.  The time to cessation of opioid use will be reported.  Side effects associated 504 
with opioid use will be assesse d at each visit and the number of side effects occurring over various intervals 505 
will be recorded.  Analgesic -related outcomes will be compared between the Groups.  506 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) , Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),  and Pain Disabi lity Index 507 
(PDI)  scores will  be averaged for each group and compared .  Data regarding  functional outcomes 508 
(Functional Independence Measure [FIM] score),  time to wound healing, incidence of neuromas, prosthesis 509 
fitting, time to hospital discharge, 30 -day readmission rate, and hospital discharge survey will be compared  510 
between groups.   511

Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 7.0 Risks and Benefits  512 
7.1 Potential Benefits  513 
It is possible that subjects in this study may not receive any direct benefit from their participation in this 514 
study.  If the investigational treatment is successful, subjects in the Treatment Group may have a reduction 515 
in acute post -amputation pain, decreased probability of developin g chronic post -amputation pain, less 516 
interference due to pain, decreased opioid medication use, increased tolerance for rehabilitation and 517 
accelerated functional improvement.  This research may benefit future patients with post -operative pain 518 
following TFA  or TTA.   519 
7.2 Potential Risks  520 
The devices used in this study  have been cleared by the  United States Food and Drug Administration to 521 
provide postoperative analgesia.  Potential risks include infection, lead fracture, lead migration and/or 522 
dislodgement, nerve injury, bleeding, skin irritation, increased pain, and discomfort on insertion, during use 523 
or with withdrawal.   However, t here may be other risks that are currently  unknown.  The incidences 524 
provided are all estimated except for lead fracture. The risks listed below are described as either common 525 
(occurring more than 10% of the time), uncommon (occurring about 2 -10% of the time), or rare (occurring 526 
less than 1% of the  time).   527 
7.2.1  Infection  528 
Based on pre vious studies using this PNS system , the risk of infection is rare.  When compared to 529 
continuous femoral nerve block and/or continuous sciatic nerve blocks, the risk of infection from a 530 
percutaneously placed lead near these nerves is expected to be l ower .  The risk is thought to be mitigated 531 
by the inherent structure and design of the lead.  Unlike nerve block catheters, PNS leads do not have an 532 
internal conduit through which bacteria can enter the body.  The coile d structure of the fine wire lead allows 533 
it to stretch when pulled, rather than move in to or out of the insertion site.  This is thought to minimize the 534 
potential of introducing bacteria into the body. Lastly, the electrode is designed to have a tight elec trode - 535 
skin barrier to help prevent bacterial inoculation .  Infection risk will be minimized by using sterile leads 536 
and thoroughly cleansing the insertion site with antibacterial solution at the time of insertion.  The insertion 537 
site will be covered with a dressing to keep it clean and dry, and the subjects will be instructed to inspect 538 
the site for signs of infection or irritation regularly and to inform the investigator if they occur.  If infection 539 
occurs, the investigator may administer an antibiotic and/ or remove the lead.  540 
7.2.2  Lead fracture  541 
Lead fracturing  beneath the skin is a common risk , with most or all fractures occurring during the procedure 542 
to remove the lead .  When this occurs, one or more lead fragments  may remain in the body.  Granuloma 543 
(mild tissue inflammation) is directly related to the risk of retained electrode fragments.  The investigators 544 
will inspect the lead after removal to determine if any fragments were retained in the body.  If there is 545 
suspicion of a retained fragment, the investigator will determine if removal of the lead is medically 546 
necessary.   In most cases, removal is not necessary unless there are further sequalae associated with the 547 
fragment, such as infection or granuloma.  Retaine d fragments may also be removed if the subject desires.  548 
The impact of retained fragments in situ  is minimal  and in most cases, retained fragments do not need to be 549 
removed .  550 
7.2.3  Lead migration and /or dislodgement  551 
It is possible for a lead to migrate fro m its original position or be come dislodged (i.e.  entirely  removed  from 552 
the insertion site ) during the 30 -day treatment period.  This is a common risk.  If migration occurs, the 553 
subject may experience discomfort during stimulation.   Stimulation near the skin surface may be perceived 554 
P a g e  19 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 as “pins and needles” which may be uncomfortable to the subject .  Please see below for the steps taken 555 
cases of discomfort associated with the PNS system.  In cases of significant migration or complete 556 
dislodgement, a replacement lead may be inserted  depending on the desires of the patient and time 557 
remaining in the tr eatment period .   558 
The risk of lead migration or dislodgement is reduced by providing  instructions to the subject and their 559 
caregiver, as appropriate, to ensure careful handling of the lead and lead connector during bandage changes.   560 
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the lead migrates from its original location.  Stimulation 561 
near the skin surface may be perceived as a “pins and needles” sensation and may be uncomfortable.  562 
Stimulation parameters or a new lead may be placed if necessary for a dditional comfort .  A tingling 563 
sensation may be felt under the pad but this sensation is not expected to be uncomfortable.  564 
7.2.4  Nerve injury  565 
The risk of mechanically damaging a nerve with the introducer is rare and will be mitigated by using 566 
ultrasound to visualize the nerves, surrounding landmarks, and relative position of the introducer. Though 567 
the lead placement procedure is like the procedu re used for  regional anesthesia  nerve block s, the lead can 568 
be placed further away from the  nerve when compared to placement of nerve block catheters . The risk of 569 
nerve injury may be further reduced by proper subject positioning and slow advancement of the 570 
introducer, stopping approximately 0.5 – 3 cm proximal to the nerve.  571 
7.2.5  Bleeding  572 
The risk of bleedi ng from lead placement is rare and is expected to be no greater than the risk of bleeding 573 
related to peripheral nerve block catheters.  INR for anticoagul ated patients will be available for review as 574 
patients undergoing surgery will have this checked as a part of routine pre-operative assessment.    575 
7.2.6  Skin irritation  576 
It is a common risk for skin to become irritated at the lead exit site, under the stimulator pad (a modified 577 
surface electrode that is positioned between the skin and the stimulator device), in the area surrounding the 578 
lead insertion site, and at the site where an adhesive bandage and  lead connecter are taped to the skin.  Skin 579 
irritation is reduced by excluding patients with known sensitivity to skin -contact materials (stickers, 580 
bandages, tape etc.).  Subjects and their caregivers will be advised to examine the electrode exit site at 581 
regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation.  To avoid irritation under the pad and lead connector 582 
tape, subjects will be advised that the stimulator and pad may be moved to various locations near the lead 583 
insertion site throughout the study.  To  avoid irritation under the belt, subjects will be instructed to move 584 
the belt as needed.  In addition, subjects will be instructed to avoid placing the pad, belt, lead connector 585 
tapes, or bandages on unhealthy skin .   586 
7.2.7  Discomfort  or increased pain  on insertion, during use or with withdrawal  587 
Like procedures involving percutaneously inserted needles (e.g., injections, needle electromyography , 588 
acupuncture ), discomfort associated with test stimulation/placement of the stimulator lead is possible.  589 
Usual ly the discomfort is transient and improves shortly after needle insertion.  Subjects are asked to 590 
provide feedback on pain or discomfort experienced during the procedure.  Symptomatic relief with local 591 
anesthesia may be used to reduce discomfort.   592 
Electr ical stimulation is perceived by the subject as tingling  or vibratory sensations.  These sensations are 593 
expected to be comfortable, however it is possible that they can cause discomfort or pain.  Uncomfortable 594 
sensations are  likely  directly related to stim ulus intensity, which is adjust ed on the PNS stimulator .  Pain is 595 
typically associated with higher intensity levels.  During the lead placement procedure, stimulus intensity 596 
is adjusted to the determine the minimum and maximum range of intensities that pro duce comfortable 597 
P a g e  20 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 sensations without discomfort or pain .  Prior to completion of the lead placement procedure, an appropriate 598 
stimulation intensity is set.  Further, the subject can select from a range of intensities determined by the 599 
investigators as safe and unlikely to cause discomfort.  If a subject ever feels pain related to stimulation, 600 
they can turn down the intensity or turn the stimulator off.   601 
Subjects may experience worsening of pain symptoms or may not obtain any therapeutic benefit from the 602 
system.  Worsening pain could be caused by natural changes in pain during post -operative recovery and 603 
rehabilitation, or may be caused by electrical stimulation, or the presence of the lead.  This is a common 604 
risk, but worsening pain is expected to be tran sient, resolving without additional treatment.  Subjects can 605 
have their stimulation parameter s adjusted throughout the study  for optimal comfort, or treatment may be 606 
discontinued.  These risks are mitigated by clinical training on the safe limits of stimul ation and the proper 607 
placement of the leads . 608 
7.3 Risk -Benefit Analysis  609 
All efforts will be made to reduce the incidence of the potential risks described above.  Despite taking all 610 
necessary precautions, these events , as well as unanticipated events  may sti ll occur.  All procedures will be 611 
performed by trained attending physicians working within their scope of practice.  Practices will be 612 
maintained to mitigate the potential risk s discussed above .  If an event occur s, the potential for significant 613 
harm is low because the risks presented have non -serious consequences.  Further, t he subjects in the 614 
Treatment Group may gain no direct benefit from electrical stimulation.  This investigation  has inherent 615 
risks to Treatment  Group subjects which are justifiable based on the following rationale : 616 
The insertion of needles targeting the femoral or sciatic nerves carries the risk of damaging unintending 617 
structures including nerves, blood vessels, organs, and joint spaces.  The ris k of damage to these structures 618 
is reduced by utilization of ultrasound guidance, knowledge of  anatomic  landmarks, and awareness of 619 
needle position and depth.  The physicians performing placement of the PNS system are trained in regional 620 
anesthesiology  with experience in the placement of peripheral nerve block catheters  or will receive the 621 
appropriate training necessary to safely conduct the procedure.  Lead placement for the peripheral nerve 622 
stimulator requires a  needle  distance that is further from the ta rget nerve than does placement of a peripheral 623 
nerve block catheter  (5 – 30 mm and 2  mm, respectively).  The increased distance between target nerve and 624 
needle should lower the risk of injury to unintended structures.  Further, evoked responses to electric al 625 
stimulation are used to guide lead placement (i.e. the needle is advanced slightly; once stopped, stimulation 626 
is applied and the subject is evaluated for responses; process is repeated as needed).  If damage to a nerve 627 
occurs from direct mechanical inju ry or nerve compression secondary to hematoma, symptoms are expected 628 
to occur within 24 -48 hours.  Subjects are instructed to contact study personnel if any changes in medical 629 
status occurs.  630 
The risk of irritation or infection from needle insertion is redu ced by cleaning the lead insertion site using 631 
aseptic technique, sterile test needles, and lead introducer needles .  Needles are not reused.  Subjects with 632 
systemic infection and/or immunosuppressive disorders will be excluded.  Subjects are instructe d to contact 633 
study personnel in case of any change in medical status.  634 
The risk of discomfort associated with needle insertion or electrical stimulation are possible.  Discomfort 635 
arising from needle insertion is usually transient and resolves shortly after needle insertion.  Subjects are 636 
asked to provide feedback regarding sensations, pain, or discomfort experienced during the lead placement 637 
procedure and throughout the study.  The test needle and lead introducer needle can be repositioned as 638 
necessary to ob tain the most comfort.  Local anesthetic will be used as needed to reduce discomfort during 639 
the procedure.  Stimulation parameters can be adjusted throughout the study to obtain the most comfort.  640 
P a g e  21 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 Lead fracture and subsequent retention of lead fragments is possible.  Study personnel will inspect the lead 641 
upon removal to look for signs of fracture.  Usually, no treatment is required for retained fragments unless 642 
an infection or granuloma occurs.  The  study investigators will determine the most appropriate course of 643 
treatment.   644 
The potential benefits expected from successful treatment include reduction in pain intensity after TFA or 645 
TTA surgery in the acute post -operative setting, decrease in the inci dence and/or severity  of chronic post - 646 
amputation PLP or RLP , reduction in opioid medication use, increased tolerance for rehabilitation and faster 647 
functional recovery.  This research may benefit future patients with post -operative pain following TFA or 648 
TTA .  Additionally, the PNS system used in this study has not been formally investigated to be used in the 649 
acute post -operative setting after TFA or TTA.  Information regarding its efficacy and utility in this setting 650 
may be useful in determining the most app ropriate applications for this system  in the future .  The potential 651 
risks associated with the use of this PNS system have non -serious consequences and are expected to be 652 
uncomplicated to manage.  The risks are justifiable  by the potential benefits .  The in formation to be gained 653 
in this study may be used to refine further research within the area of peripheral nerve stimulation for the 654 
mana gement of post -operative pain.  655 
8.0 Data and Safety Monitoring  656 
Primary and secondary outcomes will be recorded at each follow -up visit.  Study investigators will retain 657 
study -related documents in double -locked filed cabinet in 2C -117.  The PI or an investigator will conduct 658 
a data and safety monitoring review once eve ry 8 weeks in which Case Report Forms and any AE forms 659 
are evaluated.  Safety information is also assessed at outpatient study visits and by telephone calls.  If study 660 
investigators determine that the PNS tr eatment is unsafe to continue (i .e. systemic infe ction, increased pain 661 
that is intolerable  to the subject, need for implantable electronic device that requires discontinuation of the 662 
PNS), then PNS will be discontinued as appropriate.  663 
8.1 Serious Adverse Events  664 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be record ed on Form AE and the IRB will be notified within 5 days of 665 
occurrence.  Monitoring for SAEs will occur at each follow -up encounter.  Subjects will be asked if they 666 
are experiencing any increased discomfort, pain, skin irritation, or bleeding.  At the outp atient follow -up 667 
visits, the PNS lead exit site will be examined and the stimulator device will be interrogated to ensure proper 668 
functioning.  Any adverse event  will be investigated and managed as appropriate.   Subjects are instructed 669 
to notify study pers onnel by telephone (804 -675-5188) in case of any changes in medical status as soon as 670 
possible.  If investigators need to be reached after normal business hours, subjects will be given instructions 671 
on how to page study staff who call the subject as soon as  possible.   672 
Details regarding any observed adverse event  and its relation to the PNS system will be coll ected on Form 673 
AE.  The severity of the AE will be classified as mild (event that causes mild discomfort or inconvenience 674 
and resolves without treatment), moderate (event that requires medical intervention or medication to treat), 675 
or severe (event that requires interventio n to prevent permanent impairment or damage, an event that 676 
requires or prolongs hospitalization, or an event that is disabling, causing permanent damage, life 677 
threatening, or causing death).  Any treatment necessary related to the AE will be documented.  AEs will 678 
be followed to resolution, even i f a subject is discharged  from the study  early.  Adver se events will be 679 
documented and reported so that the safety profile of this system  may be further understood.    680 
8.2 Confidentiality  681 
All subjects who sign a Consent Form  will be  asked to provide name, social security number, and date of 682 
birth.  We will use this information to create a “unique identifier” to protect patient confidentiality.  The 683 
P a g e  22 | 25 
Protocol Version 1.2 –  June 11, 2018   
 unique identifier will be used in place of  the subjects’ names for all data collection forms and study 684 
databases.  A master list linking the subjects to the unique identifier will be maintained by study 685 
investigators  in 2C-117.  The number of subjects to be enrolled does not include screen failure s.  A record 686 
will be maintained of all subjects that are screened at the Vascular Clinic .  A Subject Identification log will 687 
be completed for all subjects enrolled in the study.  Information pertaining to subjects are accessible by 688 
study personnel in the e lectronic medical record.  Information to be collected includes age, race, gender, 689 
height, weight, past medical and surgical history, and eligibility criteria will be assessed as outlined in Form  690 
00.  Preliminary screening will be used to determine a subje ct’s eligibility for study participation.  All 691 
patient sensitive information, study related documents and materials will be stored in a secure d, locked 692 
cabinet in 2C-117.   693 
The protection of patient confidentiality is of utmost importance.  Subject names a nd personal identifiers 694 
will not appear in any publications resulting from this research.  Subjects will be informed that the IRB and 695 
regulatory authorities will have access to records that identify them as individuals.  All applicable HIPA A 696 
regulations wi ll be followed.  697 
9.0 Consultants  698 
Non-sensitive data resulting from this study will be made available to Robert Litwack, M.D. for assistance 699 
with data analysis.  Outcome measures (e.g. pain scores and patient survey scores) without sensitive 700 
identifying informat ion will be communicated to Dr. Litwack via VA regulated email and Safe Access File 701 
Exchange (SAFE) to ensure secure transmission of study information.  Data will be transmitted at various 702 
periods during the study and a final data set will be created at th e end of the study duration.  703 
 704 
Nate Crosby, Ph.D. of SPR Therapeutics has assisted with  protocol development.  His research background 705 
as well as  knowledge of the SPRINT PNS System and ongoing studies with the device in chronic post - 706 
amputation pain and total knee arthroplasties has been important to the development of this protocol.  He 707 
will assist in training the study investigators in placement of the device.  He will continue to p rovide advice 708 
during the study as needed.   709

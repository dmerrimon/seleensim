CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL203 Amendment 1  
05 October 2015  
 
Original Protocol UX003-CL203 (dated 09 January 2015) has been modified by 
Amendment 1 to expand the study size and to add or clarify certain procedures. The major protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Overall Study Design and Plan: In Section 7.1 and re lated sections, the study size 
has been increased from up to 7 subjects to approximately  15 subjects including 
approximately 5 infants with hydrops fetalis. 
Rationale :  Increasing the sample size will provide a more robust assessment of safety 
and efficacy  in this patient population. 
2. Study Procedures and Assessments : Several updates have been made to clarify or 
add procedures in Section 7.5. Given the age of the study population and number of assessments,  if the maximum amount of blood has been taken based on Maximum 
Allowable Blood Volume Guidelines for any subject on any given study visit, some assessments will not be  required. A provision has been established in the study-
specific Laboratory Manual for details on prioritizing blood draws. Additional 
modifications to study procedures and assessments specified in the protocol text are 
summarized below. 
Urinary and serum GAG : Reference to the NRE as the primary method for 
measuring urinary and serum GAG has been removed from the protocol. Rationale: Multiple assays for measuring pathologic accumulation of GAG are 
available. The specific methodology used for evaluating the primary efficacy variable 
will be included in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Functional Development : The protocol has  been updated to specif y the Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development
® – Third Edition ( Bayley-III) will not be 
administered if the subject has achieved the highest raw score on the instrument, or if, based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator, valid and reliable administration is 
not possible at the specified visit.  
Rationale : The protocol previously specified the highest level of age-equivalence on 
the test as a criterion for omitting the Bayley -III assessment ; the change to raw score 
provides a more straightforward threshold. The option to withhold assessment based

Amendment 1:  05 OCT 2015  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
on Investigator opinion provides a measure of flexibility thereby avoiding unreliable 
or spurious results due to mitigating factors such as language difficulties or clinical condition of the subject.  
Motor Functioning :  A gross m otor milestone checklist has been added as an 
additional assessment of motor functioning as a tertiary efficacy variable .  
Rationale:  A gross motor milestone checklist was designed to allow for assessment of 
the functional status of the subject requiring limited language interaction and physical 
handling.  
Pulmonary Function Testing:   Pulmonary function assessments have been added to 
the Continuation Period; pulse oximetry measurements will be obtained at 12- week 
intervals. 
Rationale: Continued monitoring of pulmonary function will provide a potential 
measure of maintenance of efficac y. 
Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover:  Assessment of serum markers of bone 
formation and bone resorption including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), carboxy-terminal cross -linked telopeptide of type I collagen ( CTX-I), bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase (BALP) , and vitamin D will be conducted at Weeks 0 (baseline) 
and 2, then approximately every 8 weeks thereafter for the remainder of the  
Treatment Period  (i.e. Weeks 8 -48), and every 24 weeks during the Continuation 
Period. 
Rationale:  Skeletal abnor malities are characteristic of MPS 7. Measurement of 
biochemical markers of bone turnover may allow the effects of UX003 on skeletal tissue to be evaluated .  
Drug Concentration Measurements:  Specific time points for collection of PK 
samples have been provided. 
Vital Signs:  Procedures for the assessment of vital signs have been clarified.  
Rationale:  Vital sign assessments have been clarified to be specific for young 
pediatric subjects.  
3. Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Drug Events: A new section (Section 8.5.5) 
has been added to provide direction on the reporting requirements for suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), ECs, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL203 Amendment 2  
07 April 2016 
 
Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 05 October 2015) has been modified by Amendment 2 to 
remove or clarify certain procedures and update information. The major protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Overall Study Design and Plan:  
• The protocol has been updated to remove reference to availability of c ommercial 
drug in the subject’s territory as a reason for study termination. In addition “end of trial” has been defined in Section 7.5.1 as the last visit of the last subject undergoing evaluation in the study. As the planned duration of treatment in this study is up to 240 weeks, the end of trial is defined as the Week 240 visit of the last subject. In the event the study is terminated by the Sponsor prior to Week 240, all subjects should complete a termination visit and the date of the last termination v isit of the last subject would define the end of the trial.  
Rationale : This change and additional clarification were made to align with 
current regulatory guidelines. 
• Revised protocol to allow for Mutation Analysis at any point of the study. 
Rationale : To further characterize the disease manifestations, severity and 
progression of MPS 7, the sponsor aims to determine the specific genetic mutation in each patient enrolled if consent is provided for such testing.   
• Clarify the h andling of spinal cord compression. 
Rationale : Patients with MPS diseases are at risk for spinal cord compression due 
to disease- related skeletal abnormalities including odontoid hypoplasia and 
vertebral subluxation.  Enzyme replacement therapy may result in increased joint flexibility with possible impact on the risk of spinal cord injury.  Additional te xt 
was added to the protocol to recommend appropriate monitoring and management of signs and symptoms of potential spinal cord compression.   
• Removal of serum GAG from the continuation period. 
Rationale: Based on clinical and nonclinical evidence, uGAG is a direct 
pathophysiological and readily measured marker of the MPS disease process and a reasonable predictor of treatment effect and  clinical benefit. Urine GAG is the 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
primary measure of ERT efficacy in MPS disorders and will continue to be 
followed during this continuation period. Multiple assays for measuring 
pathologic accumulation of GAG in urine are now available; supplementary assays may be performed. Removal of serum GAG assessments reduces the number of required blood draws.  
• Record Retention  has been updated to state that all study records must be retained 
for at least 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with national law.  
Rationale: This admini strative change has been made to reflect upcoming changes 
to EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by other health authorities.  
2. Study Procedures and Assessments :  
• Vital Signs:  Procedures for the assessment of vital signs have been clarified.  
Rationale:  Vital sign assessments have been clarified to be specific for young 
pediatric subjects.

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open-label Study of UX003 rhGUS Enzyme Replacement Therapy in MPS 7 Patients Less than 
5 Years Old 
PROTOCOL NUMBE R: 
UX003-CL203 
STUDY SITES: 
Multicenter; approximately 2-6 sites globally 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2 
RATIONALE:  
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome) is an ultra- rare (< 100 cases currently identified 
worldwide), chronically debilitating, and life- threatening lysosomal storage disease.  It is characterized 
by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (GUS), required for degradation of two 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, the same substrate s accumulated 
in MPS 1  (Hurler syndrome) and MPS 2  (Hunter sy ndrome).  The GUS deficiency results in 
lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in multiple tissues and organs throughout the body and numerous clinical symptoms similar to those observed in MPS 1 and MPS 2.  Some MPS 7 patients present at 
birth with severe edema o r non-immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within  2-4 months. 
There are currently no approved treatments for MPS 7.  UX003 (recombinant human 
beta-glucuronidase, rhGUS) is intended as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of 
MPS 7.  A Phase 1/2 study has shown that treatment with UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and 
urinary GAG (uGAG) and is expected to provide clinical benefit; a pivotal Phase 3 study is ongoing.   
Patients with MPS 7 can present as newborns, infants or young children; this Phase 2 study will 
evaluate treatment with  UX003 in MPS 7 patients less than 5  years of age . Although young patients 
have the same underlying etiology , the breadth and type of clinical problems can be different, 
including more frequent ascites/edem a, cardiac problems, and other severe manifestations.  This study 
will assess the relative safety , pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of UX003 ERT in young patients 
with MPS 7 . 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective : 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of UX003 treatment in pediatric MPS 7 subjects less 
than 5 years of age on:  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Efficacy as determined by the reduction of uGAG excretion 
Secondary Objective : 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of UX003 on growth velocity  and 
hepatosplenomegaly .

Tertiary Objectives : 
Tertiary objectives are to assess PK and evaluate the effect of UX003 on  measures of lysosomal 
storage, overall clinical change, cardiac and pulmonary function, bone turnover  markers, and 
functional and motor development. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
UX003-CL203 is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of UX003 
in pediatric MPS 7 subjects.  The study seeks to enroll approximately 15 subjects less than 5  years of 
age at the time of informed consent, and will attempt to include approximately 5 infants with hydrops 
fetalis if possible. Subjects with prior exposure to UX003 treatment under a n emergency  IND may 
also be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor.  In the initial 48 weeks of treatment, subject s will 
receive UX003 via intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 4 mg/kg every other week (QOW) . Subjects 
who complete the 48-week study may choose to continue UX003 treatment in the Continuation Period 
up to 240 weeks, or until the subject withdraws consent, the subject is discontinued from the study at 
the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated . Figure 2.1 provides a 
schematic of the overall study design.  
Figure 2.1: UX003-CL203 Study Schema  
 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED: 
Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled including  approximately 5 subjects with hydrops fetalis. 
Subjects under the age of 5 years at the time of informed consent with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 
will be enrolled. Due to the extremely low prevalence of the disease, the sample size is not based on 
statistical considerations but rather the ability to find qualifying patients.  
Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the study after receiving study drug may be replaced on a 
case-by-case basis, at the discretion of Ultragenyx . 
DIAGNOSIS AND CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION:  
Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 based on leukocyte or fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme assay, or 
genetic testing  
2. Under 5 years of age at the time of informed consent  
3. Written informed consent of Legally Authorized Representative after the nature of the study has 
been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures 
 

Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016

Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate in the  
study: 
1. Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has evidence of any degree of 
detectable chimaerism with donor cells  
2. Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS  or its excipients that, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects  
3. Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) other than UX003 within 
30 days prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all 
scheduled study assessments at any time during the study  
4. Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the Investigator, which may not 
allow safe study participation.  For patients with  hydrops fetalis, the ongoing interventions to 
manage fluid balance can be continued; if the addition of ERT is considered a fluid-overload risk, 
the individual should be excluded.  
5. Has a concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at 
high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with 
study participation or affect safety.  Since hydropic patients have a high rate of mortality, the risk 
of death prior to 1 year of age should not be considered sufficient to exclude the patient from the study for compliance.  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
UX003 is a sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS at a concentration of 2 mg/mL filled to allow withdrawal of a minimal of  5.0 mL deliverable volume and supplied in a 10 m L glass vial. 
UX003 will be administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW  by slow IV infusion over approximately 
4 hours.  Infusions will be administered on a rate schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by an increase in rate to minimize the potential for infusion associated reactions ( IARs); the 
infusion rate may be slowed to manage or reduce IARs . 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
No reference  therapy will be administered in this study . 
DURATION OF TREATMENT:  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is 48 weeks.  Subjects successfully completing the first 48 weeks may continue treatment for up to 240 weeks (5 years) or until one of the following occurs: 
the patient withdraws consent, the patient is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the 
Investigator or Ultragenyx,  or the study is terminated . 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence and frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including clinically significant changes from study baseline to scheduled time points in: 
• Physical examination findings  
• Vital signs and weight  
• Clinical laboratory evaluation s 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 7 
• Concomitant medications  
• IgG antibodies to rhGUS 
• Complement C3, C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) 
Management of Infusion Associated Reactions  
As has been observed in other MPS enzyme therapies, some subjects may experience IARs associated 
with the administration of UX003. Consequently, appropriate measures have been incorporated into 
the study design in order to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions. These measures include 
prophylactic premedication of subjects with antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates to mitigate the potential for infusion reactions.  The protocol also incorporates measures to minimize 
pain and distress, including the optional use of topical anesthetics to ease the pain of placing an IV line 
and the option for an in- dwelling catheter.  
Primary Efficacy Variable: 
• Urinary GAG Excretion
:  First morning void urine will be evaluated for uGAG concentration and 
normalized to urinary creatinine concentration.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables:  
• Growth will be assessed by anthropometric measurements including standing height (length or 
sitting height as applicable) , head circumference,  and weight. Growth velocity will be calculated 
and compared with pre- treatment growth velocity when available  and published normative data 
for age and gender.  
• Hepatosplenomegaly :  The volume of the liver and spleen will be determined using ultrasound. If  
an ultrasound is not possible, the liver and spleen should be assessed by physical exam. 
The volume of liver and spleen will be compared to baseline and to normal values if available. 
Ascites will also be assessed.  
Tertiary Efficacy Variables:  
• Additional GAG measures  including serum GAG and supplementary uGAG assays  
• Clinical Global Impression Scale:  Physicians caring for each subject will provide a global 
assessment of change f rom baseline or change from identification of a new finding using a seven 
point scale ranging from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (significant improvement).  The Clinical  
Global Impression (CGI) scale will be supported by reported changes in a list of disease- specific 
abnormalities projected to respond to treatment.  
• Functional Development  will be assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
Development® – Third Edition ( Bayley-III). 
• Motor Functioning will be assessed by a motor development milestone checklist. 
• Cardiac Ventricular Mass :  Ventricular mass will be assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) and 
scored as a z -score relative to normal ventricular mass. Valvular and cardiac function may also be 
evaluated . 
• Pulmonary Function :  Pulse oximetry will be used to assess problems in adequate respiration ; 
resting O 2 saturation will be measured  while the subject is breathing room air.   
• Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover (BTMs) : Levels of serum markers of bone formation and 
bone resorption will be measured including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide  (P1NP), carboxy-
terminal cross- linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BALP), and vitamin D.

Pharmacokinetic Parameters derived from Population PK Analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity  (AUC 0-∞) 
• AUC from time zero to the time of last measurable concentration  (AUC 0-last) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• Elimination half -life (t1/2) 
• Total clearance of drug after  IV administration (CL) 
• Apparent volume of distribution based upon the terminal phase (Vdz) 
• Apparent volume of distribution at steady- state (V dss) 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, the mean, the 
standard error, median, minimum, and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the 
frequency and percent dist ributions will be provided.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will also 
be presented when appropriate.  
Analyses may be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. There is no 
unblinding during analysis since it is an open-label study.  
Analysis Sets:  
The full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of  UX003 during 
the study.  
Safety Analysis :   
The primary safety analysis will evaluate the safety of UX003 as measured by the incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled time 
points in safety parameters.  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by System Organ 
Class and Preferred Term, relationship to study drug, and severity. No statistica l significance will be 
assessed. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. The frequency and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (i.e. outside of reference 
ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for 
each clinical laboratory measurement.  For each clinical laboratory measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent visits.  Changes from baseline to the post- treatment 
visits will also be provided.  Descriptive statistics of vital signs, imaging assessments, and concomitant medications will be provided in a similar manner.  
Changes in findings from baseline physical examinations will be tabulated and listed for each subject 
by examination category.  If there are examination findings that change in more than one subject, these 
will be tabulated in a separate table and expressed as the number of subject s with the change out of the 
total. 
Anti-drug antibody data will be tabulated  over the course of the study. The number of subjects 
converting to a positive antibody assay value defined as a titer increase of five-fold or more over baseline, and the time of  onset of a positive antibody response will be determined.  
Descriptive statistics on the titers achieved and the time of onset of the response will be provided 
(mean, standard deviation, median, range).

Efficacy Analyse s:   
The study is a small open- label study to obtain some clinical efficacy data from a small cohort  of these 
ultra-rare patients. A complete hypothesis testing statistical approach is not plausible in this setting, 
but a reasonable approach to assessing for the biologic efficacy of UX003 will be made.   
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate the mean percent change in uGAG excretion from Week 0 
(Baseline)  to Week 48 using the generalized estimating equation ( GEE) analysis method .  
For subject(s) previously treated with UX003 under a n emergency  IND, perce nt change from initial 
baseline (prior to first dose of UX003) will be used, if the initial baseline data are available.  The null 
hypothesis of no change in mean uGAG excretion will be tested. An additional analysis will also be 
performed on the Week 24 time point. 
Secondary analysis on growth and hepatosplenomegaly will be evaluated to compare pretreatment 
with post treatment effects. Growth rate will be compared to historical data from medical records  and 
also compared to published norma tive data for age and gender  (if available) . Changes in findings from 
baseline for other efficacy variables will be tabulated for each subject.  Comparisons of certain efficacy 
variables with published normative data based on age and gender m ay also be conducted. 
A full description of the statistical evaluations will be provided in the Statist ical Analysis Plan .

5  INTRODUCTION 
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited metabolic disor ders caused by 
the deficiency of any of the enzymes involved in the stepwise degradation of 
glycosaminoglyc ans (GAGs). Although many MPS characteristics are similar, each disease is 
a distinct entity arising from deficiency of a specific enzyme.  MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an 
ultra-rare, chronically debilitating, and life threatening lysosomal storage disease, and one of 
the rarest of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Varying in severity and progression rate, MPS 7 symptoms may include: abnormal coarsened facies, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular complications, joint stiffness, short stature, and a skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex. Most MPS 7 patients die before the second or third decade of life due 
to compounding medical problems. So me MPS 7 patients present at birth with severe edema 
or non-immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within 2-4 months.   
Despite nearly two decades of animal research demonstrating effective treatment with 
enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT) in MPS 7 models and the success of ERT in four other 
MPS disorders (MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 4A and MPS 6), there is no  approved treatment 
available for MPS 7 . Development in this disease has not proceeded because the extreme 
rarity (less than 100 patients identified worldwide and an estimated incidence rate of less 
than 1 per 250,000 births ) and clinical heterogeneity has made it impractical to approach with 
traditional clinical study designs and endpoints.   
UX003 is a formulation of recombinant human beta- glucuronidase (rhGUS), intended as an 
ERT for MPS 7 . Ultragenyx has conducted multiple clinical studies to  support UX003 
development. Ongoing i nterventional studies include a Phase 1/2 study to assess safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of UX003 treatm ent, and a confirmatory randomized 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study conducted in MPS 7 patients aged 5 – 35 years . 
Additionally , a Phase 3 long-term extension study to assess long- term safety and efficacy for 
patients who complete the phase 3 study or enrolled in other UX003 studies is on- going.  
This study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of UX003 when administered to MPS 
7 patients less than  5 years of age.    
5.1 Overview of MPS 7 
MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder 
originally described by William Sly and colleagues in 1973 ( Sly et al. 1973). MPS 7 is the 
second rarest of the MPS disorders with fewer than 100 patients identified worldwide and 
also the most heterogeneous of the MPS disorders. MPS 7 is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GUS, which is required for the degradation of two GAGs: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. This deficiency results in GAG accumulation in many tissues and organs, leading to numerous clinical symptoms similar to those observed for MPS 1 (Hurler Syndrome) and MPS 2 (Hunter Syndrome) ( Neufeld et al. 2001).

MPS 7 genotypes/phenotypes have been studied for many years (reviewed in ( Tomatsu et al. 
2009)). A total of 49 unique mutations were identified in a total of 103 mutant alleles found 
in 56 patients, with 9% of the alleles unidentified. Missense mutations account for 78.6% of 
total alleles; the remaining were nonsense mutations , deletions, or splice site mutations, all 
likely leading to a null genotype and severe phenotype. This is a much higher frequency of missense mutations than is normally found in other MPS diseases. For example, in MPS 1, nearly 70% of alleles are nonsense w ith two dominant stop mutations accounting for a large 
fraction of all mutations (Scott et al. 1995). 
The clinical course and disease progression of MPS 7 comprises a wide spectrum of severity.  The most severe form of the disease can uniquely present at birth with hydrops fetalis, a severe neonatal condition in which the child retains an enormous amount of fluid throughout the body (Vervoort et al. 1996). Infants with hydrops fetalis rarely survive beyond a few 
weeks to a few m onths of age ( Neufeld et al. 2001 ).   
Patients with severe MPS 7, who are not born with hydrops fetalis, present as infants or young children with typical Hurler (MPS 1) -like features (Neufeld et al. 2001). Diagnosis of 
MPS 7 is often made through clinical examination and urine tests for excess glycosoaminoglycans excreted in the urine ( Sewell et al. 1982) . Due to the clinical 
heterogeneity of the disease, it is recommended that GUS activity in all suspected cases of lysosomal storage disease be evaluated through enzymatic analysis of leukocytes or fibroblasts ( Lee et al. 1985 ). Clinical features include hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary 
infections,  cardiac problems, corneal clouding, hearing loss, hernias, joint stiffness, short stature and dysostosis multiplex.   
Many patients experience progressive pulmonary problems as a result of airway obstruction  (enlarged adenoids and tonsils, secretions, infections and tracheal abnormalities) leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, eventually requiring tracheostomy. Significant respiratory restriction combined  with frequent recurrent and chronic nasopharyngeal and 
respiratory infections can lead to progressive respiratory compromise and failure (Kakkis et 
al. 1996b);  (Neufeld et al. 2001) . Heart disease is also common in patients with severe MPS 
7, although it may not develop or manifest until later in life. Valvular insufficiency due to thickening and calcification of the valves, arterial lesions of the coronary arteries and obstruction of the thoracic aorta like that observed for Hurler syndrome, have been described (Kakkis et al. 1996b). In severely affected MPS 7 patients, GAG storage in the coronary 
vessels along with pulmonary insufficiency can lead to cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale and/or death.   
MPS 7 patients generally have a variety of the typical findings of dysostosis multiplex with significant variability. This may include odontoid dysplasia with atalantoaxial instability as in other MPS disorders. Storage within the synovium and other joint tissues can lead to significant restriction of mobility in the hip, shoulder, elbow and knee joints as in other MPS disorders. All of these disease complications can result in severe pain or the inability to walk, often resulting in the use of a wheelchair. Additional symptoms include hearing loss, cataracts, and corneal clouding among others.

Life expectancy for most individuals with MPS 7 is into the teenage or young adult years, 
however severe MPS 7 patients may die within the first few years of life or at birth with severe hydrops (Vervoort et al. 1996). Mortality is commonly due to cardiovascular or 
respiratory complications.  
5.2 Enzyme Replacement Therapy for MPS Disorders  
The primary treatment modalities for MPS dis orders are ERT and hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. Both approaches provide active enzyme to replace the deficiency and confer substantial benefit, but are not curative. ERT is now commercially available for MPS1 (Aldurazyme ®, laronidase), MPS 2 (Elaprase®, idursulfase), MPS 4A (Vimizim®, 
elosulfase alfa), and MPS 6 (Naglazym®, galsulfase).  At present, there are no approved 
treatments for MPS 7. Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to establish safety and efficacy of ERT in MPS diseases  ((Hendriksz et al. 2014) ; reviewed in (Valayannopoulos et 
al. 2011)). The treatment regimen for ERT involves weekly (QW) or every other week (QOW) intravenous (IV) infusions of the recombinant human enzyme.  Many patients treated 
with ERT experience infusion- associated reactions  (IARs).  Observed clinical benefits 
include improved walking ability, joint range of motion, improved lung function, decreased liver volume, and decreased (but not normalized) uGAG levels. Most MPS patients develop antibodies to the recombinant enzyme; in some severely affected MPS 1 patients, antibody titer was inversely related to the reduction in uGAG levels (Clarke et al. 2009 ).   
Clinical study data in the Phase 3 studies of laronidase, idursulfase , galsulfase have 
demonstrated significant predictive value of uGAG levels. The uGAG levels are significantly reduced during the first 4- 6 weeks of ERT treatment, then  reach a plateau  
(Wraith et al. 2004) , (Kakkis 2002) , (Harmatz et al. 2006) ; the clinical effect evolves over 
the next 6 -12 months. This pattern of uGAG reduction preceding clinical effect is expected 
considering the additional time needed for inflammation and injury to heal and recover following the resolution of lysosomal storage, and is consistent with the potential of uG AG 
to predict tissue response.  In the clinical studies, changes in uGAG were able to differentiate between effective and less effective dose regimens, with reductions of >50% associated with substantial efficacy based on clinical measures ( Table 5.2.1). In all cases, uGAG reduction 
≥ 50% was associated with significant clinical benefit.  For idursulfase, the QOW regimen showed less than 50% reduction a nd less efficacy; this difference was detected and predicted 
by the uGAG levels early in the study (Muenzer et al. 2006). For this reason, a measure of 
uGAG should be predictive of changes in lysosomal storage conducive to clinical improvement in  MPS patients.

5.3 Brief Overview of UX003 Development  
UX003 is intended as an IV ERT for the treatment of MPS 7. A brief overview of existing 
information on UX003 is provided below; a comprehensive review of available data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Ultragenyx ), which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.   
5.3.1 Brief Description of UX003 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is produced in a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the normal full length human 
GUS protein. The rhGUS protein is synthesized as an 80 kDa monomer with 651 amino 
acids remaining after removal of the 22 amino acid signal peptide ( Oshima et al. 1987).  
After glycosylation at four N -linked glycosylation sites at asparagines 173, 272, 420 and 631, 
the apparent molecular weight is 82 kDa for each monomer.  Although usually intact at the C-terminus after production, once delivered to the lysosome, proteolysis removes 18 amino acids from the C -terminal end to form a 78 kDa monomer  (Islam et al. 1993) . Biologically, 
purified rhGUS exists as a ~332 kDa homotetramer with two active sites per tetramer.  
The active drug substance is purified using standard chromatography methods and 
formulated for IV administration .

5.3.1.1 UX003 Mechanism of Action  in MPS7 
UX003 belongs to a class of ERTs that  includes approved products for MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 
4A, and MPS 6. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is a member of the 
lysosomal hydrolase family of enzymes that catalyze breakdown of complex carbohydrates.  
Human GUS catalyzes the hydrolysis of β D- glucuronic acid residues from the non- reducing 
end of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate ( Vervoort et al. 1996) . In vitro and in vivo, 
rhGUS is taken up by cells and tissues by the cation independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIM6PR) vi a the mannose 6 -phosphate recognition residues located on the 
enzyme’s N -linked oligosaccharides. Uptake by the CIM6PR occurs in a large number of 
tissues and is important for the maximal effectiveness of the enzyme. The enzyme can also be taken up by the mannose receptor (MR) due to some terminal mannose residues located on high mannose N- linked oligosaccharides. Clearance by the MR occurs mainly by the cells 
in the reticuloendothelial system: the spleen, Kupffer cells in the liver, and circulating macrophages in the plasma. Together, these recognition signals are responsible for the rapid 
clearance and tissue distribution of infused lysosomal enzymes such as rhGUS from the circulation.  Both types of delivery can have therapeutic benefit as tissues with the MR also manifest substantial GAG storage in the MPS disorders, although the mannose 6-phosphate system is sufficient for uptake into all cell types . 
5.3.2 Nonclinical Studies  
Ultragenyx has conducted a comprehensive nonclinical program to support the chronic Q OW 
IV administration of UX003. In addition, the nonclinical pharmacology of recombinant GUS has been evaluated in a large number of published studies in vitro and in murine models of MPS 7. Studies of potential clinical significance and relevan ce to this protocol are 
summarized below. Additional details are provided in the IB. 
Nonclinical studies have been completed in MPS 7 mice  (including newborns). 
The nonclinical toxicology program includes five studies , including an 8- week 
biodistribution study in tolerant MPS 7 mice, a GLP acute toxicity study in Sprague 
Dawley rats, a 26-week chronic toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, and dose 
range-finding developmental toxicity studies  in rabbits and Sprague Dawley  rats. At dose 
levels up to 20 mg/kg QOW, no toxicologically -significant findings were related to the 
administration of UX003. These studies support a 5-fold safety factor relative to the 4 mg/kg  
dose planned in this clinical study. The no observed adverse- effect level (NOAEL) for sing le 
IV dose administration in these studies was 20 mg/kg. A large number of studies in MPS 7 mouse models have shown that recombinant GUS 
distribute s to many tissues and significantly reduces or prevents lysosomal storage during 
treatment (O'Connor et al. 1998) , (Sands et al. 1994) , (Sands et al. 1997) , (Sands et al. 2001) , 
(Vogler et al. 1996), ( Vogler et al. 2005) . Biodistribution of rhGUS has been seen in many 
tissues affected by MPS 7 including the brain, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, bone and lung (Vogler et al. 2005), ( Grubb et al. 2008), ( Sly et al. 2006).  The reduced lysosomal storage 
following ERT correlates with significant pathologic improvement and clinical benefit, with

prolonged effects including dramatic improvements in bone development, growth, cognitive 
ability, hearing, immune function, and survival ( Sands et al. 1997), ( Sands et al. 2001), 
(Vogler et al. 1996). Additionally, treatment of MPS 7 mice with high doses of rhGUS 
resulted in widespread delivery of enzyme as well as delivery across the blood- brain barrier 
with corresponding reductions in lysosomal storage in nearly all tissues, including the brain. 
The increased enzyme levels and accompanying reduction in lysosomal storage correlated with both dose and duration of treatment ( Vogler et al. 2005). Histopathologic evaluation of 
tissues from MPS 7 mice showed no pathologic effects related to the enzyme- mediated 
increased clearance of heparan sulfate and dermatan  sulfate. 
5.3.3 Previous Clinical Studies  
The first in -human use of UX003 was sponsored by  at the Steven and 
Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York under an emergency IND granted by the US FDA. A  old patient with advanced multi- system MPS 7 including 
respiratory insufficiency was treated with 2 mg/kg rhGUS  QOW; the case study and results 
following initial treatment were recently reported (Fox et al. 2014). Through 24 weeks of 
treatment, a decline in uGAG excretion (~ 65%) and a sustained reduction in the size of the 
enlarged liver and spleen have been observed. The data through 52 weeks also show improved pulmonary function, oral feeding, and increased activity level. No drug- related 
serious adverse events ( SAEs) or IARs have been reported (Fox et al . 2015). 
A second emergency IND was granted to treat a  old MPS 7 infant born with severe hydrops fetalis ( , New York University School of Medicine). The patient has 
received infusions for 48 weeks ; uGAG was reduced by approximately 70% after several 
infusions. No drug- related IAR s have occurred  in this Investigator sponsored trial.   
An open-label Phase 1/2 study in 3 subjects aged 5, 9, and 25 years is ongoing to assess the 
safety, efficacy, and dose of UX003 in MPS 7 subjects via IV administration QOW for 36 weeks with provisions for additional tr eatment during the Continuation Period 
(UX003-CL201; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], EudraCT 2013-001152-35). UX003 has been administered 
up to 4 mg/kg in this study. Results through 36 weeks of treatment suggest a reduction in 
uGAG excretion and decreases in liver size relative to baseline  at 4 mg/kg, with no SAEs or 
drug-related IARs reported; the most common AEs have been  infections and gastrointestinal 
disorders. 
A Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study is being conducted to confirm safety and 
efficacy of UX003 treatment in MPS 7 patients aged 5 – 35 years (UX003-CL301; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   A Phase 3 long- term open-label treatment  extension study to assess l ong-term safety and 
efficacy of UX003 treatment in MPS 7 patients (UX003-CL202).  A comprehensive summary regarding previous clinical  experience on the use of UX003  is 
provided in the UX003 IB.

5.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits 
An initial Phase 1/2 study has shown that UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and uG AG 
and is expected to provide clinical benefit. Data from nonclinical toxicology and safety 
pharmacology studies, along with published data from MPS 7 mouse model studies, provide guidance on potential benefits and risks of UX003 treatment. The nonclinical data support the safe use of  UX003 when dosed at 4 mg/kg (5- fold safety factor ). The risk for off- target 
effects is reduced by the extreme specificity of the enzyme and the fact that the mechanism of action for GUS is restricted to the lysosome. The enzymati c activity of GUS has a pH 
optimum between 3.5 and 4.5 (data on file). At pH 7 near the pH of plasma, enzymatic activity is drastically reduced. Hence, the ability of GUS to degrade heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate outside of the lysosome is limited.  
In addition, an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with ERT for other closely related MPS disorders makes it possible to anticipate benefit-risk profile with UX003.  Clinical trial data and experience with marketed ERT products for the treatment of related 
MPS disorders (MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 4A, and MPS 6) supports the safety and efficacy of 
MPS ERT as a class. These therapies have been approved and distributed to more than 
40 countries worldwide, with hundreds of patients treated for several ye ars. Laronidase has 
now been marketed for more than 10 years without a significant change in the benefit- risk 
profile. In each of these programs, the reduction in lysosomal storage was demonstrated by reductions in liver and spleen size and uGAG excretion. The reduction was associated with clinically important changes in mobility, pulmonary function, joint stiffness, and other reported findings. 
Studies have also been conducted in MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 4A, and MPS 6 patients less than 
5 years of age, showing benefit in reducing storage and improving some aspects of disease 
(Wraith et al. 2007) , (Giugliani et al. 2 014), (Haller et al. 2013) , (Lampe et al. 2014). 
Early treatment with ERT can provide important benefit s in improving growth, skeletal 
disease and overall clinical outcome (Laraway et al. 2013). 
The most common adverse effects of ERT relate to increased antibody titers and IARs.  
There have been no other consistent adverse effects across the different MPS disorders.  
Though IARs represent the most serious safety concern with ERTs, appropriate measures have been incorporated into the design of the current study to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions.  These measures include prophylactic premedication of subj ects with 
antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates.  The large fraction of MPS 7 patients 
with missense mutations are expected to  exhibit a reduced immune response to ERT due to 
the presence of residual protein, consistent with observations in the tolerant mouse ( Sly et al. 
2001) and MPS 1 patients  undergoing ERT ( Yogalingam et al. 2004).  
The clinical experience with UX003 in pediatric and adult patients with MPS 7 has 
demonstrated a sustained reduction in uGAG levels and clinical improvement. With no treatments currently available for this progressive, ultimately -fatal genetic ultra- rare disease, 
a clear medical need exists for a novel disease-modifying approach that holds the potential 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 27 
for altering the clinical course of disease progressi on. Overall the safety and efficacy data 
from clinical and nonclinical studies in combination with an understanding of the risks 
associated with ERTs for other MPS disorders indicate the benefit -risk ratio of UX003 is 
sufficient to support treatment of ped iatric MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age . 
5.5 Study Rationale 
MPS 7 is an ultra-rare (< 100 cases currently identified worldwide), chronically debilitating, 
and life-threatening lysosomal storage disease.  Some MPS 7 patients present at birth with severe edema or non -immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within 2-4 months. There are 
currently no approved treatments for MPS 7. UX003 is intended as an ERT for the treatment of MPS 7. A Phase 1/2 study has shown that treatment with UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and uGAG and is expected to provide clinical benefit; a pivotal Phase 3 study is ongoing.   
Patients with MPS 7 can present as newborns, infants or young children; this Phase 2 study 
will evaluate treatment with UX003 in MPS 7 patients less than 5  years of age. Although 
young patients have the same underlying etiology, the breadth and type of clinical problems can be different, including more frequent ascites/edema, cardiac problems, and other severe manifestations. This study will assess the relative safety, PK, and efficacy of UX003 ERT in young patients with MPS 7 .

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
UX003-CL203 is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy 
of UX003 in pediatric MPS 7 subjects. The study seeks to enroll approximately 15 subjects 
less than 5 years of age at the time of informed consent, and will attempt to include 
approximately 5 infants with hydrops fetalis if possible. Subjects with prior exposure to UX003 treatment under a n emergency  IND may also be enrolled at the discretion of the 
Sponsor. In the initial 48 weeks of treatment, subjects will receive UX003 via IV infusion at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW. Subjects who complete the 48-week study may choose to continue UX003 treatment in the Continuation Period up to 240 weeks, or until the subject withdraws consent, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investig ator or 
Ultragenyx,  or the study is terminated . Figure 7.1.1 provides a schematic of the overall study 
design. 
Figure 7.1.1: UX003-CL203 Study Schema  
 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Given the history of ERT in the MPS field, this study is expected to show that UX003 (rhGUS) can reduce lysosomal storage and improve clinical function in MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age with an acceptable benefit -risk ratio. The population of MPS 7 patients 
less than 5 years of age is very small and heterogeneous; therefore it is not feasible to 
conduct a parallel group or placebo -controlled study to assess safety and efficacy. 
To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of UX003, two interventional stu dies are being  
conducted in pediatric and adult MPS 7 patients between the ages of 5 and 35 years.   
This study of UX003 has incorporated several elements to make efficient and safe use of a 
variable and vulnerabl e group of subjects and leverage the extensive existing data and 
lessons learned from other UX003 treatment protocols and approved ERT programs.  The single-arm, open -label study design provides active treatment to all subjects with this 
extremely rare and serious life -threatening disease, while maintaining appropriate safety and 
efficacy standards  in order to gain additional information about UX003 treatment in MPS 7 
patients less than 5 years of age. Once a subject has demonstrated acceptable long -term 
safety and efficacy following the initial 48 weeks of treatment, continuation of UX003

treatment will be available . The Continuation Period enables treatment for up to a total of up 
to 240 weeks and has been designed with a reduced frequency of assessments to  minimize 
inconvenience and discomfort for the subject.   
7.3 Selection of Study Population 
The study will be conducted in approximately 15 pediatric MPS 7 subjects. The study seeks 
to enroll subjects under the age of 5 years, and will attempt to include at le ast 5 infants with 
hydrops fetalis , if possible; subjects with prior exposure to UX003 treatment under an 
emergency  IND may also be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. The inclusion criteria 
are structured to enroll subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7. To enroll subjects 
most likely to benefit from treatment and demonstrate safety and effectiveness of UX003, MPS 7 patients who have undergone successful bone marrow or stem cell transplantation will be excluded from the study.   
The Sponsor has taken reasonable measures to ensure the protection and safety of this 
population. Appropriate pediatric expertise will be available at all trial sites, and site personnel will be focused on minimizing risk, fear, pain and distress during conduct of the study. The protocol incorporates measures to minimize pain and distress including use of 
topical anesthetic to ease the pain of placing an IV line and the option for an in -dwelling 
catheter. Prophylactic premedication of subjects with antihistamine,  and staged and 
controlled infusion rates mitigate the potential for IARs.  
7.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 based on leukocyte or fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme assay, or genetic testing  
2. Under 5 years of age at the time of informed consent 
3. Written informed consent of Legally Authorized Representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any research- related procedures  
7.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate in the study:  
1. Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has evidence of any degree of detectable chimaerism with donor cells  
2. Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS  or its excipients that, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 31 
3. Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) other than UX003 
within 30 days prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments at any time during the study  
4. Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the Investigator, which may not allow safe study participation.  For patients with hydrops fetalis, the ongoing interventions to manage fluid balance can be continued; if the addition of ERT is considered a fluid-overload risk, the individual should be excluded.  
5. Has a concurrent disease or condition tha t, in the view of the Investigator, places the 
subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or affect safety.  Since hydropic patients have a high rate of mortality, the risk of death prior to 1 year of age should not be considered sufficient to exclude the patient from the study for compliance.  
7.3.3 Removal of Subjects from T herapy or Assessment  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, subjects have the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time for any reason.  The I nvestigator and Ultragenyx also have the right to 
remove subjects from the study.  Ultragenyx must be notified of all subject withdrawals as 
soon as possible.  Ultragenyx also reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue participation of an individual subject or Investigator due to poor enrollment or noncompliance, as applicable. 
Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable AE  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, might place the subject 
at risk or invalidate the study  
• At the request of the subje ct (or legally authorized representative) , Investigator, or 
Ultragenyx, for administrative or other reasons 
• Protocol deviation or unreliable behavior 
If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the AE and any related test or 
procedure results will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed onto the case report form (CRF ).  Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically 
meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve.  If such abnormalities do not return to normal within 
30 days after the last dose given, their etiology should be identified and Ultragenyx should be notified.  All unscheduled tests must be reported to Ultragenyx immediately. 
If a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, every reasonable effort should be made 
to perform the Early  Termination Visit procedures within 2 weeks of  the last dose of study 
drug. 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 32 
Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the study after receiving study drug may be 
replaced on a cas e-by-case basis, at the discretion of Ultragenyx.  
7.3.3.1 Stopping Rules  
Individual subjects who experience any unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely 
drug-related SAEs (Section 8.5.3) that represent a change in the nature or an increase in 
frequency of the serious event from their prior medical history or known MPS 7- related 
medical issues will be assessed as to whether t he subject will continue on the study.   
The Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee ( EC) will be informed should 
unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely study drug-related SAEs occur. A full 
evaluation of the event will be performed in order to make a decision regarding what actions to take, including whether to recommend stopping the study. 
7.4 Treatments  
UX003 is a sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS at a concentration of 
2 mg/mL filled to allow withdrawal of a 5.0 mL deliv erable volume and supplied in a 10 mL 
glass vial. UX003 will be administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW by slow IV infusion over 
approximately 4 hours. Infusions will be administered on a rate schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by an increase in rate to minimize the potential for IARs; the infusion rate may be slowed to manage or reduce IARs. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for full details on study drug preparation and administration.   
7.4.1 Investigational Product 
UX003 (recombinant human beta-glucuronidase, rhGUS) is a multimeric glycoprotein 
produced using a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line to secrete the 
human lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. The mature form of the enzyme consists of 651 amino acids. The drug product is formulated at 2 mg/mL rhGUS in UX003 formulation 
buffer (refer to the Pharmacy Manual for buffer excipients) . UX003 is supplied as a sterile 
solution for IV administration packaged in single use 10 mL glass vials and is stored at 2 to 8°C. 
The study drug is manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to current Good 
Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP) regulations.   
7.4.2 Reference Therapy  
The protocol is designed as an open- label active treatment study, therefore no reference 
therapy wil l be administered in this study.

7.4.3 Study Drug Infusion Procedure  
Study drug (UX003) will be administered QOW by slow IV infusion over a period of 
approximately 4 hours. Subjects will be pre -medicated prior to infusions and study drug will 
be administered on a rate -schedule t hat minimizes the potential for IARs. The infusion will 
begin at a low rate that will be gradually increased, as tolerated by the subject, until the planned maximum rate is reached.  
7.4.3.1 Pre-Dose Medication  
The subject should fast for a minimum of 1 hour prior to the infusion and for the first 2 hours of infusion. If the subject is tolerating the infusion, clear liquids or oral electrolyte solutions (e.g. Pedialyte) may be instituted. This requirement may be removed if after 12 weeks of 
treatment, the Investigator feels that the patient is fully tolerating infusions.  
Approximately 30 – 60 minutes prior to each infusion of study drug and after performing pre-infusion efficacy assessments, all subjects will be pretreated with an appropriate dos e of 
antihistamine me dication. Non -sedating antihistamines, such as cetirizine  or loratadine, are 
preferred. For subjects who have a history of IARs or other risk factors (e.g. history of 
allergies), a sedating antihistamine (e.g. diphenhydramine or chlorphe niramine) may be 
administered. IV antihistamine (diphenhydramine dihydrochloride) may be used for 
premedication if oral is not acceptable, but the doses should be one- half the usual dose when 
given IV due to a potential increased sensitivity to these agents in MPS patients (Dr. Kakkis, personal observations). Antipyretic medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be administered at the d iscretion of the Investigator. For subj ects with IARs, slowing the 
infusion rate is important but additional premedication with agents such as H
2 blockers, 
stronger anti- histamines,  or glucocorticoid s may be considered . 
7.4.3.2 Infusion Procedure  
The amount of study drug (UX003) will be determined based on the most recent subject 
weight (in kg). The volume of study drug calculated to deliver the correct dose will be withdrawn from the vial and aseptically transferred to an infusion bag of normal saline for a final 2-3 fold drug dilution. Undiluted UX003 must never be infused. 
PLEASE NOTE FOR PREPARATION OF INFUSION SOLUTIONS :  UX003 (rhGUS) 
is a recombinant protein and is therefore sensitive to bubbles and aggressive mixing that can lead to denaturatio n and loss of enzyme activity. When preparing diluted infusion solutions, 
the product should be withdrawn VERY SLOWLY through a sufficiently large needle (18 gauge) to minimize shear and turbulence. When adding study drug solution to an infusion 
bag, this must be done slowly, with liquid to liquid contact and without generating bubbles or turbulence; the bags should be rocked gently for mixing. Shaking of vials or infusion bags or “volutrols” devices in which aggressive mixing and bubbles can occur are not acceptable.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for complete instructions on calculating drug dosage and preparation.  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 34 
Study drug will be administered by slow IV infus ion over approximately 4 hours. 
Infusions will be administered on a rate -schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially 
followed by an increase in rate that minimizes the potential for infusion reactions and may be 
slowed to manage or reduce IARs. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details on the infusion rate schedule. Topical eutectic  mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) cream or 
equivalent may be applied to the IV site prior to the infusion to ease the pain of placing an IV line. 
A second IV site on the opposite arm from the infusion will be used for the blood samples taken for PK analy sis. At the discretion of the Investigator, an in- dwelling IV catheter (such 
as a Port-a-Cath
® or other brand) may be inserted if there are difficulties in achieving IV 
access for the QOW infusions. If the second IV fails and PK samples cannot be collected  
from the second IV, the main IV line may be use for the post-infusion sampling after flushing the line thoroughly with saline. The samples taken through the same line as the infusion 
should be noted on the CRF as being drawn from the same line.  
Equipment necessary for resuscitation must be available during study drug infusion. 
7.4.4 Selection of Doses and Study Duration  
The planned UX003 dose of 4 mg/kg is based on data from clinical studies in pediatric and 
adult MPS 7 patients, and further supported by nonclinical  studies in the MPS 7 mouse 
model and relevant species . The nonclinical data support chronic QOW administration of 
UX003 at dose levels up to 4 mg/kg, providing a 5-fold safety factor.   
The therapeutic ERT doses in prior successful programs for other MPS disorders (0.58, 0.5, 
2 and 1 mg/kg weekly for MPS 1, 2, 4A and 6, respectively) were based on comparable doses that exhibited efficacy in their respective animal models. PK data in MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 4A 
and MPS 6 subjects demonstrate that doses of 0.2 to 2 mg/kg are adequate to achieve enzyme concentrations of ~10-207 nM in the circulation.  These enzyme levels are 
approximately 10- to 30-fold the uptake constants (1-7 nM) for the mannose 6 phosphate receptor and are believed to saturate delivery of enzyme to the tissues (Kakkis et al. 1994) ; 
(Kakkis et al. 1996a ); (Kakkis et al. 2001) ; (Dvorak-Ewell et al. 2010). Similar uptake 
constants (1.2-2.6 nM) were obtained in studies with human MPS 7 fibroblast cel ls in vitro 
(Ultragenyx data). Studies with rhGUS in MPS 7 mice at doses of 4 mg/kg show that serum 
GUS concentrations of >10-fold the uptake constant were readily achieved and demonstrated that enzym e was delivered to a variety of important tissues, implying that the efficacious 
dose should be within this range ( Grubb et al. 2008). 
The QOW dosing regimen is supported by the long in vitro half -life and increased stability of 
rhGUS compared with other MPS enzymes. Data from the earliest MPS ERT studies showed 
that when human enzymes for MPS 1 or 2 were applied to deficient human fibroblasts, the half-life of the enzyme in the lysoso me was on the order of 2-5 days  (Kakkis et al. 1994);  
(Elaprase 2006)  leading to weekly dosing frequency as the optimal choice.  For rhGUS, this 
experiment showed a half -life of about 40 days, which is a substantial increase over MPS 1

Proprietary and Confidential Page 35 
or MPS 2 enzymes, which are dosed weekly. The rhGUS enzyme is also a more stable 
enzyme than the other MPS enzymes at neutral pH, as it might be exposed to the circulation  
before uptake by lysosomes. Both the increased half -life and stability of rhGUS indicate 
QOW dosing should be adequate in humans. 
Study Duration  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is 48 weeks. Subjects successfully completing 
the first 48 weeks may continue for up to 240 weeks (5 years), or until one of the following occurs: the subject  withdraws consent, the subject  is discontinued from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated . 
7.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an identification 
number. All subjects will receive active treatment (UX003); there is only one treatment group in the study. 
7.4.6 Blinding 
The study drug will be administered open- label; no study participants will be blinded to study 
treatment . 
7.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
7.4.7.1 Prohibited Medications  
Subjects may not be enrolled if they have used any investigational product other than UX003 
or investigational medical device within 30 days prior to Screening, or if they require any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments. 
The use of genistein is specifically prohibited during study participation. 
7.4.7.2 Permitted Medications  
Subjects may receive concomitant medication s as required. Medications (investigational, 
prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 
30 days prior to Screening will be reviewed and recorded at the Screening visit. At the Baseline visit, current medicatio ns will be recorded. At each visit, any concomitant 
medications added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the CRF. 
The site personnel should record the following in the CRF: date and time the medication was 
taken, the dose and name of the medication, and the reason the medication was taken.  
Medications administered prior to each infusion of study drug and any non-study therapies 
provided by the Investigator during study participation will be similarly recorded in t he CRF.

7.4.8 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug is not to be dispensed to subjects.  Study drug will be administered by IV infusion 
by a qualified health care prof essional at the clinical site. The date, time, and volume of each 
dose of study drug administered to each subject must be recorded in the dispensing log for the study, as well as on the appropriate CRF. 
7.5 Study Procedures  and Assessments  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to any Screening procedures. The Baseline 
(Week 0) visit must take place within 30 days of the Screeni ng visit. Screening assessments 
(physical exam and safety labs) performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug  
may be used for Baseline  assessments. Subjects will be treated only after all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed. Baseline assessments must be completed 
within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug, unless otherwise specified. Assessments 
scheduled on the same day as treatment must be performed prior to the infusion.   
Subjects will return to the clinic at 2 -week intervals (± 3 days) throughout the 48- week 
Treatment Period  for study drug infusion and basic safety  measures . Major assessment 
visits (Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48) are scheduled at 12-week intervals (± 7 days). 
All assessments scheduled for a treatment day must be completed prior to the infusion on that 
day. For subjects who discontinue prior to completing the study, every reasonable effort 
should be made to perform the Early Termination visit procedures within 2 weeks of 
administration of last dose of study drug .   
Following completion of the 48- week Treatment Period, subjects may participate in the 
Continuation Period for up to 240 weeks. Subjects will return to the clinic for UX003 
administration every 2 weeks; additional assessments will be conducted at 12, 24 or 48- week 
intervals (± 7 days).  
7.5.1 Schedule of Events  
The parameters to be assessed in Study UX003 -CL203, along with timing of assessments, are 
provided in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). Refer to the Study Reference 
Manual for additional details on specific assessments.  For any given study visit, i f the 
maximum amount of blood has been taken based on Maximum Allowable Blood Volume Guidelines for any subject, some assessments are not required; see the Lab Manual for details on prioritizing blood draws. 
The end of trial is defined as the last visit of the last subject undergoing evaluation in the 
study. As the planned duration of treatment in this study is up to 240 weeks, the end of trial is defined as the Week 240 visit of the last subject. In the event the study is termina ted by the 
Sponsor prior to Week 240, all subjects should complete a termination visit and the date of the last termination visit of the last subject would define the end of the trial. The termination 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 37 
visit should be completed within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. Efficacy assessments 
performed within 30 days will not be repeated at the termination visit.   
7.5.2 Efficacy Measures  
The primary efficacy variable in this study, uGAG excretion, will provide a biochemical measure of t he biological action of UX003. The primary efficacy measure will be supported 
by multiple secondary and tertiary  variables to provide an assessment of UX003 efficacy in 
MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age.   
7.5.2.1 Primary Efficacy Measure :  Urinary GAG Excretion  
Clinical evidence for the use of uGAG as a relevant primary endpoint is based on nonclinical research work over 20 years, clinical disease survey studies , and Phase 3 controlled studies in 
MPS 1, 2 and 6 patients using other ERTs. The results demonstr ate a direct relationship 
between disease severity and clin ical outcomes with uGAG levels. The studies also 
demonstrate the sensitivity of uGAG to differences in clinical effect within the therapeutic range of doses and verified the sustained long- term effects of the ERT. The overall summary 
of these data show that uGAG reductions above a threshold of >50% are associated with clinically meaningful changes in clinical parameters in all three MPS ERT programs.  
First morning void urine will be evaluated  for uGAG at the time points listed in the schedule 
of events ( Table 2.1).  Urine samples will be collected once during Screening Period and on 
two separate days during the Baseline Period  (Week 0). Urine samples must be collected 
from first morning voids to assure the urine is adequately concentrated . Samples will be 
evaluated for uGAG concentration  and normalized to uri nary creatinine concentration.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on sample collection and processing requirements. 
7.5.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Measures  
7.5.2.2.1 Growth 
Growth will be assessed as a secondary efficacy measure to assess changes in growth 
velocity and comparisons to normative data matched for age and gender. A nthropometric 
measurements include standing height ( recumbent length or sitting height as appropriate), 
head circumference,  and weight , and will be obtained at twelve-week intervals beginning at 
the Baseline visit (Week 0). Every effort should be ma de to collect standing height. If unable 
to collect standing height, sitting height or length should be collected for that subject.  
Growth velocity will be calculated and compared with pre-treatment growth velocity when available.  Anthropometric measure ments may also be compared to normative reference data 
matched for age and gender. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on 
anthropometric measurements.

Proprietary and Confidential Page 38 
7.5.2.2.2 Hepatosplenomegaly 
The volume of the liver and spleen will be determined using ultrasound and compared with 
normal values for age and gender  if available ; ascites will also be assessed.  Ultrasounds will 
be conducted at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12, 24, and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the Continuation Period, an ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be 
performed annually (every 48 weeks). If an ultrasound cannot be performed, liver and spleen 
size may be assessed qualitatively by physical exam.  Ultrasound will not be performed at the 
ET visit if the assessment was conducted within 1 month of termination.   
7.5.2.3 Tertiary Efficacy Measures  
The following tertiary  efficacy variables will also be evaluated in the study.  Refer to the 
Study Reference Manual for additional details. 7.5.2.3.1 Serum and Supplementary Urinary GAG Measures  
Abnormal (pathologic) GAG in the serum will be assessed . One serum sample should be 
collected prior to dosing at the Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, and  48 visits during the 
Treatment Period . . Supplementary  assays for uGAG may be performed; samples will be 
collected as described in Section 7.5.2.1. 
7.5.2.3.2 Clinical Global Impression Scale 
The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was developed for use in National Institute of 
Mental Health -sponsored clinical trials to provide a brief, stand-a lone assessment of the 
clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study 
medication (Guy 1976). The CGI provides an overall clinician- determined  summary measure 
that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function . The Sponsor has developed an MPS disease- specific and 
age-appropriate version  of the CGI (also referred to as the Physician Global Impression of 
Change [PGI-C] in some studies) to be used in this study.  
Physicians caring for each subject will provide a global assessment of change using a seven point scale ranging from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (significant improvement). The CGI 
score will be supported by reported changes relative to baseline or identification of a new 
finding based on a list of disease -specific abnormalities projected to respond to treatment.    
The CGI will be evaluated at the Baseline (Week 0) visit and  at 12-week intervals through out 
the Treatment  Period and Continuation Period.  
7.5.2.3.3 Functional Development  
Functional Development will be assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition ( Bayley-III). The instrument will be administer ed at Baseline 
(Week 0), and at the Week 24 and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 39 
Continuation Period, the Bayley -III will be completed at 48-week intervals . Bayley-III will 
not be performed at the ET visit if the assessment was conducted within 1 month of 
termination.   
The Bayley-III (Bayley 2006 ) is a standard series of measurements developed to assess the 
motor (fine and gross), language (receptive and expressive), and cognitive development of infants and toddlers, aged 1 month - 42 months . This measure consists of a series of 
developmental play tasks and takes between 45 - 60 minutes to administer. The total raw score will be converted into a scaled score and a composite score with percen tile rank to 
compare performance to healthy same- age peers. Unless a child has achieved the highest raw 
score on the test, the Bayley-III assessments will continue throughout the study to monitor 
the progress of a child. Additionally , if valid and reliable  administration of the instrument is 
not possible based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator, e.g. language difficulties or clinical condition of the subject, testing may be omitted at that visit.  
7.5.2.3.4 Motor Functioning  
A gross motor milestone checklist, developed for use in this trial, will assess gross motor functioning and development. The checklist was designed to allow for assessment of the functional status of the subject requiring limited language interaction and physical handling.  
See Study Reference Manual for details.   
The checklist will be assessed at Baseline (Week 0), and at the Week 24 and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the Continuation Period, the gross motor milestone checklist will be completed at 48-week intervals . The checklist will not be completed  at the 
ET visit if conducted within 1 month of termination. 
7.5.2.3.5 Cardiac Ventricular Mass  
Ventricular mass will be assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) and scored as a z -score 
relative to normal ventricular mass. Valvular and cardia c function may also be evaluated .  
An ECHO performed within three months prior to the Baseline visit may be used for the 
study baseline ECHO provided cardiac ventricular mass can be calculated.  ECHO will be 
performed at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 48 (or Early Termination) study visits.   
During the Continuation Period, ECHO will be assessed annually (every 48 weeks). 7.5.2.3.6 Pulmonary Function Testing  
In young patients, traditional pulmonary function testing (i.e. spirometry) is difficult to 
perform, but measuri ng pulse oximetry can help assess basic problems in adequate 
respiration in the youngest patients Resting O
2 saturation will be assessed as a measure of 
pulmonary function while the subject is breathing room air during the Baseline (Week 0) and 
Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 (or Early Termination) visits. If the subject requires respiratory 
support, the type and duration should also be noted on the CRF. Pulse oximetry will be 
assessed every 12 weeks during the Continuation Period.

7.5.2.3.7 Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover  
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTMs) will be evaluated as an indicator of changes 
in bone metabolism in response to UX003 treatment. BTMs in serum include procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), carboxy- terminal cross -linked telopeptide of type I collagen 
(CTX-I), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP)  and vitamin D. Serum samples will be 
collected at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 2, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 visits (or Early 
Termination). Bone turnover markers will be assessed at 24 -week intervals during the 
Continuation Period. 
7.5.3 Drug Concentration Measurements  
The concentration of rhGUS in the blood will be measured to characterize the PK of UX003 
following a single dose and multiple doses. Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained 
at Weeks 0 (Baseline), 24, and 48. PK s amples will be collected prior to the infusion (pre-
dose), 60 minutes after start of infusion, at the end of the infusion, 30-120 minutes post infusion and 4-6 hours post infusion. 
Samples may be obtained by separate venipunctures, indwelling catheters, peripherally 
inserted central catheter (PICC) line or by combinations of these or other suitable methods. 
The indwelling or PICC line should be managed as prescribed by the clinic procedures. Collection and processing instructions can be found in Laboratory Manual. The same IV line post-infusion end, may be used if the primary line fails, but extensive saline flushing of the line should occur before drawing PK.  
7.5.4 Safety Measures  & General Assessments 
General assessments include medical history , demographics and weight for study drug 
preparation ( Section 7.4.3.2). Safety will be evaluated by the incidence, frequency and 
severity of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes from study baseline to 
scheduled time points in vital signs , weight, physical examination, clinical laboratory 
evaluations, and concomitant medications. To assess the immune response to UX003, 
the development of IgG antibodies to rhGUS will be evaluated  as indicated  in the Schedule 
of Events. Complement C3, C4, and CH50 levels will also be evaluated if a drug -related 
hypersensitivity reaction is suspected . Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional 
details. 
To further characterize the disease manifestations, severity and progression of MPS 7, the sponsor aims to determine the specific genetic mutation in each patient enrolled if consent is provided for such testing. Th is optional assessment can be performed at week 1 6 
or at different time -point if total blood volume at week 16 may  exceed maximum allowable 
volume.

7.5.4.1 Medical History  
A complete medical history will be obtained at the Screening visit. At the Baseline visit, any 
changes in medical history since Screening  will be recorded . General medical information 
includes subject demographics (date of birth, ethnicity, and sex) and a history of major medical illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries. Growth history for height a nd weight will be 
collected. Pretreatment measurements of height and weight should be collected from the records if possible to assure a pre and post treatment growth rate can be assessed.  MPS7 
treatment history and relevant concomitant medications will be  recorded (start date, stop 
date, dose, dose regimen). Medications include prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements. Any relevant concomitant therapy, including physical/occupational therapy will be recorded.    
7.5.4.2 Weight 
During the i nitial 48-week Treatment Period, w eight will be obtained at each visit  to 
determine appropriate study drug volume for the subsequent visit, and for safety  (refer to 
Pharmacy Manual for instructions on calculating drug dosage). During the Continuation Period, weight will be obtained at 12-week intervals (in conjunction with anthropometric 
measurements). Weight will be measured in kilograms using a scale.  
7.5.4.3 Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will be performed at the Screening, Baseline, Week 12, 24, 
36, and 48 study visits (or Early Termination Visit). During the Continuation Period, physical examinations will be conducted at 12- week intervals. Physical examinations will include 
assessments of general appearance; head , eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, 
dermatologic, lymphatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems . If the subject exhibits signs or symptoms of weakness or other new 
neurological findings, evaluate for cord compression (e.g. reflexes and motor strength). 
7.5.4.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured 
in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, respiration rate in breaths 
per minute, and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Vital signs measurements will be 
performed at every visit before any additional assessments are completed . On days when 
study drug is administered, vital signs will be measured as outlined below.  
Week 0 (Baseline) to Week 12, vital signs will be obtained: 
• 15 minutes prior to infusion 
• Every 15 minutes during the infusion 
• Immediately post -infusion 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203

Proprietary and Confidential Page 42 
• 15, 30, and 60 minutes post-infusion  
Additional measurements should be obtained as appropriate. 
Week 14 to Week 240, vital signs will be obtained: 
• 15 minutes prior to infusion 
• Every 60 minutes  for the remainder  of the infusion 
• Immediately post- infusion 
• 60 minutes post infusion   
Additional measurements should be obtained as appropriate. 
7.5.4.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests for Safety  
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be perfo rmed in this study  are listed in  Table 7.5.4.5.1. 
Clinical laboratory testing for serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed 
at the Screening , Baseline (Week 0),  Week 2, 4, and 8 visits . After Week 8, clinical 
laboratory evaluations will be performed every 8 weeks until Week 48 (or Early Termination  
visit). During the Continuation Period, clinical laboratory testing will be performed at 
24-week intervals  as indicated in the Sch edule of Events ( Table 2.1).  Blood and urine 
samples will be collected  prior to administration of study drug ; fasting is not required .

Subjects who experience a SAE possibly or probably related to study drug or other AE of 
concern may,  at the discretion of the Investigator (an d/or medical monitor) , have additional 
blood samples taken for safety laboratory tests . 
7.5.4.6 Antibodies to rhGUS 
Prior Phase 3 studies in ERT for MPS have shown that anti-IgG antibodies to the 
recombinant protein do not have a precise relationship to IARs, but the presence of antibodies may impact on enzyme distribution and efficacy ( Dickson et al. 2008).  
To determine the immunogenicity profile of UX003, testing for IgG antibodies directed 
against rhGUS will take place at Baseline (Week 0)  and the Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 
(or Early Termination) visits.  During the Continuation Period, anti -drug antibody screening 
will occur at 12 -week intervals. Serum samples for antibodies must be collected before 
infusion of study drug.  For subjects with a positive antibody and/or IAR response, further laboratory evaluation of the immune response to UX003 (i.e. antibodies and complement) may be conducted if warranted . 
7.5.4.7 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded in the subject’s CRF at each study visit, beginning at the S creening visit. Medications (investigational, prescription, 
over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Screening will be reviewed and recorded. At each subsequent visit, change in medications since the previous visit will be recorded. A discussion of prohibited and permit ted 
medications is provided in Section  7.4.7.  
7.5.4.8 Complement Levels  
Complement components will be assessed to characterize the immune response following a 
drug-related IAR. For subjects who experience an IAR  that is potentially a 
complement -mediated (anaphylactoid) hypersensitivity reaction, blood samples will be 
drawn pre- and immediately post-infusion during the subsequent infusion for measurement of the change in C3,  C4 and CH50 levels during an infusion. Refer to the Laboratory Manual 
for additional details on sample processing. 
7.5.4.9 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent until 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug . The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow-up of 
AEs will be performed as outlined  in Section 8.5. At each visit subjects will be asked  about 
any new or ongoing  AEs since the previous visit. Assessments of AEs will occur at each 
study visit. 
Clinically significant changes from study baseline in physical examination findings, weight, 
vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters , will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if 
appropriate.

7.5.5 Appropriateness of Measures  
The primary efficacy variable in this study , uGAG, is  a measure of the underlying 
biochemical defect in MPS 7 patients. Accumulated GAGs and uGAGs are a direct result of 
the genetic enzyme deficiency state. Based on clinical and nonclinical evidence, uGAG is a 
direct pathophysiological and readily measured marker of the MPS disease process and a reasonable predictor of treatment effect and clinical benefit. Therefore, i f the UX003 r estores 
the underlying biochemical block, a reduction of u GAG is expected.   
The additional variables assessed in the program are intended to replicate the clinical 
assessments u sed in other MPS ERT programs. The clinical assessments in the study employ 
standard measures used in other diseases and conditions that impact the respiratory, cardiac, 
gastrointestinal, skeletal, and central nervous systems . In a multinational study of Laronidase 
in MPS I patients younger than 5 years, clinical responses in liver si ze and left ventric ular 
hypertrophy were observed ( Wraith et al. 2007). Pulse oximetry  will be conducted to assess 
respiratory compromise, an important component of disease progression and mortality in MPS 7 subjects.  ECHO, ultrasound, and anthropometrics are routine, non-invasive procedures inflicting minimal pain/distress for the subject, while providing relevant indicators of clinical disease phenotype and progression.   
The Bayley-III is useful for assessing the compounded impact of multisystem clinical 
manifestations on the cognitive, motor, and adaptive behavioral development of infants and 
toddlers. In MPS 7, development in these domains is likely to be affected by the 
co-morbidit ies present in these subjects  (McDonald et al. 2010). The  Bayley-III may not be 
reliably administered.to all subjects, therefore a m otor milestone checklist is also included as 
an assessment of gross motor functioning and development. The checklist developed for this 
trial requires limited language interaction o r physical handling and allows for a gross motor 
assessment across all subjects .  
Assessments of serum markers of bone formation and bone resorption were included to measure the biochemical markers of bone turnover, which may enable evaluation of the 
effects of UX003 on skeletal tissue. 
Measurements of UX00 3 drug concentration in blood samples will provide information on 
relevant PK parameters  following a single -dose and at steady -state. Where possible, timing 
of assessments has been coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary sampling . 
The safety parameters to be evaluated in this study include standard assessments such as recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry  and hematology , urinalysis, concomitant medications, and other routine clini cal 
and laboratory procedures. In addition, anti- rhGUS IgG antibody levels and complement C3, 
C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) will be determined as a measure of UX003 
immunogenicity . Since the study population is  comprised of pediatric subjects, 
age-appropriate safety and  efficacy measures have been incorporated into the study design.

7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study analysis . 
Therefore , every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate and timely data collection, 
and to avoid missing data. D etailed procedures for handling missing, unused, or spurious 
data, along with t he detailed method for analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP); the information below is intended as a guide to planned analyses . 
The statistical analy ses will be reported using summary tables, figures, and data listings. 
All raw data obtained from the CRFs as well as any derived data will be included in data 
listings. All analyses and tabulations will be performed using SAS®. Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, the mean, standard error, 
median, minimum,  and maximum will be provided. For categorical variables , the frequency 
and percent distributions will be provided. Statistical tests will be two-sided at t he alpha 
=0.05 significance level. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will also be presented when 
appropriate. The statistical method employed  for the analysis of each assessment will be 
defined in more detail in the SAP.   
7.6.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled including approximately  5 subjects with hydrops 
fetalis. Subjects under the age of 5 years at the time of informed consent with a confirmed 
diagnosis of MPS 7 will be enrolled. Additional subjects previously treated with UX003 under an emergency IND or similar process may also be enrolled at the discretion of the 
Sponsor. Due to the extremely low prevalence of the disease, the sample size is primarily 
based on the ability to find qualifying patients.  
7.6.2 Subject Infor mation 
Subject disposition summaries will include the number of subjects, the number of subjects receiving study medication, the number of subjects completing the study, and the reasons for discontinuation. Demographic variables include age, sex, and race.   
7.6.3 Populations Analyzed 
The full analysis set  will consist of all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of UX003 
during the study.  
7.6.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The study is a small open label study to obtain some clinical efficacy data from a small 
cohort of these ultra- rare patients. A complete hypothesis testing statistical approach is not 
plausible in this setting, but a reasonable approach to assessing for the biologic e fficacy of 
UX003 will be made. 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 46 
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate th e mean percent change in uGAG excretion 
from Week 0 (Baseline) to Week 48 using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
analysis method.  For subject(s) previously treated with UX003 under a n emergency  IND, 
percent change from initial baseline (prior to first dose of UX003) will be used, if the initial 
baseline data are available. The null hypothesis of no change in mean uGAG excretion will be tested. An additional analysis will also be performed on the Week 24 time point. 
7.6.5 Secondary and Tertiary Endpoint s and Analyses 
Secondary analysis on growth and hepatosplenomegaly will be evaluated to compare pretreatment with post treatment effects.  Growth rate will be compared to historical data  
obtained from medical history and records (if available), and also compared to published normative data for age and gender. Changes in findings from Baseline for other efficacy 
variables will be tabulated for each subject. Comparisons of certain efficacy variables with published normative data based on age a nd gender may als o be conducted.   
7.6.6 Pharmacokinetic Analyses   
The following PK parameters will be calculated from the plasma concentrations of rhGUS measured in these blood samples: 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity 
(AUC
0 -∞) 
• AUC from time zero to the time of last measurable concentration (AUC 0-last) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) 
• Elimination half -life (t1/2) 
• Total clearance of drug after IV administration (CL)  
• Apparent volume of distribution based upon the terminal phase (Vd z) 
• Apparent volume of distribution at steady- state (Vd ss) 
7.6.7 Safety Analyses 
The primary safety analysis will evaluate the safety of UX003 as measured by the incidence, 
frequency and severity of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes from study 
baseline to scheduled time points in: 
• Vital signs  and weight 
• Physical examination findings  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 47 
• Concomitant medications  
• IgG antibodies to rhGUS 
• Complement C3, C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study drug, and seve rity. No statistical significance will 
be assessed.  A by-subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a SAE, 
including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug treatment.  
Clinical laboratory data will be  summarized b y the type of laboratory test. The frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (i.e. outside of reference ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each cl inical laboratory measurement. For each clinical laboratory 
measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for study baseline and all subseq uent 
visits. Changes from study b aseline to the post- treatment visits will also be provid ed.  
Descriptive statistics of vital signs, imaging assessments  for safety , and concomitant 
medications will be provided in a similar manner.  
Changes in findings from study baseline physical examinations will be tabulated and listed 
for each subject by examination category. If there are examination findings that change in 
more than one subject, these will be tabulated in a separate table and expressed as the number of subjects with the change out of the total.   
Anti-drug antibody data will be tabulated  over the course of the study. The number of 
subjects converting to a positive antibody assay value by increasing titer by five -fold over 
study baseline or more and the time of onset of a positive antibody response will be 
determined. Descriptive statistics on  the titers achieved and the time of onset of the response 
will be provided (mean, standard deviation, median, range). For subjects with a positive 
antibody and/or IAR response, further laboratory evaluation of the immune response to UX003 (i.e. antibodies and complement) may be conducted as indicated. 
7.6.8 Analyses 
Analyses may be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
There is no unblinding during these analys es since it is an open- label study.

8 STUDY CONDUCT  
8.1 Ethics 
8.1.1 Institutional Review Board or Ethics C ommittee  
The IRB/EC must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 5 6, "Institutional Review Boards", International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) and Good Clinical Practi ce (GCP) requirements, and applicable laws and local 
regulations. This protocol, any protocol amendments, and the associated informed consent forms (ICFs) must be submitted to the IRB/EC for review and must be approved before screening of any subject into the study. Study drug may not be shipped to the Investigator 
until Ultragenyx or its designee has received a copy of the letter or certificate of approval from the IRB/EC for the protocol and any protocol amendments, as applicable. 
All subject recruitment and/or advertising information must be submitted to the IRB/EC and 
Ultragenyx or its designee for review and approval prior to implementation. IRB/EC 
approval of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in 
the amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to protect subject safety.  In such cases, the chair of the IRB/EC should be notified immediately and the amendment forwarded to the IRB/EC for review and approval. 
8.1.2 Ethical Conduct of Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by the 18th World 
Medical Association  General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and subsequent amendments and 
clarifications adopted by the General Assemblies. The Investigator will make every ef fort to 
assure the study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those 
principles, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, and 
local ethical and regulatory requirements. Should a conflict arise, the I nvestigator  will follow 
whichever law or guideline affords the greater protection to the individual subject.  The Investigator will also make sure he or she is thoroughly familiar with the appropriate 
administration and potential risks of administration of  the study drug , as described in this 
protocol and the IB, prior to the initiation of the study. 
8.1.3 Subject Information and Consent  
Appropriate forms for documenting written informed consent will be provided by the Investigator and reviewed and approved by Ultragenyx or its designee before submission to the IRB/EC. Ultragenyx or its designee must receive a copy of the IRB/EC's approval of the ICF before the shipment of study drug to the study site.  
It is the Investigator 's responsibility to obtain signed written informed consent from each 
potential study subject prior to the conduct of any study procedures. This written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, requirements, and potential risks of the study have been fully explained to each potential subject. The Investigator must explain 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 49 
to each subject that the subject is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw 
from it at any time.  Subjects under the age of 18 years (or 16 years, depending on the region) 
will provide written assent (if possible), and his/her legally authorized representative (parent 
or legal guardian) will provide written informed consent for such subjects.   
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will 
comply with ICH GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, and all other appli cable regulatory requirements. Subjects will be given a copy of 
the signed ICF and will be provided any new information during the course of the study that might affect their continu ed participation in the study. The Investigator or a qualified 
designee will be available to answer each s ubject's questions throughout the study, and all of 
the subject's questions must be answered to the subject's satisfaction. If the protocol is 
amended and the ICF is revised, each subject will be required to provide written informed consent again using the revised ICF.  
The date of written informed consent will be documented in each potential subject’s CRF.  The signed ICF will remain in each subject's study file and must be available to the study monitor(s) at all times.  
8.2 Investigators and Study Administrati ve Structure  
Each Investigator  must provide Ultragenyx and/or its designee a completed and signed 
Form FDA 1572 and a Financial Disclosure Form. All sub-investigators must be listed on 
Form FDA 1572 and Financial Disclosure Forms must be completed for all sub- investigators 
listed on Form FDA 1572. 
Ultragenyx and/or its designee will be responsible for managing and monitoring the clinical 
trial to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelin es. Ultragenyx's trained 
designated representative (the monitor) will conduct regular visits to the clinical site to perform source document v erification. The monitor will verify the Investigator 's ongoing 
qualifications, inspect clinical site facilities, and inspect study records, including proof of IRB/EC review, with  the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements. 
8.3 Investigational Product Accountability  
While at the clinical site, study drug must be stored in a secure limited access location at 
controlled temperature as described in the IB and according to product packaging.  
The storage facility must be available for inspection by the study monitor at any time during 
the study.   
A drug accountability record must be maintained for all study drug received, dispensed, 
returned, and/or lost during the study. This record must be kept current and made available to the study monitor for inspection. Following the close-out of the study, all unused study drug 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 50 
must be returned to Ultragenyx and/or its designee unless other instructions have been 
provided for final disposition of the study drug.  
8.4 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
8.4.1 Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
The Investigator is required to initiate and maintain, for each subject, an adequate and 
accurate case history that records all observations and other data related to the study for that 
subject. A validated electronic data c apture (EDC) system will be used for entry of the data 
into electronic CRFs. Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by Ultragenyx or its 
designee. All information recorded on CRFs for this study must be consistent with the 
subject's source documentation. 
Initial data entry and any changes to the data will be mad e only by Ultragenyx-authorized 
users, and data entries and changes will be captured in an electronic audit trail.  
An explanation of any data change should be recorded in the CRF. All data entered in to the 
CRF must be verifiable; therefore, CRFs will be routinely checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records by Ultragenyx or its designee.  The Investigator must allow direct access  to all source documents. 
8.4.2 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Ultragenyx and/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA /EMA and ICH GCP guidelines.  Ultragenyx's 
designated representative (the monit or) will contact the Investigator and conduct reg ular 
visits to the study site. The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the Investigator 's 
qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, including proof of IRB/EC review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations,  including HIPAA requirements. The monitor 
will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensur ing the integrity of the data. CRFs will be checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for co nsistency with source documents 
including progress notes, laboratory test repo rts and other subject records. Instances of 
missing or uninterruptable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator . 
The monitor will also investigate any questions concerning adheren ce to regulatory 
requirements. Any administrative concerns w ill be clarified and followed. The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications by e -mail, telephone, 
facsimile, and/or mail. The Investigator and all other site personnel agree to cooperate fully 
with the monitor and will work in  good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all 
questions raised and any and all issues identified by the monitor. 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 51 
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/EC, and/or Ultragenyx or its 
designees have the right to access all CRF s, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least two years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 
two years after clinical development of the study drug for the indication being studied has 
been discontinued. The Investigator is required to guaranty access to these documents and to 
cooperate with and support such audits and inspections. 
8.4.3 Record Retention  
All study records must be r etained for at least 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in 
accordance with national law. Subject files and other source data must be kept for the 
maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practic e, but not less 
than 25 years. Ultragenyx must be notified and will assist with retention should the Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 25 years. Subject files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time 
permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 25 years.  
Ultragenyx must be notified and will assist with retention should the Investigator /institution 
be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 25 years. All study records 
must be stored in a secure and safe facility.  
8.5 Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Events  
8.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is  evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Life-threatening AE or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator  or Ultragenyx , places the patient 
or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the Investigator  or Ultragenyx , results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 52 
• Death 
• A life-threatening AE 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note that hospitaliz ations planned prior to study enrollment (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospitalizations that occur for pre- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, t he severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI  CTCAE (version 
4.0).  The  majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant typ e, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere  with daily activities, but are usually improved by simple 
therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5): Events that result in death.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided.  The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 53 
be of relatively minor medical significa nce (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relatio nship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. Categories of attributions for “Unr elated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. 
• Unlikely Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational a gent/procedure. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs  deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely Related  
will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.4 Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements 
for Immediate Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs from the time of signing the ICF through 30 days following the last 
dose of study drug , including a clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test result that is 
considered serious, must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to Ultragenyx or its designee.  These requirements apply equally to all subjects, regardless of the 
study phase or the at -risk subject's treatment assignment or dosage. All initial SAE reports  
must be followed by detailed descriptions. These should include copies of hospital case records and other documents when requested. SAEs will be reported by completing and 
submitting SAE report forms to Ultragenyx or designee.  
Follow-up SAE information m ust be submitted in a timely manner as additional information 
becomes available. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug must be followed to 
resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 54 
All deaths, regardless of causality, from the time of consent through 30 days after last dose of 
study drug must be reported to Ultragenyx or its designee within 24 hours of knowledge.  
8.5.5 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSAR) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), ECs, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. Fatal and life-threatening SUSARs will be submitted no later than 7- calendar days of first 
knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other SUSARs will be submitted within 15 -calendar days of first knowled ge of the 
event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform Regulatory Authorities, ECs, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX003, major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a SUSAR but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from signing the ICF through 30 days following the last dose of study drug.  
The Principal Investigator will notify the IRBs/ECs of SAEs and urgent safety matters, in 
accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-SUSARs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will 
prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic summary reports to Regulatory authorities and ECs, as per local laws and regulations.  
8.5.6 Urgent Safety Measures  
The regulations governing clinical studies state that the Sponsor and Investigator are required 
to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards 
that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the 
investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the Sponsor and the I nvestigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects  against any immediate hazar d. The Sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the Ethics Committee  (EC) is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent safety 
measures is the period from the signing of the ICF through 30 days following the last

Dear Ms. Kruhm,  
 
 
The study committee for  ACNS0927 , A Phase 1/2 Study of Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic 
Acid (Saha, Vorinostat) and Local Irradiation, Followed by Maintenance Saha in 
Children with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine G liomas (DIPG ) has pr ovided 
Amendment #3 A, dated 08/06/2014 for CTEP review. This amendment is being submitted 
in response to a Request for Amendment (RA) from Dr. Richard L. Piekarz 
(rpiekarz@nih.gov)  received on April 3, 2014 . 
 
In this amendment, the vorinostat  monograph has been modified to reflect the 
incorporation of the revised Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) 
list for vorinostat  provided by the NCI. The changes made due to this request are detailed 
below. Administrative updates have a lso been made throughout the protocol and are 
tracked.  
 
The ACNS0927  study committee looks forward to approval of this amendment.  
 
Sincerely,

The following COG template update has been made:  
Active CTEP -registered investigators and 
investigator -designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees can must submit agent requests 
through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing 
(OAOP) application < https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx   >.  Access to 
OAOP requires the establi shment of a CTEP Identity 
and Access Management (IAM) account < 
https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/  > and the 
maintenance of an “active” account status and a 
“current” password.   Alternatively, site personn el can 
fax completed Clinical Drug Requests (NIH -986) to 
the Pharmaceutical Management Branch at (301) 480 -
4612.   For questions about drug orders, transfers, 
returns, or accountability, call ( 301240) 496276-5725

2.6 to 2.7 of the  CAEPR:  
• Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza , NSC 701852)  
• Below is the CAEPR for vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza ). 
• Version number and date updated  
• Relationship to Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza ) 
• Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
(SPEER)  (formerly known as ASAE L) 
• Also reported on vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza ) trials 
but with the relationship to vorinostat (SAHA, 
Zolinza ) still undetermined:  
• Note: Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza ) in combination 
with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any 
adverse event currently k nown to be caused by the 
other agent, or the combination may result in events 
never previously associated with either agent.  
6.  11.3.1  46-47 The statistical section for Part B has been expanded to  clarify the 
evaluable patient s as follows:  
Efficacy Endpoints   
  ACNS0927  
   iv 
# Section  Page(s)  Change  
The primary endpoint for the evaluation of treatment efficacy 
will be event -free survival (EFS), defined as the time to 
disease progression, disease relapse, occurrence of a second 
neoplasm, or death from any cause, or dat e of last follow -up 
measured from the time of study enrollment.  
 
Definitions of Evaluable  
 
Part B:  
Evaluable for Adverse Events and Efficacy  
Patients will be considered evaluable for adverse events 
and efficacy if they meet the following criteria: (1) the  
patient is eligible; (2) the patient receives one dose of 
vorinostat at the MTD determined in Phase 1 (230 
mg/m2/day) per protocol guidelines, and (3) if central

ABSTRACT  
 
This is a phase 1/2 study to dete rmine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of suberoylanilide hydroxamic 
acid (SAHA; vorinostat) in combination with radiation therapy and the efficacy of administering 
vorinostat concurrently with radiation therapy, followed by maintenance therapy with vorino stat, in 
patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).  
 
This study consists of two parts: Part A, which is the phase 1 dose -finding study to define the MTD of 
vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy, and Part B, which is the phase 2 portion of the study to 
measure the efficacy of continuing vorinostat as maintenance therapy after radiation. Part A of the study 
will be completed within the COG Phase 1 Consortium. After completion of radiation and vorinostat, 
patients in Par t A will continue to receive vorinostat as maintenance therapy at the MTD defined in 
ADVL0416. For Part B of the study, patients will receive vorinostat, at 230 mg/m2/day ( the MTD 
determined in Part A of the study ), with concurrent radiation, and then cont inue maintenance therapy with 
vorinostat at the MTD defined in ADVL0416, for a maximum of 12 courses. Part B of the study will take 
place at member COG institutions, group wide.  
 
The primary endpoints for toxicity and safety monitoring of vorinostat in com bination with radiation 
therapy include DLTs and toxic death. Toxicities for maintenance therapy will also be determined. The 
primary endpoint for the evaluation of treatment efficacy will be 1 -year event -free survival (EFS), and a 
secondary endpoint will be overall survival (OS). EFS and OS outcomes will be compared to historical 
control data from ACNS0126 and CCG -9941.  
 
Assessment of histone acetylation, HDAC2 level, and non -homologous end -joining (NHEJ) activity from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P BMC) will be performed pre -treatment, at 2 weeks after starting 
vorinostat and radiation treatment, and at completion of vorinostat and radiation treatment. If paraffin -
embedded tumor samples are available, then HDAC 2 level, NHEJ activity, and/or protein levels of key 
repair proteins in the NHEJ and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways will be determined. 
Any correlation between these biologic studies and clinical outcome will be explored.

2.0 BACK GROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
 
2.1.1  Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas in Children  
Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) in children remain essentially 
incurable. A recent review of 22 clinical trials of pediatric diffuse brainstem  
gliomas showed that only 92 out of 940 children survived, with identical 
progression free (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in recent trials compared to older 
series.1 In children whose tumors were biopsied, the majority (153 out of 229 
samples; 67%) were high -grade gliomas.1 Clinical trials of hyperfractionated 
radiation, delivering up to 72 Gy radiation, showed no benefit over conventional 
(54-58 Gy) radiation.2-8 Chemothe rapy or biologic agents, whether given pre -
irradiation,2,8-10 with radiation, and/or after radiation,3-7,9-18 including 
myeloablative regimen with stem cell rescue,19,20 have also failed to improve PFS 
or OS. Collectively, these series showed dismal median PFS (5 -8.8 months), 
median OS (8 -12 months), and 2 -year survival (5 -15%).1

  Page  11 
 
Because radiation often induces a temporary response and symptomatic 
improvement for children with DIPGs, concurrent adminis tration of an agent 
with both an anti -glioma and a radiosensitizing effect may potentially improve 
outcome. Pre -clinical studies have shown that vorinostat  (suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid, SAHA), an orally bioavailable histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitor , inhibits growth of malignant gliomas and enhances radiation sensitivity 
of these tumors. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat  as a single 
agent has been defined in a pediatric phase 1 study (ADVL0416). We therefore 
propose a phase I/II trial fo r children with newly diagnosed DIPG to study: 1) the 
MTD or recommended phase 2 dose of vorinostat  given concurrently with 
radiation; and 2) the efficacy of vorinostat , given concurrently with radiation and 
then continued as maintenance therapy after radi ation, as measured by 12 -month 
and 18 -month EFS and OS.  
 
2.1.2  Vorinostat and Other Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors  
Nucleosomes, the basal unit of chromatin, are composed of DNA wrapped 
around histones with lysine -rich amino terminal tails. The positive ch arge of the 
amino tails attracts the negatively -charged DNA, and this interaction partly 
regulates the chromatin structure and gene expression.21 Histone acetyltra nsferase 
(HAT) transfers an acetyl moiety to the lysines on the amino tails and neutralizes 
the positive charge of the histones, leading to decreased affinity for DNA, 
relaxation of chromatin, and transcriptional activation.21,22 HDACs remove the 
acetyl groups and restore the negative charge, leading to chromatin compaction 
and transcriptional repression.22,23 Dysregulation of histone acetylation has been 
implicated in the development of human cancers.21,24 It is hypothesized that 
aberrant histone acetylation leads to inappropriate transcriptional repression and 
maintenance  of the transformed state in human tumors. HDAC inhibitors are 
hypothesized to reactivate gene expression of critical pathways that are 
abnormally silenced in tumorigenesis, and indeed treatment of human tumor cells 
with HDAC inhibitors results in cell cyc le arrest, apoptosis, and 
differentiation.21,25 There are several classes of HDAC inhibitors, including 
butyric  acid derivative (phenylbutyrate and AN -9), short -chain fatty acid 
(valproic acid), hydroxamic acids, benzamides (MS -275), and cyclic peptides 
(depsipeptide).26,27 Vorinostat is one of the hydroxamic acid -based HDAC 
inhibitors. In contrast to depsipeptide and MS -275 which only inhibit selective 
members of class I HDAC (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8) or valproic acid which inhibits 
class I and class IIa HDACs (HDAC 4, 5, 7, and 9), vorinostat  inhibits all classes 
of HDAC, including class IIb (HDAC 6 and 10) and IV (HDAC 11).27,28 Whether 
a pan -HDAC inhibitor such as vorinostat  has more potent or a broader range of 
anti-tumor efficacy versus a selective HDAC inhibitor such as MS -275 is 
unproven.

2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1  Pre-Clinical Activity of Vorinostat in CNS Tumors  
There have been several pre -clinical studies documenting vorinostat ’s in vitro  
and in vivo  inhibition of malignant gliomas. Ugur et al.29, Chinnaiyan et al.30,Yin 
et al.31, and Eyupoglu et al.32 demonstrated that the concentration of vorinostat  
required for 50% growth inhibition (IC 50) of multiple malignant glioma cell lines 
and primary GBM explants were approximately 1 -2 µM (264-528 ng/ml) , and 
these concentrations were comparable to the safely achieved C max in adult and 
pediatric clinical trials (see discussion below). Recently, it was also shown that in 
vitro  vorinostat  treatment inhibited growth of ste m-like GBM cells in 
neurospheres equally effectively as it inhibited non -stem GBM tumor cells.33 In 
vivo studies also conf irmed that administration of vorinostat  to mice with 
intracranial malignant glioma xenografts significantly prolonged their survival 
versus control animals.29,31,32   
 
In addition to its documented activity in malignant gliomas, vorinostat  also 
inhibits growth of other CNS tumors such as medulloblastoma34,35 and 
supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor.36 Although there has not been 
any formal study of the CNS pharmacokinetics of vorinostat , two investigators 
demonstrated increased levels of acetylated histones in normal mouse brains and 
intracranial xenogr afts after vorinostat  treatment.35,37 In addition, it has recently 
been s hown that in adults with GBM post -vorinostat  treatment tumors had 
increased histone acetylation as well.38 Thes e studies provide indirect evidence 
that vorinostat  crossed the blood -brain barrier and induced biological changes in 
normal brain and intracranial tumors.  
 
2.2.2  HDAC Inhibitors Enhances Radiation Sensitivity of Malignant Gliomas  
Several studies have show n that various HDAC inhibitors, including 
phenylbutyrate,39 TSA,40 AN-9,41 MS-275,42 and valproic acid43,44 enhanced in 
vitro and in vivo radiosensitivity of malignant glioma cell lines. Chinnaiyan et 
al.30 showed that pre -treating U373, a malignant glioma cell line, with 0.75 -1 µM 
of vorinostat  for 48 -72 hours, and continuing vorinostat  with radiation 
significantly increased its radiosensitivity. Additional studies similarly 
demonstrated that vorinosta t treatment enhanced radiation sensitivity of other 
solid tumors, 45-48 including intracranial breast cancer xenografts.49 In most of the 
pre-clinical studies, optimal radiation enhancement was observed when HDAC 
inhibition preceded rad iation by 24 -72 hours and was continued concurrently 
with radiation.  
 
Pre-clinical studies of vorinostat  prior to radiation treatment demonstrate 
significantly reduced levels of DNA repair proteins in the non -homologous end -
joining (NHEJ; Ku70, Ku80, DNA -PK) and homologous recombination repair 
(HRR; BRCA 1 and 2, ATM, and Rad51) pathways.30,46 Since radiat ion is 
thought to exert its anti -tumor effect by inducing double -stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
breaks, and dsDNA breaks are repaired by the NHEJ and HRR pathways, it has 
been hypothesized that radiation -enhancement by vorinostat  and other HDAC 
inhibitors is in part  mediated by decreased DNA repair proteins and impaired 
dsDNA break repair. Additional pre -clinical studies of the radiation potentiation 
by other HDAC inhibitors have also shown that expression of key DNA repair 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  13 
proteins in the NHEJ and HRR pathways is si gnificantly reduced50-53 and dsDNA 
break repair is inhibited.43,44 
 
2.2.3  NHEJ and HRR Possibly Mediating Radiation Resistance in Malignant Gliomas  
Several pre -clinical studies have documented elevated expression of DNA repair 
proteins in the NHEJ and HRR  pathway in radiation resistant glioma cell 
lines54,55 or in response to irradiation,54,56 and inhibition of these DNA repair 
proteins restored the radiation sensitivity of tumor cells.57-60 Most recently, two 
function al studies demonstrated that expression of EGFRvIII, one of the most 
common mutations in adult GBM, enhanced glioma cell survival after radiation 
by accelerating repair of dsDNA breaks.61,62 This enhanced survival after 
radiation was asso ciated with elevated expression of DNA -PK, ATM, and Rad51 
and abrogated by their respective inhibitors. Taken together, these pre -clinical 
data suggest that enhanced dsDNA break repair may mediate radiation resistance 
of malignant gliomas, and inhibition o f NHEJ and HRR pathways may potentiate 
the sensitivity of these tumors to radiation. As vorinostat  treatment has been 
associated with decreased expression of key DNA repair proteins in both the 
NHEJ and HRR pathways, it is a promising agent for radiation p otentiation, and 
its clinical efficacy may correlate with inhibition of dsDNA break repair.  
 
2.2.4  Clinical Significance of HDAC expression in Human Tumors  
Although multiple studies have documented HDAC over -expression in various 
solid tumors63-66 and correlated such over -expression with aggressive tumor 
biology and decreased survival,67-69 HDAC expression in CNS tumors has been 
poorly and inconsistently documented.70-73 Several pre -clinical studies, however, 
have shown tha t inhibition of HDAC2 appears to be critical for various aspects of 
HDAC inhibitors’ anti -tumor effect, including chromatin decondensation and 
remodeling, transcriptional activation, and induced histone acetylation.74-77 A 
clinical trial correlated HDAC2 expression in cutaneous T -cell lymphoma 
(CTCL) with biological aggressiveness and unfavorable clinical outcome.69 
Furthermore, several clinical trials have confirmed that baseline expression of 
HDAC2 in PBMCs (as surrogates for tumor s pecimens) correlated directly with 
increases in histone H3 and H4 acetylation after HDAC inhibitor 
treatment.69,75,78,79 Therefore, baseline and post -treatment HDAC2 level in 
PBMCs may be an additional surrogate marker for measuring vorinos tat’s 
biologic effect in tumors.  
 
2.3 Adult Studies of Vorinostat  
 
2.3.1  Phase 1 and 2 Studies of Vorinostat  
Early phase I trials of vorinostat  in adults showed  encouraging objective 
responses in various solid tumors80,81 and hematologic malignancies,80-82 with an 
impre ssive response rate up to 30% in patients with CTCL.83,84 Subsequent phase 
1 and 2 clinical trials of vor inostat as a single agent in adults with hematologic 
malignancies85,86 and solid tumors,87-91 however have yielded somewhat 
disappointing results, with few objective responses and stable disease being the 
most common outcome. Most recently, a phase 2 study  of vorinostat in adults 
with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated only 2 objective responses 
in 66 patients.38  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  14 
The most common vorinostat regimen is 400 mg orally, once daily or 200 mg 
orally, bid continuously;80,82-84,88,90,91 but alternative schedules (e.g. 200 -400 mg 
bid x 14 d ays every 21 days) have also been evaluated.38,85-87,89 The oral 
bioavailability is 43%, with an apparent half -life of 91 -127 minutes.80 Observed 
Cmax in the 400 mg q day regimen averaged 658 +/ - 439 ng/mL,  exceeding the 
IC50 (264-528 ng/mL)  required in pre -clinical studies to inhibit growth of 
malignant gliomas, either as a single agent29-32 or to enhance the  effect of 
radiation.30 
 
Vorinostat was reasonably well tolerated in the adult trials. The most common 
grade 3 and 4 toxicities were fatigue, gastrointestin al (nausea/vomiting, anorexia, 
diarrhea, dehydration), hematologic (thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, 
neutropenia, anemia), and metabolic (hypernatremia, hypokalemia). Grade 3 and 
4 thrombocytopenia, the most common hematologic toxicity, occurred in 5 -22% 
of patients.38,80,82,83,85,87,89-91  However, the platelet count usually rec overed to 
normal within 3 -7 days after drug discontinuation.28,80,82,85  
 
In earlier adult clinical trials, increased acetylation of H3 and H4 histones in 
PBMC was essentially observed in all patients across all dose levels.80-82,85 Peak 
hyperacetylation of PBMC histones was observed 2 -4 hours after a dose of 
vorinostat  and generally returned to baseli ne level after 6 -8 hours. Persistent 
hyperacetylation of PBMC histones was observed after 3 weeks on continuous 
dosing.80 However, hyperacetylation of histones in tumors was less consistent, as 
Kelly et al.80 and Galanis et al.38 showed that only three out of five post -
vorinostat  tumor samples demonstrated increased histone H3 acetylation.  
 
2.4 ADVL0416, A Pediatric Phase 1 Study of Vorinostat  
 
2.4.1  Phase 1 Study of Vorinostat in Ch ildren (Fouladi et al., unpublished results)  
In the recently completed COG phase 1 study of vorinostat  (ADVL0416) in 
children with refractory solid tumors, vorinostat  was administered orally once 
daily starting at 180 mg/m2/day continuously, with dose esca lations in 30% 
increments. The MTD for pediatric patients in ADVL0416 has been defined as 
230 mg/m2/day. At one dose level (300 mg/m2/day) above the MTD, 4 out of 12 
patients experienced DLTs (2 thrombocytopenia, 1 neutropenia, 1 hypokalemia). 
No dose -limiting thrombocytopenia or neutropenia were observed at the MTD 
(230 mg/m2/day) or one dose level below (180 mg/m2/day).  
 
No objective response was observed with vorinostat  as a single agent, although 
prolonged stable disease (median of 4 cycles, range 4 -8 cycles) was observed in 
six patients, including a patient with a DIPG and another with a low -grade 
glioma. Two additional patients treated with vorinostat  and 13 -cis-retinoic acid 
(one medulloblastoma, one pineoblastoma) also had stable disease for 5 and 7  
cycles.  
 
There was wide interpatient variability in vorinostat  pharmacokinetic, with no 
clear linear relationship between drug exposure (as measured by area -under 
concentration -time curve, AUC) and dose. Vorinostat exposure following a  
capsule formulation  versus an oral suspension, at 230 mg/m2/day, as measured by 
AUC 0->inf, was roughly similar (range 1415 -9291 ng/ml*hr versus 1186 -4780 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  15 
ng/ml*hr, respectively). The observed C max across all dose levels (range 269 -780 
ng/ml) was within or exceeded the IC 50 range (264 -528 ng/ml ) required for 
inhibiting malignant gliomas in pre -clinical studies.29-32 
 
A significant increase in PBMC histone H3 acetylation was not consiste ntly 
observed in children who received vorinostat  at 180 mg/m2/day, whereas 15 out 
of 18 patients who received either 230 mg/m2/day or 300 mg/m2/day 
demonstrated more than a 2 -fold increase in PBMC histone H3 acetylation.  
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatri c Study  
This study is comprised of two parts. Part A is a phase 1 dose -finding study employing 
the rolling six phase 1 trial design, to define the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose of 
vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy, for children with newly diagnosed 
DIPG. Although the MTD of vorinostat as determined in ADVL0416 was 230 
mg/m2/day, given the expansive nature of DIPG and proximity to pons and medulla, it 
would be prudent to ensure that there is no synergistic toxicity when vorinostat is 
combine d with radiation. Therefore, the starting dose of vorinostat for Part A of this trial 
will be 180 mg/m2/day, Monday through Friday during radiation (Dose Level 1; Table 1, 
section 5.3.1 ). This starting dos e is one dose level below the MTD (230 mg/m2/day) 
determined in ADVL0416. One dose de -escalation (Dose Level 0, vorinostat 180 
mg/m2/day, 3 days a week during radiation therapy) will be studied if Dose Level 1 is not 
well tolerated. The phase 1 dose -findin g study will conclude if Dose Level 2 (vorinostat 
230 mg/m2/day, Monday through Friday during radiation therapy) is well tolerated (Table 
1, section 5.3.1 ). Part A of the study will only be open for enro llment to the institutions in 
the COG Phase 1 Consortium.   
 
After completion of radiation and vorinostat, patients enrolled on Part A of the study will 
continue on maintenance therapy with vorinostat, provided that they meet all the on -study 
criteria and h ave no contraindication for continuing vorinostat . Patients will continue 
vorinostat at 230 mg/m2/day continuously (Dose Level 1; Table 2, section 5.4 ), which 
was the MTD as determined in ADVL0416. Patients will continue vorinostat 
maintenance therapy for a maximum of 12 courses. Two dose de -escalations will be 
allowed in the event a patient experiences a DLT during maintenance (post RT) therapy.   
 
Six patients were enrolled on Dose Level 1 (vorinostat 180 mg /m2/day Monday through 
Friday during radiation treatment). None of these six patients had DLTs during course 1 
of chemoradiotherapy. Six additional patients were then enrolled onto Dose Level 2 
(vorinostat 230 mg/m2/day Monday through Friday during radiati on therapy), and none 
of these six patients experienced DLTs. According to the rolling -six study design, dose 
level 2 is determined to be the recommended Phase 2 dose during chemoradiation. Part B 
of the study will now be open to group -wide participation, and all future patients will 
receive vorinostat 230 mg/m2/day, Monday through Friday, during the chemo -radiation 
phase.  
 
Of the twelve patients who have received maintenance therapy (course 2 and beyond), 
two patients experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia r equiring dose de -escalation of 
vorinostat. No recurrent dose -limiting thrombocytopenia was observed after the dose 
reduction. One of these 2 patients who experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia also 
experienced grade 4 neutropenia, and despite a dose reductio n, this patient's grade 4 
neutropenia recurred, necessitating discontinuation of maintenance protocol therapy. No

other dose limiting toxicities have been observed thus far in the 12 patients who have 
received maintenance therapy. Dose -limiting toxicities during the maintenance phase will 
continue to be monitored closely on a weekly basis, per toxicity monitoring rule specified 
in section 11.3.6, when PART B of the study opens for group -wide participation.  
 
It appears that thus far, at least with chronic do sing on this trial, hematologic DLT may 
be more prevalent than previously observed in the pediatric Phase I study (ADVL0416), 
in which patients most commonly received only 1 course of vorinostat. It is however 
worth noting that, due to the concern for intr a-tumoral hemorrhage for our patient 
population, the definition for a dose -limiting thrombocytopenia (grade 3 < 50,000/µL), 
was intentionally defined more stringently than the typical definition of a dose -limiting 
thrombocytopenia (grade 4 < 25,000/µL) for  a phase I study such as ADVL0416. We 
observed 2 out of 12 patients who experienced grade -3 thrombocytopenia with 
maintenance vorinostat, but it has been reassuring that recurrent grade -3 
thrombocytopenia has not been observed after dose -reduction of vorin ostat. Moving 
forward with conduct of PART B of the study, it is our expectation that repeated dosing 
of vorinostat during maintenance therapy may result in more patients experiencing dose -
limiting thrombocytopenia than originally anticipated, but based on  clinical observations 
from PART A of the study, we do not anticipate that discontinuation of maintenance 
vorinostat due to recurrent hematologic DLT will be a common occurrence. We have 
therefore modified the toxicity monitoring rule in Section 11.3.6  such that vorinostat 
dosing during maintenance will only be modified using the rule outlined in the Section 
11.3.6 . 
 
Part B, the phase 2 portion of the trial, will be perf ormed group -wide once the MTD of 
vorinostat during radiation is defined.  Patients enrolling onto the phase 2 portion of the 
study will be enrolled at 230 mg/m2/day, the MTD for vorinostat during radiation and 
continue on maintenance therapy as described ab ove. The primary aim of Part B of the 
study is to determine the effect of administering vorinostat concurrently with radiation, 
followed by maintenance vorinostat for up to 12 courses, as measured by 1 -year EFS and 
OS in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.  Data collected from any patients enrolled at 
the MTD from Part A of the trial will be included in analyzing the outcome from Part B 
of the study.  
 
Based on pre -clinical studies described in sections 2.2.2  throu gh 2.2.4 , we hypothesize 
that levels of HDAC2 and histone acetylation in PBMCs may be appropriate surrogate 
markers for vorinostat’s biologic effect in tumor, and that vorinostat’s inhibition of 
dsDNA break  repair and NHEJ activity may correlate with its radiation potentiation. 
Therefore, we propose to study these biological parameters in PBMCs before and at 2 
weeks after starting vorinostat and radiation therapy, and at completion of vorinostat and 
radiatio n. In addition, when DIPG tumor samples (paraffin embedded tissue blocks) are 
available, we also propose to determine levels of DNA repair proteins from the NHEJ 
(Ku70, Ku80, DNA -PK) and HRR (BRCA 1 and 2, Rad51) pathways by Western 
analysis or immunohisto chemistry. Any correlation between these biological parameters 
and clinical outcome will be explored.

3.0 STUDY ENROLLMENT  
 
3.1 Patient Registration   
Prior to enrollment on this study, patients must be assigned a COG patient ID number. 
This number is ob tained via the eRDE system once authorization for the release of 
protected health information (PHI) has been obtained. The COG patient ID number is 
used to identify the patient in all future interactions with COG. If you have problems with 
the registration , please refer to the online help.   
 
In order for an institution to maintain COG membership requirements, every newly 
diagnosed patient needs to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the 
Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The Childhood C ancer Research Network 
(CCRN) .  
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as par t of the registration process. 
Each patient will be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID. For additional 
information about the labeling of specimens pleas e refer to the Pathology and/or Biology 
Guidelines in this protocol .  
 
3.2 IRB Approval  
Local IRB/REB approval of this study must be obtained by a site prior to enrolling 
patients. Sites must submit IRB/REB approvals to the NCI’s Cancer Trials Support Unit  
(CTSU) Regulatory Office and allow 3 business days for processing. The submission 
must include a fax coversheet (or optional CTSU IRB Transmittal Sheet) and the IRB 
approval document(s).   The CTSU IRB Certification Form may be submitted in lieu of 
the sig ned IRB approval letter.   All CTSU forms can be located on the CTSU web page 
(https://www.ctsu.org ). Any other regulatory documents needed for access to the study 
enrollment screens will be listed for the study on the C TSU Member’s Website under the

3.4 Institutional Pathology Report  
Because DIPGs are often not biopsied, enrollment of patients with typical -appearing 
DIPG (see section 4.1.2) without an institutional pathology report is allowed. For patients 
with brainstem tumors not considered typical DIPG as defined in section 4.1.2 , they will 
only be eligible if their tumors are biopsied and meet the eligibility criteria as defined in 
section 4.1.2 . Immediately following enrollment, the institutional pathology report for the 
diagnosis under which the patient is being enrolled must be faxed, with the corresponding 
shuttle sheet, to the Operations Center at (626) 447 -2204.  The fax should be sent to the 
attention of the study research coordinator and must include the associated study number 
and COG patient registration and accession numbers. Personal identifiers, including the 
patient’s name and initials must be removed from  the institutional pathology report prior 
to submission to COG.  
 
 
3.5 Study Enrollment  
Patients may be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study have 
been met. Study enrollment is accomplished by going to the Enrollment applicat ion in the 
RDE system.  If you have problems with enrollment, refer to online help in the 
Applications area of the COG website.  
 
3.6 Timing  
Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins.  The date protocol therapy is projected 
to start must be no late r than seven ( 7) calendar days after the date of study enrollment. 
Patients must not receive any protocol therapy prior to enrollment.  
 
 
 
4.0 PATIENT ELIGIBIL ITY  
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 
days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  If more than 7 calendar days elapse 
between the date eligibility studies outlined in section 4.1.5 were obtained and the start 
date of treatment, then the following studies must be repeated prior to treatme nt: CBC 
with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If any of these repeat 
laboratory studies are outside the parameters required for eligibility (labs may again be 
repeated within 48 -72 hours), then the patient is off protocol therapy.   Imaging studies 
are required within 2 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy . 
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and 
cannot be waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01).  All clinical and laboratory data 
requi red for determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be 
available in the patient’s medical or research record which will serve as the source 
document for verification at the time of audit.

5.0 TREATMENT PROGRA M 
 
 
5.1 Overview of Treatment Plan  
 
All patients must begin therapy no later than 7 days after study enrollment. Enrollment 
must be no later than 28 days after the date of radiographic diagnosis or surgery, 
whichever is the later date. Radiation therapy (RT) will be administered in single  daily 
fractions of 1.8 Gy for 30 treatments over 6 -7 weeks.  The total dose of radiation will be 
54 Gy (see section 15.0). During radiation, patients on Part A o f the study will receive 
vorinostat as per Table 1, section 5.3.1 , for the duration of radiation treatment. Following 
completion of radiation therapy, patients will immediately begin maintenance therapy 
with vorinostat (see guidelines in section 5.4 ) for a maximum of 12 cycles.  
 
Note :   It is recommended but not required that Day 1 of the first cycle of protocol 
therapy begin on a Monday in order to extend the duration of radiation therapy in 
the first week.  
 
Patients' doses are to be prescribed based on dosing nomogram in Appendix III.    
 
Vorinostat is available as a 100 -mg capsule or a 50 mg/mL pediatric suspension. The 
dosing for pediatric suspension shou ld be rounded to the nearest 5 mg. Dosing for 
vorinostat capsule should be determined according to the nomogram provided in 
Appendix III , in which vorinostat doses have been rounded to the nearest 100 mg. 
Please note that the absolute daily dose of vorinos tat should not exceed 500 mg. 
Patients with a BSA < 1.25 m2 should be given the pediatric suspension, since using 
capsules can lead to more than a 15% deviation in intended dosing.  Patients ≥ 1.25 
m2  should receive either capsules per the nomogram or suspension, but may not receive a 
combination of both. Vorinostat capsules should not be opened or crushed. Vorinostat 
should be taken with food whenever possible.  If a patient vomits within 30 minutes after 
the dose of vorinostat is administered, that dose should be repeated. If a patient vomits 
after 30 minutes, the dose will not be repeated.   
 Timing of protocol therapy administration, respo nse assessment studies, and surgical interventions 
are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. 
Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease 
evaluations (and  up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or 
facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative 
Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

PART A: Phase 1 dose -finding study (Phase 1 Consortium institutions only)  
 
As of Amendment #2,  Part A was completed.  
 
Part A of this study is the phase 1 dose -finding study to define the MTD or recommended 
phase 2 dose of vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy. Part A of the study will 
be completed within the COG Phase 1 Consortium institutio ns. Patients will start 
vorinostat on the first day of radiation therapy at the assigned dose level and schedule . 
Refer to Table 1, Section 5.3.1  for the dose escalation schema. Following completion of 
radiation therapy, patients enrolled in Part A of the study will continue maintenance 
vorinostat therapy per guidelines in Section 5.4 . 
 
Patients or their guardians will keep a diary to document the intake of  each dose of 
vorinostat and potential side effects (see Appendices IV -A, IV-B, and IV-C). Please 
instruct patient/parents to re cord each dose on the diary immediately rather than waiting 
until a later time. Errors on the diary should be crossed out and initialed. The patient 
diary should be reviewed weekly with the patient and family during radiation treatment 
and at the completio n of each treatment cycle during maintenance therapy, and drug 
should be accounted for at this time. These diaries should also be faxed to the COG 
Statistics and Data Center, with the corresponding shuttle sheet, at (626) 447 -2204 after 
each treatment cycl e. 
 
PART B: Phase 2 component of the study (COG Groupwide)  
Part B is the phase 2 portion of the study to determine the efficacy of combining 
vorinostat with radiation and then continuing vorinostat as maintenance therapy in 
children newly diagnosed with DI PG. Part B of the study will begin enrollment once the 
MTD for Part A has been determined. For Part B of the study, patients will receive 
vorinostat, at 230 mg/m2/day Monday through Friday ( the MTD determined in Part A of 
the study ), with concurrent radiat ion, and then continue maintenance therapy with 
vorinostat (per guidelines in section 5.4 ) for a maximum of 12 courses. Part B of the 
study will take place at member COG institutions, group wide.  
 
5.1.1  Vorinostat Administration During Radiation Therapy  
 
As of Amendment #2, Part A was completed.  
 
PART A : Patients on Part A of the study will start vorinostat on the first day of 
radiation therapy at the dose level assigned at enrollment . Refer to Table 1, section 
5.3.1  for the Dose Escalation Schema.  
 
PART B : Once the MTD of vorinostat for Part A of the study has been determined , 
patients on Part B of the study will start vorinostat on the first day of radiat ion 
therapy at 230 mg/m2/day as determined on Part A of the study . See Appendix IX 
for Chemoradiotherapy Roadmap.  
 
Vorinostat dosing during and throughout the radiation component of therapy 
should be based on BSA determined from height and weight at the st art of 
radiation therapy.  The absolute daily dose of should not exceed 500 mg.    
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  24 
 
Vorinostat should be given 60 -120 minutes prior to radiation therapy, whenever 
feasible. For patients who must remain NPO for sedation prior to RT therapy, 
vorinostat should be given immediately prior to bedtime on the evening preceding 
the RT.  
 
 
See Section 5.6  for definition of DLTs encountered during radiation therapy and 
Section 6.0 for vorinostat dose modifications.  
 
If radiation is omit ted because of holiday or other logistical reasons, patients should 
still continue their scheduled vorinostat without interruption.  
 
5.1.2  Vorinostat Administration During Maintenance Therapy (Part A and B)  
All patients (on Part A or Part B), upon comple tion of radiation therapy, will 
immediately continue vorinostat as maintenance therapy, provided that they 
continue to meet all on -study criteria and have not experienced toxicities 
necessitating interruption or discontinuation of vorinostat.  
 
Dosing of v orinostat during maintenance therapy will be determined per guidelines 
in Section 5.4 . See Appendix X for Maintenance Roadmap.  
 
Vorinostat doses during the maintenance phase of therapy should be adjusted 
based on the BSA determined from  height and weight obtained within one 
week  prior to the beginning of each cycle . The absolute daily dose of 
vorinostat should not exceed 500 mg.  
 
A cycle of maintenance therapy is defined as 28 days. Maintenance therapy may b e 
continued for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression and/or 
excessive toxicities.  
 
See section 5.6  for definition of DLTs encountered during maintenance therapy and 
section 6.0 for vorinostat dose modification.  
 
5.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles (Part A and B)  
 
5.2.1  Chemoradiotherapy  
Radiation therapy should not be interrupted for vorinostat -related DLTs 
unless clinically indicated.  
 
5.2.2  Vorinostat Maintenance Therapy  
A complete cycle of m aintenance therapy is defined as 28 days . Cycles of 
maintenance therapy should not commence unless the ANC is ≥ 1,000/ µL and 
platelet count is ≥ 100,000/ µL. Missed doses of vorinostat during a cycle will 
not be made up.  Maintenance therapy may be continued i n the absence of 
disease progression (see section 5.4 ).

during radiation therapy  
*starting dose level  
 
The starting dose of vorinost at for Part A of the study will be Dose Level 1,  
180 mg/m2/day, Monday through Friday weekly during the duration of radiation 
therapy (on Days 1 -5, 8-12, 15 -19, 22 -26, 29 -33, and 36 -40). If radiation 
continues into Days 43 -48 then vorinostat should continu e at the same dose and 
schedule until RT is completed.  
 
The starting dose is one dose level below the MTD (230 mg/m2/day) determined 
in ADVL0416. One dose de -escalation (Dose Level 0, 180 mg/m2/day, Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday weekly during radiation the rapy) will be evaluated if 
Dose Level 1 is not well tolerated. The phase 1 dose -finding study will conclude 
if Dose Level 2 (230 mg/m2/day, Monday -Friday weekly, during radiation 
therapy) is well tolerated.  
 
Note : It is recommended but not required that D ay 1 of the first cycle of 
protocol therapy begin on a Monday in order to extend the duration of 
radiation therapy in the first week.  
 
If Dose Level 0 is not well tolerated, all subsequent patients will receive radiation 
without vorinostat.   
 
Patients enro lled in Part A of the study, upon completion of vorinostat and 
radiation therapy, will continue vorinostat as maintenance therapy, per section 
5.4, provided that they continue to meet the criteria to start s ubsequent cycles of 
therapy.

5.3.2  Part B Chemoradiotherapy   
Once the MTD of vorinostat for Part A of the study has been determined, Part B of 
the study will begin enrollment, and subsequent patients will receive vorinostat at 
230 mg/m2/day as determined  in Part A of the study.  See Appendix IX  for 
Chemoradiotherapy Roadmap.  
 
5.3.3  Intra -Patient Escalation  
Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed in either Part A or Part B of the study.  
 
5.4 Vorinostat Maint enance Therapy (Parts A and B)  
At the conclusion of chemoradiotherapy, all patients will continue vorinostat 
maintenance therapy at Dose Level 1 ( 230 mg/m2/day, continuously; Table 2) including 
those patients who had discontinued vorinostat during chemorad iotherapy because of 
DLTs.

5.5 Grading of Adverse Events  
The descriptions and grading scal es found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.   All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can b e downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).Any suspected or confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be 
reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair.  
 
5.6 Defini tion of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are at least possibly, probably or 
definitely attributable to vorinostat. For Part A of the study, the observation period for the 
purpose of dose -escalation will b e the entire duration of radiation therapy (approximately 
6 to 7 weeks). For Part B of the study, DLTs observed at any time during protocol 
therapy will be documented.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological toxicities are defined separately, as  
detailed below.

6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIO NS FOR ADVERSE EVENT S 
 
The Study Chair must be notified of any dose modification or use of Filgrastim.  
 
6.1 Dose Modification for DLT During Vorinostat a nd Concurrent Radiation  (Parts A 
and B)  
For vorinostat -related non -hematologic DLTs during  radiation therapy, vorinostat will be 
withheld until the toxicity resolves to meet on study parameters, and the patient will 
restart vorinostat at one dose level low er (see Table  1 below ), if not already at Dose 
Level 0.  
 
 
Table 1:  Oral Vorinostat Dosing During Radiation Therapy  
 
Dose Level  Vorinostat Dose  Vorinostat Schedule  
0 180 mg/m2/dose  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday  
during radiation therapy  
1 180 mg/m2/dose Monday through Friday  
during radiation therapy  
2  
(Starting Dose)  230 mg/m2/dose  Monday through Friday  
during radiation therapy  
 
For vorinostat -related hematologic DLTs, vorinostat will be withheld until criteria in 
6.1.1  and 6.1.2  are met, and vorinostat will be restarted at one dose level lower, if not 
already at Dose Level 0. If the same DLT is experienced at the lower dose level then 
vorinostat should be discont inued.  If a different DLT is encountered, then the patient 
may restart vorinostat at the next lower dose level, if not already at Dose Level 0.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  28 
 
In the event of hematological DLT, a CBC should be checked twice weekly until 
recovery of ANC ≥ 1,000/ µL and platelet ≥ 100,000/ µL. A patient who experiences any 
DLT despite being treated on Dose Level 0 will then complete radiation therapy without 
vorinostat. Radiation should be continued despite vorinostat -related DLT, unless 
there is a strong cl inical contraindication.   
 
6.1.1  Platelet transfusion is permissible and strongly encouraged for patients with 
dose-limiting thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/ µL) to minimize risk of 
intra-tumoral hemorrhage. Vorinostat should not be restarted unti l platelet count 
has recovered to ≥ 100,000/ µL (transfusion independent). Radiation should not 
be interrupted unless clinically indicated.  
 
6.1.2  Patients with grade 4 neutropenia may receive filgrastim (G -CSF) support but 
should re -start vorinostat at the next lower dose level  (See Table in Section 6.1 ). 
Vorinostat should not be restarted until the ANC is ≥ 1,000/ µL and for at least 48 
hours without G -CSF support. Radiation should not be interrupted unless 
clinically indicated.  
 
Patients who expe rience vorinostat -related DLTs during radiation will continue 
vorinostat dosing during maintenance therapy (per guidelines in section 5.4 ), provided 
that they meet the criteria to start subsequent cycles of therapy and all vorinostat -related 
toxicities have resolved to baseline .  
 
6.2 Dose Modification During Maintenance Phase  (Parts A and B)  
For non -hematologic DLTs during maintenance therapy, vorinostat will be withheld until 
the toxicity resolves to meet o n study parameters, and then vorinostat may be restarted 
per section 6.2.3.  
 
For hematologic DLTs during maintenance therapy, vorinostat will be withheld until 
criteria in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 are met, and then vorinostat will be restarted per 6.2.3. Counts 
should be checked twice weekly until recovery of ANC ≥ 1,000/ µL and platelet ≥ 
100,000/ µL.  
 
6.2.1  Platelet transfusion is permissible and strongly encouraged for patients with 
dose-limiting thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/ µL). Vorinostat should 
not be restarted until platelet count has recovered t o ≥ 100,000/ µL. (transfusion 
independent). These patients should receive vorinostat at the next lower dose 
level for subsequent cycles; however, if the patient is already at Dose Level –1, 
then vorinostat will be discontinued. See Section 5.4  
 
6.2.2  For dose -limiting neutropenia, filgrastim (G -CSF) is permitted as clinically 
indicated. Vorinostat should not be started until ANC recovers to ≥ 1,000/ µL for 
at least 48 hours without G -CSF support.  Patients shoul d start the subsequent 
cycle at the next lower dose level, without G -CSF support; however, if a patient 
experiences dose -limiting neutropenia at Dose Level –1, then vorinostat will be 
discontinued. See Sectio n 5.4  
  
6.2.3  Once study parameters are met as described above for vorinostat -related DLTs, 
vorinostat will be restarted at one dose level lower, if not already at Dose Level -
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  29 
1. If the same DLT is experienced at the lower dose level, then vorinostat shou ld 
be discontinued. If a different DLT is encountered, then the patient may restart 
vorinostat at the next lower dose level, if not already at Dose Level -1. Patients 
experiencing a DLT at Dose Level -1 will discontinue vorinostat.  See Section 5.4  
 
6.3 DSMB Monitoring of Toxicities During Maintenance  
 Toxicities during the maintenance component of this study will be monitored at regular 
intervals by the DSMB, and the maintenance dose of vorinostat will be reduced if the 
monitoring rule is met. (See section 11.3.6  for toxicity monitoring rules).  
  
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy 
may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these treatments are 
administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents  
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, steroid, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary.  
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support pl atelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered in accordance with sections 6.1  and 6.2 or for culture proven bacteremia or 
invasive fungal infection. The Study Chair should be notified when growth factors are 
initiated.  
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications  
Anticonvulsants:  Patients must not receive  enzyme inducing anticonvulsants  while on 
protocol therapy . (Please see Appendix  II for a list of enzyme inducing and non -enzyme 
inducing anticonvulsants.)  
 
Anti-coagulant:  Patients  must not receive coumadin, heparin, low -molecular weight 
heparin, or any other anti -coagulant while on protocol therapy.  
 
Anti-platelet agent:  Patients m ust not receive ASA (> 81 mg/day), non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs, clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), or any other drug 
that inhibits platelet functions while on protocol therapy.  
 
7.6 Management of Diarrhea  
Previous trials have shown that the frequency and severity of diarrhea rarely hindered 
administration of vorinostat and could be managed with loperamide. Patients with 
diarrhea must be monitored and treated for signs and symptoms of dehydration promptly. 
Should diarrhea develop, pat ients should be treated with loperamide every 2 -3 hours 
while awake and every 4 hours while asleep, until the patient has a 12 -hour diarrhea -free 
interval. The table below gives the recommend weight -based doses:

9.0 AGENT  INFORMATION  
 
9.1 VORINOSTAT  
(Zolinza®, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA )     (06/06/14) 
 NSC# 701852 , IND# 71976                                                  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  Vorinostat also known as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
(SAHA), i s a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.  Its chemical name is N-hydroxy -N’-
phenyl -octane -1, 8-diotic acid diamide,  N-hydroxy -N’-phenyl (9CI) octanediamide.  The 
HDAC enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of 
proteins, such as histones and transcription factors.  In some cancer cells, there is an 
overexpression of HDACs or an abnormal recruitment of HDACs to oncog enic 
transcription factors  causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones.  
Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and 
repression of gene transcription.  
 
Vorinostat inhibits HDAC by binding directly to the cat alytic pocket of HDAC1, 
HDAC2, and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) enzymes.  Inhibition of HDAC 
activity allows for the accumulation of acetylated histones.  This accumulation influences 
the regulation of gene expression.  In vitro , exposure of cultur ed transformed cell to 
vorinostat led to G1 or G2 phase cell -cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation and 
demonstrated synergistic and additive activity in combination with other cancer therapies 
(including radiation, kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic agents , and differentiating agents).  The 
mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized.  
 
After oral administration, vorinostat is rapidly absorbed, however, administration with a 
high-fat meal resulted in a 33% increase in  the extent of absorption and a 2.5 -hour delay 
in the rate of absorption compared to the fasted state.  Vorinostat is approximately 71% 
bound to human plasma protein.  It  is extensively metabolized to inactive metabolites, 
primarily by glucuronidation and hydrolysis followed by beta-oxidation. The two 
metabolites, O-glucuronide of vorinostat and 4 -anilino -4-oxobutanoic acid are 
pharmacologically inactive. In vitro  studies indicate that vorinostat  is not metabolized by 
and does not inhibit the activity of cy tochrome P -450 enzymes.  Less than 1% of an 
administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Approximately 35 -52% of an oral 
dose of vorinostat  is excreted in the urine as the two major metabolites.  The mean 
terminal half -life of vorinostat and the O-glucuronide metabolite  is approximately 2 
hours , while that of the 4 -anilino -4-oxobutanoic acid metabolite it is 11 hours.  
DDI 
 
Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were 
observed in patients receiving vorinostat  with coumarin -derivative anticoagulants (eg, 
warfarin).  Therefore PT and INR should be monitored when coumarin -dervative 
anticoagulants are started or discontinued . 
 
When vorinostat was administered with other HDAC inhibitors (eg, valproic acid), severe 
thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported.

Note : Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza) in combination with other agents could cause an 
exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the 
combination may result in events never previously as sociated with either agent.  
 
 
PLEASE NOTE:  The potential risks listed in the CAEPR whose relationship to 
vorinostat  is still undetermined are not required by CTEP to be described in the ICD; 
however, they may be communicated to patients according to local  IRB 
requirements.  
 
 
Effect in pregnancy:  Vorinostat is Pregnancy Category D .  It may cause  fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman.  Adequate contraception must be used by all 
patients (both male and female) and their partners during therapy with  vorinostat and for 
30 days after the completion of study drug administration.  
 
Formulation and Stability: Vorinostat is supplied as a white, opaque gelatin, size 3 
capsule, containing 100 mg of vorinostat.  The inactive ingredients in each capsule include  
microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, and magnesium stearate.  Vorinostat 100 
mg capsules are supplied in bottles containing 120 capsules.  
 
Store vorinostat capsules at room temperature, 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF). Do not store above 
30ºC and av oid exposure to excessive moisture.  
 
A formulation for compounding vorinostat suspension by the pharmacy is provided 
below:  
 
Ingredients:  
Vorinostat 100 mg capsules  20 capsules  
OraPlus or Suspensol S   20 mL  
OraSweet    20 mL  
 
Instructions:  
Add 20 mL of Su spensol S or OraPlus into an amber or clear glass 4 ounce bottle.  Place 
the contents of 20 capsules of vorinostat 100 mg into the same bottle and shake to 
disperse.  Shaking may take up to 3 minutes.  Once dispersed, add 20 mL of OraSweet to 
achieve a tot al volume of 40 mL.  Shake again to disperse.  The final concentration is 50 
mg/mL.  Store at room temperature.  The suspension is stable for 4 weeks when stored at 
room temperature, away from excessive heat and humidity.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the 
protocol.  
Vorinostat should be taken with food.  The capsules should not be opened or 
crushed.  A suspension can be prepared by the pharmacy for patients that cannot 
swallow (see Formulation and Stability s ection above).  
 
If a patient needs less than 120 capsules for a treatment cycle, the exact number of 
capsules needed for treatment can be counted into a prescription bottle.

Direct contact of the powder in vorinostat capsules with the skin or mucous mem branes 
should be avoided. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly. Clean powder spills from 
broken or damaged vorinostat capsules carefully minimizing inhalation. Wash spill area at 
least 3 times with ethyl alcohol, followed by water.  
 
Supplier:   Supplied by Merck Research Laboratories  and distributed by the NCI DTCD.  
Do not use commercially available drug  
 
Agent Ordering  
NCI supplied agent may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pha rmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained.)  The CT EP assigned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of I nvestigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under  the name of one lead 
investigator at that institution.  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees must  submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order 
Processing (OAOP) application < https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx   >.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment 
of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account < https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/  > and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” 
password.  For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call 
(240) 276-6575  Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) or email 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  anytime.  
 
Agent Accountability  
Agent Inventory Records  – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the 
investigator, must maintain a c areful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents 
received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF).  (See 
the CTEP home page at  
 http:// ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#agents_drugs  for the 
Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage and 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/default.htm  to obtain a copy of the DARF and Clinic al Drug 
Request form.)  
 
Agent Returns  
Investigators/Designees must return unused DCTD supplied investigational agent to the 
NCI clinical repository as soon as possible when: the agent is no longer required because 
the study is completed or discontinued and  the agent cannot be transferred to another 
DCTD sponsored protocol; the agent is outdated or the agent is damaged or unfit for use. 
Regulations require that all agents received from the DCTD, NCI be returned to the 
DCTD, NCI for accountability and disposi tion. Return only unused vials/bottles. Do

CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Radiographic evidence of progressive disease (see section 12 .0). 
b) Clinical evidence of disease progression that can not be clearly attributed to 
weaning of dexamethasone, side effects from anti -epileptics, electrolyte

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHI CAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
There will be two parts in this study, for patients  with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic 
pontine gl iomas : 
 
PART A : Phase I dose -finding component  
PART B : Phase II component  
 
A minimum of 2 evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level for determination of 
MTD in Part A. Accrual to Part B of the study will only open once the MTD or 
recommended ph ase 2 dose has been determined in Part A. Review of patient accrual 
onto a recent COG study of DIPG, ACNS0126, enrolled 63 patients in 15 months; hence 
the expected annual accrual for this study is 50 patients (2 -3 patients per month in phase 
1, and 4 -5 patients per month in phase 2), which will permit completion of this study 
within 1.6 years. A maximum of 80 patients is anticipated . Twelve patients were enrolled 
on Part A and Phase II will enroll up to 68 patients to obtain 65 eligible patients  for a 
maxi mum  of 870 patients.  
 
11.2 Part A of the Study  
 
11.2.1  Definitions  
 Evaluable For Adverse Effects  
Any patient who receives the study drug will be evaluable for Adverse Effects. 
However, for the consideration of dose escalation, patients must be fully 
evaluable for toxicity. Any patient who experiences DLT at any time during 
protocol therapy is considered fully evaluable for Adverse Effects. Patients 
without DLT who receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol 
guidelines are also considered full y evaluable for Adverse Effects. Patients who 
are not fully evaluable for Adverse Effects at a given dose level will be replaced.  
 
 Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one -third of patients 
experience DLT (See section 5.6 ) during the chemoradiotherapy component in 
part A of the study. In the event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable 
patients are different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and 
myelosuppression), ex pansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered if 
all of the following conditions are met:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be related to dose  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committe e chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, then dose escalation can proceed.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  44 
11.2.2  Dose Escalation and Determinati on of MTD   
 
The rolling six phase 1 trial design will be used for the conduct of this study92  
Two to six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent 
upon (1) the number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number 
of patients who have experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the 
number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose 
level.  Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study 
endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants curre ntly enrolled 
in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at 
risk for developing a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet 
assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a 
dose c ohort, if toxicity data is available for all three when the fourth participant 
entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and the fourth participant is 
enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet available for one or more 
of the fir st three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT has 
been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if 
two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de -escalated. This 
process is repeated for partici pants five and six. In place of suspending accrual 
after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is 
filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the 
next available participant if escalation  or de -escalation rules have not been 
fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.  
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the 
current dose level (ii) at an escalated dose level, ( iii) at a de -escalated dose level, 
or whether the study is suspended to accrual:

* If six patients already entered at next lower dose level, the MTD has been defined.  
**If final dose level has been reached, the recommended dose has been reached.  
 
If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients  experience DLT at a given dose 
level, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped (see 
section 11.2.1  for exception to rule).  
 
Patients enrolled on Part A will continue on maintenance therap y as described in 
section 5.4 . 
 
In addition to determination of the MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities 
will be reported.  
 
11.3 Part B of the Study  
The second portion of the study will begin after s electing the treatment dose for 
vorinostat in the phase I portion (Part A) of the study.  The primary aim of this part of the 
study is to determine the effect on event -free survival and overall -survival, of 
administering vorinostat concurrently with radiat ion therapy, followed by maintenance 
vorinostat for twelve courses, in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.  This 
portion of the trial will be performed group wide once the recommended dose of 
vorinostat during radiation is defined.  Data colle cted from any patients enrolled at the 
MTD from the phase 1 component of the trial will be utilized in the Phase 2 study.  
 
11.3.1   Efficacy Endpoints   
The primary endpoint for the evaluation of treatment efficacy will be event -free 
survival (EFS), defined  as the time to disease progression, disease relapse, 
occurrence of a second neoplasm, or death from any cause, or date of last follow -
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  46 
up measured from the time of study enrollment.  
 
Definitions of Evaluable  
 
Part B:  
Evaluable for Adverse Events and Effic acy 
Patients will be considered evaluable for adverse events and efficacy if they meet 
the following criteria: (1) the patient is el igible; (2) the patient receives  one dose 
of vorinostat at the MTD determined in Phase 1 (230  mg/m2/day) per protocol 
guidel ines, and (3) if central review is required, the patient is confirmed to have 
eligible diagnosis.  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is overall survival (OS), which is defined as the 
time to death from any cause . 
 
Primary Toxicity Endpoints:  
For purposes of analysis, toxicities are classified by whether they are attributed to 
initial therapy (XRT/vorinostat) or to maintenance therapy (vorinostat ). 
XRT/vorinostat -specific toxicities are listed in sections 5.6.1  to 5.6.3 . 
Maintenance vorinostat toxicities are the same as DLTs defined in 
XRT/vorinostat section above, excluding 5.6.1 . Toxic death is death 
predominantly attributable  to treatment -treated causes.  Toxic deaths occurring 
following the start of maintenance will be attributed to maintenance therapy, 
except when the death is clearly related to radiation necrosis or other XRT -
specific toxicities.  
 
11.3.2  Comparison with Bas eline Established from Historical Control  
The most recent relevant historical data on the outcome for patients with DIPGs 
is derived from CCG -9941 and ACNS0126. Figure 1 presents an event -free 
survival plot for the 61 eligible DIPG patients on ACNS0126 and  compares them 
to a similar cohort of 63 patients from CCG -9941. The one -year EFS was 15 ± 
5% for ACNS0126 and 21 ± 5% for CCG -9941.  For the planning of the current 
trial, the combined data of ACNS0126 and CCG -9941 will be used as the 
historical control d ata.  Figure 2 presents an approximation of the failure time 
distribution up to one year by an exponential failure time model.  Fitting an 
exponential model to the combined data yields =1.54/year, and that one -year 
EFS estimated from this model is 21%.   
 
The goal of this study is to compare outcome using historical control data 
described above as a baseline for comparison.  We wish to detect a one -third 
reduction in the risk of failure as a result of this therapy.  This corresponds to a 1 -
year EFS of 36%.   Using the Woolson93,94 one-sample log -rank test, with a one -
sided 5% test of significance and 80%  power, a total of 50 failures is obtained 
under the null hypothesis, which requires an enrollment of 65 patients in 15 -18 
months.

11.3.3  Analysis of Toxicity  
 
The analysis of toxicity will focus on estimates of the rates of 
chemoradiotherapy -phase DLT and rates of maintenance phase toxicities.  
Estimates will be obtained using life -table methods, with an event  defined as the 
first occurrence of a primary toxicity.  Patients who have progression or 
recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses.  Appropriate adjustment 
will be made to the rates estimates to account for potential effects of the initial 
vorinostat dose selection.  
  
11.3.4  Interim Monitoring of event -free survival  
 
Interim monitoring will be based on the Lan -Demets criterion, with spending 
function αt2.  The time point for 100% information is defined as 1.5 years after 
the last patient has  enrolled. Analysis year, percent information, and critical  Figure 1: Event -Free Survival for DIPG

table, if B0.37 exceeds the critical Z -value, 2.47, then the study will be flagged for 
review.

At each time of interim monitoring, we will also calculate the conditional 
probability that the test statistics will be less than the final monitoring boundary 
at the final projected analysis time, under the alternati ve hypothesis viz., 1 -year 
EFS of 36% for patients.  If the conditional probability is less than 0.1, the study 
will be considered for termination because there will be little chance of 
concluding protocol therapy to be superior to historical outcome.  
 
11.3.5 Monitoring for Toxic Death  
 
No serious problems are expected with toxic death (TDR). We will nevertheless 
monitor rates of toxic death.  The maximum tolerable TDR is 5%. If TDR is truly 
5%, there is a 40% chance that there will be at least 1 toxic deat h among the first 
enrolled 10 patients, and a 72% chance that there will be at least 1 toxic death 
among the first 25 enrolled patients.  Statistical monitoring rules will not be used. 
Rather, a careful review of treatment and patient safety will be undert aken when 
the first toxic death occurs.  The 2nd toxic death on study will lead to accrual 
suspension.  
 
11.3.6  Monitoring for Toxicity  
 
Toxicities will be monitored separately in chemoradiotherapy and maintenance 
phase. The number of patients who disconti nue vorinostat due to recurrent dose -
limiting toxicities as specified in the Study Endpoints section will be monitored 
using the following rule:  
 
If 3 or more of the first 16 patients or 7 or more of the first 48 patients  
discontinue vorinostat due to rec urrent dose -limiting toxicities , then a careful

  The distribution was derived from ACNS0222.  
 
11.5 Correlative Studies  
 
The following measurements will be obtained for analysis of the secondary aims:  
 
(1) H3 and H4 acetylation in PBMC: Pre - and post -treatment levels of H3 and H4 
acetylation in  PBMCs will be measured.  Degree of acetylation in peripheral blood 
monocytes will be divided into quartiles and coded as none, mild, moderation or 
marked.  
(2) NHEJ activity in PBMC: NEHJ activity is another possible inhibitory target for 
vorinostat. Whether there is a decreased NHEJ activity will be determined.  
(3) Quantifying DNA repair proteins from paraffin -embedded blocks: for 
immunohistochemistry from tumor blocks, the intensity will be graded from 1 to 3; 
for Western analysis, a percentage of the intensity  relative to the tumor with the 
highest level will be measured.

  Page  50 
 
With a total of 65 patients in Part B and unknown compliance rate in submitting samples, 
the analysis of above correlative studies will be exploratory in nature.  Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize the biological/laboratory measures and the changes in 
these measures across time -points. Mean and standard deviation will be used to 
summarize continuous measures; log transformation may be considered when 
appropriate. Categorical meas ures will be described by percentages with binary 
confidence intervals and frequency tables. Exploratory analyses to correlate the 
biological/laboratory measures with disease outcome will be performed. Log rank tests 
will be used to explore the prognostic significance of a categorical factor on EFS or OS. 
Cox proportional hazards models will be used to explore the effect of a continuous 
marker on EFS/OS, and will be used for exploratory multivariate analysis examining the 
effect of the predictor of interest  with adjustments for other patient characteristics or risk 
factors.  
 
 
12.0  EVALUATION CRI TERIA  
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Ev ents (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.   All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
12.2 Methodology to Determine Tumor Measurement  
In order to completely document the assessment of response, the two -dimensional tumor 
measurements for all target lesions upon which the assessmen ts of tumor response are 
based  should be explicitly noted in the radiology report for the baseline and all 
subsequent follow -up exams.  Reports for the follow -up exams should reiterate the 
measurements obtained at baseline for each target lesion. Newly occu rring lesions should 
also be enumerated in these reports, and changes in lesions should be described.  
 
Tumor response criteria for this study are to be determined by changes in size using the 
maximal 2 -dimensional cross -sectional tumor measurements, T x W (product of the 
longest diameter of the tumor [width (W)] and its longest perpendicular diameter 
[transverse (T)], using either T1 or T2 weighted images (which ever gives the best 
estimate of tumor size).   This will allow comparison with historical studies  as outlined in 
the statistical design section, such as CCG -9941 and ACNS0126, which used cross -
sectional measurements in their  determination of response status.  
  
Tumor length (L), perpendicular to the T x W plane should also be measured and 
recorded, sin ce this will provide historical data for future studies that will rely 
exclusively on volumetric response determinations.   However, for the current study, 
3-dimensional tumor volume change will not be used to determine response status.  
  
The following sect ion describes the methodology.  
  
(See drawing below for illustration)  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  51 
1.   Longest diameter of target lesion(s) should be selected in the axial plane only for CT. 
For MRI imaging, the longest diameter can be measured from the axial plane or the 
plane in wh ich the tumor is best seen or measured, provided the same plane is used in 
follow ups.  
2.   The longest measurement of the tumor (or width, W) should be determined.  
3.   The 2 perpendicular measurements should be determined (transverse (T) 
measurement -perpendicular to the width in the selected plane, and the length (L) 
tumor extent in the plane perpendicular to the selected plane).  
4.   Leptomeningeal tumor spread is not a target lesion, as its presence at diagnosis would 
make the patient ineligible for th is brainstem glioma study.   The presence and 
location of leptomeningeal tumor spread at relapse should be noted.  
 
 
 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  52 
12.3 Selection of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
For intrinsic pontine brainstem gliomas, only one lesion/mass is present at diagnosis, an d 
therefore is considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor 
progression/response. (Patients with multiple target lesions at diagnosis are considered to 
have disseminated disease and would be ineligible for this study).  
  
If other non -target lesions develop at relapse (including CSF positive for tumor cells), 
their location should be noted, although they do not need to be measured.  
 
12.4 Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
For this study, comparison of maximal 2 -dimensional measuremen ts, T x W (product of 
the longest diameter [width (W)] and its longest perpendicular diameter [transverse (T)] 
will be used for Response Criteria for Target Lesions.  
  
Complete Response (CR ): The disappearance of all abnormal signal within the 
brainstem an d return to normal size of the brainstem.  
  
Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of the target lesion, taking as reference the initial baseline 
measurements  
  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the products of the two perpendicular 
diameters o f the target lesion to qualify for PR (taking as reference the initial baseline 
measurements), nor sufficient increase in the  target lesion to qualify for PD, (taking as 
reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started).  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   Progressive disease is defined as 25% or more increase in the 
sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters of the target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum of products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions . 
 
12.5 Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in the target lesion, and the 
appearance of new lesions, where applicable, according to the criteria described in the 
table below. The  overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends 
on the assessments of target, non -target, and new lesions in the preceding columns.  
 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  53 
 
12.6 Best Response  
Two objective status determinations of disease status, by MRI, obtained on two 
consecutive determinations, separated by at least a 4 week time period, are required to 
determine the patient’s overall best response.  Two objective status determinations of CR 
before progression are required for best response of CR.  Two determinations o f PR or 
better before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of 
PR. Two determinations of stable/no response or better before progression, but not 
qualifying as CR or PR, are required for a best response of stable/no res ponse; if the first 
objective status is unknown, only one such determination is required.  Patients with an 
objective status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation is 
the first radiographic evaluation after treatment has b een administered) will have a best 
response of progressive disease.  Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify 
for a best response of progressive disease and if all objective statuses after the first 
determination and before progression are unknown.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT R EPORTING REQUIREMENT S 
 
13.1 Purpose  
Adverse eve nt data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  Certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections 
provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
13.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
 
Reporting requirements may include the follow ing considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received at least one dose of an  investigational agent  on this study ; 2) the characteristics of the 
adverse event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), 
and the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; and 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with 
the event.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  54 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administere d under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
13.3 Steps to Determine If an Adve rse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 :  Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria   
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting  and are located on 
the CTEP website at:  
 http://ctep.canc er.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.    
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE . 
 
  Step 3 :   Determine the attribution of adverse event in rela tion to the protocol therapy.   
Attribution categories are: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
 
Step 4 :  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .   
 
Expected events for a CTEP IND agent are defined as those listed in the ASA EL 
(Agent Specific Adverse Event List), a subset of the CAEPR (Comprehensive Adverse 
Event and Potential Risks). For investigational agents that are not commercially available 
and are being studied under a company’s IND  or an investigator held IND, expecte d AEs 
are usually based on the Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
Unexpected  events for a CTEP IND agent are defined as those NOT listed in the 
ASAEL . 
 
Guidance on expectedness of the agent is provided in the Drug Information Section 
of this protocol.  
 
Step 5 :  Review Table A or Table B in this section to determine if:  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting re quirements.  
 
13.4 Reporting methods  
 
• Use the NCI’s Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ). The NCI’s guidelines for 
CTEP -AERS  can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
 
 An CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted by the  following method:  
 
Electronically submit the report via the CTEP -AERS  Web -based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_appl ications/ CTEP -AERS .htm   
 
• Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents  to: 
o The NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND only (fax # 301 -230-0159).  
o and to COG for all IND studies (fax # 626 -241-1795; email: 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  55 
COGQA@childrensoncologygroup.org  attention: COG CTEP -AERS  Coordinator)  
 
• ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed documents.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during 
trial regis tration on all reports.  
 
13.5 When to report an event in an expedited manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via the 
web based application.  
 
In the rare situation where Internet connectivity is disrupted,  the 24 -hour notification is to be 
made to the NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND  by telephone call to 301 -897-7497. 
In addition, once Internet connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour notification that was phoned in 
must be entered into the electronic CTEP-AERS  system by the original submitter of the 
report at the site.    
 
• Submit the report within 5 calendar  days  of learning of the event.  
 
13.6 Other recipients of adverse event reports  
COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Cha ir. 
 
Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the local policy and 
procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient.  
 
13.7 Reporting of Adverse Events for investigational  agents  
Reporting requirements are provided  in Table A  and Table B .  The investigational agent used in this study 
is vorinostat.

14.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components including the COG Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role 
of the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of 
patients and the scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy 
scientific committee; and a member from t he NCI. The DSMC meets at least 
every 6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the 
DSMC from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting 
of the Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for work ing with 
the study statistician to prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The 
DSMC will provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics 
Chair and the Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to 
continue the study unch anged. Data and Safety Committee reports for 
institutional review boards can be prepared using the public data monitoring 
report as posted on the COG Web site.

15.0 RADIATION THERA PY GUIDELINES  
 
Radiation Therapy for patients on COG protocols  can only be delivered at approved COG RT  facilities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15.0.1  General Guidelines  
This is a phase 1/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat) in combination with radiation therapy, followed by 
maintenance therapy with vorinostat, in patients wi th newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine 
glioma (DIPG). All patients will receive radiation therapy on this protocol with the targeted 
volume based on the extent of disease defined by neuroimaging prior to radiation therapy. This 
study specifies a 1 cm  clinical target volume margin and mandates the use of CT -MR registration 
to define the target volume. The allowed treatment methods are restricted to conformal or 
intensity -modulated radiation therapy using photons and electronic data submission is requir ed. 
Proton therapy is not allowed.  
 
15.0.2  Treatment Planning Specifics  
The guidelines for this study were developed based on the performance of COG investigators 
when executing the guidelines in prior COG trials. The goal of the treatment planning process  is 
to develop a plan to deliver a uniform dose to the planning target volume which includes all 
known tumor plus the specified clinical target volume margin. The protocol specified total dose is 
54 Gy using conventional fractionation. Because the total do se does not exceed the recommended 
dose limits for the spinal cord and optic chiasm, volume reductions are not required nor 
recommended.  
 
15.0.3  Required Benchmark and Questionnaires  
Radiation therapy will be administered using photons. Required photon me thods include 3D -
conformal radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Centers 
participating in this protocol using 3D -CRT are required to complete the 3D benchmark; those 
using IMRT must complete the IMRT questionnaire and benchmark or irradiate the RPC head 
and neck phantom. All centers participating in this protocol must complete the QARC CT/MR 
image fusion benchmark. Benchmark materials and questionnaires may be obtained from the 
Quality Assurance Review Center (www.qarc. org) and must be submitted before patients on this 
protocol can be evaluated. For information regarding the IMRT phantoms, please contact the 
RPC (http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc).  
 
15.0.4  Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT  
Investigators using I MRT will be required to comply with the guidelines developed for the use of 
IMRT in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are 
available through www.qarc.org . These guidelines req uire that the protocol explicitly state their 
requirements and methods for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; 
target and organ motion management; nomenclature, definitions and rationale for targets and 
organs at risk; target vo lume coverage and normal tissue dose constraints; effects of heterogeneity Timing of prot ocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed thera py and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility,  procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibite d within the protocol).  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927

in tissues; and quality assurance.  
 
15.1 Indications for Radiation Therapy   
 All patients enrolled on this protocol will receive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy.  
 
15.2 Timing  
 
15.2.1  All patients should be seen in consultation by a radiation oncologist at the time of 
study enrollment. The purpose of the consultation is to participate in the initial 
evaluation and to review the adequacy of the initial diagnostic imaging studies 
that will be used for subsequent RT planning. If additional imaging studies are 
pursued, thin section MR (T2 -weighted and FLAIR) sequences should be 
obtained for registration to the CT data set to assist in treatment planning.  
 
15.2.2  There are no contraindications to radiation therapy.  There are, however, some 
restrictions with regard to concomitant medications and eligibility as detailed in 
section 4.2.2.  Patients receiving corticosteroids must be on a stable or decreasing 
dose for the prior 7 d ays to be eligible.  Patients taking valproic acid must 
discontinue this 2 weeks prior to protocol therapy.  In addition, patients must not 
be receiving enzyme -inducing anticonvulsants (see appendix II for a list of 
enzyme inducing and non -inducing anticon vulsants).  Within these constraints, 
corticosteroids and anticonvulsants should be used as clinically indicated and 
tapered as soon as possible. Prophylactic anticonvulsants are strongly 
discouraged.  
 
15.2.3  Please see section 5.1.1  for details of timing of vorinostat  administration. 
Vorinostat  should be administered between 1 -2 hours prior to each radiation 
therapy fraction when feasible, beginning with the first fraction.  Younger 
patients with NPO r equirements due to sedation during RT will be allowed to 
take vorinostat  6 hours prior to each fraction, or the night before each fraction.  
 
15.3 Emergency Irradiation  
 Patients are not allowed to have received radiation therapy prior to enrollment on this  
protocol and urgent irradiation is not envisioned under any circumstance.   
 
15.4 Equipment and Methods of Delivery and Verification   
 
Equipment  Photons  
(any energy)  IMRT  
(4-10MV)  
Linear Accelerator  X X 
 
15.4.1  Treatment planning  
CT (volumetric) based pl anning is required to optimize dose to the PTV while 
protecting normal tissues. Organs at risk within the irradiated volume should be 
contoured. A DVH is necessary to determine target coverage and evaluate dose to 
normal tissues. CT section thickness shoul d be < 5mm although 2 -3mm is 
preferred.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  65 
 
15.4.2  In-room verification of spatial positioning   
15.4.2.1  Portal imaging is the most common system used to verify patient 
position, in particular when the target volume is believed to 
possess a fixed spatial rel ationship with visualized bony 
anatomy. Orthogonal paired (AP and lateral) portal images (MV 
or kV) are required for IMRT and 3 -D CRT to verify that the 
isocenter is in correct alignment relative to the patient position.  
 
15.4.2.2  Volumetric imaging is all owed in this study. This includes in -room kV or 
MV cone beam or conventional CT imaging. Please submit 
representative axial images showing the isocenter and the correct 
alignment in relationship to the patients’ position. For CT 
tomography where isocenters  are not used, a printout of the 
isodoses overlaid on the fused CT images can be printed to 
demonstrate in room verification.  
 
15.5 Target Volumes  
 
15.5.1  General comments  
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 
50 and 6 2 (www.icru.org ) define prescription methods and nomenclature that 
will be utilized for this study where applicable. Although the MRI obtained 
immediately prior to radiation therapy should be used for treatment planning , the 
target volumes for this study will be determined by the collective information 
that delineates the extent of disease before and after surgical resection or CSF 
shunting procedure. The investigators recognize that resection and shunting are 
unlikely f or these patients. The sequence that best defines the extent of disease 
and post -operative tumor bed (when applicable), should be used to determine the 
GTV and registered to the treatment planning CT. Most patients with DIPG 
require a combination of MR seq uences to delineate the extent of disease.  MR 
T2 and FLAIR sequences are most likely to be those chosen for registration to 
the treatment planning CT data set. The GTV, CTV and PTV and normal tissues 
must be outlined on all axial imaging slices on which t he structures exist.  
 
15.5.2  Definitions for GTV, CTV and PTV  
• Gross tumor volume (GTV) is based on the most recent MRI and/or post -
operative MRI examination (if resection was done) and includes gross 
residual tumor and the tumor bed at the primary site. I n defining the GTV, 
the investigator should consider all imaging studies that have defined the 
extent of tumor and the tissues involved anatomically. The GTV in most 
cases will be the T2 or FLAIR abnormality on the appropriate MR sequence. 
Tissue defects r esulting from surgical approaches, when undertaken, will not 
be included as part of the GTV when not previously involved by tumor. 
Investigators should register the immediate pre -irradiation MR imaging 
sequences that demonstrated tumor and contour the GTV . 
 
• Clinical target volume (CTV) includes the GTV with an added margin of 1 
cm.  This is meant to treat subclinical microscopic disease and is 
anatomically confined (i.e., the CTV is limited to the confines of the bony 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  66 
calvarium, falx and tentorium where app licable or extends up to but not 
beyond neuroanatomic structures through which tumor extension or invasion 
is certain not to have occurred). The CTV may be manually moved inward to 
the inner table of the bony calvarium. When the GTV approaches the 
boundary  of an anatomic compartment, the CTV will extend up to and 
include the boundary. The CTV margin chosen for this study requires 
treatment planning MR and/or diagnostic MR imaging data with image 
section thickness ≤ 5mm.  
 
• Planning target volume (PTV) include s a margin which is added to the CTV 
in 3-dimensions. It is geometric and not anatomically defined. The PTV has 
two components, the internal margin (IM) and the set -up margin (SM). The 
IM is meant to compensate for all movements and variations in size and 
shape of the tissues contained within the CTV. The SM is meant to account 
for set -up, mechanical and dosimetric uncertainties related to daily patient 
positioning, treatment equipment and software.  For this study, the PTV 
margin should be 3 or 5mm. The use  of a PTV margin of 3mm requires 
written documentation that image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) methods 
are used on a daily basis or alternatively that a head fixation system or 
verification system was used with weekly or more frequent imaging. For this 
study, IGRT is defined as 2 - or 3-dimensional digital imaging positioning. 
Given that the CTV is generally confined to the intracranial space, the PTV 
may extend into or beyond bone but is unlikely to extend beyond the surface 
of the patient. The PTV margi n chosen by the treating investigator requires 
treatment planning MR and/or diagnostic MR imaging data with imaging 
section thickness ≤ the chosen PTV margin.  
 
15.6 Target Dose  
 
15.6.1  Dose Definition   
Photon dose is to be specified in centigray (cGy) -to-muscle.  
 
15.6.2  Prescribed dose and fractionation  
The total dose to the isodose surface encompasses the PTV will be 5400cGy 
administered in 30 fractions of 180cGy.  The patient should be treated with one 
fraction per day.  All fields should be treated each day. 
 
Table 15.6.2  Prescribed Doses and Fractionation  
 
Nominal Dose by Site  Target Volume  Dose/fraction  Number of Fractions  
Primary Site 5400cGy  PTV1  180cGy  30 
 
15.6.3  Dose uniformity  
At least 95% of the protocol -specified dose should encompass 100% of t he PTV 
and no more than 10% of the PTV should receive greater than 110% of the 
protocol dose as evaluated by DVH. The 100% isodose should be equal to the 
protocol specified dose. Wedges, compensators and other methods of generating 
more uniform dose distri butions are encouraged . 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  67 
15.6.4  Tissue heterogeneity  
 Calculations must take into account tissue heterogeneity and should be performed 
with CT -based treatment planning to generate dose distributions and treatment 
calculations from CT densities.  For questio ns about heterogeneity corrections or 
approved algorithms, please contact QARC ( www.QARC.org ). 
 
15.6.5  Interruptions, Delays and Dose  Modifications  
 There will be no planned rests or breaks from treatment, and once radiation 
therapy has been initiated, treatment will not be interrupted except for life 
threatening infection or severe hematological toxicity defined as ANC < 300/ L 
or plat elets less than 40,000/ L during the course of treatment. Blood product 
support should be instituted according to institutional/protocol guidelines.  The 
reason for any interruptions greater than 3 treatment days should be recorded in 
the patient treatment  chart and submitted with the QA documentation. There 
should be no modifications in dose fractionation due to age or field size.  
 
 15.7 Treatment Technique  
 
15.7.1  Beam Configuration  
Every attempt should be made to minimize dose to organs at risk without 
compromising coverage of the target volume. Three -dimensional conformal 
therapy (coplanar or non -coplanar) or IMRT are required to minimize dose to 
normal tissues.  
 
15.7.2  Field Shaping   
 Field shaping will be done with either customized cerrobend blocking  or 
multileaf collimation.  
 
15.7.3  Simulation including patient positioning and immobilization  
 
15.7.3.1   Patient positioning   
 Reproducible setups are critical.  The patient may be treated in 
any appropriate, stable position. Consideration should be give n 
to implications for inter and intrafraction motion when using 
non-standard position approaches.  
 
 
15.7.3.2  Immobilization devices  
 Standard immobilization devices for the brain or head and neck 
are to be used.  For IMRT delivery approaches, the methods u sed 
for localization and immobilization of both patient and tumor are 
critical. The imaging studies should provide a clear assessment 
of the target volume with the patient in the treatment position.  
 
15.7.4  Special considerations   
 Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young 
patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments.  
 
15.7.5  Motion Management and Margins to Account for Target Volume Changes 
During Treatment  
 Considering motion of target volumes  is important. Brain tumors susceptible to 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  68 
cyst expansion should be monitored closely.  Any change in clinical condition or 
anatomy related to hydrocephalus, VP shunt placement, subdural fluid, 
pseudomeningocele, or steroid use should be monitored carefull y with repeat 
imaging when indicated.  
 
A description of the method used and evidence of the remaining tumor motion 
(i.e., observed motion during fluoroscopy, motion of surrogate markers using 
camera systems, or analysis of 4D  CT) should be submitted on th e Motion 
Management Reporting Form  with the Quality Assurance Documentation 
materials as noted in Section  15.10 .  
 
15.8 Organs at Risk  
The organ at risk guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the re commended 
doses to the organs at risk are exceeded because of target volume coverage requirements 
or other conditions, an explanation should be included in the quality assurance 
documentation. In some cases, photon IMRT may be the preferred treatment metho d to 
meet these recommendations and the required target volume coverage guidelines.  
 
Dose Constraints  
 
15.8.1  Cochleae   
• D50% <  3500cGy – Goal (each cochlea)  
• D50% < 2000cGy – Preferred (each cochlea)  
• Comment – There is no dose limit for the cochleae.  
• Struc ture definition - Each cochlea will be contoured on the treatment planning 
CT as a circular structure within the petrous portion of the temporal bone.  The 
contour should appear on at least two successive CT images.  
 
15.8.2  Optic Globes   
• D90% <   500cGy, D 50% < 1000cGy and D10% < 3500cGy – Goal  
• D90% < 1000cGy, D50% < 2000cGy and D10% < 5400cGy – Maximum  
• Comment – Effort should be made to avoid direct treatment of the anterior 
chamber of the eye and minimize dose to the entire eye without compromising 
target  volume coverage. In the event that the recommended maximum dose 
constraints provided in this section would be exceeded, the treating radiation 
oncologist may use their discretion to reduce target volume coverage.  
• Structure definition - Each eye should be separately contoured on the treatment 
planning CT or MR as a circular structure from the most superior to inferior 
aspect.  
 
15.8.3  Right and Left Optic Nerves and Chiasm   
• D90% < 1000cGy, D50% < 5400cGy and D10% < 5600cGy – Goal  
• D90% < 5400cGy, D50% < 5600c Gy and D10% < 5800cGy – Maximum  
• Comment – Effort should be made to avoid direct treatment of the optic nerves 
and chiasm without compromising target volume coverage. In the event that the 
recommended maximum dose constraints provided in this section would be 
exceeded, the treating radiation oncologist may use their discretion to reduce 
target volume coverage.  
• Structure definition – The optic nerve may be contoured on CT or MR.  The 
contour should appear on at least two successive CT or MR images.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ACNS0927  
  Page  69 
 
15.8.4  Spinal Cord   
• D90% < 300cGy, D50% < 2600cGy and D10% < 5700cGy - Goal  
• D90% < 900cGy, D50% < 5000cGy and D10% < 5900cGy – Maximum  
• Comment – Effort should be made to minimize dose to the spinal cord without 
compromising target volume coverage.  
• Structure Definit ion - For the purposes of this study, the upper aspect of the 
spinal cord begins at the inferior border of the foramen magnum and should be 
contoured on the treatment planning CT. For purposes of comparison and 
consistency with dose volume data, the spinal  cord should be contoured on a 
number of images to be determined by the image section thickness (CT section 
thickness, n=number of images; 2mm, n=30; 2.5 mm, n=24; 3 mm, n=20). Using 
these guidelines, only the superior -most 6cm of anatomic spinal cord is 
contoured.  
 
15.9 Dose Calculations and Reporting  
 
15.9.1  Prescribed Dose  
The dose prescription and fractionation shall be reported on the RT -1/IMRT 
Dosimetry Summary Form. The total dose delivered shall be reported on the RT -
2 Radiotherapy Total Dose Record . If IMRT is used, the monitor units generated 
by the IMRT planning system must be independently checked prior to the 
patient’s first treatment. Measurements in a QA phantom can suffice for a check 
as long as the patient’s plan can be directly applied to a  phantom geometry.   
 
15.9.2  Normal Tissue Dosimetry  
The dose to the critical organs indicated should be calculated whenever they are 
directly included in a radiation field. The total dose shall be calculated and 
reported on the RT -2 Radiotherapy Total Dose  Record form. The appropriate 
dose-volume histograms should be submitted. If IMRT is used for the primary 
tumor, a DVH must be submitted for a category of tissue called “unspecified 
tissue,” which is defined as tissue contained within the skin, but which i s not 
otherwise identified by containment within any other structure.

the center of the treatment or planning target volume.  The planning target volume, 
isocenter and the normalization method must be clearly indicated.  
• Dose volume histograms (DVH) for all target v olumes and required organs at risk.  A 
DVH shall be submitted for the organs at risk specified in Section  15.8.  When using 
IMRT, a DVH shall be submitted for a category of tissue called “unspecified tissue.”  
This is defined as tissue contained within the  skin, but which is not otherwise 
identified by containment within any other structure.  
• Treatment planning system summary report that includes the monitor unit 
calculations, beam parameters, calculation algorithm, and volume of interest dose 
statistics.  
• Beams-eye-view (BEV) of portals showing collimator, beam aperture, target volume 
and critical structures are required when not using IMRT.  
 
   Digital Data  
• Submission of the treatment plan in digital format is required. Please refer to 
www.QARC.org  and click on "Digital Data" for guidelines regarding digital submission.

APPENDIX VII: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS ( PART B ONLY)  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ACNS092 7 (Part B only)  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
 
A Study of Adding Vorinostat to Treatment for Newly Diagnosed DIPG Brain Tumors  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your brain tumor, called a DIPG. Your brain tumor is a type of 
cancer that g rows in the area of the brain that controls things like your breathing and your heart beat. 
After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.   
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you were just diagnosed with a type of 
brain tumor that is hard to treat. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways 
to help people who are sick.  This study will see if a new treatment will work better to get rid of DIPG 
than the normal treatment.   
The normal treatme nt is the use of high -energy x -rays to get rid of the cancer cells. But this x -ray 
treatment may only work for a short time. Sometimes it does not work at all. Study doctors want to 
see if giving a drug during the x -ray treatment will help get rid of more cancer cells. Study doctors 
also want to see if giving the drug after x -ray treatments will help get rid of any cancer cells that may 
still be in the brain. Study doctors hope this new treatment will work better than the normal treatment 
to get rid of canc er cells.   
3. Children who are part of this study will be treated with an anti -cancer medicine called vorinostat. 
Vorinostat is a medicine that you will swallow. You will take it during the time you are having the x -
ray treatments. At the end of the x -ray tre atment you will take more vorinostat as long as you do not 
have bad effects from it and your cancer does not get any worse.  Treatment with the vorinostat may 
last up to about a year. Doctors will check you often to see how the treatment is working.   
4. Somet imes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the new 
treatment will work better than the normal treatment to get rid of t he tumor. But we do not know for 
sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study.   
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that you may have bad health problems from the 
vorinostat. If this happens you may need treatment for the health problems. Other things may happen 
to you that we do not yet know about.   
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide  to stop being in 
this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor 
can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions you have.   
7. We are asking your “okay” to collect some extra blood three times during your treatment.  One of the 
blood samples would be taken when other standard blood tests are being performed. The second 
sample would be taken during the third week of vorinostat and radiation. The third sample would be 
taken during the last w eek of vorinostat and radiation. So, there would be two extra blood draws. 
Sometimes doctors do an operation to find out if you have cancer. If you had an operation, we are 
also asking your “okay” to study any tissue the doctors took out during this operat ion. We want to see 
if there are ways to tell how the cancer will react to treatment. You can still take part in this study 
even if you do not allow us to collect the extra blood samples or the tissue for research.

(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age)  
 
A Study of Adding Vorinostat to Treatment  for Newly Diagnosed DIPG Brain Tumors  
  
1. We have been talking with you about your brain tumor, called a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or 
DIPG, for short. DIPG brain tumors are a type of cancer that grows in the lowest part of your brain 
called the brain stem . The brain stem is the area of the brain that controls your breathing, blood 
pressure, and heart rate.  DIPG tumors are hard to treat. Af ter doing tests, we have found that you have 
this type of cancer.   
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have been newly diagnosed with 
DIPG and it is hard to treat. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new wa ys to 
help people who are sick.  This study will see if a new treatment will work better to get rid of DIPG 
than the standard treatment for this disease.   
The standard treatment for this kind of tumor is radiation therapy (the use of high -energy x -rays) to  
get rid of the cancer cells. But radiation therapy may only work for a short time. Sometimes it does 
not work at all. Study doctors want to see if giving a drug during the radiation therapy will help get 
rid of more cancer cells. Study doctors also want t o see if giving the drug after radiation therapy will 
help get rid of any cancer cells that may still be in the brain. Study doctors hope this new treatment 
will work better than the standard treatment to get rid of cancer cells.   
3. Children and teens who ar e part of this study will be treated with radiation therapy once a day for 30 
days. During this time you will also take a drug called vorinostat. Vorinostat is a medicine that you 
will swallow. At the end of radiation therapy, you will then take more vorin ostat as long as you do 
not have side effects from it and your cancer does not get any worse.  Treatment with the vorinostat 
may continue for up to a year. You will have tests and scans done regularly to check how you are 
doing and how the treatment is work ing.   
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that the new 
treatment will work better to get rid of the tumor than the standard treatment. However, we do not 
know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study.   
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The risks to you from this stud y are that you may have side effects from the 
combination of radiation therapy with vorinostat, or the vorinostat alone. Some possible side effects 
include things like being very tired, an upset stomach, and not being able to keep food down. Other 
things m ay happen to you that we do not yet know about.   
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in 
this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor 
can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions you have.   
7. We are asking your permission to collect additional blood three times during your treatment. One of 
these blood samples would be taken when other standard blood tests are being perfor med, on the first 
day you have radiation therapy. The second blood sample would be taken during the third week of 
radiation therapy. The last blood sample would be taken during the last week of radiation therapy. So, 
there would be two extra blood draws. W e are also asking your permission to study tumor tissue that 
may have been removed during surgery to diagnose your cancer. We want to see if there are ways to 
tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. You can still be treated on this study even if you  do not 
allow us to collect the extra blood samples and/or tumor tissue for research .

 Radiation therapy (RT) will  be administered in single daily fractions of 1.8 Gy for 30 treatments over 6 -7 weeks.  The total dose of radiation will be 54 Gy 
(see section 15.0 ). During radiation, patients will receive vorinostat  230 mg/m2/day  Monday through Friday weekly during the duration of radiation 
therapy (on Days 1 -5, 8-12, 15 -19, 22 -26, 29 -33, and 36 -40). If radiation continues into Days 43 -47 then vorinostat should continue at the same dose 
and schedule until RT is completed . Vorinostat dosing during and throughout the radiation component of therapy should be based on BSA determined 
from height and weight at the start of radiation therapy.  The absolute daily dose of vorinostat should not exceed 500 mg. Vorinostat should be given 6 0-
120 minutes prior to radiation therapy, whenever feasible.  If a patient vomits within 30 minutes after the dose of vorinostat is administered, that dose 
should be repeated. If a patient vomits after 30 minutes, the dose will not be repeated.

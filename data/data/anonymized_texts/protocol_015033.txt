  1 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Background  
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA), accounting for over 11 m illion 30 -day prescriptions and nearly $50 million in medication costs 
annually. Though effective for treatment of acid -related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), PPIs 
have been associated with a number of possible harms in observational studies (e.g., enteric infections such as 
Clostridium difficile colitis, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, fractures, dementia, and a recent VA study reported increased mortality in Veterans receiving PPIs ). Unfortunately, PPIs continue to be used without an appropriate 
indication or for longer and at higher doses than necessary. Accordingly, in September 2019, VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (PBM) deployed the Randomized PPI De -Prescribing (RaPPID) Program – a national, multi -level PPI 
de-prescribing initiative targeting patients for whom chronic PPI therapy may not be necessary. This program, modeled after a successful initiative in one Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), comprises 3 key c omponents: (1) 
activation of clinical pharmacy specialists; (2) provider education and targeted notifications and academic detailing; and, 
(3) patient education.  
 
Objectives  
We sought to evaluate RaPPID through a cluster -randomized trial of PPI de-prescri bing involving 17 VISNs  to (1) 
identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation of RaPPID; and (2) understanding whether the program is 
effective at improving appropriate use of PPIs and whether there are any unintended consequences , (3) assessing h ow 
successfully the program components are delivered, a critical question in understanding why the program did or did not work as intended; and, (4) estimating the costs and possible savings associated with the program and with PPI de -
prescribing in genera l. 
 
Methods  
We evaluated  RaPPID in the context of a nationwide, stratified cluster -randomized controlled trial that incorporated 
assessments of both effectiveness and implementation (hybrid type II; cluster = VISN). Initially, the dashboard algorithm 
was validated and evaluated, the dashboard was user -tested and refined (months 1-11), the program w as deployed 
nationally in a cluster -randomized fashion (months 12-24), and sub jects were  follow ed for 12 months  (months 24-36) . In 
months 1 8-30 , we conducted a pr ocess evaluation. Data sources include d VA Corporate Data Warehouse ( CDW) , patient 
surveys, and interviews with VISN Pharmacy Executives, PBM Academic Detailers, pharmacists, and primary care providers.  
 Impact  
This approach allow ed us to simultaneously understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of a program focused 
on stopping use of a specific treatment (de-implementation), share data with VA PBM so they could  refine the program 
to maximize fidelity and consistency of implementation, measure important clinical outcomes, and improve the health of Veterans at scale.  The study also provided broader lessons about how to effectively undertake other such nation -wide 
interventions.

  3 2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
Focusing VHA resources more efficiently through de -implementation of low -value care is one of VHA’s top 5 strategic 
priorities. But, to date, large -scale, programmatic initiatives to reduce the use of low -value care ha d been uncommon (24) . 
This partnered evaluation gave  VHA the opportunity to reduce the use of a low -value service, thereby improving the health 
of Veterans, while also making several key scientific contributions. First, it provide d real- time insights into barriers and 
facilitators of a large -scale de -implementation effort from the perspective of Veterans, providers, and systems. The 
knowledge gained w as “fed back” to our partners in PBM to further enhance future efforts to de -prescribe in other clinical 
contexts (such as de-prescribing of anti -hypertensives and diabetes medications in older adults) (25). Notably, this w as 
among the largest de-prescribing initiatives ever conducted. Additionally, this is a topic of high priority for our partners at  
PBM, the VHA GI Program Office, and the Chief Research and Development Officer (CRADO). A second major contribution of the study was the ability to make generalizable conclusions about the risk -benefit ratio of PPI de -prescribing, as well as 
the true risk s posed by PPIs, by virtue of the study’s large (VHA -wide) scale, cluster -randomized design, and duration. Prior 
randomized trials of PPI deprescribing have been relatively small and short in duration, limiting their ability to detect serious but uncommon harms of de-prescribing, such as upper GI bleeding or increased healthcare utilization. Additionally, 
we planned to  rigorously assess the impact of reduced PPI use on selected adverse effects. Whether PPIs truly cause the 
harms with which they have been associated remains a major unresolved scientific question. Thus, the proposed work 
aligned well with VHA’s broader goal of becoming a Learning Health System  and leveraging electronic health record (EHR) 
data to conduct a n evaluation of the planned implementa tion of a high -priority national clinical program.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the United States. While these 
medications are highly effective for acid peptic disorders, o bservational studies suggest that they  can cause harm.  Prior 
studies have reported harms associated with PPI use, including vitamin B12 deficiency, hypomagnesemia, fractures, 
enteric infections (e.g., C. difficile colitis), pneumonia, and myocardial infarc tions (1,2) . More recent studies have 
reported additional associations with chronic kidney disease, dementia, stroke, and death (3,9– 11). 
Despite data on possible harms, PPIs are overused. Given the possible harms associated with PPIs, identification of 
patients unlikely to benefit from long- term d aily use is a top priority. The Choosing Wisely® Campaign stated that more 
than half of those who take PPIs may not need them, and that if gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms 
resolve after a few weeks, patients should stop their PPIs. Despite s uch recommendations, preliminary data suggest that 
>33% of Veterans who use PPIs do not have a clear indication or have well -controlled, uncomplicated GERD. Given that 
~15% of Veterans take PPIs chronically, large numbers  of Veterans may be incurring harm with little or no benefit.  
Efforts to de -p rescribe PPIs have shown efficacy but have failed to be widely adopted. The data on PPI overuse and 
harms  have generated interest in de-prescribing – “the process of withdrawal of an inappropriate medication, 
supervised by a healthcare professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes.”  (12) De-
prescription of PPIs has been evaluated in small trials of patients with GERD. For example, a prospective study conducted at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS)  in 2001 evaluated de -prescription in 71 patients with well -
controlled GERD. 58% of these 71 patients were successfully de -prescribed at 1 year, but most (73%) required H2 -
receptor antago nists (H2RAs) or prokinetics for control of symptoms. De-prescription did not reduce quality of life or 
worsen disease severity (13) . In another study of 117 VA patients with well -controlled GERD on twice -daily PPI, 80% 
were symptom -free 6 months after stepping -down to once -daily dosing (14) . Finally, in one VISN, a pharmacy -led 
program that leveraged clinical pharmacy specialist (CPS) providers, academic detailing, and patient education showed a  
Evaluation of the National Randomized Proton Pump Inhibitor De -Prescribing (RaPPID) Program    
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  4 reduction in PPI use in an uncontrolled analysis (33% relative reduction in PPI use compared to the average VISN, per 
PBM), and this reduction has been sustained over several years such that that VISN has the lowest PPI use nationally.  
Stopping PPIs in the wrong patients can cause harm. B y blocking the production of gastric acid, PPIs are highly effective 
at preventing and treating peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and its complications (e.g., upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and 
subsequent need for hospitalization, transfusion,  endoscopic therapy, surgery). As a corollary, stopping PPIs in patients 
who are at increased risk for PUD can promote upper GI bleeding, the most common cause of GI hospitalization in the United States. The widespread use of antiplatelet agents for cardio vascular prevention and the growing use of direct 
anticoagulants means that many Veterans are now at increased risk for upper GI bleeding. Moreover, bleeding is not the only potential unintended consequence of stopping PPIs. A 2017 Cochrane review of randomized trials of PPI de-prescription included 6 studies of de -prescription in patients with PPI-responsive GERD (15) . Those randomized to de-
prescription followed by on-demand therapy showed a 58% reduction in PPI pill use (3.79 vs 6.57 pills per week), but they also experienced an increase in poor symptom control (RR=1.71; 95% CI: 1.31 -2.21). These data suggest that any 
PPI de-prescribing program must: (1) ensure appropriate de-prescribing – that patients who are taking PPIs for GERD are 
offered a trial off PPI therapy while those who are at increased risk for GI bleeding are NOT inadvertently taken off their PPIs; and, (2) assess for potential unintended consequences including worsening in upper GI symptoms or quality of life 
(assessed through patient- reported outcomes (PROs)) and an increase in upper GI bleeding events. Further refinement 
and validation of an existing electronic algorithm to identify candidates for appropriate de-prescribing was a core 
deliverable from this study . 
Due to concern about PPI overuse and harms, PBM de
 ployed  a national program to appropriately de -prescribe PPIs in 
2019-2020. In light of the data on overuse and PPI harms, PBM deployed a national de-prescribing program in 2019 – 
the Ra ndomized PPI De-Prescribing (RaPPID) Program. RaPPID was  modeled after the su ccessful experience of a VISN 
program, with modifications to ensure that de-prescribing is appropriate and efficient (using the electronic algorithm 
developed by our team) and that randomization and deployment was feasible at the national level. Specifically, the 
program leveraged PBM infrastructure at multiple levels of the health system, including their national network of clinical 
pharmacy specialist (CPS) providers, an electronic dashboard system, PBM’s academic detailing capabilities, and patient 
educa tion. We worked closely with the  Director of Center for Medication Safety at PBM to coordinate the evaluation of 
RaPPID. PBM’s planned de -prescribing program offered a rare opportunity to study the effectiveness of PPI de-
prescribing and the barriers and f acilitators of a large -scale de -implementation effort.  
 
2.2.1  P RELIMINARY WORK   
PPIs are among the most commonly used medications in VHA. Working with PBM, we examined the prevalence of PPI use in Veterans as well as  associated costs. Based on these data, PPIs were used regularly (> 270 days per year) in 15.4% 
of Veterans. While the cost of these drugs wa s low on a per -pill basis, their widespread use incur red significant cost – 
approximately $50,000,000 per year in direct drug costs alone. At least one -third of Veterans using PPIs ha d no clear 
indication or ha d only uncomplicated GERD. Together, these Veterans (using PPI for no indication or for uncomplicated 
GERD without risk factors for upper GI bleeding) w ere the focus of RaPPID.  
PPIs have the potential to cau se long -term, debilitating harms. Multiple PD/PIs D rs. Yang and Laine have published 
multiple pivotal studies investigating the adverse effects of PPIs (16–20) . Although these epidemiological studies cannot 
definitively address whether these adverse effects are truly caused by PPIs, there are biologically plausible mechanisms linking these potent acid suppressants to a number of physiological changes that could mediate the reported adverse effects. Therefore, PPI therapy in patients without an appropriate indication is a low -value, potentially harmful practice 
that is not recommended.  
Evaluation of the National Randomized Proton Pump Inhibitor De -Prescribing (RaPPID) Program    
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  5 Most patients using PPIs are concerned about adverse effects. In 2017, co -investigator Jacob Kurlander surveyed 755 
patients using PPIs for GERD in an online survey sample (manuscript under review at JAMA -IM). Of these 755 patients, 
54% reported awareness of one or more PPI -related adverse effects, most commonly chronic kidney disease (17%), and 
78% reported at least some concern about PPI adverse effects. Only 24% reported that a physician had discussed PPI 
risks and benefits with them, and only 9% had been encouraged to stop by a physician. Independent predictors of a prior attempt to stop included: (1) physician recommendation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 1.82 -5.83); and (2) concern about PPI -related 
adverse effects (OR 12.0, 95% CI: 6.51-22.2). Notably, patients at high risk of upper GI bleeding, w ho require long -term 
PPIs for gastroprotection, were just as likely to have stopped their PPI as others (OR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.66-1.44). This study underscores the prevalence of public concern about PPI-related harms and the potential dangers of self -directed 
attempts at PPI discontinuation, which could be harmful in the wrong patients. 
Providers are also concerned about PPI -related adverse effects but inappropriately recommend withdrawing PPIs 
from high -risk patients.  We surveyed a representative sample of internists in the United States (N=487, response rate 
53%) to evaluate how physicians we re changing their PPI prescribing practices due to concern about adverse effects 
(21). Of the sample, 63% reported sometimes or often taking steps to reduce their patients’ exposure to PPIs by 
reducing the dose, switching to an H2RA, or stopping the PPI altogether. Providers were also asked to report how likely 
they would be to recommend PPI de-prescription in a patient with bone loss (a potential PPI adverse effect) in v ignettes 
of patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for upper GI bleeding. Surprisingly, providers were more likely  to stop PPI 
in the high -risk vignette (62%) than in the intermediate-risk vignette (47%) or the low -risk vignette (32%). These findings  
show the importance of having an algorithm that can identify patients who are at high risk for GI bleeding to guide 
appropriate de-prescribing of PPIs. 
An electronic algorithm can reliably identify candidates for PPI de -prescription in a pilot study. Dr. Yang, and co -
investigator, Brian Sauer, have previously used CDW data to identify candidates for PPI de -prescribing. For example, Drs. 
Yang and Sauer developed an electronic algorithm to identify Veterans who had been prescribed PPIs in 2012. They 
identifi ed ~3,000,000 Veterans who had at least one PPI prescription in the prior year, 33% of whom did not have an 
appropriate indication. In other work, Dr. Yang undertook pilot development and validation of an algorithm to identify 
appropriate candidates for PPI de-prescribing (i.e., chronic  PPI users with uncomplicated GERD or without clear 
indication – the target population for RaPPID) at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center. A CDW -based algorithm was 
developed to identify candidates for de -prescribing, and vali dation was performed through manual record review of 100 
patients randomly selected from over 9,000 PPI users. The sensitivity of the CDW algorithm for identifying appropriate 
de-prescribing candidates was 100% (95% CI: 90%-100%), and the specificity was 97% (95% CI: 89%-100%). While these results were impressive, they were obtained at a single center. Additional refinement and validation were performed 
during our planning period. Given the large number of Veterans using PPIs, it wa s imperative that the alg orithm used to 
identify de- prescribing candidates in RaPPID have high specificity to prevent alert fatigue and obsolescence among 
providers. 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
There were no physical risks from participation. The study’s chief risk is the psycho social/financial/ legal risk of potential 
loss of confidentiality. We stored electronic  files that contain personal identifiers. The investigative team used their  
considerable exp erience in maintaining the confidentiality of large datasets and adhered to all VHA established procedures 
in place to ensure data confidentiality.  
2.3.2  KNOW N POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
No direct benefits to the subjects themselves we re anticipated, as they were not b eing treated. However, this study’s 
findings directly enhanced all Veterans’ care by gaining insights about how to appropriately de-prescribe PPIs and how to

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  6 effectively undertake other such interventions to “unlearn” entrenched clinical practices in the f uture. Thus, the benefit 
to future VA patients wa s likely to be substantial.  
 
2.3.3  ASSE SSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Risk Minimization  
The risks to subjects we re minimal and were  addressed by following strict privacy and confidentiality procedures regarding 
how data are collected, stored, and used throughout the course of this project.  There were no physical risks to 
participation in this study. There was potential risk of psychol ogical, financial, or legal harm due to exposure of personally 
identifying information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). However, the risk of a breach of confidentiality wa s 
low. Throughout the study, VHA, IRB, and HIPAA guidelines w ere followed to ensure the privacy and integrity of the 
information collected . Any breach would have been  immediately reported to the PD/PIs and the appropriate IRBs. To 
minimize the risk of a breach of confidentiality, we perform ed the following steps. First, as soon  as the cohort was defined 
by the data manager, each patient in the cohort w as assigned a unique study ID  unrelated to any identifying information . 
We then create d a limited access  electronic tracking file that map ped the study participant’s identifying information to 
the study ID.  
 
Importance of Knowledge to be Gained  
VHA has long been a leader in measuring and delivering high -quality care. In recent years, however, it has become 
increasingly apparent that efforts to promote quality have inadvertently led to the use of not only high-value, but also low-value care. To date, however, large -scale, programmatic initiatives to reduce the use of low -value care have been 
uncommon. This partnered evaluation gave VHA the opportunity to simultaneous ly address the use of a low -value clinical 
service and to understand multi -level barriers to de -implementation of a commonly prescribed medication. Additionally, 
by randomizing the program, VHA ensured  that efforts to de -prescribe PPIs d o not  cause unintended harms (such as upper 
GI bleeding) and assess the effect of reduced PPI use on selected adverse effects (such as enteric infections, fractures, pneumonia, and hypomagnesemia). Notably, this was the largest de -prescribing initiative ever conducted. Studying its 
effects in real time yielded  valuable generalizable knowledge about how systems can effectively de-implement low -value 
care. Moreover, the randomized evaluation yielded clinical knowledge about the balance of benefit and harm for PPIs , 
knowledge th at was unlikely to be acquired in any other evaluation. 
 
3 PRIMAR Y OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS  
Primary  
Proportion of days PPIs are 
prescribed at or above the 
baseline daily dosing-frequency, over the 12 months following the index 
visit. 
 We hypothesize (H1) that the 
proportion of days will be lower 
in intervention group than in the control group (i.e., that the outcome will be superior in the 
intervention vs control group). 
This outcome is analogous to th e 
medication possession ratio.  This is the appropriate measure of 
success of de -prescribing because it 
captures a variety of results in a single endpoint, including discontinuation without resumption, discontinuation with 
intermittent or on -demand use, and  
resumption of daily PPI at or above 
baseline dosing frequency.

  7 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
Study Design:  We evaluated RaPPID in the context of a nationwide, stratified cluster -randomized controlled trial that 
incorporate d assessments of both effectiveness and implementation (hybrid type II) (28). RaPPID was a multi -level de-
prescribing program modeled after a similar ini tiative developed and deployed in one VISN in 2015. After validating and 
testing the deprescribing algorithm and dashboard, developing educational materials and randomization  (months 1 -11), 
the program w as deployed nationally in a cluster -randomized fashion (months 12-24 ). During the randomization and 
subsequent follow -up period (months 24 -36), we assessed the program’s impact on a variety of clinical outcomes.  
 Study Population and Sample:  De- prescribing of PPIs has potential clinical and economic benefits (by reducing 
unnecessary daily use of a medication with possible long-term harms). However, de-prescribing may also be harmful due to worsening upper GI symptoms and increased risk of upper  GI bleeding. To maximize potential benefit and minimize 
potential harm, RaPPID focu sed on “chronic PPI users” (defined as daily PPI for ≥ 90 days during the 120 -day period prior 
to PCP visit) with uncomplicated GERD, OR with no clear indication for PPI. T hose who ha d acceptable indications for 
chronic PPI therapy (e.g., NSAID use, anti -thrombotic use, PUD, Barrett’s esophagus, erosive esophagitis, eosinophilic 
esophagitis) w ere excluded. Identification of candidates for appropriate de -prescription was facilitated by a high-
specificity electronic algorithm, as discussed in Section 2.2, Background.  
4.1.1  P
ROCEDURES 
Overview of RaPPID:  RaPPID was a multi -level program modeled after a successful de-prescribing initiative in one VISN. 
The program h ad 3 main components: (1) activation of VISN Pharmacy Executives (VPEs) and their subsequent activation 
of Clinical Pharmacy Specialist ( CPS) providers a t VA Healthcare System s within their VISNs; (2) provider education with 
targeted academic detailing and notifications; and, (3) patient education. CPS providers are pharmacists with training and 
expertise in medication stewardship, quality improvement, and medication -use evaluation. Many CPS providers have a 
broad scope of practice that allows them to prescribe and de -prescribe medications, deliver provider and patient 
education, and provide professional -to-professional academic detailing, and they often wo rk with other clinical providers 
and patients to improve appropriate medication use (29). PBM has successfully used CPS providers in several national medication safety initiatives. In RaPPID, PBM leveraged this national network of experienced CPS providers  to undertake  
this initiative  focused on safely de-prescribing PPIs. Specifically, PBM asked VPEs  randomized to the intervention to 
identify local CPS provider s to champion the program  at their respective facilities . CPS providers were  then be “activated” 
with a variety of standardized tools (see below). It is important to note that while PBM ha d extensive experience in 
conducting medication evaluations , RaPPID w as novel in several ways: (1) it was  randomized – PBM ha d experience 
conducting randomization in  the context of research studies using similar tools , (2) it involved one of the most commonly 
prescribed medications in VHA – prior  evaluations had  been significantly smaller in scale; and, (3) it involve d appropriate 
de-prescribing – prior de -prescribing efforts had focused on acute medication safety issues, where de -prescribing 
recommendations were less nuanced and less apt to cause harm (such as upper GI bleeding due to inappropriate de-
prescribing of PPIs).  
Activation of CPS Providers:  CPS providers were “activated” with a variety of standardized tools, including: (1) the PPI 
Dashboard ; (2) educational materials to help CPS providers promote RaPPID to PCPs and clinical staff at their facilities; 
and, (3) educational materials for patients who were de-prescribed, to provide guidance and support for managing 
bothersome symptoms in the period immediately after de- prescribing. The PPI Dashboard  serve d several important 
purposes. It allow ed the CPS providers to efficiently identify PPI de -prescribing candidates up to 4 weeks ahead of a 
scheduled primary care visit. It also allow ed CPS providers to track patients who h ad been de-prescribed and monitor 
adoption of de-prescribing by individual providers. Data on adoption allow ed the CPS providers  to deliver academic 
Evaluation of the National Randomized Proton Pump Inhibitor De -Prescribing (RaPPID) Program    
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  8 detailing (using local and regional academic detailing resources managed by PBM) to providers who appear ed to be slow 
to adopt de-prescribing recommendations. 
 
RaPPID De -Prescribing Regimen: The RaPPID de-prescribing regimen varied  according to whether the Veteran wa s 
receiving once -daily or twice -daily PPI therapy. For patients on twice-daily PPI, the dosing frequency w as reduced to once-
daily and maintained at that dose (i.e., 50% dose reduction). For patients on once-daily PPI, t he dose w as to first be tapered 
to once -daily PPI every other day for 2 weeks, followed by discontinuation. All patients w ere to  be prescribed H2RAs to 
be taken as needed for intermittent upper GI symptoms. Written educational information regarding de- pres cription was 
to be provided to patients by the primary care team. The recommended de-prescribing regimen and appropriate management of recurrent symptoms w as a key component of provider and patient education and (as needed) academic 
detailing.  
Deployment of RaPPID:  CPS providers used a variety of methods to initiate contact with PCPs at healthcare systems within 
VISNs randomized to RaPPID, including direct contact at primary care staff meetings and electronic contact via email. PCPs 
were  to be educated and  trained on: (1) the scientific justification for RaPPID; (2) VHA’s national commitment to the 
program; (3) the protocol for de -prescribing; and, (4) resources for Veterans who are de- prescribed (educational materials, 
consultation with CPS providers). CPS  providers adapt ed (as needed)  standardized educational materials to their local sites 
and worked with primary care leadership at their sites to devise efficient methods for disseminating these materials (e.g., 
during team meetings). Additionally, the VHA National Program Office for Gastroenterology notified VHA GI Section Chiefs 
and providers of the effort as part of national field calls and email listserv updates. Once RaPPID wa s deployed, CPS 
providers used the Dashboard to identify and track candidates for de -prescribing and notif ied PCPs of candidates using 
locally adapted approaches (e.g., note in CPRS, email).  
4.1.2  P
ROVIDER EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL EXCERPT  
The text and table below were part of the educational materials for Pharmacy and Primary Care providers.  
It is recommended that patients meeting inclusion -exclusion criteria should be deprescribed using one of the methods 
below. Some patients with GERD  are expected to have recurrence of frequent bothersome symptoms intermittently 
in the coming months or years. Studies have suggest ed such patients can be well -managed by intermittent courses of 
once -daily PPI for up to 4 weeks. On -demand PPI therapy (in which  the patient takes PPIs as they determine is needed 
based on symptoms and response) is also shown to be well accepted by patients with GERD. Only a minority of GERD 
patients should  require daily maintenance PPI therapy to provide acceptable symptom relief.   
Patients Taking PPIs  
Once Daily  Twice Daily  
 Taper to every other day for 2 weeks and then 
discontinue  
 Prescribe H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., 
famotidine, ranitidine) to take as needed for 
intermittent recurrent symptoms   Taper to once daily PPI, taken 30 -60 minutes 
before a meal 
Patients should be cautioned that they may have rebound symptoms for a few weeks after discontinuation.

  9 4.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA), accounting for over 11 million 30 -day prescriptions and nearly $50 million in medication costs 
annually. Though effective for trea tment of acid -related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), PPIs 
have been associated with possible harms in observational studies (e.g., enteric infections such as Clostridium difficile 
colitis, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, fract ures, dementia) (1,2), and a 2017 VA study reported increased mortality 
in Veterans receiving PPIs (3). Unfortunately, PPIs continue to be used without an appropriate indication or for longer and 
at higher doses than necessary (4,5).   Accordingly, in  2019, VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (PBM) deployed 
the Randomized PPI De -Prescribing (RaPPID) Program – a national, multi -level PPI de- prescribing initiative targeting 
patients for whom chronic PPI therapy may not be necessary. This program, modeled  after a successful initiative in one 
VISN, was comprised of  3 key components: (1) activation of clinical pharmacy specialists; (2) provider education and 
targeted notifications and academic detailing; and  (3) patient education.  
 RaPPID was among the largest concerted efforts at de -prescribing ever undertaken in VHA. Prospective evaluation of the 
program therefore present ed a unique opportunity not only to enhance the program itself, but also to gain insights into 
how to reduce the use of low -value services  more broadly, a key VHA priority for the coming decade. Indeed, estimates 
suggest that 10% of all healthcare spending in the U.S. pays for unnecessary care (6). But reducing the use of low -value 
care is challenging for many reasons. Programs to reduce low -value care often employ multiple interacting components, 
deployed in active healthcare delivery contexts, and they require patients, providers, and systems to “unlearn” well-
established behaviors and expectations about healthcare delivery (7,8). These cha llenges are compounded when efforts 
are scaled to the level of an entire health system.

Not applicable for RCT as all subjects electronically enrolled w ere analyzed. 
For patient reported outcomes, we expect ed some missing data. Our initial analyses only used observed data, but for 
missing data for items within scales, we used recommended imputation strategies. For missing 3 -month  survey  
assessments, we used  logistic regression with missing follow -up as a dependent variable to see if missingness is associated 
with baseline variables, including facility-level variables. We included baseline variables found to be predictive of 
missingness in the longitudinal data model, and if missingness was at random, longitudinal mixed -effects provide d an 
unbiased estimate of the study group effect. I f the extent of missingness is more than 20% , we conducted  a secondary 
analysis by combining results based on multiply imputed data using sequential regression multivariate imputation method,

7.2.2  ST UDY ASSESSMENTS - VETERAN SURVEYS  
One potential unintended consequence of PPI de-prescription is worsening upper GI symptoms. Worsening symptoms can 
substantially affect quality of life and promote use of medications and healthcare resources. Importantly, these medications and healthcare resources need not be sought within VA. For example, medications to alleviate heartburn may be obtained over-the -counter (OTC) or from a non -VA provider. Therefore, we used  surveys to assess and track outcomes 
that could not be measured electronically, including upper GI symptoms, quality of life, and use of non -VA healthcare 
resources. We develop ed two surveys with distinct elements: (1) a pre -visit survey, to be completed 1 -2 weeks prior to 
the index primary care visit; and (2) a post -visit survey, to be c ompleted 3 months  after the index primary care visit.  
Surveys were administered to subjects in the VISN with the most Dashboard activity (a high participation VISN) and a comparable control VISN.  
 
Pre-Visit /Baseline  Survey  
The pre-visit survey include d several established scales and individual survey items. Upper GI symptoms w ere assessed 
using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), a validated PRO scale. Quality of life w as assessed using the Short Form-12 
(SF-12). We also include d single items to ass ess baseline trust in PCP, concern about PPI -related harms, and receptiveness 
to de -prescribing of PPIs, all taken from an existing survey instrument.  
 
Post -Visit Survey  
For the 3 -month follow -up survey, we again assessed symptoms and quality of life using  the RDQ and SF-12, respectively. 
As a measure of “reach” for our process evaluation, we develop ed a single item to assess whether the patient recalls a 
discussion with the PCP about PPI de-prescription. Furthermore, w e developed items to assess use of non -VA medications 
for symptom control (PPIs, H2RAs, antacids) and the use of non -VA healthcare. We also ask ed Veterans to report the 
source of payment for these services (e.g., out of pocket, private insurance) .

  13 8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
We hypothesized  that RaPPID will reduce the use of PPIs without a clinically meaningful increase in upper GI symptoms 
or upper GI complications such as bleeding.  
Primary outcome measure: The  primary outcome  was the  proportion of days PPIs are prescribed at or above the 
baseline daily dosing-frequency, over the 12 months following the index visit. We hypothesize d (H1) that the proportion 
of days would be lower in intervention group than in the control group (i.e., th at the outcome w ould  be superior  in the 
intervention vs control group). This outcome is analogous to the medication possession ratio. This  was the appropriate 
measure of success of de- prescribing because it capture d a variety of results in a single endpoint, including 
discontinuation without resumption, discontinuation with intermittent or on -demand use, and resumption of daily PPI 
at or above b aseline dosing frequency. Secondary outcome measures: We also measured a variety of secondary 
outcomes to assess unintended, adverse events related to PPI de- prescribing. We hypothesize that utilization of 
outpatient care (H2) and the patient reported outcome (PRO) of upper GI symptoms (H3) will be non -inferior in the 
intervention vs control group.  
Utilization of outpatient and inpatient care: Usi ng CDW data, we assessed utilization of outpatient care – clinic visits or 
emergency department visits (using stop codes) for predefined upper GI symptoms/diagnoses (based on ICD -10 codes) 
or upper endoscopies (based on CPT codes). We also assessed use of inpatient care (i.e., hospital admissions) for 
predefined upper GI symptoms/diagnoses (based on ICD -10 codes).  
Upper GI symptoms and quality of life:  W e assessed upper GI symptoms using the RDQ, a validated PRO instrument 
(30,31) . We also measured generic quality of life using the SF -12 (32) . 
Serious GI complications:  We a ssessed upper GI complications (bleeding, perforation, obstruction) using ICD -10 codes.  
PPI-related harms: To ensure that we captured all relevant harms, we reviewed published observational studies of PPI 
harms to identify relevant diagnoses and ICD -9/10 codes.  
Covariates:  Co variates include d demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), Charlson comorbidity index, indication for PPI 
use (uncomplicated GERD vs no indication), and baseline PPI dosing frequency (o nce-daily vs twice -daily). We also 
collected covariates on a subset of patients (1 intervention VISN and 1 control VISN), using our survey questionnaires, 
including baseline RDQ symptom score, trust in provider, baseline concern about PPI harms, and recept iveness to de -
prescribing of PPIs. 
8.1 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
8.1.1  PRIMARY OUTCOME  
Assuming approximately the same number of eligible subjects in each VISN (with an average of 10,563 candidates per VISN) and an ICC of 0.12, randomizing 17 VISNs will give more than 80% power to detect % days on PPI of 75% vs. 50%, 
85% vs. 60%, 80% vs. 55%, or 70% vs. 45%, but to detect a difference between 70% vs. 50%, power is only 61% using 0.05 
level 2 -sided test.
  
8.1.2  VETERAN SURVEYS  
Recruitment numbers were based on a power calculation in which patient -reported symptoms, as measured by the Reflux 
Disease Questionnaire, we re treated as a continuous variable rather. Based on previous research, we assumed an  RDQ 
score Standard Deviation (SD)=1.3 for GERD patients for this calc ulation. To detect the between-group difference of 0.71 
vs. 1.13, assuming SD=1.3 with 90% power and alpha=0.01, we need 287 surveys completed per group (574 in total) at 3 
months and 820 in total surveys returned at baseline to account for 30% dropout by month 3. We e stimated a 50% 
response rate for the baseline survey  and a 70% response rate for the follow-up survey. we mailed 1,722 baseline surveys 
and approximately 8 50 follow -up (3 month) surveys.

8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
Analyses proceeded  in 3 phases. In the 1st phase, we examined the distribution of all study variables to assess extreme 
values, missing data, variances, possible coding errors, skewness, and type of distribution. In the 2nd phase, we evaluate d 
bivariate associations between study arm and outcomes, as well as between  each covariate and outcomes, using 
generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering. This w as done to determine 
unadjusted measures of effect, assess possible confounders, and anticipate any collinearity in subsequ ent analyses. In the 
final phase, we fit multivariable models to identify the effects of the intervention.  
 Primary outcome (H1): To assess the primary outcome (proportion of days PPIs are prescribed), we used an intent -to-treat 
analysis with a mixed -effec ts model, with proportion of PPI days over 12 months as the dependent variable. The primary 
independent variable w as study arm. Because randomization  was done at the VISN (regional) level, we anticipate d that 
patients seen at the same facility will show a positive intraclass correlation (ICC). The mixed -effects model account ed for 
such clustering by including VISNs  as random intercepts. It  also control led for VISN  strata variables used in randomization. 
We did not account for patient dropout since all data collection is done electronically and does not require further patient 
participation.  
 To assess secondary outcomes (utilization of outpatient care and upper GI symptoms patient reported outcomes ), we 
used generalized linear mixed -effects models with logit link (hierarchical logistic regression) to account for VISN-level 
clustering and randomization strata. The primary independent variable w as study arm. For each outcome, an odds ratio 
(OR) for adverse events in the intervention group relative to the control group w as obtained from each logistic regression 
model, where a significant OR less than 1.0 will favor the intervention group. For analyses of the  patient reported 
outcomes,  the outcome of interest was  the RDQ score  assessed at 3 months. For both outcomes, non -inferiority was 
assessed by comparing the effect estimate and its 90% CI with a non -inferiority margin.

  17 9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
Final report update: no SAEs were reported throughout the duration of the study.   
 Because this was a minimal risk study with the intervention being implemented as part of VHA clinical operations and 
involving only use of paper and telephone surveys and t elephone interviews about PPI de-prescribing experiences, we d id 
not anticipate any serious adverse events (SAEs). Serious adverse events to be monitored include d the following: 1) a 
breach of a participant’s confidentiality or privacy that involve d potential risk to that participant or others, 2) deviations 
from VA IRB regulations and policies, and 3) unanticipated problems  (UAPs) that involved social or economic harm instead 
of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. SAEs w ere prospectively tracked according to the 
following plan: reports of SAEs and protocol deviations w ere made by the study team member who discover ed the event, 
the site PI, or site project manager (if applicable) to the primary site (Ann Arbor) project manager. The primary site project 
manager and PI would  report the event to the Ann Arbor VA IRB (Primary Site IRB). Any SAEs and UAPs meeting the 
definition of serious would  be reported within 5 business days of discovery to the Ann Arbor VA IRB. AEs and UAPs that  
did not meet the definition of serious we re to be reported to Ann Arbor project manager as they we re discovered, and 
would  be reported to the Ann Arbor VA IRB in summary at the time of continuing review/project closure. Protocol 
deviations/violations that  were likely to substantially adversely affect 1) the rights, safety, or welfare of a participant; 2) a 
participant’s willingness to continue participation; or 3) the integrity of the research data, including VA information security requirements will all be reported within 5 working days of being made aware of the occurrence.  
9.3 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
 
This study will comply with all Department of Veterans Affairs regulations and policies.   
9.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
 
Final report update: no conflicts were reported throughout the duration of the study.  
 The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence was  critical . Therefore, any actual conflict of 
interest of persons who ha d a role in the design, c onduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial  was disclosed 
and managed . Furthermore, persons who ha d a perceived conflict of interest was  required to have such conflicts managed 
in a way that was  appropriate to their participation in the des ign and conduct of this trial. The study leadership in 
conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs  has established policies and procedures for all study group members 
to disclose all conflicts of interest and an  established mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.

 2 INTRODUCTION  46 
Stiffness after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) occurs when patients have difficulty flexing and 47 
extending their knee for routine activities of daily living. Patients require 67 degrees of knee 48 
flexion during the swing phase of gait, 83 degrees to ascend stairs, 90 degrees to descend stairs 49 
and 93 degrees to rise from a standard chair.1 When l ess than 90 degrees of motion is reached 50 
after TKA, the quality of life for patients is substantially decreased since simple activities like 51 
walking can become difficult.2 3 52 
 53 
Despite advancements in surgical technique, implant design and pain management, arthrofibrosis 54 
(i.e., malignant stiffness) remains one of the top five reasons for revision TKA. At the upcom ing 55 
2016 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meetin g, Matthew P. Abdel, M.D., 56 
and colleagues will present their data indicating a contemporary arthrofibrosis rate of 5.8 percent 57 
after primary TKA at Mayo Clinic. In addition, 2.8 percent of patients require a manipulation 58 
under anesthesia (MUA). While there a re alternatives to MUA , physical therapy shows only 59 
modest gains and surgery is reserved for patients that fail non -operative management . With 60 
MUA, mean flexion improved 35  degrees .  However, 5 percent of patients failed to maintain at 61 
least 90 degrees of flexion after the MUA  at our institution . More concerning, these results were  62 
similar to the previous decade, where the rate of arthrofibrosis was 5.4 percent, with 2.9 percent 63 
requiring MUA. The only identifiable risk factor for MUA was previous knee oper ation.  Lastly , 64 
a manipulation under anesthesia significantly increased the risk for revision.   As one can see, the 65 
incidence of arthrofibrosis following primary TKA has remained unchanged over the past two 66 
decades. With the exponential increase in primary  TKAs, arthrofibrosis is a large burden to the 67 
patient, surgeon and entire U.S. health care system ($8.75 billion annually).  68

Preliminary clinical and translational research has indicated that an inflammatory disorder of the 70 
musculoskeletal system may be responsible for post -operati ve stiffness in some patients.4-8 71 
Although evidence remains limited to animal models , the inflammatory cascade plays a central 72 
role in the formation, and recurrence, of arthrofibrosis, particularly at the time of insult (i.e. time 73 
of index arthroplasty and/or MUA).7,9,10 This is essential as some in surance companies have 74 
stopped covering this procedure.  The purpose of this study was to  determine the efficacy of 75 
manipulation under anesthesia (MUA), with and without perioperative oral celecoxib and 76 
intravenous ( IV) corticosteroid.  77 
 78 
PATIENTS  AND METHODS  79 
Study Design  80 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical  trial (RCT)  designed to evaluate the 81 
use of anti -inflammatory medications for the management of arthrofibrosis following primary 82 
TKA . Patients w ill be  randomly assigned to e ither the control or experimental group. Both groups 83 
will receive a m anipulation under anesthesia  (MU A) if  flexion is < 90 degrees  at 4 –12 weeks 84 
postoperatively.  Manipulation under anesthesia is the international standard of care for early 85 
arthrofibrosis.  The control group will not r eceive any IV corticosteroids or  PO non -steroidal anti - 86 
inflammatory medications (NSAIDs).  The experimental group will receive  a single dose of IV 87 
corticosteroids (8 mg IV dexametha sone immediately prior to MUA)  and 2 weeks of PO celecoxib 88 
at a dos e of 200 mg daily .  Many surgeons, including several at the Mayo Clinic, consider the use 89 
of IV corticosteroids and PO celecoxib the standard of care with a MUA.   90 
 91

 4 Patients  92 
Patients w ill be  recruited from sixteen  high-volume , academic, tertiary -care referral centers  93 
(Table 1).  All enrolling centers have been vetted, as only surgeons that are members of the 94 
prestigious closed Knee Society (representing the top 100 knee surgeons in the world) are 95 
participating.  P atients approached for enrollment will have received a primary unila teral TKA  96 
for a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. All primary TKA constructs will have constraint that is less than 97 
that of varus -valgus constraint (VVC).  All VVC and hinged TKAs will be excluded.  Only 98 
MUAs scheduled between 4 –12weeks postoperatively wil l be included .   99 
 100 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained from all respective institutions prior 101 
to initiation of the study .  The Mayo Clinic will serve as the coordinating site.  Patients will be 102 
excluded from the study if any of the fol lowing exist:  (1) intolerance  to NSAIDs , (2) renal 103 
dysfunction, (3) age < 18 or > 90 years ,  (4) primary di agnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and (5) 104 
patients with GFR <60 as the cut off for CKD (stag e 3 CKD).  Use of non -steroidal anti - 105 
inflammatory medicati ons during the first two weeks after manipulation under anesthesia will 106 
exclude patients from participation in this study. However, celecoxib (a non -steroidal anti - 107 
inflamatory medication) will be provided  for those patients randomized to the experimental 108 
group, once daily for fourteen days following the manipulation under anesthesia. Aspirin, used 109 
routinely for DVT prophylaxis post -operatively, did not restrict patients from participation in this 110 
study. Patients who are on NSAIDs prior to MUA, is ok to enroll. Patient demograp hics were 111 
noted, including age at index arthroplasty, s ex, body mass index ( BMI ), ASA score, and 112 
Charlson Index . 113 
 114 
 June 8, 2018   Version  6 
 5 Randomization  115 
Patients w ill be  randomized into one of 2 groups: (1) MUA only  (i.e. control group)  or (2) MUA 116 
plus 8 mg of IV dexamethasone immediately before MUA , followed by 2 weeks of PO celecoxib 117 
(200 mg daily)  (experimental group) . Assignment of patients into either group will be made  prior 118 
to the initiation of enrollment for the study. Patients will be randomized using a computer 119 
generated (SAS PROC) block randomization schedule to ensure equivalent numbers of patients 120 
in each group over the course of the study in case early stopping is required. The randomization 121 
schedule will be generated by the Mayo Clinic Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics  122 
with the randomization list provided to the investigators prior to initiation o f patient recruitment. 123 
Neither the patient nor the trea ting physician were  blinded the randomization group.   124 
 125 
Manipulation Under Anesthesia  126 
Patients will undergo MUA per their instit utional protocol.  As previously noted, t hese will be 127 
completed between 4 and 10 weeks postoperatively for flexion < 90 degrees.   Patients will 128 
receive sedation per their institutional protocol .  Physical therapy (either supervised or 129 
unsupervised) will be prescribed 2 -3 times per week for 4 – 6 weeks thereafter.   130 
 131 
Outcome Measures  132 
The primary outcome measure will be knee range of motion , including both passive and active 133 
flexion and extension 6 weeks after the manipulation and 1 year from the date of the TKA . 134 
Secondary outcomes will include comparison of Knee Society Scores  (KSS) , 12-item Short 135 
Form Survey (SF -12v2), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the 136 
Promise -29 ou tcome form  (Appendices 1 -4). Outcomes  will be documented pre-MUA, 6 weeks 137 
 June 8, 2018   Version  6 
 6 after the MUA, and 1 year after the TKA. A standardize evaluation form w ill be shared amongst 138 
all participating sites , and will be used consistently  for all patients  (Appendix 1 -4). 139 
 140 
Power Analysis  141 
The mean and standard deviation for sample size calculation were derived from a study by 142 
Yercan  et al. In that study, the authors found that the mean ROM following MUA was 114° ± 143 
16°.11  We hypothesized that a 10° difference in total range of motion would constitute a 144 
clinically significant difference. With a type I error rate of 5%, 108 total patients (54 per arm) are 145 
required to have 90% power to detect this difference. Accounting for a dropout  rate of 20%, 65 146 
patients per arm (130 total patients) will be recruited.  147 
 148 
Statistical Analysis  149 
All data will be summarized and reported d escriptively using appropriate summary statistics, 150 
including mean and standard deviation  (SD)  for continuous variables, and count and percentage 151 
for categorical variables.  The analysis was focused  on the two primary study outcomes: range of 152 
motion (total arc of motion as well as angle of terminal knee flexion, measured in degrees), and 153 
subjective outcome ( KSS, SF-12v2, KOOS, and PROMIS ).  Outcomes were  compared between 154 
the two study groups using two -sample t -tests if the data are approximately normally dis tributed; 155 
if the data are not sufficiently normally distributed, non -parametric  Wilcoxon rank sum tests was  156 
used.  Since the subjects were  assigned to the study groups in a randomized manner, no 157 
significant differences between the subjects in the two group s were expected .  However, 158 
apparent differences in subject demographics or baseline clinical data were evaluated , and 159 
further analysis w as undertaken using multivariable modeling to compare the two groups while 160 
 June 8, 2018   Version  6 
 7 adjusting fo r other important variables.  Whe n necessary and a ppropriate, the analysis was  161 
adjusted for enrolling cente r.  Categorical outcomes were  analyzed using chi -square tests and 162 
logistic regres sion.  Separate analyses were  performed for the 6 -week and 1 -year outcome s. All 163 
statistical tests wer e two-sided and p -values less than 0.05 will be considered significant.  164

Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   1 INTRODUCTION  
This statistical a nalysis p lan (SAP) is based on P rotocol Amendment 5 and is to define key 
elements including variable definition s, and statistical methods  for analysis of data in evaluation  
of efficacy and safety of the study  PCYC -1137- CA. Analyses of biomarker and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) data will be addressed in separate document s. Throughout  this SAP, 
“study treatment” and “study drug” are used interchangeably , both referred to as 
ibrutinib /placebo, nab- paclitaxel, and/or gemcitabine  
Analysis methods specified in this document take precedence over those described in protocol 
should there be any difference. This SAP will be finalized before unblinding.  
1.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -blind placebo- controlled, Phase  3 study comparing 
ibrutinib in combination with nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus placebo in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel and  gemcitabine in the first- line treatment of subjec ts with metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinom a.  
Safety Run -in Phase:  
Six subjects will initially be recruited to receive open -label ibrutinib in combination with nab-
paclitaxel and gemcitabine.  The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review 
data on the safety of ibrutinib  combined with nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine after the first 
6 subjects have completed at least 28  days of follow -up after the initiation of combination 
therapy . Following DMC review and confirmation, the study may proceed to t he Double -blind 
Randomized Phase. 
Double -blind Randomized Phase : 
The second phase of the study  will be a randomized, double -blind comparison of ibrutinib in 
combination with nab- paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus  placebo in combination with nab-
paclitaxel and gemcitabine . 
Approximately 420 subjects  will be randomized between Arm  A (ibrutinib in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine) and Arm  B (placebo in combination with nab- paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine).  All subjects in Arm A and Arm  B are to receive nab -paclitaxel  (intravenous [ IV]) 
125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine ( IV) 1000 mg/m2 given on D ays 1, 8, and  15 of each 28- day cycle  
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Unless otherwise  indicated,  all subjects in 
Arm A and Arm  B per  randomization are to receive oral i brutinib 560 mg or match ing placebo 
given  orally once daily continuously starting on Cycle  1 Day  1 until dise ase progression or 
unacceptable toxicity . If nab-paclitaxel  and/or gemcitabine or ibrutinib/placebo are discontinued 
 PCYC -1137- CA 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Page 8 of 22  
 
Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   prior to disease progression, the remaining agents will be continued until unacceptable toxicity  or 
disease progression . 
1.2 Endpoints  
1.2.1 Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoints are progression- free survival (PFS), as assessed by the investigator -based 
on RECIST 1.1 and overall survival (OS) . 
1.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
• Overall response rate (ORR) :  complete response (CR)  + partial response (PR) per 
investigator assessment  
• Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19- 9 (CA19- 9) response : proportion of subjects with a decline of 
≥ 60% from baseline  
• Patient -reported outcome (PRO) by EORTC QLQ -C30: time until definitive deterioration 
(TUDD1) for global  health status/ quality -of-life ( QoL) scale.  
• Rate of venous thromboembolic events (VTE)   
• Clinical benefit response (CBR) rate  
1.2.3 Safety Assessments 
• Safety  and tolerability of the study treatment ( ibrutinib/placebo, nab- paclitaxel, and/or 
gemcitabine)  
1.2.4 Exploratory Endpoints  
Exploratory endpoints to be included in the CSR are,  
• CA19 -9 response rat e for a ≥  20% reduction and a ≥  90% reduction  
• Disease control rate (DCR)  
• Time to diminished pain (TDP)  
• OS for the survival maintenance subgroup, and  
• EORTC QLQ -C30 Global Health Status/QoL scale: time until definitive deterioration  
(TUDD2)  (see Table 3 for endpoint definition) .  
In addition, baseline serum cytokine  and C -reactive protein ( CRP ) biomarkers compared to  PFS 
and OS w ill be explored .  
 PCYC -1137- CA

Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   1.3 Statistical Hypotheses  
The statistical hypotheses for each of the primary endpoints (PFS or OS) can be written as 
follows:  
H0:  SI(t) = SC(t), for all t  > 0, where SI(t), and SC(t) are survival functions for the experimental 
and control arms, respectively at all time points t :  
vs. 
H1: SI(t) ≠ SC(t), for some t  > 0  
These hypotheses will be tested for the primary endpoints using a 2 -sided stratified log -rank test  
at an α level specified in Section  1.6. The source of the stratification factors will be based on 
Interactive Web Response System  (IWRS ) data.  
1.4  Sample Size Determination  
The sample size calculation is based on a 2 -sided family -wise Type I error rate (aka. family -wise 
error rate, FWER) of 0.05 for 2 primary endpoints, PFS and OS. The FWER is controlled 
at 0.05, with  0.007 allocated to the PFS endpoint and 0.043 allocated to the OS endpoint. 
In this protocol amendment, a total of 424 subjects have been randomized with a 1:1 allocation to the 2 treatment arms. The calculations are based on the following assumptions using EAST 
software Version  6.3.1 and the actual enrollment rates.  
For PFS:  
• Median PFS is 5.5 months for the control arm (nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine) ( Von Hoff 
2013).  
• Target hazard ratio is  0.66 which corresponds to a 51% improvement in median PFS ( eg, 
from 5.5 months to 8.33 months) for the ibrutinib +  nab-paclitaxel  + gemcitabine arm 
compared to the placebo + nab-paclitaxel  + gemcitabine arm  
• 2-sided α  = 0.007  
• A total of 350 PFS events will provide approximately 88% power.  
For OS:  
• Median OS is 8.5 months for the control arm (nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine) ( Von Hoff 
2013).  
• Target hazard ratio is  0.735 which corresponds to approximately 36% improvement in 
median OS ( e.g., from 8.5 months to 11.6 months) for the ibrutinib +  nab-
paclitaxel  + gemcitabine arm compared to the placebo  + nab-paclitaxel  + gemcitabine arm  
 PCYC -1137- CA 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Page 10 of 22  
 
Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   • 2-sided α  = 0.043  
• A group sequential design with 1 interim analysis is planned when at least 250 deaths occur 
(approximately 71% of the deaths occur). The Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with 
O’Brien -Fleming boundary for efficacy will be  used. 
• A total of 353 OS events will provide approximately 80% power for the study.  
1.5 Planned Analysis  
1.5.1 Final Analysis  PFS and OS Interim Analysis  
The OS interim analysis strategy has been changed from P rotocol Section 10.4.1.  Conditions for 
conducting the OS interim analysis are described below.  
At the time of the planned final PFS analysis  (i.e., at least 350  PFS events  as specified in the 
protocol) , if the total number of OS events is ≥  333 (i.e., ≥  94% of the OS information fraction) 
the PFS final analys is will be delayed until approximately 350 OS events have been reached. On 
the other hand, if the total number of the OS events is <  333 at the time of the final PFS analysis, 
the PFS final analysis will take place, and t he OS interim analysis will only be conducted when 
the PFS endpoint is statistically significant. A Heybittle -Peto boundary with a 2- sided 
significance level of  0.0001 will be used for the OS interim analysis . Otherwise, a final OS 
analysis will be performed at approximately 350 events if t he PFS endpoint is not statistically 
significant.   
Secondary endpoints will be tested following a prespecified hierarchical order. If both PFS and 
OS endpoints  are statistically s ignificant , the secondary endpoints will be tested using a 2 -sided 
alpha of  0.05. However, if only the OS endpoint  (or PFS endpoint) is statistically significant , the 
secondary endpoints will be tested using a 2- sided alpha of  0.043 (or 0.007) . 
1.5.2 Final  Analysis OS  
The final analysis for the OS  will be conducted after approximately 350–353 OS events are 
reached.   
1.6 Testing Procedure and Level of Significance  
The Type  I error rate will be controlled for testing the primary and secondary endpoints. A 2-
sided FWER of  0.05 will be used, with  0.007 allocated to the PFS hypothesis testing and 0.043 
allocated to the OS hypothesis testing. The alpha level  for the OS interim analysis will be based  
on a Heybittle -Peto boundary with a 2- sided significance level of  0.0001. The plan for 
conducting the interim and final OS analyses is specified in Section  1.5.1 and Section  1.5.2, 
respectively .   
The secondary endpoint hypotheses will be tested sequentially with a 2 -sided alpha level of 5% 
if both PFS and OS analys es show superiority. However, if only OS (or PFS) endpoint shows 
 PCYC -1137- CA 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Page 11 of 22  
 
Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   superiority , the secondary endpoint hypotheses will be tested sequentially at  an alpha level 
of 4.3%  (or 0.7%) .    
The secondary endpoints will be ranked in the following hierarchical order. Statistical testing 
will follow this sequence .   
1) ORR :  CR  +  PR per investigator assessment  
2) CA19-9 response :  proportion of subjects with a decline of ≥  60% from baseline  
3) PRO by EORTC QLQ -C30: TUDD1 for global  health status/QoL scale.  
4) VTE  rate 
5) CBR rate  
1.7 Blinding and Randomization Methods  
1.7.1 Blinding Method  
This is a double -blind study ; the blinding method is described in  the protocol (ie, Section  5.1 
“Treatment Allocation and Blinding ”) and the DMC charter . 
1.7.2 Randomization Method  
Randomization will be implemented in this study using IWRS. The randomization of treatment assignment will be stratified by the follow ing factors:  
• Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 70 -80 vs . 90-100 
• Liver metastasis (present vs. absent)  
• Age ≤  65 years vs . > 65 years.  
Subjects will be  randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms within each 
of 8 randomization strata  using permuted block stratified randomization .   
2 GENERAL ANALYSIS CON SIDERATION 
The statistical analysis sections  in this SAP are mainly for the Double -blind Randomized Phase . 
Subjects will be analyzed and summarized by treatment as randomized for all safety and  efficacy 
endpoints. Safety run -in data will be summarized or listed separately from Phase  3 data and 
placed in an appendix of the clinical study report ( CSR) . They include tables for demographic, 
baseline characteristics and baseline disease characteristics ; overview of treatment- emergent 
adverse events ( TEAEs ), all TEAEs by system organ class ( SOC )/preferred term (PT ), and 
maximum severity ; and 1  efficacy listing ( for best overall response, progression/death, and 
associated dates).

Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   5 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety data will be summarized by treatment. Table 4 summarize s the safety analyses to be 
carried out. Adverse events (AEs) will be coded in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Severity of AEs will be grad ed by the investigator according 
the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-
CTCAE ), Version  4.03. Events of special interest such as hemorrhagic events, major 
hemorrhage, and other safety observations such as hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), rash, cardiac arrhythmia excluding atrial fibrillation,  
and other malignancies will be included. 
In general, the treatment -emergent period is defined as the period from the date of the first dose 
of study treatment up to 30 days after the date of the last dose of study treatment or the day 
before initiation of  subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever comes first. Treatment -
emergent adverse events are those events that occur or worsen during the t reatment -emergent 
period or that are related to the study treatment or events with a complete missing onset date but 
with a resolution date during the treatment phase.  
All laboratory values will be converted to and reported as international standard (SI) units. In 
general, only data from the central laboratory will be summarized and analyzed. Laboratory 
parameters wi ll be graded using the NCI CTCAE , Version  4.03. Unless otherwise specified, only 
baseline and post -baseline values collected during the treatment -emergent period will be 
included in the safety analysis.

Version 1.0  Proprietary and Confidential   6 CHANGES IN PROTOCOL PLANNED ANALYSIS  
Protocol Section 10.4.1 states the following : 
“PFS final analysis and OS interim analysis will be carried out at the same time after at least 
350 PFS events and 250 death events (approximately 71% of death events) are observed. To 
control the family -wise Type  I error rate the fallback method as specified in the FDA Draft 
Guidance ( Multiple Endpoints in Clinical Trials, 2017 ), will be used to test the two primary 
endpoints. A 2- sided family -wise Type  I error rate (FWER) of 0.05 will be used with 0.007 
allocated to the PFS hypothesis testing and  0.043 allocated to the OS hypothesis testing. Lan-
DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien -Fleming boundary for efficacy will be used to 
determine the Type I error rate for the interim and final OS analyses depending on whether an 
alpha of  0.043 or  0.05 is used.”  
However, t he OS interim analysis strategy has been changed from P rotocol S ection  10.4.1. 
Conditions for conducting the OS interim analysis are outlined below:  
1) If at the time of the planned final PFS analysis,  (i.e., at least 350 PFS events as specified in 
the protocol)  the total number of OS events is ≥  333 (i e, ≥ 94% of the OS information 
fraction), the PFS final analysis will be delayed until the final OS events of approximately  350 have been reached.  
2) If at the time of the planned final PFS analysis, the total number of the OS events is <  333, 
the PFS final analysis will take place.  
a. If the PFS endpoint at the final analysis is significant, the OS interim analysis will be conducted using the Heybittle -Peto boundary .  
i. The interim analysis boundary will be based on a fixed Heybittle -Peto boundary 
using a 2- sided significance level of 0.0001.  
b. If the PFS endpoint at the final analysis is not significant, the OS will be tested at the time of the final analysis when a total of ~350 OS events have occurred.

Version 4.0 5 19 November 2019 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 3 - SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
This protocol was amended to include the following notable changes:  
• Justification for Dose (Section 4.3 ) 
o Added data from Phase 2 and 3 studies showing that doses up to 100 mg 
(including 75mg) of vibegron vs. placebo were safe and efficacious in patients 
with OAB up to 52 weeks. 
• Inclusion criteria (Section 5.1) and Section 10.2  
o Made fecal calprotectin testing optional per investigator’s discretion, reserving evaluation only in subjects with a strong suspicion for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) (eg, IBD family history in a 1
st degree relative, other genetic 
factors, etc)  
• Inclusion criteria (Section 5.1):  
o Removed C- reactive protein  (CRP ) testing as an eligibility requirement for all 
subjects 
o Updated diary completion for screening to “any 5 days out of 7 days at baseline prior to Day 1 Randomization” 
o Removed the IBS- D diarrhea criterion  (Bristol Stool Scale Type 6 or 7)  
• Exclusion criteria (Section 5.2), Section 6.5.1, 10.7.2, and Schedule of Assessments  
o For subjects who had a positive urine drug screen at Visit 1 due to a prohibited concomitant medication, the urine drug screen must be repeated at Visit 2 to determine if sufficient washout of the prohibited concomitant medication has occurred and to confirm eligibility.  The urine drug screen does not need to be re-tested at Visit 2 if the initial positive res ult at Visit 1 was due to a permitted 
concomitant medication based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.   
• Table 6 -2 Medications Permitted at Stable Doses  
o Added class of medications:  Antispasmodics/Smooth muscle relaxants and 
Peppermint Oil 
• Subject St ratification  
o Increased cap on IBS- M subjects from n  ≤ 40 (20%) to n ≤ 100 (50%) 
• Statistics  Considerations ( Section 9): 
o Removed the formal hypothes is testing.  The primary objective is to estimate the 
treatment effect of each group .  Nominal p- values will be provided for descriptive 
purposes 
o Updated the sample size section accordingly based on the requirement that 50% 
of the subjects be IBS -M 
o Added two additional analysis populations: Full analysis set  (FAS):  FAS -D and 
FAS-M, which are each subsets of FAS . 
o Added that an interim analys is may be performed

Version 4.0 14 19 November 2019 1. Protocol Summary 
1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy and Safety of Vibegron Administered Orally for 12 Weeks to Women  with Irritable 
Bowel Syndrome 
Protocol Number:  URO-901-2001 
Brief Title: Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of Vibegron in Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Study Rationale: 
Animal models have shown that beta -3 adrenergic receptor  (β3-AR) activation protects against 
gastric ulcers, i nhibits castor -oil induc ed diarrhea, and reduces observed pain behavior 
[Vasina, 2008; Cellek, 2007]. C linical studies of solabegron , a β3-AR agonist,  have shown 
improvement in pain among women with IBS , with no effect on gut motility in healthy subjects 
[Grudell, 2008; Kelleher, 2008]. Vibegron, a novel β 3-AR agonist, is in clinical development for 
the treatment of overactive bladder. It has been studied in approximately 2300 subjects (1840 
with overactive bladder and 460 healthy subjects ) and is currently being assessed in Phase 3 
studies. All clinical data a vailable to date indicate that vibegron is well tolerated.  
Objectives and Endpoint s (Primary and Secondary Only) : 
The primary study objective is to compare the effect of vibegron vs placebo in subjects with abdominal pain due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominantly diarrhea ( IBS-D) on 
the abdominal pain intensity (API) weekly responder rate over 12 weeks. Secondary objectives are to:  
• Compare the effect of vibegron vs placebo in subjects with abdominal pain due to IBS- D 
or mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation (IBS- M) on patient-reported outcomes 
• Compare the effect of vibegron vs placebo in subjects with abdominal pain due to IBS- D 
on the API weekly responder rate over 12 weeks based on different thresholds of 
improvement 
• Compare the effect of vibegron vs placebo in subjects with abd ominal pain due to IBS- D 
or IBS -M on safety endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of API weekly responders over 12 weeks , with a n API 
Weekly Responder defined as a subject who experiences a decrease in the weekly average of 
“worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours” scores of at least 30% compared with the baseline weekly average. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of Global Improvement Scale responders at Week 12 , the proportion of IBS- D subjects who are API weekly responder s with at 
least 40% improvement over 12 weeks, the proportion of IBS- D subjects who are API 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 15 19 November 2019 responders with at least 50 % improvement over 12 weeks , adverse events (AEs) , clinical 
laboratory values, and vital signs. 
Overall Study Design : 
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vibegron in women  with  irritable bowel 
syndrome with predominantly diarrhea ( IBS-D) or mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation 
(IBS-M). Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either vibegron 75 mg or matched  placebo. Randomization will be stratified by baseline 
abdominal pain intensity score (< 6 vs ≥ 6 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating  scale ) and  IBS 
subtype (IBS- D vs IBS -M). Enrollment for subjects with IBS -M will be capped at 50 % of the 
total subject population (ie, up to 50% [n=100] of the study population can  be subjects with IBS-
M). Stratification will be performed via central randomization across the study (not per site).  
The study consists of a Screening Period (1 to 5 weeks), a single- blind  placebo  Run -in Period 
(2 weeks), a randomized double -blind Treatment Period (12  weeks) , and a Safety Follow-up 
telephone call  (approximately 2 weeks).  
Number of Subjects : 
In total, approximately  200 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (100 per treatment group).

Version 4.0 22 19 November 2019 2. Introduction  
2.1. Study Rationale  
This s tudy will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vibegron, a beta-3 adrenergic receptor ( β3-AR) 
agonist, in the treatment of pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is associated 
with predominantly diarrhea (IBS -D) or has mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation 
(IBS -M). The rationale for the study is based on both animal models  of functional 
gastrointestinal disorders and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies of the β3-AR agonist 
solabegron. Animal models have shown that β 3-AR activation can protect a gainst gastric ulcers, 
inhibit castor -oil induced diarrhea, and reduce observed pain behavior [ Vasina, 2008 ; 
Cellek,  2007 ]. The clinical studies of solabegron have shown improvement in pain among 
women  with IBS , with no effect on gut motility in healthy subjects [ Grude ll, 2008 ; 
Kelleher,  2008]. Although this is the first study of vibegron in the setting of IBS, vibegron has 
been studied in the overactive bladder population (including a completed large Phase 2b 
dose-ranging study, 2 completed Phase 3 studies in Japan , and 2 ongoing global Phase 3 studies ), 
and all clinical data available to date indicate that vibegron has been  well tolerated.  
2.2. Background  
2.2.1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic, functional, bowel disorder associated with changes in the 
frequency or consistency of stool (ie, diarrhea, constipation , or a combination of both) as well as 
abdominal pain and distension [ Sinagra, 2017]. The et iology of IBS is complex and affects 
bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous system (ie, gut -brain 
axis) . Altered colonic motility, defects in epithelial and secretory function, immune dysfunction, 
neurohormonal regulation, stress, and infection have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS 
[Occhipinti, 2012]. The  Rome IV  criteria classify  IBS into 4 distinct subtypes based on 
predominant stool consistency: IBS with predominantly constipation (IBS- C), IBS with 
predominantly diarrhea ( IBS-D), IBS with mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation (IBS -M), 
and IBS with unknown subtype (IBS- U) [Lacy , 2017] . The definitions of diarrhe a and 
constipation correlate with the Bristol Stool Form Scale, with Types 1 and 2 defined as  
constipation and Types 6 and 7 defined as diarrhea. The Rome IV IBS classification  is based on 
the patient’s predominant bowel habit on days with abnormal bowel movement as follows:  
• IBS-C: ≥ 25% constipation (Bristol Type 1 or 2) and < 25% diar rhea (Bristol Type 6 
or 7).  
• IBS-D: ≥ 25% diarrhea (Bristol Type 6 or 7) and <  25% const ipation (Bristol Type 1 or 2) 
• IBS-M: ≥ 25% constipation (Bristol Type 1 or 2) and ≥  25% diarrhea (Bristol Type 6 
or 7) 
• IBS-U: unclassified ( insufficient abnormality to meet other criteria )  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 23 19 November 2019 The Rome IV d iagnostic criteria must be met within the  most recent  3 months, with symptom 
onset at least 6  months before diagnosis.  
Among functional gastrointestinal disorders, IBS is the most prevalent, affecting approximately 
11% of the world’s population (range: 1% to 45%, depending on country and criteria)  
[Lovell, 2012] . Epidemiology studies indicate that gender plays a role in the development of 
IBS, as women are at a higher risk for the condition than men; however, t he predominance of 
women has been observed only in Western cou ntries  (approximately 2:1 to 5:1 , depending on the 
care setting)  possibly because of under diagnosis or differences in diet or infection risk factors 
[Sinagra, 2017]. IBS has a significant impact on quality of life and consid erable economic 
burden to the health care system, with total cost (direct and indirect) estimates of $30 billion in the United States (US) [ Lembo, 2007].  
Abdominal pain is an important aspect and largely unmet medical need of IBS . Visceral 
structures are highly sensitive to distension, ischemia, and inflammation, and activation of nociceptors in response to tension or stretching can cause pain in patients w ith IBS . Colon 
spasms are common in patients with IBS and are associated with the symptoms of pain and bloating. Patients with IBS may also exhibit visceral hypersensitivity (ie, lowered pain thres hold) 
[Melchior, 2018; Camilleri, 2008 ; Sabate, 2008]. IBS pain is often refractory to currently 
available therapeutic options ( ie, diet , antispasmodics, antidepressants, laxatives, or 
antidiarrheals), creating a significa nt challenge for clinicians and patients trying to manage the 
disorder [ Camilleri, 2017 ]. In addition, the side effects associated with pharmacotherapies, such 
as the anticholinergic effects of antispasmodics, may lead to lack of compliance or even discontinuation of treatment [ Camilleri  2017; Saha 2014]. 
2.2.2. Vibegron 
Vibegron is a potent, highly selective, orally available, β
3-AR agonist demonstrating > 9000-fold 
selectivity for activation of β 3-AR over β 2-AR and β 1-AR in cell -based in vitro assays. 
Nonclinical and clinical studies suggest β3-AR activation is a novel t arget for treating pain and 
gastrointestinal motility in patients with IBS. β 3-ARs are widely expressed and distributed on 
vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle and enteric neurons in the gastrointestinal tracts of many species, including humans [ Cellek, 2007; De Ponti, 1996; Anthony, 1996; Krief, 1993].  
Mechanistically, β
3-AR agonists are hypothesized to reduce colon smooth muscle contractions, 
enteric neuron hyperactivity, and visceral pain by mediating a direct effect on smooth muscle and indirectly by promoting release of somatostatin within the intestine. In isolated ci rcular 
muscle strips of human colon, activation of β
3-AR induced smooth muscle relaxation 
[Cellek,  2007; De Ponti, 1999; Bardou, 1998; De Ponti, 1996], which was blocked using β 3-AR 
antagonists [ Schemann, 2010; De  Ponti, 1999]. In addition, β 3-AR agonists have been shown to 
reduce hyperexcitabilit y of huma n enteric neurons and stimulate release of somatostatin 
[Schemann, 2010; Cellek,  2007], which inhibit s submucosal neuronal excitability and pain in 
both animal models and humans [ Prasoon, 2015; Shi, 2014; Mihara, 1987].  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 24 19 November 2019 Approximately 2300 subjects (including 1840 with overactive bladder and 460 healthy subjects ) 
have received vibegron in 19 clinical studies.  Data from these studies indicate that vibegron has 
been well tolerated  when administered alone or in combination with the following drugs: 
antimuscarinics (imidafenacin or tolterodine); metoprolol (a representative beta -blocker); or 
amlod ipine (a representative vasodilator). Assessment of safety laboratory parameters and mean 
vital sign values over time, including heart rate and blood pressure, showed no clinically 
meaningful differences for any active treatment group relative to placebo or an antimuscarinic comparator. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were low (less than 5%) in all clinical studies. A more detailed description of vibegron, including pharmacology, efficacy, and safety data in overactive bladder, is provided in the most recent version of the Investigator’s B rochure . 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
2.3.1. Potential Benefits  
Vibegron’s novel mechanism of action has the potential to demonstrate significant therapeutic benefit in subjects with IBS pain . Early phase clinical studies of another β
3-AR agonist, 
solabegron, showed improvement in the pain scores of women  with IBS and no effect on gut 
motility in healthy subjects [Grudell, 2008; Kelle her, 2008].  
2.3.2. Potential Risks  
To date, in subjects (male or female) with overactive bladder, no adverse reactions specific to vibegron have been identified. 
Based on aggregate preclinical, clinical pharmacology, and Phase 2 and 3 studies, AEs of special 
interest (AESIs) predefined for specific evaluations in vibegron clinical studies are as follows:  
• Potential major cardiovascular events 
• Hypertension 
• AEs suggestive of orthostatic hypotension 
• AEs suggestive of cystitis or urinary tract infection  
• Elevated AST or  ALT lab value requiring that the study drug be temporarily withheld or 
permanently discontinued 
Prespecified definitions of AESI s are provided in Section 8.4.7. More detailed information about 
the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected  AEs  of vibegron may be 
found in the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure.

Version 4.0 29 19 November 2019 4. Study Design  
4.1. Overall  Design  
This study is a Phase 2 randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-group, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of vibegron in women  with IBS -D or IBS -M. Subjects 
who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vibegron  75 mg 
or matched  placebo. R andomization will be stratified by baseline abdominal pain intensity score 
(< 6 vs ≥ 6 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale [NRS]) and IBS subtype (IBS -D vs IBS -M). 
Enrollment for subjects with IBS -M wi ll be capped at 50% of the total subject population (ie, up 
to 50% of the study population will be subjects with IBS -M). Stratification will be performed via 
central randomization across the study (not per site).  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be retained to assess, on an ongoing basis, all 
safety aspects of this study, including SAEs, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and all other AEs. The committee will meet to review the safety data at the follo wing 3 times when the (1) first 25% of subjects enrolled complete the 
Week 4 visit (Visit 5); (2) first 50% of subjects enrolled complete the Week 4 visit (Visit 5); and (3) first 75% of subjects enrolled complete the Week 4 visit (Visit 5).  
The study cons ists of a Screening Period (1  to 5 weeks), a single-blind Run- in Period (2  weeks), 
a randomized, double- blind Treatment Period (12  weeks) , and a Safety Follow-up telephone c all 
(2 weeks) . The  Safety Follow -up tele phone call will occur 14 days (with a window of −7 days) 
after the subject’s last dose of study drug (ie,  at Week  14 for subjects who complete the 
Week  12 Visit, or 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug for randomized subjects who 
discontinue treatment early ) (see Schedule of Assessments, Section 1.3 ). Additionally, 
Unscheduled Visits may be arranged for subjects with study- related safety concerns as needed.  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 40 sites in the US  to achieve 
approximately 90 evaluable IBS -D subjects ( 45 per treatment group).  Enrollment will be 
competitive . The sample size justification is provided in Section 9.2. 
4.1.1. Clinical Hypotheses  
The primary objective will be to estimate the treatment effect of vibegron relative to placebo  
with respect to improvement in IBS -related abdominal pain in IBS -D subjects.  There is no 
formal statistical hypothesis.  Nominal p -values from comparisons to placebo may be provided 
for descriptive purposes. 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
A single- blind , placebo Run-in Period will be used to assess placebo response and to  ensure that 
subjects have adequate experience with dosing compliance and completing the diaries . The 
double- blind Treatment Period will include a placebo arm t o accurately demonstrate and measure 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 30 19 November 2019 the efficacy of vibegron. Subjects with IBS -D or IBS -M were chosen as the study population 
because the abdominal pain due to colonic contractions in these subjects is an unmet medical 
need that may be addressed by vibegron’s ability to relax smooth muscle contractions, as 
demonstrated in the overactive bladder population. The study population is limited to women because data from the Phase 2 clinical study of the β
3-AR agonist solabegron have shown 
improvement in IBS pain among women [Kelleher, 2008].  
4.3. Justification for Dose  
This study is a proof- of-concept study that will evaluate the effect of vibegron in subjects with 
IBS-D or IBS -M. The dose of vibegron for this study (75 mg once daily) is the  same dose that 
was evaluated in the recent Phase 3 program for subjects with overactive bladder. The evidence 
to support this dose comes from the following data :  
• Several  Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies with v ibegron at doses up to 100 mg 
(including 75 mg) have demonstrated that it is generally safe , well tolerated , and 
efficacious in subjects with overactive bladder over  52 weeks of treatment: 
o Vibegron 75 mg (2 Phase 3 studies): Studies 3003 and 3004 
o Vibegron 50 mg and 100 mg (2 Phase 3 studies and 1 Phase 2b study): Stud ies 
301, 302, and 008 
• Study 008 demonstrated dose-dependent significant efficacy over placebo across 
multiple clinical endpoints in overactive bladder, with the maximal effect generally 
estimated at doses between 50 and 100 mg 
• Compared with placebo, no clinically relevant differences in h eart rate or blood pressure 
were observed for vibegron (50 and 100 mg once daily) in the overactive bladder population 
• Vibegron 75 mg administered once daily  is expected to capture approximately 90% of 
the efficacy of 100 mg daily; the mean trough concentration for vibegron 75 mg at steady -state is 40 ng/mL, which is several fold  above the β
3 half- maximal effective 
concentration  of 1.7 nM (0.76 ng/mL) 
The dose of vibegron used in this IBS study ( 75 mg once daily ) is expected to have a similar 
safety profile to that observed with the same dose in the overactive bladder population. 
4.4. End of Study Definition  
The end of the study is defined as the date that the last subject completes  both the Week 12 Visit 
and Week 14 Safety Follow-up Telep hone Call Visit, discontinues from the study, or is lost to 
follow -up. 
A subject  is considered to  have completed the study if she completes 12 weeks of double-blind 
treatment at the Week 12 Visit .

• Subjects who have a positive urine drug screen at Visit 1 due to a prohibited concomitant medication that can be washed out, the urine drug screen must be 
repeated at Visit 2 to determine if sufficient washout of the prohibited concomitant medication has occurred and to confirm eligibility   
• If the initial positive result at Visit 1 was due to a permitted concomitant 
medication (see Section 6.5.2), based on the clinical judgment of the investigator, 
a subject is still eligible  and the urine drug screen would not need to be re- tested

Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 35 19 November 2019 5.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
Subjects are expected to maintain their pre -study diet  for the duration of the study. Alcoholic 
drinks must be limited to ≤  3 per day (one drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of 
wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits).  
5.4. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as subject s who consent to participate in the clinical study but  are not 
subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials  publishing requirements and to respond to queries from r egulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event  (SAE)  that occurred within the Screening P eriod . 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in the study (screen failures prior to 
initiation of run -in study medication ) may be rescreened  once  upon consultation with, and 
approval by, the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor,  Sponsor, or its designe e. Subjects who 
initiate Run -in study drug dosing may not be rescreened. Rescreened subjects will be assigned a 
new subject number, and both subject numbers will be linked to the subject, and a new informed consent with the new subject number should be signed. Screening assessments specified in Section 1.3 should be repeated if subjects are rescreened.

HDPE = high density polyethylene  
The study drug will be supplied in  bottles  each containing 32 tablets (4 -week supply) and labeled 
with the protocol number, bottle number, lot number, expiration date, study drug name (vibegron 
75 mg or placebo tablets ), number of tablets, directions for use, storage in formation, warning 
language ( Keep Out of Reach of Children. For Clinical Trial Use Only. To be used by qualified 
Investigators only. Caution: New Drug— Limited by United States Law to Investigational Use.), 
and the US Sponsor name and address. Immediately b efore dispensing the study drug, the 
Investigator (or appropriately trained designee) will write the subject number , visit number. and 
the dispense date on the detachable panel of the label , which also includes the protocol number, 
bottle number and lot number. 
6.1.1. Run-in Medications and Administration  
During the single- blind Run- in Period, all subjects will take 1 tablet of study drug (ie, placebo) 
once daily for 2 weeks. All subjects will take their first dose of study drug at the study site as a 
witnessed dose. The date and time of the study drug dosing will be recorded. The I nvestigator 
will be aware that the study drug is placebo, but the subject will not know either t he identity of 
the treatment or that entry into the double -blind Treatment Period is dependent on compliance 
with dosing in the Run- in Period. The matched placebo will be identical in appearance to the 
study drug administered during double- blind treatment.   
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 37 19 November 2019 6.1.2. Treatment Period Medications and Administration  
During the double-blind Treatment Period, subjects will take 1 tablet of study drug (vibegron or 
matched placebo) once daily for up to 12 weeks. The appearance of the vibegron and placebo tablets will be identical. All subjects will take their first dose of study drug at the study site as a witnessed dose. The date and time of the study drug dosing will be recorded. 
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
Clinical supplies must be stored in a secure, lim ited-access location under the storage conditions 
specified on the label.  
Receipt and dispensing of study drug must be recorded by an authorized person at the study site. 
Clinical supplies may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the protocol. The Investigator is responsible for keeping accurate records of the clinical supplies received 
from the Sponsor or designee, the amount dispensed to and returned by the subjects , and the 
amount remaining at the conclusion of the study. These records will be monitored throughout the 
study. 
For all sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return. 
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
Single- blind (Run -in only) and double- blind (Treatment Period) technique s will be used. 
Vibegron and its matched  placebo will be packaged identically so that the treatment blind is 
maintained. The subject, Investigator, and Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in 
the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be unaware of the treatment group assignments during the double-blind Treatment Period. Subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study drug using an interactive web response system (IWRS) and the randomization schedule generated by the Sponsor or designee. Before the screening is initiated at each site, 
login information and directions for the IWRS will be provided . 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s study drug assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investi gator  decides that unblinding is warranted, the Investigator should 
make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee prior to unblinding a subject’s study drug 
assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject. If a subject’s study drug assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation. 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 38 19 November 2019 At the end of the study, the official, final database will be frozen and unblinded after 
medical/scientific review has been performed, and data have been declared final and complete. The Sponsor will be granted access to the unblinded database in order to analyze the data. A clinical study report will be prepared after all subjects complete the study.  
6.4. Study Drug  Compliance  
Study drug compliance will be closely monitored by counting the number of tablets dispensed and returned. Before dispensing new study drug at applicable visits, study site  personnel will 
make every effort to collect all unused study drug and empty bottles. 
The study site  will keep an accurate d rug disposition record that specifies the amount of study 
drug administered to each subject and the date of administration. 
6.5. Concomitant Therapy  
The use of any concomitant medication, prescription or over- the-counter, is to be recorded on the 
subject ’s electronic case report form (e CRF ) at each visit , along with the reason the medication is 
taken , the dates of administration, and the dose. 
6.5.1. Prohibited Drug s and Washout Before the Study  
Table 6-1 provides a list of specific restriction s for concomitant therapy use during the study, 
with any necessary washout periods described (s ee Sect ion 6.5.2 for permitted medications 
requiring a stable dose prior to study entry and Table 6 -1 for the list of prohibited medications 
and washout periods). For subjects who had a positive urine drug screen at Visit 1 due to a 
prohibited concomitant medication, the urine drug screen must be repeated at Visit 2 to determine if sufficient washout of the prohibited concomitant medication has occurred and to confirm eligibility.  Th e urine drug screen does not need to be re- tested at Visit 2 if the initial 
positive result at Visit 1 was due to a permitted concomitant medication based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator.   
If there is a clinical indication for any therapy tha t is specifically prohibited during the study, 
discontinuation from study drug may be required. The Investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor. The final decision on any supportive therapy rests with the Investigator and/or the subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on study t reatment requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator and the Sponsor’s designated  Medical Monitor.  
Consult the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor if there is any uncertainty regarding subject use of a particular drug or drug class.

abnormalities as described in Section 8.4.7.1. 
6.7. Drug  after the End of the Study  
No further study drug will be administered to subjects who complete the study.  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 42 19 November 2019 7. Discontinuation of Study Drug  and Subject  
Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
A premature discontinuation will occur if a subject who signs the informed consent form ( ICF) 
and is randomized  ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the 
completion of the protocol-defined study procedures. 
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Subjects who discontinue study drug post-randomization will complete the Week 12/Early 
Withdrawal  assessments specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3). Reasons for 
discontinuation from double-blind study drug treatment and the study include the following : 
• Adverse event (AE) 
• Lack of efficacy  
• Noncompliance 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Physician decision  
• Protocol deviation  
• Pregnancy 
• Death  
• Other  
Discontinuation of study drug for abnormal liver function should be considered by the Investigator when a subject  meets all of the conditions outlined in Section  8.4.7.2 for Hy’s law  or 
if the Investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the subject (reason for discontinuation 
will be AE ). Reporting and follow-up requirements for pregnancy are provided in Section  8.4.5 
and Section  10.6.2. 
For subjects who are not randomized into the  12-week double-bl ind treatmen t period and, 
therefore , are either screen failures or run -in failures, the End  of Study eCRF should be 
completed  (refer to eCRF completion guidelines for additional information).  
  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 43 19 November 2019 7.2. Subject Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study  
• Subjects who discontinue post- randomization study drug will also withdraw from the study.  
• A subject  may choose to withdraw from the study  at any time at her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons . 
• If a subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor or designee 
may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• If a subject withdraws from the study, she may request destruction of any blood or urine 
samples taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study 
records.  
• Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced (enrollment ac counts for a 
predetermined dropout rate).  
• The Week 12/Early Withdrawal assessments will be completed , if possible, when a subject 
withdraws or is withdrawn from the study (see Schedule of Assessments  in Section 1.3 ). 
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
Should a subject fail to attend a required study visit, the site should attempt to contact the subject 
and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study based on previous noncompliance. In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the subject so that they c an 
appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”, including at least three documented attempts to contact the subject  (ie, phone, email, or certified 
letter). Efforts to establish the possible reason for discontinua tion should be documented. 
7.4. Early Study Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. The study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/b enefit ratio to the study population as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further 
recruitment in the study overall or at a particular study site may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice or other applicable regulatory requirements; procedure- related problems ; or the number of discontinuations for administrative 
reasons is too high. 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 44 19 November 2019 8. Study Assessments and Procedures 
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3). 
A detailed listing of study assessments by visit is p rovided in Section 10.7 . 
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed; however, subjects who fail to meet 
eligibility criteria may be rescreened once, as appropriate. Any notable protocol 
deviations should be noted and raised to the Sponsor’s or designee’s attention. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor’s designated Medical 
Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study drug. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Assessments , is essential and required for study conduct. 
• Note  that patient -repor ted outcome ( PRO) assessments will be completed prior to vital 
signs, and vital signs will be taken prior to blood draws. 
8.1. Baseline Procedures  
8.1.1. Informed Consent  
Documented consent must be obtained from each potential subject  prior to participating in any 
study procedures according to the process described in Section 10.1.3. 
8.1.2. Assignment of Subject Number  
All subjects who sign the ICF will be assigned a unique subject number by IWRS. This number 
will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. Subjects who are rescreened  will be 
assigned a new subject  number. If a new number is assigned, the subject will be linked to both 
subject numbers. 
8.1.3. Screening  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subject s 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
subject s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 ) will be reviewed by the 
Investigator  or qualified designee at Screening, the start of the Run-in Period, and the start of the 
double- blind Treatment Period.  
Subjects who fail to meet entry criteria may be rescreened once  upon consultation with, and 
approval by, the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor, Sponsor, or designee (See Section 8.1.2 
regarding subject number). 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 45 19 November 2019 The Screening Period may also be used for washout of prohibited medications (see 
Section  6.5.1).  
8.1.4. Medical History  
A medical history will be obtained by the Investigator or qualified designee. Medical history will include all chronic and ongoing conditions, regardless of year diagnosed; surgical history; substance abuse history ; and IBS history (eg, Rome subtype, date of diagnosis, prior treatment). 
A history of previous diets for IBS and their perceived effectiveness will also be collected. All events occurring after the subject signs the ICF will be recorded as AEs . 
8.1.5. Demographics 
Demographic data collection will include sex, age, race, and ethnicity. 
8.1.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior IBS medications and o ngoing (concomitant) medications will be recorded beginning at the 
signing of the ICF and continuing until the Safety Follow -up call. 
8.2. Efficacy  Assessments  
Efficacy assessments will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3 ).

PRO = patient- reported outcomes; WPAI = Work Productivity  and Activity  Impairment  
8.2.1. Symptom Diar ies 
Subjects will complete 2 diaries daily, a Bowel Movement Diary and a Pain Diary . The Bowel 
Movement Diary  will be event-driven (ie, subjects will record events as they occur)  and will 
capture bowel movement frequency and form, bowel urgency, and recurrent bowel movements. 
The Pain Diary  will prompt subjects  each evening to answer  a question regarding worst 
abdominal pain for the past 24 hours using the 0- to 10-point NRS  to rate pain  and to  capture use 
of rescue medications. 
Subjects will rec eive the diaries and be trained on their  use at the st art of the Run-in Period 
(Visit 2). At subsequent visits, subjects will be re- instructed or retrained as needed. Subjects

Version 4.0 48 19 November 2019 8.3.3. Electrocardiograms  
At Screening only, a 12- lead ECG will be performed in the supine position using an ECG 
machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and  QTc  
intervals.  ECGs will be read by trained personnel at the study site. 
8.3.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2 and including urine 
pregnancy test  and drug screen , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and 
the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3). Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for 
safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.  
The clinical significance of test results will be evaluated as follows:  
• At Screening, the Investigator or physician sub- investigator will assess the clinical 
significance of any values outside the reference ranges provided by the laboratory, and 
subject s with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the 
study. 
• The Investigator or physician sub- investigator must review the laboratory report, document 
this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the subject ’s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significant during participation in the 
study or within 14 days after the last dose of study drug should be repeated until the values 
return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator or Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor. 
- If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor  notified . 
- If laboratory values from non protocol- specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator (eg, SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the e CRF.  
8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The definitions of an AE and SAE  can be found in Section 10.3. 
AEs will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject’ s legally authorized  representative).  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 49 19 November 2019 The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs  that are serious, considered related to the study drug or study procedures, or that caused 
the subject  to discontinue the study drug or the study (see Section 7). 
8.4.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event  Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from  the signing of the ICF  through 14  days after the last 
dose of study drug. AEs will be collected at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments  (Section  1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by study subjects. 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of double- blind study drug, but after obtaining 
informed consent, will be recorded in the AE section of the  eCRF.  
All SAEs  (including serious AESIs) will be recorded and reported on the eCRF within 24 hours  
of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event , as indicated in Section 8.4.4. Marking the 
event as “serious” will automatically send required notifications for Sponsor or designee review.  
The Investigator will also submit any updated SAE data within 24 hours of receipt of the information . Nonserious AESIs will be reported on the eCRF within 72 hours  of the site’s 
knowledge of the information. 
Investigator s are not obligated to actively seek  AE or SAE  information after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any  SAE , including a death, at any 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify 
the Sponsor or designee. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3 . 
8.4.2. Method of Detecting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences. 
8.4.3. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All  AEs will be followed until the Week 14 Safety Follow-up 
telephone call  (14 days [ with a − 7-day window ] after the last dose of study drug) . All SAEs will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost 
to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). If a subject dies during participation in the study or 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 50 19 November 2019 within 14 days of the last dose of study drug, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor or 
designee with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology. 
The Investigator is obligated to p erform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by  the Sponsor or 
designee to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the  AE or SAE  as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. As noted above, 
the Investigator will submit any updated SAE data within 24  hours of receipt of the information.  
8.4.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
• Prompt notification of an SAE by the Investigator to the Sponsor or designee is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study drug  under clinical investigation are met. 
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug  under clinical investigation. The Sponsor 
will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB) or In dependent Ethics Committee 
(IEC), and Investigator s. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
Investigator s as necessary . 
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a n SAE  or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from the Sponsor or designee 
will review and then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.4.5. Pregnancy  
If any subject becomes pregnant during the study ( from signing the ICF  through 14 days after the 
last d ose of study drug), the site must discontinue the subject  from study drug  immediately and 
have the subject return for an Early Withdrawal Visit (W eek 12 Visit assessments). The 
Investigator must inform the subject of the right to receive treatment information. If the subject 
chooses to receive unblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken and 
the treatment assignment provided to the subject  (see Section 6.3 for unblinding information). 
The study team will remain blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment.  
In the case of a pregnant subject, if she agrees, the Investigator should notify the subject’s 
primary care physician of the pregnancy and provide details of the subject’s participation in the study and treatment (blinded or unblinded, as applicable). 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 51 19 November 2019 A pregnancy is to be reported to the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
awareness by the study site personnel using the contact information on the Study Contacts Page  
and the dedicated pregnancy reporting form. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, neonatal data, etc. should be included in this information, as avai lable.  
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, the pregnancy, as well as the outcome of the infant at birth, and will report the outcome to the Sponsor or designee. 
If the pregnant subject experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (ie, report the event on the AE eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of causality) shoul d be reported as SAEs. In addition, any infant death or congenital anomaly 
occurring after study completion that the Investigator suspects is related to the in-utero  exposure 
to the study drug should also be reported. Refer to Section 10.6.2 for additional information regarding collection of pregnancy data.  
8.4.6. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease- Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
No disease- related events or outcomes are excluded from AE  reporting. Any worsening of 
diarrhea or constipation and any new onset of constipation should be collected as AE s. 
8.4.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Selected nonserious and serious AE s will be reported as AES Is. The events must be reported on 
the AE eCRF within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event. AESIs that 
also meet the definition of an SAE must be reported as described in  Section 10.3. 
Adverse events of clinical interest for this study include:  
• Potential major cardiac and c erebrovascular events,  including death (or any event with 
fatal outcome), 
myocardial infarction, cere brovascular accident, hospitalization for 
unstable angina or chest pain, hospitalization for heart failure, and coronary 
revascularization/angioplasty/stent  
• Hypertension, def
ined as follows:  
- 

Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 52 19 November 2019 - 
- 
• AEs consistent with orthostatic hypotension as confirmed by or thostatic vital
 signs 
• AEs suggestive of cys
titis or urinary tra
ct infection  (UTI)  
- 
- 
- 
• Elevated asparta
te am
inotransferase ( AST ) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) lab value 
requiring that study d
rug be temporarily withheld or permanently discontinued (see 
Section s 8.4.7.1 and 8.4.7.2). To date, no c
oncern regarding drug -induced liver toxicity 
has been identified; however, the Sponsor is monitoring laboratory data for a potential 
safety signal, consistent  with Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) guidance 
[FDA Guidance, 2009]. 
Serious AESIs and elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin requiring withholding of study drug must 
be reported within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event by marking the appropriate box on the AE eCRF and assigning the most appropriate category. Additional information should be provided as directed in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. AESIs that also meet t he definition of an SAE  must be reported as an SAE , as described in Section 8.4.4. 
Nonserious AESIs should be reported within 72 hours of the site personnel’s knowledge, using the AE eCRF.  
8.4.7.1. Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug  in Association with Liver 
Test Abnormalities  
Elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin sufficient to require withholding study medication must be reported wit hin 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event using 
AES I -specific eCRFs/forms/worksheets provided for the study.  

Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 53 19 November 2019 Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA Guidance, 2009].  
If any  of the following liver te st abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld 
immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a 
subject’s  laboratory profile has returned to normal /baseline status), and the event reported as an 
SAE :  
• ALT or AST > 8 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• ALT or AST > 5 x ULN an d persists for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio 
(INR) > 1.5  
• ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubi n) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline 
values. The Investigator and Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor must discuss and agree with 
any decision to rechallenge.  
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalit ies is considered 
possibly drug-induced. 
8.4.7.2. Criteria for
  Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  in Association with Liver 
Test A
bnormalities  
Study drug should be discontinued permanently if all  of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, 
potential severe drug -induced liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
• Total bilirubin increases to > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5 and 
• AST or ALT i
ncr
eases to ≥ 3 x ULN  and 
• Alkal
ine phospha
tase value does not reach 2 x ULN  and 
• No alter
nati
ve cause explains the combination of t he above laboratory abnormalities; 
important alternative causes include, but are not limited to , the following: 
- Hepatobiliary tract disease  
- Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis  A/B/C/D/E, E pstein -Barr virus)  
- Exposure to hepatotoxic a
gents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary 
supplements
, plants, and mushrooms;  
- Alcoholic he
patitis  
- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 54 19 November 2019 - Autoimmune hepatitis  
If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the 
severity of 
the hepatotoxicity or event) whether study drug should be withheld or permanently 
discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the subject, following consultation with the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor. 
8.4.8. Medication E
rrors 
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
drug as per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fal l into 4 categories as 
follows:  
• Wrong study drug 
• Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount) 
• Wrong route of administration 
• Wrong subject  (ie, not administered to the intended subject) 
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study drug. 
Overdose : Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study drug given per administration 
or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the protoc ol. This also 
takes into account cumulative effects due to overdose (see Section 8.5 for treatment and 
reporting of overdose) . For this study, any dose of vibegron or placebo > 2 tablets within a 
24-hour window is an overdose. There is no known antidote for an overdose. Underdose: No underdose is defined for this study. 
8.5. Treatment of Overdose  
In the event of an overdose (> 2 tablets of study drug within 24 hours) , the Investigator or 
treating physician should: 
• Contact the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor immediately  
• Closely monitor the subject for any AEs, SAEs, and laboratory abnormalities 
• Report all overdose events within 24 hours of awareness by the study site, using the 
Overdose eCRF , whether or not the overdose is associated with an AE  
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
eCRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor  based on the clinical ev aluation of 
the subject . 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 55 19 November 2019 9. Statistical Considerations  
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses for this study; full details will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The randomized allocation schedule will be generated by the Sponsor or designee and 
implemented by the vendor of the study. Stratification will be performed across the study (not per site). The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee. At the end of the study, the official, final database will be frozen and unblinded after medical/scientific review has been performed, and data have been declared final and complete. The  SAP  will be approved prior to data being unblinded. 
A subject is considered enrolled in the study at randomization.  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary objective will be to estimate the treatment effect of vi begron relative to placebo  
with respect to improvement in IBS -related abdominal pain  in IBS -D subjects.  There is no 
formal statistical hypothesis .  Nominal p -values from comparisons to placebo may be provided 
for descriptive purposes.  An improvement in the primary endpoint is  defined as a subject who 
experiences a decrease in the weekly average of “worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours” scores of at least 30% compared with the baseline weekly average.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
In total, approximately 200 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of the 
following study drugs: 
• Vibegron 75 mg (N = 100 ) 
• Placebo (N  = 100) 
At most, 50 % of randomized subjects (approximately 100 subjects total [ 50 per treatment arm]) 
will have IBS -M; and at least 50% of randomized subjects (approximately 100 subjects total [50 
per treatment arm]) will have IBS -D, and the IBS -D subgroup will be used for the primary 
endpoint analysis.  
Assuming a total of 10% of subjec ts will discontinue prior to Week  12 (for any reason), there 
will be a minimum of approximately 90 evaluable  IBS-D subjects (45 in the vibegron arm and 45 
in the placebo  arm) at the end of Week 12. The study has approximately 60 % power to detect a 
between -group treatment difference of 20% in proportion of abdominal pain responders at a 
2 -sided  test at the α  = 0.10 level assuming a responder rate of 51% versus 31% for vibegron and 
placebo, respectively. The assumptions were based  on results from a solabegron study female

Version 4.0 56 19 November 2019 9.3. Populations for Analyses  
The analysis populations will consist of subject s as defined below : 
• The Screened Analysis Set  includes all subjects who are screened for the study. This 
population is used primarily for subject accounting purposes and will generally not be used 
for summary or analysis. 
• The Randomized Set  includes all subjects who are randomized to receive study drug 
regardless of whether they take a dose. 
• The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Subjects will be classified according to the treatment they actually receive.  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized IBS -D and IBS-M subjects who took at 
least one dose of double-blind study drug and ha d a baseline diary assessment and at least 
1 post -randomization diary entry. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment, irrespective of whether or not they ha ve prematurely discontinued, according to 
the Intent - to-Treat  principle. The Full Analysis Set for IBS -D (FAS -D) and Full Analysis 
Set for IBS -M (FAS -M) are each a subset of FAS and consists of IBS -D and IBS- M subjects, 
respectively . The FAS -D will serve as the primary population for the primary analysis of 
efficacy data in this study.  
• The Per -Protocol Set for IBS -D excludes subjects from the FAS-D due to important 
deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the  result of the prim ary efficacy 
endpoint (ie, Major P rotocol D eviations  associated with efficacy). The  Per - Protocol Set will 
serve as the supportive population for the analysis of efficacy data in this study .  Other Per-
Protocol Sets may be defined. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
Endpoints that will be evaluated for within - and/or between- treatment differences are provided 
below. Th e descriptions of the endpoints and timepoints at which they are measured are 
described in  Section 3 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3).  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized by treatment to indicate the population 
sample size (N), number of subjects with available data (n), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first and third quartile, minimum and maximum values.  Categorical variables will 
be summarized by N, n, number of subjects in each category and the percentage of subjects in each category. Unless otherwise noted, the denominator to determine the percentage of subjects in each category will be based on the number of subjects with available data. Tables summarizing demographics and other baseline characteristics will also include a column for all subjects combined.

Version 4.0 57 19 November 2019 9.4.1. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
All demographic data such as age, sex , race, ethnicity and baseline characteristic data will be 
summarized by treatment group for the Full Analysis Set. Subject disposition will be 
summarized using the Screened Analysis S et.  
Descriptions of medical history findings will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version  21.1 (or later) . Medical history may be summarized in the 
descending order of overall frequency, by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the lates t version of World Health 
Organization Drug  Dictionary . The number and percentage of subjects receiving prior or 
concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group . 
9.4.2. Efficacy  Analyses 
Statistical analysis of efficacy endpoints will be for descrip tive purposes only.  Nominal p-values 
will be based on statistical tests will be 2 -sided hypothesis tests performed at the 10%  level of 
significance for main effects. All confidence intervals will be 2 -sided  90% confidence intervals, 
unless stated otherwise.  When summarizing diary data by visit, including weekly response 
endpoints, only the data from the 7 days prior to the subje ct’s clinic visit will be included.  
9.4.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Response efficacy endpoints from Week 1 through Week 12 will be analyzed using the 
Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel risk difference estimate. The estimated difference in the proportion of 
responders and 90% confidence interval for the difference will be calculated using the 
Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel risk difference estimate stratified by baseline abdominal pain 
(< 6 vs ≥ 6) with weights proposed b y Greenland and Robins.  
For the analysis of other continuous endpoints ( eg, change from baseline at Week  12), a mixed 
model for repeated measure s with restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used  by 
incorporating on treatment- values at all time points . The analysis model for the efficacy 
endpoint will include terms for treatment, visit, baseline score, and interaction of visit by treatment. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment for denominator degrees of freedom 
will be used with restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood to make statistical inference.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.4.2.2. PRO Analyses  
Details of PRO analyses wil l be provided in the SAP. 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 58 19 November 2019 9.4.2.3. Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Details of exploratory efficacy analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
9.4.2.4. Multiplicity Adjustment 
No formal multiplicity adjustment will be performed.  All efficacy analyses will be considered 
descriptive .  Ninety-percent confidence intervals will be provided for each treatment group and 
nominal p-values from comparisons to placebo may be provided for descriptive purposes.  The nominal p- values will be tested using a hierarchical testing strategy using 2-sided tests with 
significant level α = 0.10 .  Nominal p -values will be provided for all secondary efficacy analys es 
as a measure of the strength of the associat ion between the endpoint and the treatment effect 
rather than formal tests of hypotheses.  
9.4.3. Safety Analyses 
The safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set and will be fully defined in the SAP. The safety parameters will include AEs and clinical laboratory and vital sign parameters. For each safety parameter of the clinical laboratory and vital sign  parameters, the last 
non-- missing safety assessment before the first dose of double-blind study drug will be used as 
the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter . 
9.4.3.1. Adverse Events  
An AE will be considered a treatment- emergent AE (TEAE) if:  
• The AE began on or after the date of the first dose of study drug; or 
• The AE was present before the date of the first dose of study drug, but increased in severity or became serious on or after the date of the first dose of study drug 
An AE that occurs more than 14 days after the last dose of study drug will not be counted as a TEAE.  
An AE will be considered a treatment- emergent SAE (TESAE) if it is a TEAE  that additionally 
meets any SAE criteria.  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA version 21.1 (or later). An overall summary table of AEs by treatment group will be presented with number and percentage of subjects. The incidence of all TEAEs by primary  SOC and PT  will be prepared for all TEAEs, serious TEAEs , 
treatment - related TEAEs , treatment- related serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
from study drug , AESIs,  and all TEAEs by maximum intensity. All AEs will be listed , with a 
flag designating AEs that are treatment emergent.

All continuous safety laboratory parameters will be summarized descriptively by absolute value 
at each visit by treatment group, together with the corresponding changes from baseline. Central laboratory reference ranges will be used to identify abnormalities with low, normal or high.  
9.4.3.3. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics of observed values and change from baselin e for vital signs will be 
presented for each treatment group by visit.

10.3. Appendix 3: Adver se Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording , Evaluating , Follow-up , and Reporting 
Definition of AE 
AE Definition 
An AE is any untoward medical occur rence in a c linical study subject , temporally 
associated with the u se of study diug , whether or not considered related to the study diug. 
An AE can ther efore be any unfavorab le and unintended sign ( inclu ding an abnonnal 
laborato1y finding), symp tom, or disease (new or exace rbated) temporally associated with 
the use of study diug. 
AE of Special Intere st 
An AES! (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and m edical conce rn specific to the 
Spon sor's study di11 g or prog ram, which wanants ongoing mo nitoring and rapid 
commun ication by the Investigato r to the Sponsor or designee . Such an event might 
wanant further investigation in order to ch aracte rize and understand it. See Section 8.4.7 
for AESis defined for this study. 
Event s Meeting the AE Definition 
• Any abnonnal laborato1y test results (hem atology, clinical chemistiy, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assess ments ( eg, ECGs, radiolog ical scans , vital signs measuremen ts), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significa nt in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progressio n of 
underlying disease) 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intennittent pre-exist ing conditio n includi ng eith er an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New conditio n detected or diagnosed after study diug adininisu-atio n even thou gh it 
may have been present before the staii of the s tudy 
• Signs , symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected diug -diug interactio n 
• Signs , symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study di11 g 
or a concomitant medicatio n. For this study, repo1i all overdose eve nts wit hin 
24 hours of awareness by the study site, using the Overdose eCRF , whether or n ot the 
overdose is assoc iated with an AE. 
• L ack of efficacy or failure of expected phaimaco logical actio n per se will not be 
repo1ied as an AE or SAE . Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assess ments. Howeve r, the signs, symptoms, an d/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as AEs or SAEs if they fulfill the definition of an AE 
or SAE. Any worsening of diaiTh ea or constipation and any n ew onset of constipatio n 
in IBS-D subjects shou ld be collected as AEs. 
Versio n 4.0 68 19 Nove mber 2019 
Urovant Confidential Protocol UR0- 901-2001 
Event s NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
• Abnonnal screening laborato 1 y values, inclu ding fecal calprotectin , C-reactive 
protein, etc. 
• Any clinically significant abno1mal laborat01y findin gs or other abno1mal safety 
assess ments that are associated with the underlying disease , unless judged by the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subj ect's condition. Merely 
repeat ing an abno1mal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE. Any abnonnal test result that is dete1 mined to be an enor does not 
require record ing as an AE. 
• The disease /disorder being studied or expected signs , or symptoms ( clearly defined) 
of the disease /disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject's conditio n. 
• Medical or surgical proced ure (eg, endoscopy, appendecto my) the condition that 
leads to th e proced ure is the AE. 
• Situatio ns in which an untoward medical occunence did not occur (social an d/or 
convenience admiss ion to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease( s) or condition( s) prese nt 
or detected at the staii of the study that do not worse n. 
Definition of SAE 
SAEs must meet both the AE criter ia described above and the seriousness criteria listed below. 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life-threatening 
The te1m life-threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetica lly Inight have caused death, if it were more severe. 
C. Require s inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing ho spitalization 
In gene ral, hospita lizatio n signi fies that the su bject has been admitted to the h ospital or 
kept in the Emergency Room for ~ 24 hours for observatio n and/o r treatment th at would 
not h ave been approp riate in the ph ysician's office or outpatie nt setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalizat ion are AEs. If a complicatio n prolongs hospita lizatio n or 
fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to wh ether 
hospitalizat ion occuned or was necessa 1y, the AE shou ld be considered serious. 
Hospitalizatio n for elective intervention of a pre-exist ing conditio n that did not worse n 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
Versio n 4.0 69 19 Nove mber 2019 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 70 19 November 2019 d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent activities of daily living  but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
f. Other situations:  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death  or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such medically significant events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment with a  drug in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abus e.
 
Urovant Confidential Protocol UR0- 901-2001 
Recordin2 and Follow-Up of AEs and SAEs 
AE and SAE Recording 
• When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigato r to review all 
documentation ( eg, hospital pro gress notes, laborato1y repo1is, and diagnostics 
repo1is) related to the event. 
• The Investigato r will then record all relevant AE or SAE inform ation in the eCRF 
page. 
• A ll SAEs (includin g serious AESis) must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours 
of the study site personnel's knowledge of the event , regardless of the Investigator 
assess ment of the relati onship of the event to study diug. 
-The event te1m , sta1i date, severity, and initial causality assessment must be 
entered in the AE eCRF page and the event must be marked as "Serio us". This 
will activate additional assess ment fields inclu ding "actio n taken with study 
di11g" , "seriousn ess criteria", and "brief description " which sho uld be completed 
as soon as infonn ation is available. Marking the event as "serious" will 
automatically send required notifications for Sponsor or designee review. 
-The initial SAE repo1i should inclu de: 
o The date of the repo1i 
o A description of the SAE ( event tenn , seriousness of the event , date of 
onset, intensity) 
o Causal relatio nship to the s tudy diug 
- A discharge summai y should be provided for all hospitaliz ations. If the subject 
died, the repo1i should include the cause of death as the event te1m (with death as

An event is defined as serious when it m eets at least one of the predefined criteria as 
described in the definiti on of an SAE , NOT when it is rated as seve re. 
Assess ment of Causality 
The Investigator is obligated to assess the re lations hip betwee n stu dy drng and each 
occmTence of each AE or SAE. 
A reason able possibility of a rel ationship conveys that there are facts, evide nce, and/o r 
argume nts to su gges t a causal relationsh ip, rather than a relatio nship cannot be rnled out. 
The Investigator will use c linical judgme nt to determin e the rel ationship. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying dis ease( s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
facto rs, as well as the tem poral relationship of the event to study drng admini stration will 
be considered and investigated. 
The Investigator will also consult the Investigator 's Brochure and/or product information, 
for marketed products, in his/her assessmen t. 
For each AE or SAE, the Investigator !!!!!.U document in the m edical notes that he/she h as 
reviewed the AE or SAE and h as provided an assessment of causality. 
There m ay be si tuations in which an SAE has occmTed and the Investigator has minim al 
info1mation to include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the 
Inve stigator alwa ys make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial tran smission of the SAE to the Spon sor or designee. 
The Investigator may chan ge his/her opi nion of causality in light of follow-up 
info1mation and send an SAE follow-up repo1 i with the u pdated causality assessment. 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when detenninin g regulato1 y

Version 4.0 78 19 November 2019 10.6. Appendix 6: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile.  Women in the following categories are not considered wo men of 
child bearing potential:  
• Premenopausal woman  with 1 of the following:  
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the subject ’s medica l 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal woman  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
- Women  on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation o f postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
10.6.1. Contracept ion Guidance  
Women  of child bearing potential must agree to use (or have their male partner use) a highly 
effective contraception method, unless any of the following apply: 
• Has reached natural menop ause, defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause;  
• Is permanently sterile, following hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral 
oophorectomy. 
Highly effective methods of contraception include the following:  
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, which may be oral, intravaginal or transdermal  
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, which may be oral, injectable, or implantable intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 79 19 November 2019 • Bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as Essure™ at 
least 6 months prior to the initial Screening Visit [subject s with Essure must have prior 
confirmation of tubal occlusion by hysterosalpingogram])  
• Sexual partner(s) who was documented to be vasectomized at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit  
• Sexual abstinence from heterosexual intercourse  
Subjects will  be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
informed consent process and will confirm when they sign an ICF that they understand the 
requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study.  
These meth ods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly, and in 
accordance with the product label. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects 
understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. 
10.6.2. Pregnancy Testing  and Reporting  
10.6.2.1. Pregnancy Testing  
Women of childbearing potential  should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and 
a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test  at Screening , Baseline ( Visit 3, prior to dosing), 
and at Week 12 or Early Withdrawal. A serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin test must be 
performed if the urine test is positive.  
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected.  
10.6.2.2. Reporting Pregnancy   
The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any subject  who becomes pregnant while 
participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the dedicated pregnancy reporting 
form and submitted to the Sponsor or designee within  24 hours  of le arning of a subject ’s 
pregnancy. The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject  and the neonate, and the 
information will be forwarded to  the Sponsor or designee. Generally, follow-up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
While pr egnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication will 
be reported as an  AE or SAE.  A spontaneous or elective abortion is always considered to be an 
SAE  and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy- related SAE considered reasonably 
related to the study drug by the Investigator will be reported using the eCRF  as described in 
Urovant Confidential Protocol URO-901-2001 
 
Version 4.0 80 19 November 2019 Section  10.3 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former 
study subject s, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any subject  who becomes pregnant while participating in the study  will discontinue study drug 
and be withdrawn from the study .

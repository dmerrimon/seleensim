  1  1. RCT Details This section provides a high-level overview of the RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.   1.1 Title Prasugrel versus Clopidogrel in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRITON–TIMI 38 trial)  1.2 Intended aim(s)  To compare prasugrel, a new thienopyridine, with clopidogrel, we randomly assigned 13,608 patients with moderate-to-high-risk acute coronary syndromes with scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention to receive prasugrel (a 60-mg loading dose and a 10-mg daily maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (a 300-mg loading dose and a 75-mg daily maintenance dose), for 6 to 15 months.  1.3 Primary endpoint for replication and RCT finding  The primary efficacy end point was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The key safety end point was major bleeding.  1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable)  We calculated that a total of 875 primary end points would be required for the study to have a 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the relative risk of the primary end point among patients with unstable angina or non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction receiving prasugrel, as compared with clopidogrel.  1.5 Primary trial estimate targeted for replication HR = 0.81 (95% CI 0.73–0.90) comparing prasugrel to clopidogrel (Wiviott et al., 2007)  2.

 4  5. Cohort Identification   5.1 Cohort Summary This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing prasugrel 90mg to clopidogrel 75mg. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180 days before initiation of prasugrel 90mg or a comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation.   5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  New users (defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified.  5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates Market availability of prasugrel in the U.S. started on 2009-07-10.       • For Marketscan: 2009-07-10 to 2017-12-31 (end of data availability).  • For Optum: 2009-07-10 to 2019-03-31 (end of data availability).  5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date  Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.    5.3 Flowchart of the study cohort assembly   Optum MarketScan  Less Excluded Patients Remaining Patients Less Excluded Patients Remaining Patients All patients   75,524,500   191,990,035 Patients meeting the cohort entry criteria of moderate to high risk Acute Coronary Syndrome undergoing PCI procedure  -75219388 305,112 -191556394 433,641 Patients with sufficient enrollment period in the claims database -41910 263,202 -120017 313,624 Patients with moderate to high risk Acute Coronary Syndrome  -144114 119,088 -165792 147,832 Patients initiating clopidogrel 75mg or prasugrel 10mg within 14 days of discharge of PCI hospitalization  -56497 62,591 -54511 93,321

Variables   6.1 Exposure-related variables:   Study drug:  The study exposure of interest is initiation of Prasugrel. Initiation will be defined by no use of Prasugrel or a comparator in the prior 6 months before treatment initiation (washout period).

 6 Comparator agents: • Initiators of prasugrel 10mg will be compared to initiators of- o Clopidogrel 75mg  6.2 Preliminary covariates: • Age • Sex • Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to and including index date  Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:   6.3.1 Outcome variables  Effectiveness outcomes of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A):  • Primary outcome: 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), i.e., non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or CV mortality • Secondary outcomes: Individual components: o Hospital admission for MI (for purposes of this individual component, fatal MI is included) o Hospital admission for stroke (for purposes of this individual component, fatal stroke is included) o All-cause mortality/CV mortality: § All-cause inpatient mortality identified using discharge status codes will be used as a proxy for “CV mortality” in Marketscan § In Optum, all-cause inpatient mortality + all-cause mortality for Medicare Advantage patients is used  Control outcome of interest (control outcome only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further interpreted):

 8   6.3.2 Study follow-up Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.   For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of prasugrel and comparator and will continue until the earliest date of the following events: • The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  • The date of end of continuous registration in the database, • End of the study period, • Measured death event occurs, • Nursing home admission o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for cohorts for the same reason. • The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (prasugrel and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 30 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses). •  The date of augmentation or switching from an exposure to a comparator  • Initiation of ticagrelor   For the ITT analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 365 days.   7.

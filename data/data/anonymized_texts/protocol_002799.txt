Evaluate the Safet y and Tolerab ility of Oral OPC -34712 as 
Adju nctive Thera py in Adults with Major Depressive 
Disorder , the Orion Trial
Clinical Phase: 3
Treatment Indication: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
Objective(s): Primary :  To assess the long -term safety  and tolerability  of oral 
OPC -34712 (hereafter referred to b y the generic name 
“brexpiprazole”) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
adults with MDD.
Secondary :  To assess the long- term efficacy  of oral 
brexpiprazole as adjunctive therap y in the treatment of adults 
with MDD.
Trial Design: This isa multicenter, 26-week , open -label trial designed to 
assess the long
-term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of 
adjunctive brexpiprazole in depressed adults on concurrent 
antidepressant therap y (ADT ).  The trial will be conducted on 
an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into th e trialwill be drawn 
from eligible subjects who have completed the last scheduled 
visit of adouble -blind ,phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trialand 
who, in the investigator’s judgment, could potentially  benefit 
from adjunctive treatmen t with oral brexpiprazole for MDD.
The original 52 week open- label trial design has been modified 
in this Amendment 3 to shorten the duration of the trial to 26 
weeks ;
ongoing subjects who have not re ached their Week 26 
visit will be re-consented and will follow Amendment 3 
schedu le of assessments.  Ongoing subjects who have alread y 
completed their Week 26 visit at the time of Amend
ment 3 
will follow Amendment 3 week 26/ET schedule of 
assessments at their next scheduled visit.
The trialwill be organized as follows:
Screening/Basel ine:  Subjects will be screened for eligibility  at 
the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 
trial.  
Subjects will sign a separate informed consent form for 
participation in Trial 331-10- 238 before an y procedures 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 3 13Jun 2014specific to the open -label trialare performed.  The assessments 
from the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 
trial will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-10-238 
for an y assessment that is not unique to the open -label trial.  
Medical history  will be u pdated, if necessary .
Treatment Phase:   Eligible subjects will receive daily  
treatment with open -label brexpiprazole and ADT as described 
intheInvestigational Medicinal Product, Dose, Formulation, 
Mode of Administration section.  V isits will occur at the end 
of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26.  
All subjects will receive 
up to 26weeks of open -label treatment in Trial 331-10-
238.
Follow -up:  
Subjects will be followed for safety  via telep hone 
contact or clinic visit 30 (+2)days after the last dose of ope
n-
label medication.
Subject Population: The subject population will consist of eligible subjects who, in 
the investigator’s judgment, could potentially  benefit from 
adjunctive treatment with brexpiprazole for MDD accor ding to 
the following criteria:
Subjects who partic ipated i n Trial 331-10-227,
Trial 331-10-228 or 331-13 -214 will be eligible for the 
331-10-238 trial if they  meet one of the following 
conditions:
Subjects who completed participation in the 
double -blind randomization phase (ie, Week 14 visit of 
Phase B) in Trial 331 -
10-227,  Trial 331-10-228 or 
Trial 331-
13-214 or
Subjects who continued into Phase A+ (were not 
randomized into Phase B) at the end of prospective 
treatment (ie, Week 8 visit of Phase A) in 
Trial 331-10-227, Trial 331 -10-228 or
Trial331-
13-214, BUT DID NOT meet criteria for 
remission (defined as a Montgomery  Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale Total Score of 10) at the 
Week 14 visit of Phase A+ in Trial 331 -10-
227, Trial 
331-10-228 or Trial 331-13-214.
Subjects who participated in a nother double -blind phase 3 
brexpiprazole MDD trial will be eligible for 331-10-238 
Trial 
if they  have completed the last scheduled visit of the 
prior double -blind phase 3 trial .
Subjects must qualify  for Trial 331-10- 238 at the last 
scheduled visit of th
e prior double -blind phase 3 trial and 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 4 13Jun 2014must be able to continue therap y without interruption 
between the double- blind and open label trials.  Based on 
the projected enrollment estimates for the prior 
double -blind phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trials, up to
approximately 3,000 subjects may enroll into 
Trial 331-10-238.
Investigational 
Medicinal Product, 
Dose, Formulation,
Mode of 
Administration:Trial medication (ie, investigational medicinal product [ IMP]) 
will be provided to the investigator(s) b y the sponsor (or 
designated agent ) and will consist of open- label brexpiprazole
and open -label ADTs.
Brexpiprazole :  Open -label brexpiprazole will be supplied as 
0.5, 1, 2, and 3- mg tablets packaged in weekl y blister cards, 
each contain ing sufficient tablets for 7 (+ 2 days).  Blister
cards will be dispensed at each scheduled visit and at 
unscheduled visits if the dose of brexpiprazole is changed.  All 
doses of brexpiprazole
should be taken orally  once daily  and 
can be administered without regard to meals.  For 
conveni ence, brexpiprazole may be taken with the first dail y 
dose of ADT.
All subjects will be dosed as follows:
The first dose of open -label brexpiprazole will be taken one 
day after the last dose 
is taken for the prior double -blind , 
phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trialso that adjunctive 
treatment will continue without interruption.  I t is 
anticipated that the last dose of the double- blind, phase 3 
brexpiprazole MDD trial will be taken the day  ofthe last 
scheduled visit, ie, the day  of the Screening/Baseline visit 
for the open -label trial.  Subjects will initiate open -label 
dosing with brexpiprazole 0.5 mg/day  for 1 week.  Subjects 
unable to tolerate brexpiprazole 0.5mg/day  must be 
withdrawn from the trial.
The dose of brexpiprazole will be increased to 1mg/day  at 
the Week 1 visit.  Subjects unable to tolerate brexpiprazole 
1mg/day  may  decrease to 0.5 mg/day  at any  time after the 
Week 1 visit.
Investigators may  further increase 
the dose to brexpiprazole 
2 mg/day  and then to brexpiprazole 3mg/day , with an 
interval of at least 5 day sbetween dose increases .  An 
interval of at least 5 day sbetween dose adjustments is 
recommended for dose decreases; however, the dose of 
brexpiprazole can be decreased at the investigator’s 
discretion in a step -wise manner at any  time after the 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 5 13Jun 2014Week 1 visit as needed for tolerability  to a minimum of 
0.5mg/day .  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made 
based upon the clinical judgment of the investigator as it 
relates to tolerability  and therapeutic response.
Subjects who tolerate a reduc ed dose of brexpiprazole 
0.5mg/day  should be rechallenged with brexpiprazole 
1mg/day  
at least once during the trial.  In addition, t he
dose of brexpiprazole can be re -escalated as necessary  
following a nydose decrease if, in the investigator’s 
judgment, rechallenge with a higher dose is warranted in 
order to identify  an optimum dose for the subject.  Subjects 
must return to the clinic for unscheduled visit s if changes to 
the dose of brexpiprazole (increases or decreases) are 
required between scheduled vis
its.
ADT:  During the Treatment Phase of Trial 331 -
10-238,
subjects will remain on the same assigned open -label ADT 
from the prior double -blind , phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trial.  
The initial dose of ADT will be the same as the ADT dose 
taken on the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind 
phase 3 trial .  It is recommended that the dose of ADT not be 
changed while the dose of brexpiprazole is being optimized 
(ie, no change to A DT up to and including the Week 4 visit).  
After the Week 4 visit , the dose of ADT can be modified if 
necessary  to achieve optimum efficacy  and tolerability  for the 
treatment regimen using the following rules:  1) at least 5 day s
must elapse between dose increases (either brexpiprazole or 
ADT), 2) an interval of at least 5 day s between dose 
adjustments (either brexpiprazole or ADT) is recommended 
for dose decreases; however, the ADT dose can be decreased 
at the investigator’s discretion at an y time as needed for 
tolerability , and 3) subjects must return to the clinic for 
unschedul ed visits if changes to the ADT dose are required 
between scheduled visits.
ADTs for open -
label treatment will be provided in commercial 
packaging (eg, bottles), with additional labeling for use in this 
trial, as necessary  to fulfill regulatory  requirement s.  
Numbered ADT bottles to be dispensed to the subject will be 
assigned b y the IVRS or IWRS.  The ADTs to be used in this 
trial, including allowable doses within the therapeutic range, 
are as follows:
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors:

60mg/day
Venlafaxine XR (Effexor XR) extended- release (XR) 
capsules, 75, 150, and 225 mg/day
All doses of ADT will be administered orall y once daily  
except for duloxetine 40 mg/day  that can be administered once 
daily  or as duloxetine 20 mg twice daily , duloxetine 60 mg/day  
that can be administered once dail y or as duloxetine 30 mg 
twice dail y,and fluoxetine 40 mg/day that can be administered 
once dail y or in divided doses twice dail y.  All A DTs can be 
given without regard to meals, except for venlafaxine XR 
which should be taken with food.  Subjects should be 
instructed to take the ADT at approximately  the same time 
each day , if possible.
Criteria for 
Evaluation:Primary  Outcome Variable:
The primary  outcome variable is the safet y and tolerability  of 
brexpiprazole which will be assessed b y examining the 
frequency  and severit y of adverse events (AEs).
Secondary  Outcome Variables:
Efficacy :  Efficacy  variables will be as follows:
Change from ba seline in Clinical Global I mpression -
Severity  of Illness scale score;
Mean Clinical Global Impre ssion -Improvement scale 
score;
Change from baseline in Sheehan Disability  Scale score.
Change from baseline in the Inventory  of Depressive 
Symptomatology  (Self-Report )Total Score
Safet y:  In addition to AEs, safet y variables to be examined in 
this trialwill include physical examinations, vital signs, bod y 
weight, waist circumference, clinical laboratory  tests 
(hematology , serum chemistry , urinal ysis, and pr egnancy  
tests), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) .  In general, descriptive 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 7 13Jun 2014statistics of changes from baseline will be provided for safety 
variables based on all available data.  Prospectively  defined 
criteria will be used to identify  potentially  clinically  relevant 
abnormal values for clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, ECGs, 
and body  weight.  Change from baseline in body  mass index 
(derived programmatically from body  weight and height 
measurements) will be summarized.  In addition to the anal ysis 
of standard safet y variables, other safet y variables including 
the Simpson Angus Scale, the Abnormal Involuntary  
Movement Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale , the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale ,and the 
Massachusetts General Hospital S exual Functioni ng 
Questionnaire will also be evaluated.
Other Outcomes:   
Responses to the Resource Utilization F orm 
(RUF) will be summarized appropriatel y to explore the impact 
of treatment on health care resources.
Trial Duration: The duration of this trial from first subject enrolled to last 
subject completed is estimated to be approximately  57months, 
of which approximately  51months are allotted for rollover of 
subjects from the prior double -blind phase 3 brexpiprazole 
MDD trials.  Individual participation for subjec ts who 
complete the trialwithout earlywithdrawal will be 
approximately  30weeks ( 26 weeks of treatment and 30 -day 
follow -up).

Confidential -Proprietary Information 19 13Jun 20141 Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and chronic illness characterized b y a 
broad spectrum of emotional and ph ysical s ymptoms.  Despite the availability  of 
numerous treatments (eg, pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral psychother apy, 
electroconvulsive therapy [ECT], etc.), achievement of consistent and favorable 
long-term outcomes still represents an unmet medical need.  For patients who experience 
an initial major depressive episode, the probability of experiencing another episod e at 
some point in the future can be as high as 85%.1  In addition, 15% of patients may  endure 
chronic s ymptoms after the first episode, while 35% may  experience recurrent episodes.2  
Remission rates are low for initial antidepressant monotherapy  treatment (less than 30%) 
and partial response is common.3
  Incomplete response to treatment for MDD is 
associated with an increased risk of relapse , 4,5impaired social and occupational 
functioning,6 and consequently , an increased eco nomic burden.7, 8  Practice guidelines 
emphasize the importance of adequate treatment for MDD, including continuation of 
pharmacotherap y after an initial res ponse is achieved to prevent relapse and maintenance 
treatment in individuals at risk of recurrence.9  Augmentation of ADT with agents such 
as lithium, thy roid hormone, anticonvulsants, or psy chostimulants has a lso been explored 
as a possible means of achieving a more robust response to treatment.
Antipsy chotics have been used in combination with antidepressants for treatment of 
psychotic or delusional forms of depression.  However, the use of antipsychotics as 
adjunctive therapy  for non- psychotic depression has been limited due to safety  concerns, 
specificall y, the potential for extrap yramidal s ymptoms (EPS), hy perprolactinemia, 
weight gain, and excessive sedation.  The introduction of at ypical antips ychotics has
created a renewed interest in adjunctive therap y for MDD, particularl y for 
treatment -
resistant MDD.  Although initial studies produced mixed results, several 
atypical antips ychotics have been shown to enhance the response to ADT .10,11,12,13,14
OPC -34712 (hereafter refe rred to by  the generic name “brexpiprazole”) is an organic 
compound sy nthesized by  Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co, L td, that is a  at 
, , and , an

 and .  Details of the receptor affinity  profile of 
brexpiprazole are summarized in Section 1.1.1
.  Activity  at dopamine and serotonin 
receptors has been shown to be useful in the treatment of psy chiatric disorders, eg, 

Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 20 13Jun 2014schizophrenia and bipolar mania.  Hence, brexpiprazole is expected to be a promising 
antipsy chotic agent.  As the relative activity  at these and other receptors appears to be 
related to the side effect profiles of antips ychotic drugs,15,16,17,18brexpiprazole may have 
the potential to exhibit improved safety  compared to other agents.  The more potent 
antagonism at 5 -HT2A receptors for brexpiprazole relative to aripiprazole may  afford a 
more favorable profile with respect to sleep quality ; whereas, the low binding affinities 
for histamine and muscarinic receptors suggest that brexpiprazole may have less potential 
to cause H1 -receptor -related weight gain than olanzapine.  Preclinical data also suggest 
that 
brexpiprazole will h ave lower potential for hyperprolactinemia than risperidone.  
Results from initial phase 2 trials showed brexpiprazole to be well tolerated by subjects 
with MDD and schizophrenia (see Section 1.3).
1.1 Nonclini cal Studies
Efficacy  and safet y pharmacology are summarized in Section 1.1.1 and Section 1.1.2.  A 
complete description of the available data from nonclinic al studies, including 
pharmacokinetic and toxicology  studies in different animal species can be found in the 
Investigator Brochure.19
1.1.1 Efficacy  Pharmacology
Brexpiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the D2 receptor.  In in vitro assay  systems 
based on forskolin
-induced cy clic AMP accumulation and calcium (Ca2+) mobilization in 
human dopamine D2L receptor- expressing cells, its intrinsic activity  at the D2 receptor 
was slightl y lower than that of aripiprazo le, another D2 receptor partial agonist.  
Brexpiprazole inhibited apomorphine (APO) -induced hy perlocomotion, APO -induced 
stereot yped behavior, and conditioned avoidance response in rats, which are predictive 
animal models for antipsy chotic -like efficacy .  The inhibitory  effects of brexpiprazole
were more potent than those of aripiprazole.  Moreover, in contrast to the D2 receptor 
antagonist risperidone, brexpiprazole did not increase plasm
a prolactin levels in 
reserpine -treated rats, thus demonstrating a D2 receptor partial agonistic profile in vivo.  
Despite its lower intrinsic activity  at the D2 receptor, the in vivo cataleps y liability  of 
brexpiprazole , an index of EPS, was similar to that of aripiprazole, but still lower than 
that of the typical antips ychotic haloperidol.  Furthermore, brexpiprazole showed high 
binding affinity  for the 5 -HT2A receptor and dose -dependentl y inhibited 
()-2,5- dimethoxy -4-iodoamphetamine- induced head twitch response in rats, indicating 
that the compound has 5 -HT2A receptor an tagonistic activity ; the effect of brexpiprazole
was more potent than that of aripiprazole.  In addition, brexpiprazole exhibited high 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 21 13Jun 2014binding affinities for the D3 and 5 -HT1A receptors, acting as a partial agonist at these 
receptors.
1.1.2 Safety  Pharmacology
In safet y pharmacology studies in rats at an oral dose of 30 mg/kg or higher, 
brexpiprazole induced pharmacologically  mediated clinical signs considered to be due to 
depression of the central nervous s ystem (CNS) and dose -dependent decreases in body  
tempera ture.  When orally  administered at up to 30 mg/kg in conscious male beagle dogs, 
brexpiprazole showed no effect on respiratory  parameters or heart rate at any  dose tested.  
Brexpiprazole decreased blood pressure at doses of 3 mg/kg or higher and prolonged both 
QT interval and corrected QT interval (QTc, b y Van de Water’s formula) at 30 mg/kg.  
Brexpiprazole inhibited human ether -a-go-go related gene (hERG) current in Chinese 
hamster ovary  cells (CHO -K1) at concentrations of 10−
8mol/L  or higher, with a 50% 
inhibitory  concentration of 1.17  10−7mol/L .  The mechanism for the blood pressure 
decreasing effect of brexpiprazole was suggested to result from a blockade of the 
1-adrenoceptor in peripheral blood vessels, which is a part of the compound’s 
pharmacolo gical profile.  Proarrh ythmic risk was also evaluated b y examining the effects 
of brexpiprazole on monophasic action potential parameters in halothane- anesthetized 
dogs.  Brexpiprazole did not affect the terminal repolarization period even at an 
intravenou
s dose of 3 mg/kg, suggesting a low potential for proarrhy thmic effects.  In 
general, the changes in the CNS, respiratory ,and cardiovascular s ystems observed with 
brexpiprazole occurred at doses or exposure levels higher than those at which efficacy  
was c onfirmed in rats (3 mg/kg), and similar changes were shown to occur after 
administration of risperidone at similar or lower doses.
1.2 Clinical Studies
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of brexpiprazole was studied in 
healthy  subjects and in subjects with MDD, attention -deficit/hy peractivity  disorder 
(ADHD), and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Based on preclinical data and 
human clinical trials, brexpiprazole (OPC -34712) and one metabolite, DM-3411, were 
identified as the major analy tes that are present in human plasma.  In vitro, the activity  of 
DM-3411 is 17 times lower than that of brexpiprazole and thus is considered as an 
inactive metabolite.  Both brexpiprazole and DM -3411 pharmacokinetics were linear 
following single oral doses of brexpiprazole 0.2 to 8 mg to health y subjects .  The 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 22 13Jun 2014terminal phase elimination half -life of brexpiprazole and DM -3411 was 48.3 to 
80.8 hours and 48.6 to 77.5 hours, respectively .  The median time to maximum (peak) 
plasma concentration (t max) occurred at approximately  2 to 6 hours postdose for 
brexpiprazole and at approximately  10 to 24 hours postdose for DM- 3411.  In healthy  
subjects, administration of single -dose brexpiprazole with a high -fat meal did not affect 
its ra te and extent of absorption.
Steady  state pharmacokinetics also appeared to be linear following multiple daily  doses 
of brexpiprazole in the range of 0.5 to 2 mg to healthy  subjects.  The accumulation factor 
based on maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C max) and area under the 
concentration -time curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t (AUC t) 
was approximately  4 times.  After multiple dose administration of brexpiprazole (1 to 
12mg/day ) to subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffect ive disorder, brexpiprazole and 
DM-3411 mean terminal elimination half -life at steady  state was 95.4 and 89.3 hours, 
respectivel y; median t maxwas 3.0 and 8.0 hours, respectivel y.
In drug interaction trials in healthy  subjects, brexpiprazole was shown to b e metabolized 
by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isozy mes and was not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, 
CYP2D6, or P- glycoprotein.  Coadministration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors 
with brexpiprazole resulted in about a 2 -fold higher exposure and about a 1.5 -fold 
increase in the terminal elimination half life of brexpiprazole .  Of note, administration of
brexpiprazole with fluoxetine, paroxetine , or duloxetine (MDD medications 
coadministered in this trial) may  potentiall y increase brexpiprazole plasma concentrations 
by up to 2- fold.
In a single -dose trial in healthy  subjects, approximately  46.0% and 24.6% of 
administered radioactivity following an oral dose of 14C-brexpiprazole was excreted in 
feces and urine , respectively .  In this same trial, brexpiprazole did not p referentially  bind 
to red blood cells.  Brexpiprazole showed high protein binding in human serum 
(99.8%) in vitro.
The binding of brexpiprazole to dopamine receptors was assessed using positron 
emission tomograph y (PET).  The mean D2/D3 receptor occupanc ies at 4 and 24 hours 
postdose after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 mg single dose administration of brexpiprazole
to healthy  subjects were 11.4% to 17.4%, 36.5% to 46.3%, 45.6% to 60.2%, 52.7% to 
68.6%, 67.9% to 79.5%, 71.9% to 88.2%, and 69.5% to 92.6%, re spectively  
(Trial 331-
07-202).  Based on the single -dose D2/D3 receptor occupancy  data and 
stead y
-state pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic modeling, it was predicted that the 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 23 13Jun 2014D2/D3 receptor occupancy  after multiple daily  dose administration of 1 to 2 mg and 
higher doses of brexpiprazole will result in at least 80% to 90% D2/D3 receptor 
occupancy .

its metabolites in humans can be found in the Investigator Broc
hure.19
1.2.2 Major Depressive Disorder
The efficacy  of brexpiprazole as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of MDD has been 
studied in one completed placebo -controlled trial ( Trial 331-08- 211).  An additional 
placebo- controlled ef ficacy  trial ( Trial 331-09- 222) and one long -term open -label safet y 
trial ( Trial 331-08- 212) are ongoing.  Trial 331 -08-211 was a multicenter, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to assess the safety  and efficacy  of 
brexpiprazole (0.15 to 2 mg dail y) as adjunctive treatment to an assigned open -label ADT 
in subjects with MDD who have demonstr ated an incomplete response to prospective 
treatment with the same ADT.  Subjects with an incomplete response after 8 weeks of 
treatment with sin gle-blind placebo plus open -label ADT were randomized to 6 weeks of 
double -blind treatment with either brexpiprazole -plus- ADT or placebo- plus-ADT.  
Responders continued to receive placebo- plus- ADT for an additional 6 weeks.  
Randomized subjects received brexpiprazole 0.15 mg/day , 0.50 0.25 mg/day, 
1.50.50 mg/day , or matching placebo.  Subjects randomized to the brexpiprazole 
0.500.25 mg/day  and brexpiprazole 1.5 0.50 mg/day  arms were titrated to the target 
doses (0.50 and 1.5 mg, respectivel y) ove r a 2-week period.  Dose adjustments were 
permitted after the subjects received 1 week of treatment at the target dose.  Subjects who 
could not tolerate the lowest dose ( brexpiprazole 0.15, 0.25, or 1.0mg/day or matching 
placebo, respectivel y) were to be discontinued from the trial .  In this trial, adjunctive 
brexpiprazole dosed at 1.5 0.50 mg/day  was superior to adjunctive placebo with respect 
to the primary  endpoint (change from Week 8 to Week 14 in Montgomery Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] Tot al Score) and several secondary  efficacy  
endpoints.20  Ongoing Trial 331-09- 222 is of similar design to Trial 331 - 08-211, but is 
exploring an expanded dose range ( brexpiprazole 1 to 3 mg/day ).
1.2.3 Schizophrenia
Adose-ranging, placebo -controlled trial for the monotherap y treatment of adults with 
schizophrenia has been performed in subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of 
schizophrenia (Trial 331 -07-203).  The outcome of this trial suggests an active dose ran ge 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 24 13Jun 2014of brexpiprazole 1 to 6 mg/day  for the treatment of schizophrenia .21  In addition to the 
double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, a long- term open -label safet y trial 
(Trial 331-08- 210) is ongoing.
1.2.4 Other Ind ications
Brexpiprazole is being investigated in a proof -of
-concept trial in adult ADHD 
(Trial 331-08- 213).  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
flexible -dose trial in which adults with ADHD who have an incomplete/partial re sponse 
to stimulant therapy  in a prospective treatment phase are randomized to double -blind 
treatment with either brexpiprazole -plus
-stimulant or placebo -plus- stimulant.  This trial is 
ongoing; therefore, results are not available.
1.3 Know n and Potential Risks and Benefits
As of 31 Dec 2010, 14 clinical trials involving brexpiprazole have been completed 
worldwide, including 10 in the United States (US), 1 in multiple countries (including the 
US), 2in Japan, and 1 in Korea .  An additional 4 trials are currentl y ongoing (3 in the US
and1 in multiple countries [including the US]).  The collective trials can be classified as 
follows:  four phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) trials in healthy  subjects, 2 drug interaction 
trials in healthy  subjects, one phase 1 PET trialin healthy  subjects, one phase 1b 
polysomnograph ytrial in subjects with schizophrenia, fivephase 1 PK trials in specific 
patient populations, and six phase 2 effi cacy and/or safet y trials.  Brexpiprazole has been 
well tolerated b y health y volunteers at single doses up to 6 mg and at multiple doses up t o 
2mg/day .  In patient trials, brexpiprazole has been well tol erated at multiple doses up to 
12mg/day  in subj ects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , up to 4 mg/day  in 
subjects with MDD who re ceived concomitant ADT, and up to 4 mg/day  in adults with 
ADHD who received concomitant stimulant therapy.
In the 11 completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials performed under the US IND (two phase 
2 trials, one phase 1b trial, and eight phase 1 trials), 673/ 973 (69.2%) subjects who 
received brexpiprazole either alone or coadministered with another marketed medication
reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) compared to 
158/253 (62.5%) subjects who received placebo either alone or coadmini stered with 
another marketed medication .  The most common TEAEs reported for brexpiprazole in 
the completed trials ( 5% in the total 
brexpiprazole group and more than the total 
placebo group ) were headache (10.6%), dizziness (8.0%), anxiety  (7.1%), akathi sia 
(7.0%), and nausea (5.5%).  In the total placebo group, TEAEs that occurred in 5% of 
subjects were headache (9.9%) , insomnia (9.1%), and constipation (5.5%) .
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 25 13Jun 2014One death was reported in the completed phase 2 trial in adults with acute schizophrenia 
(Trial 331-07- 203).  The subject was not on any  investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
at the time of death, and the death was not considered b y the investigator to be related to 
IMP.  The incidence of serious TEAEs (fatal and non- fatal) that were reported d uring 
treatment with brexpiprazole administered either alone or coadministered with another 
medication (19/973 subjects, 2.0%) was comparable to placebo administered either alone 
or coadministered with another medication (4/253 subjects, 1.6%).  Furthermor e, 
treatment with brexpiprazole does not appear to promote suicidal behavior in subjects 
with MDD or schizophrenia.
Brexpiprazole did not result in any  consistent, clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  
values, vital signs (blood pressure or heart rate) , or electrocardiogram ( ECG )parameters 
in the completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in subjects with MDD or schizophrenia.  
Statistically  significant increases in weight were observed with brexpiprazole relative to 
placebo in both sample populations.  Brexpiprazole exhibited a favorable profile with 
respect to movement disorders in sub jects with MDD at doses up to 3 mg/day
(Trial 331-
09-221) and in subjects with schizophrenia at doses up to 12 mg/day
(Trial 331-08- 205).  In the dose -ranging trial that enrolled subjects who were 
experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (Trial 331 -
07-203), an increase in 
the incidence of EPS was observed at the highest dose (ie, brexpiprazole 
5.01.0mg/day ).
Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure fo r a summary  of available nonclinical 
and clinical safet y data.19
Risks associated with use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI s
)and 
serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRI s)used in Trial 331-10-238 can be 
found in the prescribing information for the open -label ADTs .
2 Trial Rationale and Objectives
2.1 Trial Rationale
Investigations of the interactions between serotonin and norepinephrine following 
sustained treatment with SSRI s provid e a pharmacological basis for use of aty pical 
antipsy chotics as an augmentation strategy  in treatment -resistant MDD.  At the cellular 
level, increased serotonergic activity  from prolonged reuptake inhibition appears to 
attenuate the firing of noradrenergic neurons indirectly  through increased activation of 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 26 13Jun 20145-HT2A receptors.22  The resulting decrease in noradrenergic tone may  contribute to the 
suboptimal therapeutic response observed clinically  with long-term administration of 
SSRI s.23  As brexpiprazole demonstrated antagonism at 5- HT2A receptors, the attenuated 
response t o SSRI s may  be reversed with co administration of brexpiprazole and SSRI s, 
thus enhancing clini
cal outcomes.
Because the management of MDD may  require prolonged administration of ADT(s) with 
or without an augmenting agent, safety  monitoring for longer than the period required to 
achieve initial response is warranted.  In the brexpiprazole clinical d evelopment program 
for MDD, phase 2 and phase 3 trials examined the 6 -week safet y and efficacy  of 
brexpiprazole augmentation of ADTs.  For phase 2, subjects who completed either of the 
trials had the option to enroll into an open -label rollover trial in wh ich they  receiv ed 
brexpiprazole for up to 52 weeks ( Trial 331-
08-212).  The current trial ( Trial 331-10-238) 
provides an open -label rollover option for double -blind phase 3 
brexpiprazole MDD trials
andwill expand on the knowledge gained in these trials byassessing the long -term 
safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of brexpiprazole when administered concomitantly  with 
antidepressant medications .
2.2 Dosing Rationale
Adose range of brexpiprazole 0.5 to 3 mg/day  was selected for the current open- label 
trial to en compass the dose range of the double- blind efficacy  trials (ie, 
brexpiprazole 
1to 3mg/day ) and to include an option for a reduced dose for tolerabilit y (ie, 
0.5mg/day ) in order to maximize subject retention in the long -term trial .  Therapeutic 
dose ranges of ADT are based on product labels and clinical practice.  Data from phase 1 
drug interaction trials
(Trial 331-08-207 and Trial 331- 08-208) indicated that 
coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine , and duloxetine ) with 
brexpipra zole could cause potentially  higher plasma concentrations of brexpiprazole (up 
to 2-fold).  In order to limit the potential higher exposure of brexpiprazole when 
coadministered with such inhibitors, the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is
limited to 40mg for fluoxeti ne, 50 mg for paroxetine CR , and 60 mg for duloxetine in the 
current trial.
2.3 Trial Objectives
Primary : To assess the long -term safet y and tolerability of oral brexpiprazole as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adults with MDD.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 27 13Jun 2014Secondar y: To assess the long -term efficacy  of oral brexpiprazole as adjunctive

3 Trial Design
3.1 Type/Design of Trial
This is a multicenter, 26-week, open -label trial designed to assess the long -term safet y, 
tolerability , and efficacy  of adjunctive brexpiprazole in depressed adults on concurrent 
ADT.  The trialwill be conducted on an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into the trialwill be 
drawn from eligible subjects who have completed the last scheduled visit of a
double-blind phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trialand who, in the investigator’s judgment, 
could potentially  benefit from adjunctive treatment with oral brexpiprazole for MDD.  A 
schematic of the trialdesign is presented in Figure 3.1-
1.
The trialwill be organized as follows:
Screening/Baseline:   Subjects will be screened for eligibility  at the last scheduled visit of 
the prior double -blind phase 3 trial .  Subjects will sign a separate informed consent form 
(ICF) for participation in Trial 331-10- 238 before any  proced ures specific to the 
open -label trial are performed.  The assessments from the last scheduled visit of the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-10-238 for 
any assessment that is not unique to the open -label trial.  Medical history  will be updated, 
if necessary .

3.2.1 Treatment A dministration
3.2.1.1 Brexpiprazol e
The first dose of open- label brexpiprazole will be taken one day  after the last dose is 
taken for the prior double -blind, phase 3 efficacy  trial so that adjunctive treatment will 
continue without interruption.  I t is anticipated that the last dose of the double -blind, 
phase 3 efficacy  trial will be taken the day  of the last scheduled visit ie, the day  of the 
Screening/Baseline visit for the open -label trial.  Subjects will initiate open -label dosing 
with brexpiprazole 0.5 mg/day  for 1 week.  Subjects unable to tolerate brexpiprazole 
0.5mg/day  must be withdrawn from the trial.  The dose of brexpiprazole will be 
increased to 1 mg/day  at the Week 1 visit.  Subjects unable to tolerate brexpiprazole 
1mg/day  may  decrease to 0.5 mg/day  at any  time after the Wee k 1 visit.
Investigators may  further increase the dose to brexpiprazole 2 mg/day  and then to 
brexpiprazole 3 mg/day , with an interval of at least 
5 day s between dose increases.  An 
interval of at least 5 day sbetween dose adjustments is recommended for dos e decreases; 
however, the dose of brexpiprazole can be decreased at the investigator’s discretion in a 
step- wise manner at an y time after the Week 1 visit as needed for tolerability  to a 
minimum of 0.5 mg/day .  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made base d upon the 
clinical judgment of the investigator as it relates to tolerability  and therapeutic response.  
Subjects must return to the cli nic for unscheduled visits if change sto the dose of 
brexpiprazole (increase s or decrease s) are required between schedu led visits.  The dosing 
schedule is summarized in Table 3.2.1.1-1.  Additional i nformation on dose adjustments 
is provided in Section 3.2.2.1.
All doses of 
brexpiprazole should be taken orally  once dail y and can be administered 
without regard to meals.  For convenience, brexpiprazole may be taken with the first 
daily  dose of ADT.

bStep-wise increases in the dose of brexpiprazole must be separated by at least 5 day s.  Although step -
wise decreases in the brexpiprazole dose are permitted at any time after the Week 1 visit to a 
minimum of 0.5mg/day, an interval of at least 5 days between dose adjustments is recommended.  
See Section 3.2.2.1 for additional information on dose adjustments.  Subjects must return to the clinic 
for unscheduled visits if changes to the dose of brexpiprazole (increases or decreases) are required 
betw een scheduled visits.
cSubjects una ble to tolerate the minimum dose of brexpiprazole (ie, 0.5 mg/day) must be withdrawn 
from the trial.
dThroughout Trial 331-10-238, the subject must remain on the same ADT that was assigned in the prior 
double- blind phase 3 
trial.
eIt is recommended that th e dose of ADT not be changed while the dose of brexpiprazole is being 
optim ized.
3.2.1.2 ADT
During the Treatment Phase of Trial 331-10-238, subjects will r emain on the same 
assigned open- label ADT from the prior double -blind , phase 3 efficacy  trial.  Numbered 
ADT bottles to be dispensed to the subject will be assigned by  the IVRS or IWRS.  
The 
initial dose of ADT for the open -label trial will be the same as the ADT dose taken on the 
last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial .  The ADTs to be use d in 
Trial 331-10- 238, including allowable doses within the therapeutic range, are listed in 
Table 3.2.1.2-
1.  Adjustments to the ADT dose are permitted as described in 
Section 3.2.2.2.  If in the clinical judgment of the investigator a subject should 
permanentl y discontinue their assigned ADT or change to a different ADT, the subject 
must be withdrawn from the trial.  
All doses of ADT will be administered orally  once 
daily  except for duloxetine 40 mg/day  that 
can be administered once daily  or as 
duloxetine 20 mg twice daily , duloxetine 60 mg/day  that can be administered once dail y 
or as duloxetine 30 mg twice dail y, and fluoxetine 40 mg/day that can be administered 
once dail y or in divided doses twice dail y.  All ADTs can be given without regard to 
meals, except for venlafaxine XR ,which should be taken with food.  Subjects should be 
instructed to take the ADT at approximately  the same time each day , if possible.

3.2.2 Dose A djustments
Dose modifications to both brexpiprazole and ADT will be permitted to optimize 
therapeutic benefit according to the rules described below for each treatment .  However, 
the dose of brexpiprazole and the dose of ADT should not both be changed at the same 
visit.
3.2.2.1 Brexpiprazole
Allowable dose modifications to the daily  dose of brexpiprazole are summarized in 
Table 
3.2.2.1-1.  At least 5 days must elapse between dose increases for brexpiprazole .  An 
interval of at least 5 day sbetween dose adjustments is recommended for dose decreases; 
however, the dose of brexpiprazole can be decreased at the investigator’s discretion in a 
step
-wise manner at an y time after the Week 1 visit as needed for tolerability to a 
minimum of 0.5 mg/day .  Subjects must return to the clinic for unscheduled visits if 
changes to the dose of brexpiprazole (increases or decreases) are required between 
scheduled visits.
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the 0.5mg/day dose of brexpiprazole must be 
withdrawn from the trial
.  However, subjects whose brexpiprazole dose is decreased to 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 32 13Jun 20140.5mg/day  and who demonstrate adequate tolerability  at this dose should be rechalle nged 
with a 1 mg/day  dose within approximately  6 to 8 weeks after the dose is decreased to 
0.5mg/day .  If tolerability  issues arise followi ng the rechallenge, the dose may  be 
decreased again to 0.5 mg/day .  Further rechallenge at 1mg/day  may  be performed at the 
investigator’s discretion.  The dose of brexpiprazole can be increased as necessary  
following a dose decrease at an y other dose if, in the investigator’s judgment, rechallenge 
with a higher dose is warranted in order to identify  an optimum dose for the subject.  
Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made based upon the clinical judgment of the 
investigator as it relates to tolerability  and therapeutic response.

dSubjects unable to tolerate 0.5 mg/day of brexpiprazole must be w ithdrawn from the trial.
3.2.2.2 ADT
It is recommended that the dose of ADT not be ch anged while the dose of brexpiprazole
is being optimized (ie, no change to ADT up to and including the Week 4 visit).  After the 
Week 4 visit , the dose of ADT can be modified if necessary  to achieve optimum efficacy  
and tolerability  for the treatment regim en using the following rules:  1) at least 5 day s
must elapse between dose increases (either brexpiprazole or ADT), 2) an interval of at 
least 5 day s between dose adjustments (either brexpiprazole or ADT) is recommended for 
dose decreases; however, the ADT dose can be decreased at the investigator’s discretion 
at an y time as needed for tolerability , and 3) subjects must return to the clinic for 
unscheduled visits if changes to the ADT dose are required between scheduled visits.

aUse of CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers is prohibited during the trial.  
Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and duloxetine are protocol -defined ADTs that are also CYP2D6 inhibitors.  
In order to limit the potential higher exposure of brexpip razole when coadministered w ith such 
inhibitors, the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is limited to 40 mg for fluoxetine, 50 mg for 
paroxetine CR, and 60 mg for duloxetine.
Subjects who do not qualify  for the open -label trial at the Screening/Basel ine visit may  
not be rescreened at a later date.  If results of clinical labor atory  tests from the last 
scheduled 
visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial are not available to assess 
eligibility , the assessment for the affected criteria should be base d on the last available 
measurement during the respective double -blind trial.   Results from the last visit of the 
double -blind trial should be reviewed when they  become available and action should be 
taken as described in Section 3.6.2.1 if there are any  clinically  significant and/or 
exclusionary  values.
3.5 Primary  and Secondary  Outcome Variables
3.5.1 Primary  Outcome Variable
The primary  outcome variable is the safet y and tolerability  of brexpiprazole , which will 
beassessed b y examining the frequency  and severity  of adverse events (AEs).
3.5.2 Secondary Outcome Variables
3.5.2.1 Efficacy Variables
Efficacy  variables will 
be as follows :
Change from baseline in Clinical Global I mpression -Severit y of Illness scale 
(CGI -S) score;
Mean Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI -I) score;
Change from baseline in Sheehan Disability  Scale (SDS) score.

(IDS -SR) Total Score
3.5.2.2 Safety Variables
In addit ion to AEs, safety  variables to be examined in this trialwill include phy sical 
examinations, vital signs, body  weight, waist circumference, clinical laboratory  tests 
(hematology , serum chemistry , urinal ysis, and pregnancy  tests), ECGs, the Simpson 
Angus S cale (SAS), the Abnormal Involuntary  Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes 
Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), the Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS), 
and the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (MSFQ).
Mean change from base line and the incidence of potentially  clinicall y relevant abnormal 
values will be calculated for vital signs, bod y weight, routine laboratory tests (including 
prolactin), and ECG parameters.  Mean change from baseline will be calculated for 
coagulation par ameters (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time 
[aPTT], and I nternational Normalized Ratio [INR]), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 
thyroid
-stimulating hormone (TSH), waist circumference, and bod y mass index (BMI ; 
derived programmatic ally from body  weight and height measurements).  A central ECG 
service will be utilized to review all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the 
safet y analysis.  EPS will be evaluated b y calcula ting mean change from baseline on the 
SAS, AI MS, and BARS.  Sexual dy sfunction will be evaluated as change from baseline 
in MSFQ score .  The C -SSRS will be used to assess and classify  reported suicidal 
behavior.  By -patient listings of ph ysical examination findings will be reviewed as a 
further assessment of safety .
3.5.2.3 Other Outcome Variables
Responses to the Resource Utilization F orm (RUF) will be summarized appropriatel y to 
explore the impact of treatment on health care resources.
3.6 Trial Procedures
The duration of this trial from first subject enrolled to las t subject completed is estimated to be 
approximately 57months,of which approximately 51 months are allotted for rollover of subjects from 
prior double -blind phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trials.  Individual participation for subjects who complete 
the trial without early withdrawal will be approximately 30 weeks ( 26 weeksof treatment and 30 -day 
follow -up).  Trial assessment time points are summarized in Table 3.6-1.

of the trial results.  Subjects meeting any  of these criteria will be excluded from 
Trial 331-10-238.  Appendix 4is included to assist investigators in their assessments of 
results that may  be potentially  medicall y significant, depending on the subject’s medical 
history  and clinical presentation.  I f one or more results from the screening/baseline 
sample are clinicall y significant and/or exclusionary  when the results from the last 
scheduled visit of the 
prior double -blind phase 3 trial become available, the test(s) should 
be repeated.  The subject may  continue to receive trialmedication pending results of the 
repeat laboratory  tests at the investigator’s discretion.  If the abnormality  remains upon 
retest, the medical monitor should be contacted to discuss the subject’s eligibility  for 
continued participation in Trial 331-10-238.
A central laboratory  designated by  the sponsor will be used for all laboratory  testing 
required during the trial.  The central laboratory  should be used for all laboratory  testing 
whenever possible (including unscheduled and follow-
up labs, if needed).  In cases where 
an immediate result is required for a p articular laboratory  test, the sample should be 
divided and sent to both a local laboratory  and the designated central laboratory .  Urine 
will be collected and blood will be drawn from subjects at the scheduled visits designated 
in Table 3.6 -1.  Additional urine and blood samples may  be collected for further 
evaluation of safet y as warranted b y the investigator’s judgment.  Screening/baseline 
laboratory  assessments will be performed after a minimum 8-
hour fast per the protocol 
instructions for the double -
blindphase 3 trials .  All s ubjects must be fasting for a 
minimum of 8 hour s prior to the blood draw at Week 26/ET and should be fasting for a 
minimum of 8 hour
s prior to all other blood draws during the Treatment Phase , if 
possible.  I f a subject is not fasting at a visit other than Week 26/ ET, the blood draw 
should still be performed and the status documented as nonfasting on the laboratory  
requisition sheet.  The Week 26/ET blood draw must be rescheduled to accommodate the 
fasting requirement.  Reports fr om the central laboratory  should be filed with the source 
documents for each subject.  The central laboratory  will provide laboratory  results to the 
sponsor electronically .

3.6.2.2 Physical Examination and Vital Sign Assessments
3.6.2.2.1 Physical Examination
The complete ph ysical examination at the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind
phase 3 trial will serve as the screening/baseline phy sical examination for the current 
protocol.  A complete phy sical examination will consist of a rev iew of the following 
body  systems:  HEENT, thorax, abdomen, urogenital, extremities, neurological, and skin 
and mucosae.  Repeat measurement of height is not required during Trial 331-10-238 if a 
Screening/ Baseline value is available from the prior double -blind phase 3 trial.  Waist 
circumference will be measured at Screening/Baseline , Week 14,and Week 26/ET.   The 
following procedures will aid in the standardization of these measurements:
The subject should be minimally  clothed (ie, lightweight clothing; n o heavy  
overgarments).
Waist circumference should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  
the same time at each visit.
Measurement will be accomplished by  locating the upper hip bone and the top of the 
right iliac crest and placing a weigh ted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest.  Before reading the tape measure, the assessor 
should assure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to 
the floor.  The measurement is to be made at the end of a normal exhalation.24
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 53 13Jun 2014The principal investigator or his/her appointed designee is primaril y responsible to 
perform the ph ysical examination .  If the appointed designee is to pe rform the phy sical 
exam ination , he/she must be permitted b y local regulations and his/her name must be 
included on the FDA Form 1572.  Whenever possible, the same individual should 
perform all phy sical exam ination s.  Any  condition present at the post- treatment physical 
exam ination that was not present at the screening/baseline exam ination should be 
documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
3.6.2.2.2 Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will include body  weight, body  temperature, s ystolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate.  The following guidelines 
will aid in the standardization of body  weight measurements:
The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible.
Scales should be calibrated a nd reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh- in session.
A subject should void prior to being weighed and be minimally  clothed (ie, no shoes 
or heav y overgarments).
Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approx imately  the same 
time at each visit.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supine, sitting, and 
standing positions after the subject has been in each position for at least 3 minutes.  The 
supine measurements will be performed firs t, followed by  sitting, and finally  standing.  
Vital signs scheduled at the same visit as blood samples are to be completed before blood 
is drawn.
Subjects with uncontrolled hy perte nsion (Screening/Baseline DBP > 95mmHg) or 
symptomatic hy potension are exc luded from the trialas are subjects with orthostatic 
hypotension defined as a decrease of 30 mmHg in SBP and/or a decrease of 
20 mmHg in DBP after at least 3 minutes standing compared to the previous supine 
blood pressure OR development of sy mptoms (see Table 3.4.3-1 ).  In addition, subjects 
should be excluded if they have an y other vital sign measurement at Screening/Baseline 
that, in the investigator’s judgment, is medicall y significant in that it would impact the 
safet y of the subject or the interpr etation of the trialresults.  However, an y abnormal 
screening/baseline vital sign result(s) considered to be clinicall y significant should be 
repeated to confirm the finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial.  Appendix 
3is included to assist
investigators in their assessments of results that may be potentially  
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 54 13Jun 2014medically  significant, depending on the subject’s medical history  and clinical 
presentation.
3.6.2.3 ECG Assessments
Twelve -lead ECGs will be recorded at the visits specified in Table 3.6-1.  E CG 
recordings will be obtained after the subject has been su pine and at rest for at least 
5minutes.  Additional 12 -lead ECGs may  be obtained at the investigator’s discretion and 
should alway s be obtained in the event of an earl y termination.  A central EC G service 
will be utilized for reading all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the safety  
analysis.  In addition, 
ECG results will be evaluated at the investigational site to monitor 
safet y during the trial.  The principal investigator or qual ified designee will review, sign, 
and date each ECG reading, noting whether or not any abnormal results are of clinical 
significance.  The ECG will be repeated if an y results are considered to be clinically  
significant.
As the results from the central read er will not be available at the Screening/Baseline visit, 
the subject will be enrolled into Trial 331-10-238 based on the local ECG results.  A 
screening/baseline ECG finding of QTc corrected for heart rate b y Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF) 450
msec is excl usionary (see Table 3.4.3 -1).  In addition, subjects should be 
excluded if they  have any  other abnormal ECG finding at Screening/Baseline that, in the 
investigator’s judgment, is medically  significant in that it would impact the safet y of the 
subject or th e interpretation of the trialresults.  However, any  screening/baseline ECG 
with abnormal result(s) considered to be clinically significant should be repeated to 
confirm the finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial.  
Appendix 5is 
provided as a guide for determining potentially  clinically  relevant ECG abnormalities.   If 
the results from the central reader, when available, indicate a screening/baseline 
QTcF 450msec, the investigator must contact the medical monitor to discuss the 
subject’s c ontinued participation in the trial.
3.6.2.4 Other Safety  Assessments
It is required that a trained and experienced clinician administer the safet y assessments, 
including the EPS scales (SAS, AI MS, and BARS) and C -SSRS.  The number of raters 
within each trial cent er should be kept to a minimum.  All efforts will be made to ensure 
that the same clinician administers the scales for a given subject.  Notations in the 
subject’s trial records should substantiate the ratings.  Training and materials for rating 
will be pr ovided b y Bracket .
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 55 13Jun 20143.6.2.4.1 Simpson Angus Scale (SA S)
The SAS25(Appendix 10) consis ts of a list of 10 sy mptoms of P arkinsonism (gait, arm 
dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity , wrist rigidity , head rotation , glabella tap, 
tremor, salivation, and akathisia).  Each item will be rated on a 5 -point scale, with a score 
of zero representing absence of s ymptoms, and a score of 4 representing a severe 
condition.  The SAS Total Score is the sum of the scores for all 10 items.  
Anticholinergics, propranolol, benzodiazepines, and non- benzodiazepine sleep aids are 
not permitted within 12 hours of scale administration (see Section 4).  Investigators are 
encouraged to delay scale administration until 12 hours have elapsed, if at all possible.  
However, if delay ing administration of the scale is not feasible, the SAS should still be 
administered and the use of the medication documented, including a notation of the drug 
name, dose, and time of administration on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
3.6.2.4.2 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (A IMS)
The AIMS26assessment ( Appendix 11
) consists of 10 items describing s ymptoms of 
dyskines ia.  Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity  movements (items 
5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) will be observed unobtrusivel y while the subject 
is at rest (eg, in the waiting room), and the investigator will also make global judgment s 
on the subject’s d yskinesias (items 8 through 10).  Each item will be rated on a 5-point 
scale, with a score of zero representing absence of sy mptoms (for item 10, no awareness), 
and a score of 4 indicating a severe condition (for item 10, awareness, sev ere distress).  
For this scale, the subject is to be sitting on a hard, firm chair.  In addition, the AIMS 
includes two y es/no questions that address the subject’s dental status.  Anticholinergics, 
propranolol, benzodiazepines, and non -benzodiazepine sleep aids are not permitted 
within 12 hours of scale administration (see Section 4).  Investigators are encouraged to 
delay  scale administration until 12 hours have elapsed, if at all possible.  However, if 
delaying administration of the scale is not feasible, the AIMS should still be administered 
and the use of the medication documented, including a notation of the drug name, dose, 
and time of administration on the eCRF.
The AIMS Movement Rating Score is define d as the sum of items 1 through 7 (ie, items 
1 through 4, facial and oral movements; items 5 and 6, extremity  movements; and item 7, 
trunk movements).
3.6.2.4.3 Barnes A kathisia Rating Scale (BA RS)
The BARS27(Appendix 12
) consists of 4 items related to akathisia:  objective 
observation of akathisia by  the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by  the 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 56 13Jun 2014subject, subjective distress due to akathisia, and global clinical assessment of akathisia.  
The first 3 items will be rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of zero representing 
absence of s ymptoms and a score of 3 representing a severe condition.  The global 
clinical evaluation will be made on a 6 -point scale, with zero representing absence of 
symptoms and a score of 5 representing severe akathisia.  To complete this scale, subjects 
will be observed while they  are seated and then standing for a minimum of 2 minutes in 
each position.  Sy mptoms observed in other situations (eg, while engaged in neutral 
conver sation or engaged in other activity ) may  also be rated.  Subjective phenomena are 
to be elicited b y direct questioning.  Anticholinergics, propranolol, benzodiazepines, and 
non-benzodiazepine sleep aids are not permitted within 12 hours of scale administra tion 
(see Section 4
).  Investigators are encouraged to delay  scale administration until 12 hours 
have elapsed, if at all possible.  However, if delaying administration of the scale is not 
feasible, the BARS should still be administered and the use of the medication 
documented, including a notation of the drug name, dose, and time of administration on 
the eCRF.
The BARS Global Score is defined as the global clinical assessment of akathisia.
3.6.2.4.4 Suicidality
Suicid ality will be monitored during the trialusing the C -SSRS.  Subjects completed the 
“Baseline /Screening ” C-SSRS form at the beginning of the prior 
double -blind phase 3 
trial; therefore, onl y the “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be used in 
Trial 331-10-238.  A copy  of the “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form is provided in 
Appendix 13
.
3.6.2.4.5 Sexual Function
The MSFQ28is a measure of a subject’s self -reported sexual functioning.  It consists of 
5 items that are each rated as one
of six defined grades of functioning ( Appendix 14).  
The investigator or designated trialpersonnel should ensure that a subject completes this 
instrument completely  and legibl y.
3.6.3 Efficacy  Assessments
It is required that appropriately trained and qualified individuals administer the CGI -S 
and CGI -I.  The number of raters within each trialcenter should be kept to a minimum.  
All efforts will be made to ensure that the same clinician administers the scales for a 
given subject.  Notations in the subject’s trialrecords should substantiate the ratings.  
Training and materials for rating will be provided by  Bracket .
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 57 13Jun 20143.6.3.1 Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Illness Scale (CGI -S)
The severity  of illness for each subject will be rated using the CGI -S.26  To perform this 
assessment, the rater or investigator will answer the following question: “Considering 
your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally  ill is the 
patient at this time?”  Re sponse choices include:  0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all 
ill; 2 = borderline mentally  ill; 3 = mildly  ill; 4 = moderatel y ill; 5 = markedly  ill; 
6 =severel y ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.  A sample of the CGI -S is 
provided in Appendix 6
.
3.6.3.2 Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI
-I)
The efficacy  of trialtreatment will be rated for each subject using the CGI -I.26  The rater 
or investigator will rate the subject’s total improvement whether or not it is due entirel y 
to drug treatment.  All responses will be compared to the subject’s condition at 
Screening/Baseline (ie, last scheduled visit ofthe prior double -blind phase 3 trial ).  
Response choices include:  0 = not assess
ed, 1 = very  much improved, 2 = much 
improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally  worse, 6 = much 
worse, and 7 = very  much worse.  A sample of the CGI -I is provided in Appendix 7.

3.6.3.3.1 Sheehan Disability  Scale (SDS )
The SDS29
,30is a self -rated instrument used to measure the effect of the subject’s 
symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities ( Appendix 8
).  
The SDS is a visual analogue scale that uses spatio- visual, numeric, and verbal 
descriptive anchors simultaneously  to assess disability  across the three domains.  The 
number most representative of how much each area was disrupted b y symptoms is 
marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely .  Scores of 5 and above are 
associated with significant functional impairment.  I
n addition to the visual scale, the 
SDS includes two questions related to productivity  losses due to the ps ychiatric 
symptoms and impairment.
3.6.3.3.2 Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (Self -Report)
The IDS -SR31is a 30- item self -report measure used to assess core diagnostic depressive 
symptoms as well as at ypical and melan cholic s ymptom features of MDD ( Appendix 9).  
The investigator or designated trial personnel should ensure that a subject completes this 
instrument completely  and legibl y.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 58 13Jun 20143.6.3.3.3 Resource Utilization Form (RUF)
The RUF is a self -report tool designed to collect information regarding the extent of 
medical care sought b y subjects while participating in the trial ( Appendix 15).  The 
number of hospitalizations and day s of hospitalization within the past 12 months will be 
collected on the Baseline F orm at Screening/Base
line, including an y hospitalizations that 
may have occurred during the subject’s participation in the prior double -blind phase 3 
trial.  The number of visits to various practitioners for mental health and other reasons 
within the 3 months prior to Screenin g/Baseline (excluding any visits from the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial ) will be collected on the Baseline F orm and the number of such 
visits occurring during the trial (excluding visits related to the trial ) will be collected on 
the Follow -up Form at W eek26/ET.
3.6.4 End of Trial
The End of Trial Date is defined as the last Date of Contact or the Date of Final Contact 
Attempt from the Post- treatment Follow -up e CRF page for the last subject completing or 
withdrawing from the trial.
3.7 Stopping Rules, Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures
3.7.1 Entire Trial or Treatment A rm(s)
If the sponsor terminates or suspends the trial for safet y or unanticipated other reasons, 
prompt notification will be given to investigators, I RBs/IECs, and regulatory  authorities 
in accordance with regulatory  requirements.
3.7.2 Individual Center
A particular center may  be terminated from the trial at the discretion of the investigator, 
sponsor, or I RB, eg, for non-enrollment of subjects or noncompliance with the protocol.  
The investigator will notify  the sponsor promptly  if the trial is terminat ed by  the 
investigator or the I RB/EC at the site.
3.7.3 Individual Subject
If a subject discontinues from the trialprematurely , the reason must be fully  evaluated 
and recorded appropriately  in source documents and the eCRF.  If the subject is being 
withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal.  
All subjects have the right to withdraw at an y point during treatment without prejudice.  
The investigator can discontinue a subject ’s par ticipation in the trial at an y time if 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 59 13Jun 2014medically  necessary .  In addition, subjects meeting the following criteria must be 
withdrawn from the trial:
a) occurrence of an y AE, intercurrent illness or abnormality in a laboratory  assessment
which, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants the subject’s permanent withdrawal 
from the trial ;
b) treatment with a prohibited concomitant medication other than the use of appropriate 
medications for the treatment of AEs under direction of the investigator;
c) subject 
noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability  to adhere to the trialschedule or 
procedures (see Section 3.11, Subject Compliance) ;
d) at the request of the subject, investigator, sponsor or des ignee, or r egulatory  authority ;
e) subject becomes pregnant ;
f) subject cannot tolerate the minimum dose of brexpiprazole (ie, 0.5mg/day ), the 
minimum protocol -defined therapeutic dose of ADT (see Table 3.2.1.2-1 ),or requires a 
different ADT; or
g) subject is lost to follow -
up.
The investigator will notify  the sponsor promptly  when a subject is withdrawn.  Subjects 
withdrawn prior to Week 26 must complete the Week 26/ET evaluations at the time of 
withdrawal.  In addition, all subjects who withdraw prematurely  from the trial will be 
assessed 30 (+2)days after the last dose of I MP for evaluation of safet y.  This 
assessment can be accomplished via telephone contact or clinic visit at the investigator’s 
discretion.  Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.
3.8 Screen Failu res
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF), but who is not started on treatment, 
whether through randomization or open assignment. For the purposes of 
Trial 331-10-238, treatment begins with the first dose of open- label brexpiprazole in the 
Treatment Phase.  Subjects who do not qualify  for Trial 331-10- 238 at the last scheduled 
visit of the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial may  not be rescreened.
3.9 Definition of Completed Subjects
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary  and/or secondary  objectives of the trialirrespective of whether or not the subject 
actuall y consumed all doses of IMP.  Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 60 13Jun 2014visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers.  For purposes of this 
trial, subjects who complete the Week 26 visit will be defined as completers.  Protocol -
specified post -treatment follow -up contacts will not qualify  as the “last scheduled visit.”  
Subjects who are not completers are defined as those who “discontinued thetrial.”
3.10 Definition of Lost to Follow -up
Subjects who cannot be contacted on or before 
the Week 26 visit during the treatment 
period and who d
o not have a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or 
AE) will be classified as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation.  The site 
will make three attempts to contact the subject b y telephone and in the event the site is 
unab le to reach the subject by  telephone, the site will attempt to contact the subject via 
certified mail or an alternative similar method where appropriate.
3.11 Subject Compliance
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP (ie, brexpiprazole and ADTs).  
Accountability  and compliance verification should be documented in the subject’s trial 
records.  Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at 
alltrialvisits.  I f poor compliance continues (eg, multiple missed doses resultin g in less 
than 80% overall compliance at an y point in the trial
), discontinuation of the subject from 
the trial should be considered.  Subjects who habitually  miss visits or habitually  attend 
visits outside of the protocol- defined visit window are also non compliant and should be 
considered for discontinuation.  The medical monitor should be contacted if the 
investigator is uncertain whether a subject's lack of compliance merits discontinuation 
from the trial.
3.12 Protocol Deviations
This trial is intended to be conducted as described in this protocol.  In the event of a 
significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency , accident, or mistake
(eg,violation of informed consent process, IMP dispensing or subject dosing error, 
subject enrolled in violation of eligibility  criteria or concomitant medication criteria) , the 
investigator or designee will contact the sponsor ’s designee (medical monitor) at the 
earliest possible time by  telephone.  Investigator and s ponsor (or sponsor’s designee) will 
come as quic kly as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the 
trial.  This decision will be documented b y the investigator and the designated medical 
monitor , and reviewed by  the site monitor.

GAB A = gamma -aminobutyric acid.
aAdministration of specific oral benzodiazepines is permitted for the short -term management of 
treatment emergent AEs such as anxiety and agitation up to a maximum of 6 mg/day lorazepam (or 
equivalent) in divided doses.  Short -acting benzodiazepines are to be used w henever possible.  In 
countries where no short -acting benzodiazepines are commercially available, use of oral diazepam or 
clonazepam may be acceptable if prior authorization is obtained from the medical monitor.  The 
following guide should be used to determine approximate lorazepam equivalents:  1 mg lorazepam = 
15 mg oxazepam = 0.5 mg alprazolam = 5 mg diazepam = 0.5 mg clonazepam.  The prescribed 
benzodiazepine should be discontinued as soon as the AE f or which it was initiated subsides, as per 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 62 13Jun 2014the investigator’s discretion to avoid any withdrawal effects.  Benzodiazepines must not be 
administered within 12 hours prior to scheduled efficacy and safety assessments, including EPS 
scales.  Investigators are encouraged to delay scale administration until 12 hours have elapsed, if at all 
possible.  How ever, if delaying administration of efficacy and safety scales is not feasible, the scales 
should still be administered and the use of benzodiazepine documented, including a notation of the 
drug name, dose, and time of administration on the eCRF.
bNon-benzodiazepine sleep aids (ie, zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone only) are permitted 
for the treatment of insomnia, but not on the same day as administration of a benzodiazepine, 
regardless of indication.  For the non -benzodiazepine sleep aids, sites should only utilize one of the 
listed medications that areapproved for thisindication in their respective countries and the country -
specific prescribing in formation is to be used to determine the maximum allowable daily dose for the 
treatment of insomnia.  Non-benzodiazepine sleep aids must not be administered w ithin 12 hours 
prior to scheduled efficacy and safety assessments, including EPS scales.  Investig ators are 
encouraged to delay scale administration until 12 hours have elapsed, if at all possible.  However, if 
delaying administration of efficacy and safety scales is not feasible, the scales should still be 
administered and the use of the sleep aid doc umented, including a notation of the drug name, dose, 
and time of administration on the eCRF.
cFluoxetine, paroxetine, and duloxetine are protocol -defined ADTs that are also CYP2D6 inhibitors.  In 
order to limit the potential higher exposure of brexpiprazo lewhen coadministered with such 
inhibitors, the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is limited to 40 mg for fluoxetine, 50 mg for 
paroxetine CR, and 60 mg for duloxetine (see Section 4.2.1 ).
4.2 Other Res trictions
4.2.1 Restricted Therapies and Precautions
The subject’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre-existing or that develop during the trial(intercurrent illness or 
AEs).  The investigator should examine the acceptability  of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly  prohibited.  I n order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy  is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take an y medications (either 
self-administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy  prescribed by  another 
physician) without prior consultation with the investigator.  In particular, the investigator 
should caution the subject about concomitant use of the following during the trial:
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs, aspirin, or other drugs that interfere with 
coagulation since the combined use of ps ychotropic drugs that interfere with 
serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of 
upper gastrointestinal bleeding.32
Triptans (eg, sumatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, 
and zolmitriptan) , linezolid, and methy lene blue since there have been rare 
post-marketing reports of ser otonin sy ndrome or serotonin sy ndrome -like reactions 
(eg, mental status changes, hyperreflexia ,autonomic effects, lack of coordination , and 
diarrhea ) following the concomitant use of SSRI sor SNRI sand these drugs .33,34,35
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 63 13Jun 2014Electroconvulsive therapy was prohibited during the prior double -blind phase 3 trials and 
is also prohibited for the duration of Trial 331-10- 238.  Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
is also prohibited.  I n addition, subjects may  not undergo implantation of a device for 
vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation during the trial.
Use of intramuscular benzodiazepines andcontinual u se of oral benzodiazepines are
prohibited throughout the trial.  However, a dministration of specific oral benzodiazepines 
is permitted for the short -term management of treatment emergent AEs such as anxiety  
and agitation up to a maximum of 6 mg/day  lorazep am (or equivalent) in divided doses.  
Short -acting benzodiazepines are to be used whenever possible.  In countries where no 
short -acting benzodiazepines are commercially  available, use of oral diazepam or 
clonazepam may  be acceptable if prior authorization is obtained from the medical 
monitor.  The following guide should be used to determine approximate lorazepam 
equivalents:  1 mg lorazepam = 15 mg oxazepam = 0.5 mg alprazolam = 5 mg diazepam 
= 0.5 mg clonazepam.  The prescribed benzodiazepine should be di scontinued as soon as 
the AE for which it was initiated subsides, as per the investigator’s discretion to avoid 
any withdrawal effects.
Non-benzodiazepine sleep aids (ie, zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone only) 
are permitted for the treatment of insomnia, but not on the same day  as administration of 
a benzodiazepine, regardless of indication.  For the non
-benzodiazepine sleep aids, sites 
should only  utilize one o f the listed medications that are approved for th isindication in 
their respective countries and the country -specific prescribing information is to be used to 
determine the maximum allowable dail y dose for the treatment of insomnia.
Anticholinergics are permitted for the treatment of EPS up to a maximum of 4 mg/day 
benztropine or its equivalent and propranolol is permitted for akathisia or tremor up to a 
maximum of 20 mg three times daily  (total of 60 mg/day ).  Sites should only utilize 
medications that are approved for these indications in their respective countries.
Benzodiazepines, non -benzodiazepine sleep aids, anticholinergics, and propranolol must 
not be administered within 12 hours prior to scheduled efficacy  and safety  assessments, 
including EPS scales.  Investigators are encouraged to delay  scale administration until 
12hours have elapsed, if at all possible.  However, if delay ing administration of efficacy  
and safet y scales is not feasible, the scales should still be administered and the use of the 
medication documented, including a notation of the drug name, dose, and time of 
administration on the eCRF.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 64 13Jun 2014Fluoxetine , paroxetine, and duloxetine are protocol -defined ADTs in this trial ; however, 
they are also CYP2D6 inhibitors.  Data from Tr ial 331 -
08-207 and Trial 331 -08- 208 
indicate that co administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors with bre xpiprazole can cause 
potentially  higher plasma concentrations of brexpiprazole (up to 2
-fold).  In order to limit 
the potential higher exposure of brexpiprazole when co administered with such inhibitors, 
the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is limi ted to 40 mg for fluoxetine, 50 mg for 
paroxetine CR , and 60 mg for duloxetine .  The investigator should consid er the potential 
for higher brexpiprazole plasma concentrations when adjusting the dose of brexpiprazole
for subjects who are receiving fluoxetine, paroxetine CR , or duloxetine as the assigned 
ADT.
All trialpersonnel should be familiar with the content of the Investigator Brochure for 
brexpiprazole in order to manage the subject’s condition adequatel y and select 
appropriate concomitant medications, if needed.
4.2.2 Non- therapy Precautions and Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Precautions
Subjects should not undergo an y elective medical procedure without prior consultation 
with the investigator.  An elective procedure (minor surgery , dental surgery , orthopedic 
surgery , etc) tha t might require hospitalization or general anesthesia should be deferred 
until after the trialwhenever clinicall y appropriate.
4.2.2.2 Restrictions
Subjects may  only receive psychotherap y (eg, individual, group, marriage, or family 
therap y) if they  initiated the therap y at least 42 days before enrollment in theprior 
double -blind phase 3 tria l, participated in the therapy  regularly  during the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial, and commit to maintain their participation during the course of 
Trial 331-10- 238, or unle ss permission is obtained from the medical monitor.
Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or Seville orange 
products within 72 hours prior to dosing and during the trial is prohibited.  Subjects will 
be instructed to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages or using illicit drugs during 
participation in the trial.  The investigator may  request a blood or urine drug screen at any  
time during the trial if there is a suspicion of illicit drug use.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 65 13Jun 20145 Reporting of Adverse Events
5.1 Defini tions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.
A suspected adverse reaction means an y AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  
that the drug caused the AE .  For the purpose of IND safet y reporting, “reasonable 
possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and 
the AE.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty  about causality  
than adverse reactio n, which means an y AE caused by a drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes an y event that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
death
life-threatening, ie, the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator or the 
sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not 
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
requires i n-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization   
NOTE: A pre -scheduled hospitalization is not considered an SAE; however, 
SAE forms must be completed for all other hospitalizations, including 
hospitalization for psychiatric reasons.  Psy chosocial hospitalizations 
(eg,homelessness or need for shelter that is unrelated to the subject’s underly ing 
psychiatric condition) should not be reported as SAEs.
congenital anomal y/birth defect
other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropr iate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, eg, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, 
blood dy scrasias or convul sions that do not result in hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Non-serious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" AE.
If a subject is experiencing an extrapy ramidal s ymptom, the specific extrapy ramidal 
symptom must be indicated on the AE page of the eCRF.  Examples of AEs that are 
considered extrapyramidal sy mptoms include, but are not limited to :  generalized rigidity , 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 66 13Jun 2014hyperkinesia, dy skinesia, bradykinesia, akinesia, dystonia, h ypertoni a, akathisia, tremor, 
flexed posture, involuntary  muscle contractions, athetosis, and chorea.  If a subject is 
experiencing two or more of these s ymptoms, whether or not treatment with an 
anticholinergic is required, this is considered as extrapy ramidal s yndrome and must be 
entered as “extrap yramidal sy ndrome” on the AE page of the eCRF instead of the 
individual sy mptoms.  Permitted treatments for EPS are described in Section 4.2.1.
Immediatel y Reportable Event (IRE):
Any SAE
Any AEthat necessitates discontinuation of IMP.
Potential Hy ’s Law cases ( any increase of 
AST or ALT3 times the upper 
normal limit with an increase in total bilirubin 2 times the upper normal limit) .
Pregn ancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, 
it will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to INC 
Research.  Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE eCRF if there is an 
abnormality  or complication.
Clinical L aboratory  Chan ges:  It is the investigator’s responsibility  to review the results 
of all laboratory  tests as they  become available.  This review will be documented by  the 
investigator’s dated signature on the laboratory  report.  For each abnormal laboratory  test 
result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal (ie, clinically  significant) 
change from baseline for that individual subject. (This determination, however, does not 
necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed.  Th e 
investigator may  repeat the laboratory  test or request additional tests to verify  the results 
of the original laboratory tests).  If this laboratory  value is determined by  the investigator 
to be an abnormal change from baseline for that subject, this is considered an AE. 
Severity :  Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on 
the eCRF .  The intensit y of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity .
2 = Mod erate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y.
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity .
IMP Causalit y:Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related : There is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 67 13Jun 2014Possibly related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and the 
AE.  Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.
Unlikely related : There is a temporal relationship to IMPadministration, bu t there is 
not a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and the AE .
Not Related : There is no temporal or reasonable relationship to the IMP
administration.
Investigators will assess IMP causality  based on brexpiprazole .
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will periodically  assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs.  In order to 
avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non-leading question: 
"How have you felt since y our last visit?"  AllAEs (serious and non- serious) reported by  
the subject must be recorded on the source documents and on the eCRFs provided by  the 
sponsor or designee .
Note:  Normal pregnancy is not an AEand should not be recorded on the eCRFs; 
guidelines outlined in Section 5.5should be followed for pregnancy reporting.
In addition, INC Research (Appendix 2) must be notified immediately  by telephone or 
fax of any  immediately  reportable events according to the procedure outlined below in 
Section 5.3 .  Special attention should be paid to recording hospitalization and 
concomitant medications.
5.3 Immediately  Reportable Events (IRE)
The investigator must immediately (ie, within 24 hours) report an yserious adverse event, 
potential Hy ’s law cases ,or confirmed pregnancy by telephone or by  fax to INC 
Research as outlined in Appendix 2after either the investigator or site personnel become 
aware of the event.  An Immediately  Reportable Event (IRE) form must be completed 
and transmitted per the instructions in the Operations Manual.  (Please note that the IRE
form is NOT the AE eCRF .)
Non-serious events that require discontinuation of IMP(including laboratory  
abnormalities) should be reported to INC Res earch within 3 working day s.  The IREform 
must be completed and sent by fax or overnight courier to INC Research .
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically  until their health has returned 
to baseline status or until all parameters have returned to normal, or have otherwise been 
explained.  I t is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate 
supportive care for the subject.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 68 13Jun 20145.4 Potential Hy ’s Law Cases
For a subject that experiences an elevation in AST or ALT that is 3 time s the upper 
normal limit , a total bilirubin level should also be evaluated. If the total bilirubin is 
2times the upper normal limit, confirmatory repeat laboratory  samples should be 
drawn within 48 to 72 hours of the initial draw.  If these values are confirmed, trial 
personnel will complete an I RE form with all values listed and also report the event as an 
AE on the 
eCRFs.   Please note: If the subject was enrolled into the trial with non-
exclusionary  elevated transaminase levels at baseline, please discuss an y potential drug -
induced liver injury  events with the Medical Monitor.
5.5 Pregnancy
WOCBP and men who are sexually  active must use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the trial and for at least 30 day s after the last dose 
in a man ner such 
that risk of failure is minimized.  Unless the subject issterile (ie, women who have had 
an oophorectomy  and/or hy sterectom y or have been postmenopausal for at least 
12consecutive months; or men who have had orchidectomy ) or remain sabstinent, t wo of 
the following precautions must be used: vasectomy ortubal ligation (subject and 
partner) , vaginal diap hragm, intrauterine device , birth control pills, birth control depot 
injection, birth control implant, condom or sponge with spermicide.  An y single method 
of birth control, including vasectom y and tubal ligation, may fail, leading to pregnancy.
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guidelines about 
trialparticipation for WOCBP.  The topics should generally  includ e:
General information
Informed consent form
Pregnancy  prevention information
Drug interactio ns with hormonal contraceptives
Contraceptives in current use
Guidelines for the fo
llow-up of a reported pregnancy
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advise d of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy .  The subject must sign an ICFstating that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and the consequences were discussed with her.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 69 13Jun 2014During the trial, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately  
if they  suspect they  might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may  be pregnant prior to IMP
administ ration, the IMP administration must be withheld until the results of serum 
pregnancy  tests are available.  If the pregnancy  is confirmed, the subject must not receive 
the IMPand must not be enrolled in the trial.  If pregnancy  is suspected while the subje ct 
is taking IMP , the IMP must be withheld immediately  (if reasonable, taking into 
consideration an y potential withdrawal risks) until the result of the pregnancy is known.  
If pregnancy  is confirmed, the IMPwill be permanently  discontinued in an appropri ate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y) and the subj ect withdrawn from 
the trial.  Exceptions to trial discontinuation may  be considered for life -threatening 
conditions only  after consultations with the Drug Safet y and Pharmacovigila nce 
Department of INC Research (see Appendix 2for contact information ).
The investigator must immediately  notify INC Research of any  pregnancy  associated 
with IMPexposure, including 
at least 30 day s after the last dose for female subjects and 
the female partner(s) of a male subject and record the event on the IREform and forward 
it to INC Research.  INC Research will forward Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) for 
monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy .
Protocol required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies).  Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.  In addition, the 
investigator must report to INC Research , on appr opriate Pregnancy  Surveillance form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of six months.
5.6 Follow -up of A dverse Events
For this trial, information on AEs will be followed for up to 30 (+2)days after the last 
dose of IMP has been administered.
5.6.1 Follow -up of Non -serious A dverse Events
Non-serious AEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact must be recorded on the 
AE eCRF with the current status note d.  All non-serious events that are ongoing at this 
time will be recorded as ongoing on the eCRF.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 70 13Jun 20145.6.2 Follow -up of Post Trial Serious A dverse Events
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last scheduled contact must be 
recorded on the AE eCRF page and reported to INC Research according to the reporting 
procedures outlined in Section 5.3
.  This may  include unresolved previously reported
SAEs , or new SAEs.  
The investigator will follow SAEs until the events are resolved, or 
the subject is lost to follow -up.  Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline 
state of health, or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening 
of the subject’s condition.  The investigator will continue to report an y significant follow -
up information to INC Research up to the point the event has been resolved.
This trialrequires that subjects be actively monitored for SAEs up to 30(+2)days after 
discharge from the trial.
5.6.3 Follow -up and Reporting o f Serious A dverse Ev ents Occurring 
after Last Scheduled Contact
Any new SAEs reported by  the subject to the investigator that occur after the last 
scheduled contact , and are determined b y the investigator to be reasonably associated 
with the use of the IMP, should be reported to INC Research.  This may  include SAEs
that are captured on follow-up visit or telephone contact or at an y other time point after 
the defined trial period (ie, up to last scheduled contact). The investigator should follow 
related 
SAEs identified after the last scheduled contact until the events are resolved, or 
the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator should continue to report any  significant 
follow -up information to INC Research up to the poin t the event has been resolved.

Trial drugs will be provided to the investigator(s) by  the sponsor (or designated agent ).  
The IMP will consist of open- label brexpiprazole and open -label ADTs.  Open- label 
brexpiprazole will be supplied as 0.5, 
1, 2, and 3-mg tablets packaged in weekl y blister 
cards, each containing sufficie nttablets for 7 (+2 days).  Blister cards will contain single 
tablet strengths (ie, brexpiprazole 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 mg/day ) and subjects will take 1 tablet 
daily .  When accessed by the site, the IVRS or I WRS will assign a specific blister card 
number to be d ispensed to a subject.  New weekly blister cards will be dispensed at each 
scheduled visit and at unscheduled visits if the dose of brexpiprazole is changed.
Each blister card used in the trialwill be 
given an identify ing number and will be labeled 
to cle arly disclose the blister card number, 
Subject ID (to be filled in b y the site 
staff/investigator), subject’s initials or other unique identifier , name of the investigator (to 
be filled in by the site staff/investigator), site number (to be filled in by  the site 
staff/investigator), subject’s initials (to be filled in by  the site staff/investigator), date 
dispensed (to be filled in by  the site staff/investigator), compound ID, protocol number, 
the sponsor's name and address, instructions for use, route of a dministration, and 
appropriate precautionary statements.
  Once a blister card has been assigned to a subject
via the IVRS or I WRS , it cannot be dispensed to another subject.
ADTs will be supplied as bulk drug in commercial packaging (eg, bottles) with an 
ancillary  trial-specific label that will be positioned such that it will not obscure the 
original commercial label.  The sponsor reserves the right to use a generic equivalent, 
should any  marketed antidepressant become unavailable during the course of the trial.
  
Each ADT bottle used in the trial will be labeled to clearl y disclose the bottle number, 
Subject ID, subject’s initials, protocol number, ADT drug name, the sponsor's name and 
address, instructions for use, route of administration, and appropriate p recautionary  
statements.  Once an ADT bottle has been assigned to a subject via the IVRS or I WRS, it 
cannot be dispensed to another subject.  The amount of open -label ADT dispensed to a 
subject at each visit will be contingent upon the prescribed daily  dose of ADT as well as 
the duration between trialvisits.  Subjects must remain on the same ADT for the duration 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 75 13Jun 2014of the trial (ie, Screening/Baseline through Week 26/ ET).  An y subject who cannot 
tolerate the minimum protocol -defined therapeutic dose of ADT (s ee Table 3.2.1.2-1) or 
who is required to change from one ADT to another must be withdrawn from the 
trial.
8.2 Storage
Trial drugs will be stored in a securely locked cabinet or enclosure.  Access will be 
limited to the investigators and their designees.  Neit her investigators nor any  designees 
may provide trial drugs to any  subject not participating in this protocol.
Brexpiprazole should be stored according to the storage conditions indicated on the 
clinical label.  The open -label ADTs should be stored as per the individual 
manufacturers’ label recommendations on the package insert or the ADT clinical label.  
The clinical site staff will maintain a temperature log in the drug storage area recording 
the temperature at least once each working day .
8.3 Accountability
The investigator, or designee, must maintain an inventory  record of trial drugs (including 
brexpiprazole and ADTs ) received, dispen sed, administered, and returned.
8.4 Returns and Destruction
Upon completion or termination of the trial, all unused and/or parti ally used IMP
(including brexpiprazole and ADTs) must be returned to Otsuka Pharmaceutical 
Development & Commercialization, I nc. (OPDC )(or a designated contractor).
All IMP returned to OPDC (or the designated contractor) must be accompanied by  the 
appropr iate documentation and be clearl y identified by protocol number and trial 
site 
number.  Returned supplies should be in the original containers (eg, blister cards and 
ADT commercial packaging ).  The assigned trial monitor willfacilitate the return of 
unuse d and/or partially  used IMP.
8.5 Reporting of Product Quality  Complaints
A Product Quality  Complaint (PQC) is any  written, electronic, or verbal communication 
by a healthcare professional, consumer, subject, medical representative, Competent

Confidential -Proprietary Information 78 13Jun 2014In addition, an y contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the pro gress notes as 
described above. Any changes to information in the trialprogress notes or other source 
documents will be initialed and dated on the day  the change is made by a site trialstaff 
member authorized to make the change.  Changes will be made by striking a single line 
through erroneous data, and clearl y entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data).  
If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be 
written in the source documentation by  the clinici an.
Information from the trial progress notes and other source documents will be data entered 
by investigative site personnel directl y onto eCRFs in the sponsor’s electronic data 
capture s ystem.
9.3 File Management at the Trial Site
The investigator will ensur e that the trialcenter file is maintained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the ICH GCP and as required by applicable local regulations. The 
investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction 
of these documents.
9.4 Reco rds Retention at the Trial Site
Regulatory  requirements for the archival of records for this trial necessitate that 
participating investigators maintain detailed clinical data for the longest of the following 
three periods:
A period of at least 2 years fol lowing the date on which approval to market the drug 
is obtained (or if IMP development is discontinued, the date regulatory  authorities 
were notified of discontinuation); OR
A period of at least 3 years after the sponsor notifies the investigator that the final 
report has been filed with regulatory  authorities.
Longer, region -specific storage requirements , if applicable .
The investigator must not dispose of an y records relevant to this trial without either
(1)written permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity  for the sponsor 
or designated agent to collect such records.  The investigator will be responsible to 
maintain adequate and accurate electronic or hard copy  source documents of all 
observations and data generated during this trial, including the eCRF data on the 
CD-ROM and any data clarification forms received from the sponsor (or sponsor’s 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 79 13Jun 2014designee) .  Such documentation is subject to inspection by  the sponsor , sponsor’s 
designee, and relevant regulatory  agencies.  If the investiga tor withdraws from the trial
(eg, due to relocation or retirement), all trialrelated records should be transferred to a 
mutually  agreed upon designee within a sponsor -specified timeframe .  Notice of such 
transfer will be given to the sponsor (or designee) in writing.
10 Quality  Control and Quality  Assurance 
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal ,and scientific obligations to follow this trial in a detailed 
and orderl y manner in accordance with established research principles, the ICH GCP 
Guideline, FDA regulations and applicable regulatory  requirements and local laws .  As 
part of a concerted effort to fulfill these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge 
of the progress of the trial
), the sponsor's monitors or designee will visit the site during
the trial, as well as communicate frequent ly viatelephone and written communication s.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor's Qualit y Management Unit (or representative) may conduct trial site audits.  
Audits will include, but are not be limited to, drug supply , presence of required 
documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs with source 
documents.  The investigator agrees to participate with audits.
Regulatory  authorities may  inspect the investigator during or after the trial.  The 
investigator will cooperate with such inspections and will contact the sponsor 
immediately  if such an inspection occurs.
11
Ethics and Responsibility
This trial must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA regulations, the I CH 
GCP Guideline, and all other applicable local laws and regulatory  requirements. Each 
trial site will seek approval by  an IRB or ECaccording to regional requirements. The 
IRB/IEC will evaluate the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the trial. 
Further, in preparing and handlin g eCRFs, the investigator, sub investigator ,and their 
staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting subject privacy . To this 
end, a subject number and subject identification code will be used to identify  each 
subject.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 80 13Jun 201412 Confidentiality
Allinformation generated in this trial will be considered highl y confidential and will not 
be disclosed to an yone not directly  concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission.  However, authorized regulatory  officials and sponsor pers onnel (or 
their representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and cop y the records.  All 
IMPs , subject bodil y fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely  in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing b ythe sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only  by initials and unique subject numbers in eCRFs.  Per 
country  regulations, if subject initials cannot be collected, another unique identifier will 
be used.  
Their full names may , however, be made known to a re gulatory  agency  or other 
authorized officials if necessary .
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without prior written consent 
from the sponsor (or sponsor’s designee) and subsequent approval by  the IRB/IEC.  Any  
permanent change to the protocol, whether it be an overall change or a change for 
specific trial site(s) , must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any  amendment will be 
written by  the sponsor.  Each amendment will be submitted to the I RB/IEC.  Except for 
non-substantial (ie, administrative) amendments, investigators will wait for IRB/IEC 
approval of the amended protocol before implementing the change(s).  Administrative 
amendments are defined as having no effect on the safet yor phy sical or mental integrity
of subjects, the conduct or management of the trial, the scientific value of the trial or the 
quality  or safet y of IMP(s) used in the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented im mediately , 
followed b y IRB/IEC notification within 5 working days.  The sponsor (or sponsor’s 
designee) will submit protocol amendments to the FDA or other regulatory  agencies.
When the I RB/IEC, investigators ,and/or the sponsor conclude that the protocol 
amendment substantially  alters the trial design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currentl y approved written ICFwill require similar modification.  I n such 
cases, after approval of the new ICF by  the IRB/IEC, repeat informed consent will be 
obtained from subjects in atimely  manner before expecting continued participation in the 
trial.

Instructions to the investigator:
The Sheehan Disability  Scale is a measurement of functional disability  and impairment 
due to psy chiatric s ymptoms. I t consists of 3 functional impairment items and 2 items 
related to productivity  losses due to the sy mptoms and impairment.
The Sheehan Disability  Scale is a self rated questionnaire and should be administered to 
the patient t o be completed on his/her own without the presence or influence of study  
investigator/nurse or other individuals.
You should instruct the patient to report the disability  and impairment experienced during 
the past week due to his/her symptoms . Emphasize t hat y ou will not interfere with the 
completion or have an y comments to the patient’s responses.
Please note that a questionnaire that has been completed by  the patient is considered as 
source data and cannot be amended b y the investigator or an y other ind ividual.

Circle the appropriate score for each item:
1. GAIT
The patient is examined as he walks into the examining room; his gait, the swing of arms, his 
general posture; all form the basis for an overall score for this item.  This is rated as follows:
0Normal
1Mild diminution in swing while the patient is walking 
2 Obvious d iminution in swing suggesting shoulder rigidity
3Stiff gait with little or no arm swing noticeable
4Rigid gait with arms slightly pronated; or stooped -shuffling gait with propulsion and retropulsion.
2. ARM DROPPING
The patient and the examiner both rai se their arms to shoulder height and let them fall to their sides, 
in a normal subject a stout slap is heard as the arms hit the sides.  In the patient with extreme 
Parkinson's syndrome, the arms fall very slowly.
0Normal, free fall with loud slap and re bound
1Fall slowed slightly with less audible contact and little rebound
2Fall slowed, no rebound
3Marked slowing, no slap at all
4Arms fall as though against resistance; as though through glue
3. SHOULDER SHAKING
The subject's arms are bent at a righ t angle at the elbow and taken one at a time by the examiner 
who grabs one hand and also clasps the other around the patient's elbow.  The subject's upper arm is 
pushed to and fro and the humerus is externally rotated.  The degree of resistance from normal to 
extreme rigidity is scored as follow s:
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
4. ELBOW RIGIDITY
The elbow  joints are separately bent at right angles and passively extended and flexed, with the 
subject's biceps observed and simultaneously palpated.  The resistance to the procedure is rated.  
(The presence of cogwheel rigidity is noted separately.)
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint

The w rist is held in one hand and then the fin gers held by the examiner's other hand w ith the w rist 
moved to extension, and both ulnar and radial deviation.  The resistance to this procedure is rated:
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity wit h difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
6. HEAD ROTATION
The patient sits or stands and is told that you are going to move his head from side to side, that it 
will not hurt and that he should try and re lax.  (Questions about pain in the cervical area or difficulty 
in moving his head should be obtained to avoid causing any pain.)  Clasp the patient's head betw een 
the two hands with fingers on back of the neck.  Gently rotate the head in a circular motion 3 times 
and evaluate the muscular resistance to the movement.
0Loose, no resistance
1Slight resistance to movement although the time to rotate may be normal
2Resistance is apparent and time of rotation is slowed
3Resistance is obvious and rotation is slow ed
4Head appears stiff and rotation is difficult to carry out
7. GLABELLA TAP
Subject is told to open his eyes and not to blink.  The glabella region is tapped at a steady, rapid 
speed.  The number of times patient blinks in succession is noted:
0 0- 5 blinks
1 6- 10 blinks
211-15 blinks
316-20 blinks
421 and more blinks
8. TREMOR
Patient is observed walking into examining room and then is examined for this item:
0Normal
1Mild finger tremor, obvious to sight and touch
2Trem or of hand or arm occ urring spasmodically
3Persistent tremor of one or more limbs
4Whole body tremor
9. SALIVATION
Patient is observed while talking and then asked to open his mouth and elevate his tongue.  The

Confidential -Proprietary Information 104 13Jun 2014Global clinical assessment of akathisia
0 Absent .  No evidence of awareness of restlessness.  Observation of characteristic 
movements of akathisia in the absence of a subjective report o f inner restlessness 
or compulsive desire to move the legs should be classified as pseudoakathisia
1 Questionable .  Non- specific inner tension and fidgety  movements
2 Mild akathisia.  Awareness of restlessness in the legs and/or inner restlessness 
worse when required to stand still.  Fidget y movements present, but characteristic 
restless movements of akathisia not necessarily  observed.  Condition causes little 
or no distress
3 Moderate akathisia.  Awareness of restlessness as described for mild akathisia
above, combined with characteristic restless movements such as rocking from foot 
to foot when standing.  Patient finds the condition distressing
4 Marked akathisia.  Subjective experience of restlessness includes a compulsive 
desire to walk or pace.  How ever, the patient is able to remain seated for at least 
five minutes.  The condition is obviously  distressing

Actual Attempt:
A potentially s elf-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  I f there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be consid ered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no 
injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring I ntent: Ev en if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, 
but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anything to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dang erous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? 
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to 
relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior

Interrupted Attempt:   
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for 
that, actual attempt would have occurred).
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an 
attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by 
someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it 
is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose 
around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole :  Open
-label OPC -34712 brexpiprazole will be supplied as 
0.5, 1, 2, and 3- mg tablets packaged in weekl y blister cards, each containing sufficient 
tablets for 7 (+ 2 day s).  Blister cards will be dispensed at each scheduled visit and at 
unschedul ed visits if the dose of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole is changed.  All doses of 
OPC -34712 brexpiprazole should be taken orally  once dail y and can be administered 
without regard to meals.  For convenience, OPC-34712 brexpiprazole may be taken 
with the first dail y dose of ADT.
All subjects will be dosed as follows:
The first dose of open- label OPC -34712 brexpiprazole will be taken one day  after 
the last dose is taken for the double- blind, phase 3 efficacy  trial so that adjunctive 
treatment will continue without interruption.  I t is anticipated that the last dose of the 
double -blind, phase 3 efficacy  trial will be taken the day  of the Week 14 visit of Trial 
Protocol 331 -10-238

open -label trial).  Subjects will initiate open -label dosing with brexpiprazole
0.5mg/day  OPC-34712 for 1 week.  Subjects unable to tolerate brexpiprazole
0.5mg/day  OPC-34712 must be withdrawn from the trial.
The dose of brexpiprazole OPC -34712 will be increased to 1 mg/day  at the Week 1 
visit.  Subjects unable to tolerate brexpiprazole 1mg/day  OPC-34712 may decrease 
to 0.5 mg/day  at an y time after the Week 1 visit.
Investigators may  further increase the dose to brexpiprazole 2 mg/day  OPC - 34712
and then to brexpiprazole 3mg/da y OPC -34712, with an interval of at least one 
week 5 days between dose increases.  An interval of at least one week 5 days
between dose adjustments is recommended for dose decreases; however, the dose of 
brexpiprazole OPC -34712 can be decreased at the inve stigator’s discretion in a step-
wise manner at an y time after the Week 1 visit as needed for tolerability  to a 
minimum of 0.5 mg/day .  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made based upon the 
clinical judgment of the investigator as it relates to tolerabili ty and therapeutic 
response.
Subjects who tolerate a reduced dose of brexpiprazole 0.5mg/day  OPC-34712
should be rechallenged with brexpiprazole 1mg/day  OPC -34712 at least once 
during the trial.  In addition, the dose of brexpiprazole OPC-34712 can be re -
escalated as necessary  following an y dose decrease if, in the investigator’s judgment, 
rechallenge with a higher dose is warranted in order to identify  an optimum dose for 
the subject.  Subjects must return to the clinic for unscheduled visits if changes to the 
dose of brexpiprazole OPC-34712 (increases or decreases) are required between 
scheduled visits.
SYNOPSI S, Investigational Medicinal Product, Dose, Formulation, Mode of 
Administration, ADT , Paragraph 1, Sentences 3 and 4:
It is recommended that the dose of ADT not be changed while the dose of brexpiprazole
OPC -34712 is being optimized (ie, no change to ADT up to and including the Week 4 
visit).  After the Week 4 visit , the dose of ADT can be modified if necessary to achieve 
optimum efficacy  and toler ability  for the treatment regimen using the following rules:  1) 
at least one week 5 days must elapse between dose increases (either brexpiprazole
OPC -34712 or ADT), 2) an interval of at least one week 5 days between dose 
adjustments (either brexpiprazole OPC -34712 or ADT) is recommended for dose 
decreases; however, the ADT dose can be decreased at the investigator’s discretion at an y 
time as needed for tolerability , and 3) subjects must return to the clinic for unscheduled 
visits if changes to the ADT dose are required between scheduled visits.

Section 1, I ntroduction, Paragraph 3:
OPC -34712 (hereafter referred to by the generic name “brexpiprazole”) is an organic 
compound sy nthesized by  Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co, L td, that is a  at 
, , and , an 
antagonist at , and has a  for 
 and   Details of the receptor affin ity profile of OPC -
34712 brexpiprazole are summarized in Section 1.1.1.  Activity  at dopamine and 
serotonin receptors has been shown to be useful in the treatment of ps ychiatric disorders, 
eg, schizophrenia and bipolar mania.  Hence, OPC-34712 brexpiprazol eis expected to 
be a promising antipsy chotic agent.  As the relative activity  at these and other receptors 
appears to be related to the side effect profiles of antipsy chotic drugs,15,16,17,18 OPC -
34712 brexpiprazole may have the potential to exhibit impro ved safet y compared to 
other agents.  The more potent antagonism at 5- HT2A receptors for OPC -34712
brexpiprazole relative to aripiprazole may  afford a more favorable profile with respect to 
sleep quality ; whereas, the low binding affinities for histamine a nd muscarinic receptors 
suggest that OP C-34712 brexpiprazole may have less potential to cause H1- receptor -
related weight gain than olanzapine.  Preclinical data also suggest that OPC -34712
brexpiprazole will have lower potential for h yperprolactinemia than risperidone.  

Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 118 13Jun 2014Results from initial phase 2 trials showed OPC-34712 brexpiprazole to be well tolerated 
by subjects with MDD and schizophrenia (see Section 1.3).
Section 1.1.1, Efficacy  Pharmacology :
OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the D2 receptor.  In in vitro 
assay  systems based on forskolin- induced cy clic AMP accumulation and calcium (Ca2+) 
mobilization in human dopamine D2L receptor- expressing cells, its intrinsic activity  at 
the D2 receptor was slightly  lower than that of aripi prazole, another D2 receptor partial 
agonist.  OP C-34712 Brexpiprazole inhibited apomorphine (APO) -induced 
hyperlocomotion, APO -induced stereoty ped behavior, and conditioned avoidance 
response in rats, which are predictive animal models for antipsy chotic -like efficacy .  The 
inhibitory  effects of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole were more potent than those of 
aripiprazole.  Moreover, in contrast to the D2 receptor antagonist risperidone, OPC -
34712 brexpiprazole did not increase plasma prolactin levels in reserpine- treated rats, 
thus demonstrating a D2 receptor partial agonistic profile in vivo.  Despite its lower 
intrinsic activity  at the D2 receptor, the in vivo cataleps y liability of OP C-34712
brexpiprazole , an index of EPS, was similar to that of aripiprazole, but still lower than 
that of the typical antips ychotic haloperidol.  Furthermore, OPC-34712 brexpiprazole
showed high binding affinity  for the 5 -HT2A receptor and dose -dependently  inhibited 
()-2,5- dimethoxy -4-iodoamphetamine- induced head twitch response in ra ts, indicating 
that the compound has 5 -HT2A receptor antagonistic activity ; the effect of OPC -
34712
brexpiprazole was more potent than that of aripiprazole.  In addition, OPC -34712
brexpiprazole exhibited high binding affinities for the D3 and 5-HT1A receptors, acting 
as a partial agonist at these receptors.
Section 1.1.2, Safet y Pharmacology :
In safet y pharmacology studies in rats at an oral dose of 30 mg/kg or higher, OPC -34712
brexpiprazole induced pharmacologically  mediated clinical signs considered to be due to 
depression of the central nervous s ystem (CNS) and dose -dependent decreases in body  
temperature.  When orally  administered at up to 30 mg/kg in conscious male beagle dogs, 
OPC -34712 brexpiprazole showed no effect on respiratory  parameters or hear t rate at 
any dose tested.  OP C-34712 Brexpiprazole decreased blood pressure at doses of 3 
mg/kg or higher and prolonged both QT interval and corrected QT interval (QTc, b y Van 
de Water's formula) at 30 mg/kg.  OPC-34712 Brexpiprazole inhibited human ether -a-
go-gorelated gene (hERG) current in Chinese hamster ovary  cells (CHO -K1) at 
concentrations of 10−8mol/L  or higher, with a 50% inhibitory  concentration of 1.17 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 119 13Jun 201410−7mol/L .  The mechanism for the blood pressure decreasing effect of OPC -34712
brexpiprazole was suggested to result from a blockade of the 1-adrenoceptor in 
peripheral blood vessels, which is a part of the compound’s pharmacological profile.  
Proarrh ythmic risk was also evaluated by  examining the effects of OPC-34712
brexpiprazole on monophasic action potential parameters in halothane -anesthetized 
dogs.  OPC-34712 Brexpiprazole did not affect the terminal repolarization period even 
at an intravenous dose of 3 mg/kg, suggesting a low potential for proarrh ythmic effects.  
In general, the chang es in the CNS, respiratory , and cardiovascular s ystems observed 
with OPC -34712 brexpiprazole occurred at doses or exposure levels higher than those at 
which efficacy  was confirmed in rats (3 mg/kg), and similar changes were shown to 
occur after administrat ion of risperidone at similar or lower doses.
Section 1.2.1, Pharmacokinetics/pharmacod ynamics:
The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole was 
studied in healthy  subjects and in subjects with MDD, attention -deficit/hy perac tivity  
disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Based on preclinical 
data and human clinical trials, brexpiprazole ( OPC -34712 )and one metabolite, 
DM-3411, were identified as the major analy tes that are present in human plasma.  In 
vitro, the activity  of DM- 3411 is 17 times lower than that of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole
and thus is considered as an inactive metabolite.  Both OPC -34712 brexpiprazole and 
DM-3411 pharmacokinetics were linear following single oral doses of brexpiprazole 0.2 
to 8 mg OP C-34712 to healthy  subjects.  The terminal phase elimination half -life of 
OPC -34712 brexpiprazole and DM -3411 was 48.3 to 80.8 hours and 48.6 to 77.5 hours, 
respectivel y.  The median time to maximum (peak) plasma concentration (t max) occurred 
at approximately  2 to 6 hours postdose for OPC-34712 brexpiprazole and at 
approximately  10 to 24 hours postdose for DM- 3411.  I n healthy  subjects, administration 
of single -dose OPC-34712 brexpiprazole with a high- fat meal did not affect its rate and 
extent of absorption.
Steady  state pharmacokinetics also appeared to be linear following multiple daily  doses 
of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole in the range of 0.5 to 2 mg to health y subjects.  The 
accumulation factor based on maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C max) and area 
under the concentration- time curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time 
t (AUC t) was approximately  4 times.  After multiple dose administration of OPC -34712
brexpiprazole (1 to 12 mg/day ) to subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaf fective 
disorder, OP C-34712 brexpiprazole and DM -3411 mean terminal elimination half -life 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 120 13Jun 2014at stead y state was 95.4 and 89.3 hours, respectively ; median t maxwas 3.0 and 8.0 hours, 
respectivel y.
In drug interaction trials in healthy  subjects, OP C-34712 brex piprazole was shown to be 
metabolized by  CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isozy mes and was not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2B6, CYP2D6, or P -glycoprotein.  Coadministration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 
inhibitors with OPC -34712 brexpiprazole resulted in about a 2- fold highe r exposure and 
about a 1.5 -fold increase in the terminal elimination half life of OPC-34712
brexpiprazole .  Of note, administration of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole with fluoxetine, 
paroxetine, or duloxetine (MDD medications coadministered in this trial) may  potentially  
increase OP C-34712 brexpiprazole plasma concentrations by  up to 2- fold.
In a single -dose trial in healthy  subjects, approximately  46.0% and 24.6% of 
administered radioactivity following an oral dose of 14C-OPC -34712 brexpiprazole was 
excreted in f eces and urine, respectivel y.  In this same trial, OP C-34712 brexpiprazole
did not preferentially  bind to red blood cells.  OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole showed high 
protein binding in human serum ( 99.8%) in vitro.
The binding of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole to dop amine receptors was assessed using 
positron emission tomography (PET).  The mean D2/D3 receptor occupancies at 4 and 24 
hours postdose after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 mg single dose administration of OPC -
34712 brexpiprazole to healthy  subjects were 11.4 % to 17.4%, 36.5% to 46.3%, 45.6% 
to 60.2%, 52.7% to 68.6%, 67.9% to 79.5%, 71.9% to 88.2%, and 69.5% to 92.6%, 
respectivel y (Trial 331- 07-202).  Based on the single -dose D2/D3 receptor occupancy  
data and stead y-state pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic (PK/PD ) modeling, it was 
predicted that the D2/D3 receptor occupancy  after multiple daily  dose administration of 1 
to 2mg and higher doses of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole will result in at least 80% to 
90% D2/D3 receptor occupancy .

brexpiprazole and its metabolites in humans can be found in the Investigator Brochure.19
Section 1.2.2, Major Depressive Disorder
The efficacy  of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole as adjunctive therap y for the treatment of
MDD has been studied in one completed placebo -controlled trial (Trial 331-08- 211).  An 
additional placebo -controlled efficacy  trial (Trial 331 -09-222) and one long -term open -
label safet y trial (Trial 331 -08-212) are ongoing.  Trial 331 -08-211 was a multic enter, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled trial designed to assess the safet y and 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 121 13Jun 2014efficacy  of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole (0.15 to 2 mg dail y) as adjunctive treatment to an 
assigned open- label ADT in subjects with MDD who have demonstrated an incompl ete 
response to prospective treatment with the same ADT.  Subjects with an incomplete 
response after 8 weeks of treatment with single- blind placebo plus open -label ADT were 
randomized to 6 weeks of double- blind treatment with either OPC -34712 brexpiprazole -
plus- ADT or placebo- plus-ADT.  Responders continued to receive placebo- plus- ADT for 
an additional 6 weeks.  Randomized subjects received brexpiprazole 0.15 mg/day OPC
-
34712 , 0.50 0.25 mg/day OPC -34712 , 1.50.50 mg/day OPC-34712 , or matching 
placebo.  S ubjects randomized to the brexpiprazole 0.500.25 mg/day  OPC -34712 and 
brexpiprazole 1.50.50 mg/day  OPC-34712 arms were titrated to the target doses (0.50 
and 1.5 mg, respectively) over a 2 -week period.  Dose adjustments were permitted after 
the subje cts received 1 week of treatment at the target dose.  Subjects who could not 
tolerate the lowest dose ( brexpiprazole 0.15, 0.25, or 1.0 mg/day  OPC-34712 or 
matching placebo, respectively ) were to be discontinued from the trial.  In this trial, 
adjunctive OPC-34712 brexpiprazole dosed at 1.5 0.50 mg/day  was superior to 
adjunctive placebo with respect to the primary  endpoint (change from Week 8 to Week 
14 in Montgomery  Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] Total Score) and several 
secondary  efficacy  endpoin ts.20  Ongoing Trial 331-09-222 is of similar design to Trial 
331-08-211, but is exploring an expanded dose range ( brexpiprazole 1 to 
3mg/day OPC-34712 ).
Section 1.2.3, Schizophrenia, Sentence 2:
The outcome of this trial suggests an active dose range of brexpiprazole 1 to 6 mg/day  
OPC -34712 for the treatment of schizophrenia.21
Section 1.2.4, Other Indications, Sentences 1 and 2:
OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole is being investigated in a proof -of-concept trial in adult 
ADHD (Trial 331-08-213).  This is a multicent er, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, flexible -dose trial in which adults with ADHD who have an incomplete/partial 
response to stimulant therap y in a prospective treatment phase are randomized to double

blind treatment with either OPC-34712 brexpiprazole -plus- stimulant or placebo -plus-
stimulant.
Section 1.3, Known and Potential Risks and Benefits, Paragraph 1, Sentences 1, 4, and 5:
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 122 13Jun 2014As of 31 Dec 2010, 14 clinical trials involving OPC -34712 brexpiprazole have been 
completed worldwide, including 1 0 in the United States (US), 1 in multiple countries 
(including the US), 2 in Japan, and 1 in Korea.  
OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole has been well tolerated by  healthy  volunteers at single doses 
up to 6 mg and at multiple doses up to 2 mg/day .  In patient trials, OPC -34712
brexpiprazole has been well tolerated at multiple doses up to 12 mg/day  in subjects with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, up to 4 mg/day  in subjects with MDD who 
received concomitant ADT, and up to 4 mg/day  in adults with ADHD who rec eived 
concomitant stimulant therap y.
Section 1.3, Known and Potential Risks and Benefits, Paragraph 2, Sentences 1 and 2:
In the 11 completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials performed under the US IND (two phase 
2 trials, one phase 1b trial, and eight phase 1 trials), 673/973 (69.2%) subjects who 
received OP C-34712 brexpiprazole either alone or coadministered with another 
marketed medication reported at least one treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
compared to 158/253 (62.5%) subjects who received placebo either alone or 
coadministered with another marketed medication.  The most common TEAEs reported 
for OPC-34712 brexpiprazole in the completed trials ( 5% in the total OPC -34712
brexpiprazole group and more than the total placebo group) were headache (10. 6%), 
dizziness (8.0%), anxiety (7.1%), akathisia (7.0%), and nausea (5.5%).  
Section 1.3, Known and Potential Risks and Benefits, Paragraph 3, Sentences 3 and 4:
The incidence of serious TEAEs (fatal and non -fatal) that were reported during treatment 
with OPC -34712 brexpiprazole administered either alone or coadministered with 
another medication (19/973 subjects, 2.0%) was comparable to placebo administered 
either alone or coadministered with another medication (4/253 subjects, 1.6%).  
Furthermore, treatme nt with OPC -34712 brexpiprazole does not appear to promote 
suicidal behavior in subjects with MDD or schizophrenia.
Section 1.3, Known and Potential Risks and Benefits, Paragraph 4:
OPC -34712 Brexpiprazole did not result in any  consistent, clinically  relev ant changes in 
laboratory  values, vital signs (blood pressure or heart rate), or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters in the completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in subjects with MDD or 
schizophrenia.  Statistically  significant increases in weight were observed with OPC -
34712 brexpiprazole relative to placebo in both sample populations.  OPC -34712
Brexpiprazole exhibited a favorable profile with respect to movement disorders in 
subjects with MDD at doses up to 3 mg/day  (Trial 331 -09-221) and in subjects wi th 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 123 13Jun 2014schizophrenia at doses up to 12 mg/day  (Trial 331 -08-205).  In the dose -ranging trial that 
enrolled subjects who were experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (Trial 
331-07- 203), an increase in the incidence of EPS was observed at the highest dose (ie, 
brexpiprazole 5.01.0mg/day  
OPC-34712 ).
Section 2.1, Trial Rationale, Paragraph 1, Sentence 4:
As OPC -34712 brexpiprazole demonstrated antagonism at 5- HT2A receptors, the 
attenuated response to SSRI s may  be reversed with coadministration of O PC-34712
brexpiprazole and SSRIs, thus enhancing clinical outcomes.
Section 2.1, Trial Rationale, Paragraph 2:
Because the management of MDD may  require prolonged administration of ADT(s) with 
or without an augmenting agent, safety  monitoring for longer than the period required to 
achieve initial response is warranted.  In the OPC-34712 brexpiprazole clinical 
development program for MDD, phase 2 and phase 3 trials examined the 6 -week safet y 
and efficacy  of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole augmentation of ADTs.  For phase 2, subjects 
who completed either of the trials had the option to enroll into an open -label rollover trial 
in which they  received OP C-34712 brexpiprazole for up to 52 weeks (Trial 331-08-
212).  The current trial (Trial 331 -10-238) provides an open -label rollover option for the 
double -blind phase 3 trials (ie, Trial 331-10- 227 and Trial 331 -10-228) and will expand 
on the knowledge gained in these trials by  assessing the long -term safety , tolerability , and 
efficacy  of OPC
-34712 brexpiprazole when administered concomitantly with 
antidepressant medications .
Section 2.2, Dosing Rational e, Paragraph 1:
A dose range of brexpiprazole 0.5 to 3 mg/day OPC-34712 was selected for the current 
open -label trial to encompass the dose range of the double -blind efficacy  trials (ie, 
brexpiprazole 1 to 3 mg/day  OPC -34712) and to include an option for a reduced dose 
for tolerabilit y (ie, 0.5 mg/day) in order to maximize subject retention in the long -term 
trial.  Therapeutic dose ranges of ADT are based on product labels and clinical practice.  
Data from phase 1 drug interaction trials (Trial 331-08- 207 and Trial 331 -08-208) 
indicated that coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and 
duloxetine) with OPC -34712 brexpiprazole could cause potentiall y hig her plasma 
concentrations of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole (up to 2 -fold).  In order to limit the 
potential higher exposure of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole when coadministered with such 
inhibitors, the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is limited to 40 mg for f luoxetine, 
50 mg for paroxetine CR, and 60 mg for duloxetine in the current trial.

summarized in Table 3.2.2.1- 1.  At least one week 5 days must elapse between dose 
increases for OPC-34712 brexpiprazole .  An interval of at least one week 5 days
between dose adjustments is recomm ended for dose decreases; however, the dose of 
OPC -34712 brexpiprazole can be decreased at the investigator’s discretion in a step-
wise manner at an y time after the Week 1 visit as needed for tolerability  to a minimum of 
0.5mg/day .  Subjects must return t o the clinic for unscheduled visits if changes to the 
dose of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole (increases or decreases) are required between 
scheduled visits.
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the 0.5 -mg/day dose of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole
must be withdrawn from the trial.  However, subjects whose OPC-34712 brexpiprazole
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 127 13Jun 2014dose is decreased to 0.5 mg/day  and who demonstrate adequate tolerability at this dose 
should be rechallenged with a 1- mg/day  dose within approximately  6 to 8 weeks after 
starting the dose is decr eased to 0.5mg/day  dose .  If tolerability  issues arise following 
the rechallenge, the dose may be decreased again to 0.5 mg/day .  Further rechallenge at 
1mg/day  may  be performed at the investigator’s discretion.  The dose of OPC -34712
brexpiprazole can b e re-escalated as necessary  following a dose decrease at any  other 
dose if, in the investigator’s judgment, rechallenge with a higher dose is warranted in 
order to identify  an optimum dose for the subject.  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be 
made based upon the clinical judgment of the investigator as it relates to tolerability  and 
therapeutic response.

Section 4.2.1, Restricted Therapies and Precautions, Paragraph s 7and 8:
Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and duloxetine are pro tocol- defined ADTs in this trial; however, 
they are also CYP2D6 inhibitors.  Data from Trial 331 -08-207 and Trial 331 -08- 208 
indicate that coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors with OPC - 34712 brexpiprazole
can cause potentiall y higher plasma concentrations of OPC -34712 brexpiprazole (up to 
2-fold).  In order to limit the potential higher exposure of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole
when coadministered with such inhibitors, the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is 
limited to 40 mg for fluoxetine, 50 mg for paro xetine CR, and 60 mg for duloxetine.  The 
investigator should consider the potential for higher OPC-34712 brexpiprazole plasma 
concentrations when adjusting the dose of OPC-34712 brexpiprazole for subjects who 
are receiving fluoxetine, paroxetine CR, or du loxetine as the assigned ADT.

baseline and the Week 8 visit as measured by the 17-item 
Hamilton Depression Rat ing Scale (HAM -D17) Total Score ; 
AND a HAM -D17 Total Score  14 at the Week 8 visit; AND a 
Clinical Global Impression -Improvement scale (CGI- I) score 
3 at the Week 8 visit.  Note:  The visit of interest for this 
definition is the Week 8 visit of the do uble- blind phase 3 trial 
(ie, Trial 331 -10-227 and Trial 331- 10-228).
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 140 13Jun 2014Response A term employed to assess prospective response to ADT 
during Phase A of the double -blind phase 3 trials (ie, Trial 
331-10-227 and Trial 331- 10-228) and representing the logical
complement of “incomplete response.”  Response is defined as 
50% reduction in depressive symptom severity between 
baseline and the Week 8 visit as measured by the HAM -D17 
Total Score; OR a HAM- D17 Total Score of < 14 at the Week 
8 visit; OR a CGI -I scor e of < 3 at the Week 8 visit.  Note:  
The visit of interest for this definition is the Week 8 visit of 
the double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Trial 331 -10-227 and Trial 
331-10-228).
Section 2.1, Trial Rationale , Paragraph 2, Sentence 4 :
The current trial (T rial 331 -10-238) provides an open- label rollover option for the
double -blind phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trials (ie,Trial 331-10 -227 andTrial 331-10-
228) and will expand on the knowledge gained in these trials b y assessing the long- term 
safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of brexpiprazole when administered concomitantly  with 
antidepressant medications .
Section 3.1, Ty pe/Design of Trial, Paragraph 1, Sentence 3:
This is a multicenter, 52 -week, open -label trial designed to assess the long -term safet y, 
tolerabil ity, and efficacy  of adjunctive brexpiprazole in depressed adults on concurrent 
ADT.  The trial will be conducted on an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into the trial will be 
drawn from eligible subjects who have completed onethe last scheduled visit of the 
double -blind, phase 3 efficacy brexpiprazole MDD trials(ie, Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 
331-10-228) and who, in the investigator’s judgment, could potentially  benefit from 
adjunctive treatment with oral brexpiprazole for MDD.
Section 3.1, Ty pe/Design of Tri al, Paragraph 3, Screening/Baseline , Sentences 1 and 3:
Subjects will be screened for eligibility  at the last scheduled visit of the prior double-
blind phase 3 trial Trial 331-10-227 or Trial 331-10-228 ( ie, Week 14) .  Subjects will 
sign a separate informe d consent form for participation in Trial 331 -10-238 before any  
procedures specific to the open -label trial are performed.  The assessments from the last 
scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (Week 14 visit of Trial 331-10-
227 or Trial 331-10 -228)will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-10- 238 for 
any assessment that is not unique to the open -label trial.
Section 3.1, Ty pe/Design of Trial, Paragraph 3, Follow-up:
Subjects will be followed upfor safet y via telephone contact or cl inic visit 30 (+ 2) day s 
after the last dose of open- label medication.

0.5mg/day  and who demonstrate adequate tolerability  at this dose should be rechallenged 
with a 1 -mg/day  dose within approximately  6 to 8 weeks after the dose is decreased to 
0.5mg/day .  If tolerabilit y issues arise following the rechallenge, the dose may  be 
decreased again to 0.5 mg/day .  Further rechallenge at 1 mg/day  may  be performed at the 
investigator’s discretion.  The dose of brexpiprazole can be increased re-escalated as 
necessary  following a do se decrease at an y other dose if, in the investigator’s judgment, 
rechallenge with a higher dose is warranted in order to identify  an optimum dose for the 
subject.  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made based upon the clinical judgment of

aScreening for Trial 331 -10-238 occurs simultaneously with Ba seline at the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind trial Week 14 visit of Trial 331 -10 -
227 or Trial 331 -10-228.  All assessments listed under screening need to be performed at Screening/Baseline of Trial 331 -10-238; if any of these 
assessments wer e conducted at the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial, then Screening/Baseline values for those assessments will 
be derived from that visit and those assessments will not need to be repeated at Screening/Baseline of Trial 331 -10-238.
bIf a subject discontinues prematurely before Week 52, procedures noted for Week 52 must be completed at the early termination (ET) visit.
cConsists of telephone contact or clinic visit (investigator’s discretion) for evaluation of safety and applies t o all subjects (completers and early withdrawals).
dInformed consent for Trial 331 -10-238 w ill occur at Screening/Baseline and must be obtained before any trial -related procedures specific to the open -label 
trial are performed.
eUpdate, if necessary.
fScre ening/Baseline value will be obtained from  the Week 14 visit of Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331 -10-228.
gfImprovement should be based on the subject’s status at the last scheduled visit of the prior double- blind phase 3 trial (ie, theWeek 14 visit of Trial 331-
10-227 or Trial 331 -10-228).
hgVital signs include body weight, body temperature, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart r ate.  Blood pressure and heart 
rate w ill be measured in the follow ing order:  supine, sitting, a nd standing after the subject has been in each position for at least 3 minutes.  Vital signs 
scheduled for the same visit as blood samples are to be completed before blood is drawn.
ihStandard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been supin e and at rest for 5 minutes prior to the ECG.  A central ECG service will be 
utilized to review all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the safety analysis.  In addition, ECG results will be evaluated at the investigational 
site to monitor s afety during the trial.  Subjects will be enrolled in Trial 331 -10-238 based on the screening/baseline ECG results from the trial site.  If the

double -blind phase 3 trial ), when available, indicate a QTcF  450msec at screening/baseline, the investigator must contact the medical monitor to discuss 
the subject’s continued participation in the trial.  ECGs sch eduled for the same visit as blood samples are to be completed before blood is drawn.
jiIncludes hematology (including PT, aPTT, and INR), serum chemistry (including prolactin and TSH, w ith reflex to free thyroxin e [T4] if the result for TSH 
is abnormal), and urinalysis.
kkjSubjects must be fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to blood draw s for screening/baseline laboratory assessments (ie, Week 14 visit of Trial 331 -10-
227 andTrial 331 -10-228the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 tr ial).
lkClinical laboratory tests should be drawn fasting, if possible, but must be drawn after a minimum 8 -hour fast at Week 52/ET.  Vital sign and ECG 
assessments should be completed before any blood samples are collected.

Subjects entering Trial 331-10- 238 must sign the ICF for the open-label trial before an y procedures specific to Trial 331 - 10-238 can 
be performed.  Subjects will retain the same subject identification (Subject ID) number assigned in the prior double -blind phase 3 trial
(ie, Trial 331 -10-
227or Trial 331-10- 228).  Screening/ baseline values will be derived from the last visit of the double -blind 
phase 3 trial (ie, Week 14 visit of Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331-10- 228) for the following assessments:  CGI -S, SDS, IDS -SR, 
MSFQ, SAS, AIMS, BARS, C -SSRS, ph ysical examination, waist circumference, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests 
(except for ACTH, cortisol, and HbA1c for some subjects), urine drug screen, blood alcohol, and urine pregnancy test .  The 
only additional following procedures need to be p erformed at Screening/Baseline of Trial 331 -10-238the open -label trial are as 
follows: ; if any of these assessments were conducted at the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial, then 
Screening/Baseline values for those assessments wil l be derived from that visit and those assessments will not need to be repeated 
at Screening/Baseline of Trial 331-10-238.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria for Trial 331 -10-238 will be reviewed to assure the subject’s eligibility .
Medical history  will be updated, if necessary , using information from the prior double -blind phase 3 trial .
Subjects will submit to a physical examination and assessments of waist circumference, vital signs, and ECG.
The investigator (or qualified designee) will administer any scale ( ie, CGI -I and CGI -S).
Subjects will complete any Baseline instrument (ie, SDS, IDS

at this time.
Section 3.6.2.1, Clinical Laboratory  Tests, Paragraph 1, Sentences 1 and 3 :
As it is unlikely  that the final laborato ry test results from the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Week 14 
of Trial 331 -10-227 and Trial 331-10-228) will be available at the time of enrollment in Trial 331- 10- 238, the investigator is to 
review the subject’s most r ecent laboratory test results from the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331 -
10-228) for compliance with the exclusion criteria and the presence of abnormal laboratory  test results that, in the investigator’s 
judgment, are med ically  significant and would impact the safet y of the subject or the interpretation of the trial results.   Subjects 
meeting an y of these criteria will be excluded from Trial 331 -10-
238.  Appendix 4 is included to assist investigators in their 
assessments of results that may  be potentiall y medically significant, depending on the subject’s medical history and clinical 
presentation.  If one or more results from the screening/baseline sample are clinically  significant and/or exclusionary
 when the results 
from t he last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial become available, the test(s) should be repeated.
Section 3.6.2.2.1, Phy sical Examination, Paragraph 1, Sentences 1 and 3:
The complete ph ysical examination at the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Week 14 visit of Trial 331-
10-227 or Trial 331-10-228) will serve as the screening/baseline ph ysical examination for the current protocol.  A complete phy sical 
examination will consist of a review of the following bod ysystems:  HEENT, thorax, abdomen, urogenital, extremities, neurological, 
and skin and mucosae.  Repeat measurement of height is not required during Trial 331 -10-238 if a S screening/ Bbaseline value is 
available from the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial.

appointed designee is to perform the ph ysical examination , he/she must be permitted by  local regulations and his/her name must be 
included on the FDA Form 1572.  Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all ph ysical examinations.  Any  condition 
present at the post- treatment phy sical exam ination that was not present at the screening/baseline exam ination should be documented 
as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
Section 3.6.2.4.4
Suicidality  will be monitored during the trial using the C -SSRS.  Subjects com pleted the “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form at the 
beginning of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331 -10- 228); therefore, onl y the “Since Last Visit” C -

improvement whether or not it is due entirely  to drug treatment.  All responses will be compared to the subject’s condition a t 
Screening/Baseline (ie, Week 14 last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial Trial 331-10- 227 or Tr ial 331 -10-228 ).  
Response choices include:  0 = not assessed, 1 = very  much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally  improved, 4 = no change , 5 
= minimally  worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very  much worse.  A sample of the CGI -I is provided in Appendix 7.
Section 3.6.3.3.3, Resource Utilization Form (RUF), Sentences 2 and 3:
The RUF is a self -report tool designed to collect information regarding the extent of medical care sought by  subjects while 
participating in the trial ( Appendix 15).  The number of hospitalizations and day s of hospitalization within the past 12 months will be 
collected on the Baseline Form at Screening/Baseline, including an y hospitalizations that may  have occurred during the subject’s 
participation in the prior double -blind phase 3 tri alTrial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331 -10- 228.  The number of visits to various

visits occurring during the trial (excluding visits related to the trial) will be collected on the Follow -up Form at Weeks 8, 26, and 
52/ET.
Section 3.8, Screen Failures, Sentenc e 3:
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF ), but 
who is not started on treatment, whether through randomization or open assignment.  For the purposes of Trial 331-10-238, treatment 
begins with the first dose of open- label brexpiprazole in the Treatment Phase.  Subjects who do not qualify  for Trial 331 -
10-238 at the 
last 
scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 trial (ie, Week 14 of Trial 331 -10-227 or Trial 331- 10-228) may not be 
rescreened.
Section 4.1, Prohibited Medications, Sentence 1:
Concomitant medications taken b y subjects who are rolling over into Trial 331 -10-238 from one of the a prior double -blind phase 3 
trials(ie, Trial 331 -10-227or Trial 331 -10- 228) should be reviewed for the prohibited medications listed in Table 4.1-1.
Section 4.2.1, Restricted Therapies and Precautions, Paragraph 4, Sentence 1:
ECT was prohibited during the prior double -blind phase 3 trials (ie, Trial 331 -10-227 and Trial 331 -10-228) and is also prohibited

Section 5.4, Potential Hy’s Law Cases:
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 153 13Jun 2014For a subject that experiences an elevation in AST or ALT that is  3 times the upper normal limit or whose levels increase 3 times 
their init ial screening value , a total bilirubin level should also be evaluated.  If the total bilirubin is 2 times the upper normal limit
or 2 times their screening value , confirmatory repeat laboratory samples should be drawn within 48 to 72 hours of the initi al 
draw.  If these values are confirmed, trial personnel will complete an I RE form with all values listed and also report as an AE on the 
eCRFs.  Please note: If the subject was enrolled into the trial with non -exclusionary elevated transaminase levels at baseline, 
please discuss any potential drug -induced liver injury events with the Medical Monitor.
Section 5.5, Pregnancy :
WOCBP and men who are sexually  active must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the trial and for at least 
30days after the last dose in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized.  Unless the subject is sterile (ie, women who ha ve had an 
oophorectom y and/or h ysterectom y or have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; or men who have had 
orchidectom y) or remains abstinent, two of the following precautions must be used:  vasectomy or,tubal ligation (subject and 
partner) , vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pills, birth control depot injection, birth control implant, condom or 
sponge with spermicide.  Any  single method of birth control, including vasectomy  and tubal ligation, may  fail, leading to pre gnancy .
Section 7.2, Sample Size:
The sample size is not based on statistical power considerations.  The trial population will be derived from eligible subjects from the 
prior double -blind phase 3 brexpiprazole MDD trials (ie, Trial 331 -10-
227and Trial 331 -10- 228).  Therefore, the number of eligible 
subjects will be limited by  the number of subjects enrolled into these protocols.  Based on the projected enrollment estimates for the 
prior double -blind phase 3 trials (ie, Trial 331 -10-227 and Trial 331 -10- 228),up to approximately up to 3,0001280 subjects may  
enroll into Trial 331 -10-238.

necessary to conduct this trial in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practices and as 
described herein and in the sponsor's (or designee's) Clinical Rese arch Agreement.
I will provide copies of the protocol to all physicians, nurses and other professional personnel to 
whom I delegate trial responsibilities. I will discuss the protocol with them to ensure that they are 
sufficiently informed regarding the investigational new drug, OPC -34712 , the concurrent 
medications, the efficacy and safety parameters and the conduct of the trial in general. I am 
aware that this protocol must be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent 
Ethics Committ ee (IEC )responsible for such matters in the clinical trial facility where 331-10-238 
will be tested prior to commencement of this trial. I agree to adhere strictly to the attached 
protocol (unless amended in the manner set forth in Paragraph I of the spon sor's Clinical 
Research Agreement, at which time I agree to adhere strictly to the protocol as amended).
I understand that this IRB -or IE C-approved protocol will be submitted to the appropriate 
regulator y authority/ies by the sponsor. I agree that clinic al data entered on case report forms by 
me and my  staff will be utilized by the sponsor in various ways such as for submission to 
governmental regulator y authorities and/or in combination with clinical data gathered from other 
research sites, whenever appl icable. I agree to allow sponsor monitors and auditors full access to 
all medical records at the research facility for subjects screened or enrolled in the trial.
I agree to await IRB/IEC approval before implementation of any protocol amendments to this 
protocol. If, however, there is an immediate hazard to subjects, I will implement the amendment 
immediately, and provide the information to the IRB/IEC within 5 working day s. Administrative 
changes to the protocol will be transmitted to the IRB/IEC for info rmational purposes only.
I agree to provide all subjects with informed consent forms, as required by the applicable

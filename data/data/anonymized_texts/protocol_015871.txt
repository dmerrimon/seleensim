2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
2.1 Indication to be Studied  
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intratracheal (IT) dose  of 
rhCC10 to intubated premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of 
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)  to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to  as 
chronic respiratory morbi dity (CRM ; asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respiratory infections ).  
Traditionally, short term predictors of CRM have involved the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysp lasia 
(BPD). However, t he clinical definition of BPD has changed several times over the past decade.  The 
current consensus method for determining BPD is assessing oxygen requirements at 36 weeks 
corrected gestational age (CGA) using a target oxygen saturation range of 88 -94% or through oxygen

CONFIDENTIAL  5 challenge testing . However a cohort of premature infants followed to 18 -22 months CGA demonstrated 
that this definition correctly pr edicted CRM only 35 -40% of the time, although accuracy increased as 
the severity of BPD worsene d. A major problem for investigators studying BPD is that premature infants 
who do not develop BPD can also suffer CRM and have lung function abnormalities at fo llow-up. In 
view of these significant methodologic difficulties, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the NIH and 
FDA have recommended that clinical trials should evaluate CRM in the first 1 -2 years of life as a 
potentially more meaningful outcome.  
Extremel y low gestational age i nfants (ELGANs) with RDS are at particular risk of developing 
BPD, a condition associated with marked inflammation , injury  to small airways , and arrest of 
alveolarization  that is believed to result in CRM .  BPD is associated with significant morbidity (asthma, 
repeated pulmonary infections, re -hospitalizations) and mortality, and affects up to 15,000 infants in the 
US annually. The lungs of p remature infants are deficient in factors that regulate inflammatory  
responses  (including CC10). This is critically important since intrauterine infection and inflammation are 
believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of preterm delivery as well as acute and chronic lung injury.  
These factors  are normally present in the  term lung in preparation for the transition to the extrauterine 
environment . RDS and the associated immature lung structure require rescue  with exogenous 
surfactant  and support with supplemental oxygen and positive pressure mechan ical ventilation, which 
amplifie s lung inflammation , injury , fibrosis , and impaired lung development .   
2.2 Study Drug  
 The study drug , rhCC10 , is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein.  Native CC10 
is produced primarily by non -ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, called Club ( Clara ) cells and is the most 
abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs.  CC10  circulates in the blood and is 
excreted in the urine. The recomb inant version is nearly identical to the native protein and shares all 
biological properties with the native protein that have been characterized thus far.  rhCC10  is produced 
in E. coli  bacteria.  
The rhCC10  drug formulation to be used in this study  is a clear, colorless liquid formulated in 
unbuffered normal saline (0.9%) at a concentration of 5.5 mg/ml.  It is aliquoted into sterile septum -
capped, 2 ml glass vials and stored at 4ºC.  rhCC10 is stable under these conditions for at least 1 4 
years and  stable at room temperature for at least 18 months. This formulation has been administered 
by IT instillation in premature infants and by intranasal instillation in healthy adults.  
Drug administration : In the previous pilot clinical trial in premature inf ants, a single dose  (1.5 and 5 
mg/kg/dose)  of rhCC10 was administered by IT instillation within 24 hours of birth in intubated 
premature infants treated for surfactant deficiency . In the present study, administration of rhCC10 will

CONFIDENTIAL  6 be nearly identical to t he first clinical trial , however, in the present study the administration  of study 
medication to each lung will be specifically instilled  over not less than a 30 second period (duration of 
instillation not specified in first trial).  In addition, just prior to instillation, adjust ventilator settings as 
follows:   
 Increase PIP by 1 -2 cm H 2O 
 Increase the rate to 35 (if not already there)  
 Increase FiO 2 by 5-10% 
 
Dose selection : The  IT dose  will replicate the single IT doses of 1.5 mg/kg a nd 5.0 mg/kg from the 
previous clinical study. Doses will be calculated based on the patient’s birth weight. )   
2.3 Rationale for the Clinical Study  
BPD is a disorder characterized  by marked inflammation and alveolar  hypoplasia , affect ing 20-
60% of extremely low birth weight preterm infants. It is associated with significant mortality and short - 
and long -term morbidity . Long-term morbidities include CRM such as asthma  and repeated respiratory 
tract infections during  infancy that lead to increased hospitalizati ons and treatments with asthma 
medications . Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes , retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and other 
significant morbidities of prematurity occur at increased frequency in infants with BPD. While 
exogenous surfactant therapy has reduced the overall severity of BPD, the prevalence of BPD has 
increased with improved survival of these infants. New treatments to prevent BPD and subsequent  
CRM  are urgently needed.  
There is ample  rationale for s tudying CC10 supplementation  in these patients . The phenotypes 
of two different strains of CC10 knockout mice indicate that CC10 is an autocrine factor required for the 
normal development of non -ciliated airway epithelial cells, including Club ( Clara ) cells. CC10  regulates 
inflammatory responses  and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary tissue while  preserv ing 
pulmonary mechanical function d uring various insults ( e.g. viral infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone , 
allergens,  hyperoxia ). Together these properties suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to 
facilitate development of normal airway epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CRM in 
these infants.    
2.4 Non-Clinical Studies: Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies  
Native CC10 is produced primarily by non -ciliated respiratory epithelial cells and is the most 
abundant protein in normal adult lungs, constituting up to 7% of the total extracellular protein. Native 
CC10 is synthesized by a number of tissues including the lu ngs, pancreas, uterine endometrium, 
prostate, and seminal vesicles. The normal physiological tissue distribution for CC 10 includes all 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  7 mucosal tissues  except the eye s and central nervous system . The concentration of endogenous CC10 
in the blood ranges from  10-120 ng/ml in normal, healthy adults and up to 5 g/ml in patients with renal 
dysfunction. From the blood, CC10 enters numerous tissues and organs and is also excreted in the 
urine. Several studies have found significantly lower endogenous CC10 protein concentration and 
expression  in the lungs of preterm infants who died or developed severe BPD , suggesting an integral 
role of this protein in normal lung homeostasis .  
The CC10 protein has potent anti -inflammatory and anti -fibrotic properties as demonstrated by 
numerous in vitro  and in vivo  studies.  Although there is no consensus as to the central mechanism of 
action, CC10 may mediate many of its short term anti -inflamm atory effects through its role in vesicle 
and protein trafficking in Club ( Clara ) cells. Respiratory epithelial cells in CC10 knockout mice 
demonstrate a lack of secretory vesicles and the presence of unusual intracellular structures 
characterized by multi -layer stacked membranes  and disproportionate amounts of Golgi, rough 
endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomal compartments  compared to respiratory epithelial cells from non -
knockout mice . In the longer term, CC10 may mediate effects through development and /or 
maintenance of airway epithelia l cells , including Club ( Clara ) cells (autocrine function) , which secrete 
the majority of native CC10 in the lungs and circulation.  
rhCC10 follows the natural physiological distribution path for the native protein from  lung to 
blood and blood to urine. The circulating half -life of rhCC10 is 2 -2.5 hours, which is prolonged to 9 -11 
hours by an uptake phase when administered to a mucosal surface ( intratracheal instillation ). The 
circulating half -life decreases slightly with incr easing dose, sugges ting active clearance of the protein. 
Although all tissues and or gans are exposed to  CC10, tissues that primarily take up excess rhCC10 
include the lungs (airways and alveoli) , esophagus, and thyroid.  Not only is excess circulating rhCC10 
taken up specifically by the lungs, but also small amounts of protein actually reach the extracellular 
mucosal fluid where it is detected in tracheal aspirate fluid ( TAF) and bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid 
(BAL).  
Several t oxicology studies have be en conducted with no evidence of acute or chronic toxicity or 
any significant tissue pathology, including IT administration in newborn piglets (n=86), premature lambs 
(n=22), premature baboons (n= 4), and juvenile rabbits (n= 18).  No evidence of acute or chronic toxicity 
was observed in adult cynomolgus monkeys that received seven daily intranasal doses of rhCC10. No 
evidence of acute or chronic toxicity was observed in juvenile rats that received 14 daily IV doses of 
rhCC10 .  Several models of acute lung injury and infection  (RSV, influenza)  have demonstrated the 
protective effects of rhCC10  (by different routes of administration ) without evidence of toxicity.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 2.5 Previous Human Experience  
2.5.1  Previous Clinical Trials  
 Two Phase 1/2 clinical trials have been conducted with rh CC10.  Both studies indicated that 
rhCC10 appeared to be safe and well -tolerated. rhCC10 demonstrated potent anti -inflammatory activity 
and long er term benefit s in patients who were deficient in native CC10.  
The first  trial was performed in premature infants with RDS, in which a single dose of rhCC10 
was administered by IT instillation.  Two dose levels of rhCC10 (1.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) were evaluated 
in a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation design , conducted at 3  clinical 
centers  in the US .  A total of 22 infants were enrolled in three groups including placebo  (n = 7), low 
dose (n = 8), and high dose (n = 7).  Two infants in the study died. The first had received 1.5 mg/kg of 
rhCC10 and died of complications of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ).  The second had received 5 mg/kg 
of rhCC10 and died of complications  from respiratory failure.  Neither death was deemed to be 
attributable to the study drug.  Significant reductions in total protein content, neutrophil counts, and total 
cell counts were observed in TAF in rhCC10 -treated infants compared to placebo  control s (unusual in 
this small a study population) . At the six month CGA  follow up, data were collected for a total of 17 
patients on measures of CRM  (one infant from each experimental group was lost to follow up) .  
Interestingly, none of the CC10 -infants (0/11) had been re-hospitalized for respiratory causes  following 
NICU discharge , while 50% (3/6) of the placebo infants had been re-hospitalized for respiratory causes.  
The prevention of acute inflammation and preservation of norma l airway and alveolar development may 
contribute to this long term benefit . No anti -rhCC10 antibodies were detected in sera collected from all 
infants at 28 days of life.  
   The second trial was performed in healthy adults wit h seasonal allergies  in which rhCC10 was 
administered by intranasal instillation (1.1 mg per day for seven consecutive days).  The study was a 
placebo -controlled, double -blinded, cross -over design at a single center in Sweden.  Patients were 
previously characterized with allergies to tree pollen but were otherwise healthy. Each subject was 
given a  daily intranasal instillation of rhCC10 immediately prior to receiving an intranasal instillation of 
allergen. This nasal allergen challenge (NAC) causes a mild inflammatory response in the n asal 
epithelia. Total nasal symptoms scores  (TNSS)  were documented within 30 minutes of each challenge. 
Repeat intranasal administration of rhCC10 did not affect TNSS in this model , but also  raised no safety 
or tolerability concerns. No blood was taken in this study  and it is not clear whether intranasal dos ing 
resulted in systemic exposure .

CONFIDENTIAL  9 2.5.2  Non-Therapeutic Studies of Human CC10 Physiology  
Several  studies have examined the concentrations of endogenous CC10 in premature newborn 
infants and found that CC10 concentration in pulmonary fluids is directly proportional to gestational age .  
A variety of methods have been used to detect and measure native CC10 in these studies including 
radioimmunoassay, ELISA, and LC-mass spectrometry. The consensus findings are t hat pulmonary 
CC10 expression and protein levels in lung  fluids are low in ELGANS  and increase over time with 
increasing gestational age.  Rapid increases in CC10 levels in TAF occur following premature birth.  No 
studies have been performed  to document CC10 TAF levels in term infants with normal lungs. One 
study documented  that CC10 mRNA is detectable in human fetal lungs as early as week 16, with the 
protein becom ing detectable in amniotic fluid around week 22 , and rapidly  increas ing after week 28 
then plateau ing at week 32 (~ 1 g/ml; a pattern similar to  surfactant proteins ). Another study showed 
that CC10 levels are lowest in preterm infants who die or develop BPD compared to those who do not, 
and that a greater proportion of the native C C10 in patients who die or dev elop BPD is oxidized .  It is 
notable that CC10  is also produced by the uterine endometrium and the placenta during the first and 
second trimester s of pregnancy, such that the fetus is exposed to CC10 throughout pregnancy and 
before the fetal lungs start producing it.  
2.6 Potential Risks  
 Human CC10 is a natural product of respiratory epithelia and is normally present in the 
extracellular fluid of the lung, as well as amniotic fluid . The clinical protocol proposes to supplement low 
endogenous CC10 levels in the lungs of premature neonates with a recombinant human protein. Thus, 
we do not expect immunogenicity to be a problem.  Peak concentrations of rhC C10 in lung fluid and 
blood of infants  to be treated may exceed normal adult levels, but should be well within the ranges 
explored in non -clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies. rhCC10 has been tested in non -clinical 
toxicology studies at doses up to  25 mg/kg (IT) and 2 mg/kg (IV).   
CC10 is transcriptionally upregulated in the lungs by corticosteroids . Therefore, patterns of toxicity  
secondary to excessive CC10  that could occur secondary to treatment with corticosteroids were 
specifically examined  in the first study in preterm infants and in all animal pharm/tox studies. Although 
no such toxicities  have been detected , these effects will continue to b e monitored closely  in the present 
studies . 
The pharmacokinetic analysis of CC10 in TAF fluids in th e first trial demonstrated  a trend  that 
native CC10 expression was h igher in day 3  TAF of placebo infants than in CC10 -treated infants.  
Although t he number of day 3  TAF samples was extremely limited (n= 2-3/group  due to many infants

Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  10 being extubated ), there is a possibility that administration of exogenous rhCC10 may transiently 
suppress expression of the native protein in the lungs. This will be closely monitored during the present 
trial. 
There was a higher incidence of confirmed (n= 3) and suspected  (e.g. radiologic; n=5) NEC  in 
rhCC10 -treated infants compared to the placebo group  (P=NS) . This was not thought to be due to 
administration of study drug, since the NEC occurred 3-6 weeks after rhCC10 administration and 
because other infants in the NICU  who were  not enrolled in the study also developed NEC at the same 
time.  (NEC is known to occur in clusters). H owever, the incidence and severity of NEC , as well as 
other infectious related AEs (e.g. sepsis, pneumonia, etc.)  will be closely monitored during this study .  
3 OBJECTIVES OF THE ST UDY  
 The purpose of the placebo -controlled study is to deter mine the efficacy  of a single  IT dose  of 
rhCC10 (1.5 and  5 mg/kg  in a 2 ml/kg  fixed volume ) in improving survival without CRM as indicated by 
a reduction in  respiratory complications  12 months CGA  (using validated respiratory diaries and 
pulmonary questionnaires, see Appendices D, E, and F). Based on these data, f uture studies will be 
designed to determine whether administration of rhCC10 to neonates with RDS is effective in improving 
survival without  CRM . 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 This study is designed as a randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled phase 2 trial. The study will 
enroll premature i nfants with a gestational age of 24 -29 weeks who are receiving positive pressure 
mechanical ventilation and surfactant replacement therapy for treatment of RDS . Placebo ( normal 
saline ) will be compared to two dose  groups of rhCC10 as shown in Table 1 :

CONFIDENTIAL  11 A total of 8 8 patients will be enrolled in  three treatment groups in  which  high and low dose 
rhCC10  will be compared to placebo . A total of 44  patients will receive placebo, 22  patients will receive 
1.5 mg/kg rhCC10 , and 22  patients will receive 5 mg/kg rhCC10.  Complete results  of the study should 
allow direct com parison of three groups . 
Patients enrolled in the study will meet the prescribing criteria for Survanta  or Curosurf  and will 
receive the usual recommended clinical dose of surfactant replacement therapy.  Each patient will then 
receive a single IT dose of the study drug (or placebo) within  four hours after surfactant. Patients may 
be given subsequent doses of surfactant if r equired, but will not receive  additional dose s of rhCC10.  
Concentrations of rh CC10 will be evaluated in serum  derived from the infant, umbilical cord , or 
placental blood before drug administration and in serum  or plasma  and urine on day s 1 and 28, and 12 
months CGA . TAF will be  obtained  on similar days  if the infant is  still intubated  to evaluate the effects of 
a single IT  dose  of rhCC10 on native CC10 expression in the lungs . Total protein, TH2 cytokines, IL -6, 
and cellular infiltrates will also be evaluated in TAF samples, to the extent permitted by the volume of 
patient samples  collected .

 5 minute Apgar score of ≤ 5  (ie. 1 -5); except in cases where the subject’s Apgar score is ≤ 5 
at 5 minutes , normalizes by 10 minutes , no acidosis is present on cord blood gas and the 
neonatal depression is thought to be due to maternal anesthesia or other drug exposure 
such as MgSO 4.   
 Major congenital abnormalities  (chromosomal, renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic, or 
pulmonary malfor mations; minor anomalies such as cleft lip/palate are permitted);  
 Evidence of severe neonatal depression  (as defined by cord blood pH < 7.00 and/or an 
Apgar score of < 4 at 10 minutes) ;  
 Evidence of congenital infection  (bacterial or non -bacterial) ; 
 Require s a major surgical procedure prior to administration of Study drug  
 Enrollment in any other study involving administration of another investigational drug;  
 Any condition which could preclude receiving study drug or performing any study -related 
procedu res; 
 Use of postnatal corticosteroids  prior to administration of rhCC10 , exce pt as specified in the 
protocol;  
 Use of inhaled nitric oxide  prior to administration of rhCC10 ; 
 Mother is known to be  seropositive for HIV or HTLV -1 (per maternal medical records) ; 
 Parent or guardian is unable or unwilling to complete the study  diary after hospital 
discharge;  
 Parent or guardian is unable to bring the infant back to the study  center for follow -up 
evaluations  after discharge.  
5.3 Randomization  
As previously described, tw o dose levels will be evaluated against the placebo in two 
consecutive cohorts. The first cohort will randomize patients to receive either 1.5 mg/kg or placebo.  
The second cohort will randomize patients to receive either 5 mg/kg or placebo.  Each cohort w ill 
randomize 44 infants to either placebo or drug treatment.  The overall design is 2:1:1; 44 (placebo):22 
(1.5 mg/kg):22 (5mg/kg).  The randomization scheme was developed and is maintained by StudyTrax, 
a secured electronic data capture platform that is compliant with 21 CFR-11 and HIPAA .  A 
randomization ID is generated when a subject is randomized using the format TMC -001, BWH -002, and

Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  13 so on  (i.e. 3 letter site designation and th ree numbers designating the sequence in which the patient 
was enrolled) .  The randomization scheme uses the permuted block randomization method, with 
stratification by site and by gestational age group (divided into 24 -27 wks CGA and 27 -29 wks CGA), 
with block sizes  2,2,4.  For Cohort 1, treatment groups are:  Placebo and 1.5  mg/kg.  When Cohort 1 is 
completed, Cohort 2 treatment groups will be:  Placebo and 5.0 mg/kg.  Cohort is also listed as a 
Stratification factor so that when Cohort 2 starts, any open blocks from the first cohort will not be filled.  
The Cohort is automat ically set to 1 at the start of the study.  Once Cohort 1 is done and Cohort 2 
starts, that will change.  Each site’s pharmacy will receive authorization to access the patient 
randomization assignment via the Internet on StudyTrax.  
The randomization assign ment must not be disclosed to anyone outside the pharmacy.  
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and are successfully enrolled will be assigned a patient 
Randomized ID number.  Due to the time critical nature of managing the respiratory support  of the 
subject and  dosing with study medication, it is permissible for the patient to be randomized before 
receiving the first dose of surfactant. The patient Randomization ID number  and the birth weight of the 
patient will then be communicated to the pharmacy  on a paper form requesting  study medication . The 
pharmacist will then access the StudyTrax randomization assignment on the Internet. The patient will 
be assigned to one of the three groups (placebo, low dose or high dose) as appropriate to the cohort, 
and an  opaque syringe containing an appropriate dose of the study drug or placebo will be sent to 
study personnel in a sealed envelope. In order to administer the study drug within 4 hours of surfactant 
administration, the patient’s birth weight should be commun icated to the pharmacy as soon as it is 
available. The syringe received from the pharmacy will be identified only with the patient Randomization  
ID number  and will contain 1.5 – 3.1 mL of solution, depending on the birth weight of the patient. 
StudyTrax wi ll hold the key to patient treatment assignments, which will not be disclosed until the end of 
the study.  
  Given the small size of the study and the simple randomization scheme, it is possible that a 
significant discrepancy may exist among the treatment groups in birth weight and/or gestational age.  
Any such difference will be taken into account in evaluating the results of the study.  
5.4 Withdrawal Criteria  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study by a parent or legal guardian or by the attending 
physician  at any time.

CONFIDENTIAL  14 6 TREATMENT PLAN  
6.1 Baseline Examination  
 Examination prior to administration of the study drug (and preferably prior to surfactant 
administration) will include at least the following components:  
 Physical examination, including determination of body weight;  
 APGAR score;  
 SNAPPE II score  (performed within first 12 hours of life);  
 Chest radiograph , if available ; 
 Blood sample (for electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, CBC with differential and 
platelets, CC10 concentration);  and 
 TAF sample  taken prior to surfactant administration  (if possible ) for cell counts and 
concentration s of CC10, total protein, sIgA, and cytokines.  
 Urine  sample , if available  
 Stool  sample , if available  
All blood samples for CC10 concentration determinations will be limited to ~ 200 microliters each of 
whole blood  to be separ ated to yield  serum.  
6.2 Surfactant Administration  
Survanta  or Curosurf  will be administered according to the prescribing instructions.  Subsequent doses 
of surfactant  may be administered at any time a t the discretion of the attending physician.  
6.3 Study Drug Administration  
 The study drug will be administered to patients within four hours after surfactant administration , 
but no sooner than 30 minutes after surfactant . Just prior to administration of the s tudy drug, the 
following adjust ments  to the ventilator settings should be done : increase the PIP by 1 -2 cm H 2O, 
increase the rate to 35 breaths/min (if not already there) and increase FiO 2 by 5-10%. The study drug 
should be administered  IT in two aliquots. Initially, half the dose will be instilled into one lung (via a pre -
measured feeding tube placed into the distal third of the endotracheal tube with the patient in a lateral 
decubitus position and 30o of Trendelenburg), then the second al iquot will be given into the other lung 
in a similar fashion.   The administration of the study medication to each lung will be specifically instilled 
over not less than a 30 second period.  No further study medication will be provided after the first day o f 
life. 
6.4 Subsequent Examinations  
During the initial 4 -week, post-dosing period ( 28 days) , serum, urine, stool, and TAF sa mples 
will be taken on days 1  (baseline)  and 28.  If possible, samples will also be collected on days 7, 14, and

CONFIDENTIAL  15 21 only if scavenged blood from clinical specimens is available. Serum and urine samples for CC10 
analysis will also be collected on visit 20 (see table 3). TAF samples on day 28 will only be collected if 
the infant is still intubated.  
A schedule of clinical and pharmacological evaluations is shown in Table 2.  During the initial 
active -treatment period , formal study visits and procedures will be performed on a weekly basis. 
Weekly formal study visits will review concomitant medications, adverse exper iences, collection of vital 
signs, growth parameters (weight, length, head circumference ), physical and neurologic examinations, 
respiratory status (days of mechanical ventilation, days of nasal CPAP, oxygen requirements), 
nutritional support data and safe ty laboratories (electrolytes, glucose, calcium, hepatic and renal 
function, complete blood count with differential). Maternal history including smoking, atopy, and asthma 
will also be collected. In order to document that initial severity of illness is com parable between groups, 
a Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology Version II  (SNAPPE -II) will be recorded during the initial visit. 
Cranial sonography to detect intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH) will be performed within 7 ± 2 days of 
enrollment and to detect p eriventricular leukomalacia ( PVL) within 28 ± 2 days per standard of care for 
infants of this gestational age.

6.5 Monitoring and Management of NEC  
NEC is a severe inflammatory response in the GI tract that can occur in preterm infants .  The 
causes of NEC are not well understood . One hypothesis is that increased risk is associated with  
abnormal  colonization of the GI tract by pathogenic bacteria  compa red to those that normally colonize 
term infants .  NEC may also be related to ischemic bowel injury from peri - or postnatal hypotension or 
sepsis, absence of maternal antibodies against colonizing organisms, and presence of a patent ductus 
arteriosus with exposure to indomethacin or ibuprofen. T he incidence and severity  of NEC  will be 
documented on the CRF and compared between treatment groups  (along with other SAE) .  NEC 
treatment protocols are standard, but a standardized approach will be outlined in the MOO, which will 
include  NPO with antibiotic coverage for 10 – 14 days in the presence of concerning clinical , laboratory  
and/or radiographic  findings  (e.g. pneumatosis, fixed and dilated  bowel loops, portal air) or 
surgery/drainage if  the surgeon indicates that this is needed .  
6.6 Longer -Term Patient Follow -Up 
Infants surviving to discharge will be followed up at each center’s Neonatal Follow Up Program 
until at least 1 8 months  CGA , as specified in section 6.4 .  Infants will have physical examinations and

Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  18 formal neurodevelopmental testing, including a Bayley II I neurodevelopmental examination at 18 
months CGA  (considered the gold standard for assessing neurodevelopmental follow -up).  At the site’s 
discretion, p atient parents/caregivers will be offered a monetary  incentive of $50  for each of three 
follow -up visits, including bringing the infant to the hospital  visits at 6, 12, and 18 months CGA along 
with the return of 28 -day diaries due at each visit.  
6.7 Procedure for Collection of Samples  
All samples will be labeled only with the type of sample (e.g. serum, TAF, urine, stool), the 
patient Randomization ID number, and the time and date of collection.   
Blood Samples for Electrolytes, CBC and Liver and Renal Function .  These samples should be 
collected according to standard hospital procedure and tested at the hospital laboratory.  Initial blood 
will be obtained from the umbilical cord or placenta, if available.   Infant serum or plasma  will also be 
obtained from scave nged samples, if available.  
Blood  Samples for Anti -CC10 Antibody and CC10 Assay . A single blood sample is required for 
both tests. Approximately 200 L of whole blood will be placed into a serum microtainer, allowed to clot 
for about ten minutes at room te mperature, and then spun in a clinical centrifuge.  The serum will be 
transferred to a sterile microtube and stored at –20oC for analysis by the sponsor. Initial blood will be 
obtained from the placenta  or cord , if available.  Drawing of blood required for CC10 tests will be 
coordinated with collection of blood samples required for routine lab tests, and if possible, from central 
lines.  The total maximum amount of blood to be drawn from each infant for CC10 -specific testing for 
the entire proto col (12 months ; 3 samples ) is about 3.1 mL.  
TAF Samples .  TAF samples will be obtained by placing 1 mL of sterile saline into  the 
endotracheal tube, followed by ventilation. A suction catheter is then passed with secretions aspirated 
into a Leukens trap  or other suitable collection device .  The catheter is then rinsed with an additional 1 
mL of sterile saline.   TAF samples will then be spun at 300 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The 
supernatant will then be transferred to a clean labeled tube and frozen immediately at -80o C.  Frozen 
TAF supernata nts will be transferred to the S ponsor when sample collection is complete. For samples 
requiring cell counts, t he cell pellet will then be resuspended in 100 L of sterile saline  and sent to the 
hospital lab for determination of cell counts and differentials by standard methods.   TAF samples will be 
collected prior to surfactant administration (if medically possible) since suctioning shoul d be avoided 
after surfactant is given for 1 -2 hours. TAF samples will continue to be collected  weekly  if the infant is 
still intubated (see tables 2 and 3).  
Urine and Fecal Samples .  When  urine is  collected for urinalysis in  the hospital laborato ry using 
a bag , excess  urine  collected  should be reserved for CC10 analysis by the Sponsor. (Note: Urine 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  19 samples collected using cotton balls are not useful for CC10 measurements and should not be 
collected for the study.)  Each urine sample should be stored  at –20oC in a sealed plastic tube that is 
labeled with the patient Randomization ID, time and date.   Fecal material may also be collected from 
each infant within the first 24 -48 hours of life for further analysis of CC10  and oxidized CC10  by the 
Sponsor .  Fecal material  will be  stored in a sealed plastic tube and  labeled with the patient ID, time, and 
date, and stored at -20°C.  
6.8 Analysis of Samples  
Blood Samples for Electrolytes, CBC and Liver and Renal Function .  Hospital laboratories will 
carry out these tests. These will include CBC with differential and platelets; serum electrolytes, glucose, 
BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin  (total and direct) , total protein and albumin.  
Spots of Whole Blood for CC10 Genotyping .  The Sponsor will carry out these tests by 
extracting genetic material from spotted blood , amplifying the CC10 gene sequences, and sequencing 
across  the four known alleles of the human CC10 gene that are associated with respiratory and 
autoimmune disorders . 
Serum Samples for Anti -CC10 Antibody and CC10 Assay .  The Sponsor will test for a nti-
rhCC10 antibody with standard titrations performed using serial dilutions of serum to bind rhCC10 
coated onto 96 -well plates .  Following this,  an anti -human IgG will be used to detect anti -rhCC10 
antibodies. To measure rhCC10 in serum, the CC10 ELISA described in the IND CMC section will be 
used.  To measure oxidatively modified/damaged CC10, a new ELISA has been  developed.  
TAF Samples . The clinical sites will measure cell  counts (total cells, neutrophils, etc.) . The 
Sponsor will carry out immunoassays to measure CC10 , sIgA, and cytokines ( TH2 panel, IL -6, TNF-, 
IFN-; Lumine x and ELISA ). The Sponsor will also use the BCA assay to measure total protein in TAF.  
Urine  and Fecal  Samples . The Sponsor will  measure u rine and fecal CC10 using the ELISA .  
6.9 Concomitant Medications  
No other investigational drugs may be administered to patients enrolled in the study.  
Medications that may be indicated as part of standard care fo r this group of patients will be 
administered as needed. Postnatal c orticosteroids  (other than hydrocortisone utilized for the treatment 
of early hypotension/adrenal insufficiency)  will be avoided, except in cases in which the att ending 
physician determines that the infant’s life would be jeopardized without their use.  The MOO  will include 
a recommended protocol for postnatal corticosteroid treatment for severe respiratory failure  if the 
clinic ian feels this therapy is warranted.

CONFIDENTIAL  20 Other medications that have a small, but significant impact on the incidence of BPD include 
Vitamin A and caffeine. Vitamin A is not used in either clinical site and caffeine is administered to all 
infants within the first 48 -72 hours of life (will be seen equally in rhCC10  and placebo treated infants). 
The impact of all medications will be examined in the final statistical analysis.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Serious, Life -Threatening or Unexpected Adverse Events  
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event .  Any medical event associated with  the use of the drug 
will be considered a Serious Adverse Event if it results in death, a life -threatening adverse event, 
prolongation of inpatient hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity , or a 
substantial disruption of the ab ility to conduct normal life functions .  Important medical events that may 
not result in death, be life -threatening or require prolongation of hospitalization may be considered 
Serious Adverse Events if, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeop ardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   
Clarification of SAE definition .  In the context of the definition of an SAE, the phrase “associated 
with the use of the drug” means that the event is associated with a patient enrolled in the trial and is 
being reported as a result of the trial.  (This is not the same as relatedness of th e drug to the event. )  
An SAE is any adverse event occurring at any dose that ; 1) results in  death, 2) is life -threatening , 3) 
results in prolongation of inpatient hospitalization, 4) is likely to lead to  a persistent or significant 
disability or incapacit y (including a medically significant event that may require medical or surgical 
intervention to treat or prevent one of the outcomes , as described  in Section 7.3 , Section 7.4,  and 
Appendix A) ,or 5) results in a substantial disruption of the ability to cond uct normal life functions.  In the 
context of this trial re -hospitalization for any reason following initial NICU discharge (in follow -up period) 
is also an SAE.  An SAE may be related or unrelated to study medication or study procedures and 
relatedness is  not a consideration in the determination of whether an event is an SAE.  
Definition of a Life -Threatening Adverse Event .  Any medical event associated with the use of 
the study drug will be considered a Life -Threatening Adverse Event if it places the patient, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event .  Any Adverse Event associated with the use of the 
study drug will be considered an Unexpected Adverse Event if, in the view of the investigator, it is not 
consistent with the typical incidence and severity of the same or similar e vent among similar patients at 
the same institution  or it is not listed in the investigator brochure .

CONFIDENTIAL  21 7.2 Reporting of Serious, Life -Threatening or Unexpected Adverse Events  
Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events .  Adverse Events that are either  serious and /or 
unexpected must be reported to the S ponsor and CRO as soon as possible after the occurrence. Such 
events must be reported by the S ponsor to the FDA in writing as soon as possible after the occurrence 
but in no cas e more than 7 days (expedited) or 15 days  (non-expedited)  after the S ponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.    
Unexpected and Fatal or Life -Threatening Adverse Events . Adverse Events that are unexpected 
and are life -threatening or result in death must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as poss ible after 
occurrence. Such events must be reported by the S ponsor to the FDA by facsimile , mail, email,  and/or 
by courier  as soon as possible after the occurrence , but in no c ase more than 7 days after the 
Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
All serious, life -threatening, or unexpected adverse events will be reported to the Medical 
Monitor and to the CRO within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event using the CRO’s 
secured e -mail portal.   
7.3 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting.  
Some Adverse  Events are of particular importance or concern in the patient population being 
treated. The purpose of monitoring Serious Adverse Events is to allow the independent DSMB to 
suspend enrollment in the study if there appears to be a higher incidence of such events among the 
treated patients than would be expected in a comparable group of premature infants (a difference may 
be considered clinically significant even though it is not statistically significant due to small patient 
numbers).  
For the purposes of th is study, the following will be considered Serious Adverse Events:  
 Air leak, including pneumothorax, pulmonary  interstitial emphysema ( PIE) and , 
pneumomediastinum  significantly impairing gas exchange ; 
 Pulmonary hemorrhage  (requiring blood products and escalating ventilator support) ; 
 Grades III/IV IVH, PVL, seizures;  
 Confirmed NEC ( >Bells stage II, based on attending Neonatologist diagnosis);  
 ROP Stage 3 or 4;  
 Overwhelming sepsis (early and late  – associated with shock );  
 Pneumonia  
 Death

Adverse Events of Nosocomial Infection (specific definitions)  
Since rhCC10 is an immunomodulatory  protein, special attention will be paid to the AEs associated with 
nosocomial infection, with a particular emphasis on sepsis, pneumonia, NEC, UTI, and meningitis.  A 
diagnosis of nosocomial infection may be difficult in an intubated neonate and definitio ns vary.  It is 
recognized that an inflammatory process can arise in the absence of infection.  Since uniform reporting 
is required, the terms sepsis and pneumonia should be reserved for those AEs meeting the criteria 
defined in Appendix A.  In the absence  of documented infection, manifestations of a systemic 
inflammatory response should be listed by underlying etiology or by symptom.  Separate summaries of 
adverse events associated with nosocomial infection will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by the site  
investigators and the Sponsor and reported to the DSMB, the site IRBs, and FDA as soon as possible 
after recognition of their importance.  
7.5 Criteria for Suspension of the Trial (Stopping Rules).  
The DSM B will receive information on the occurrence of Se rious  Adverse Events on an ongoing 
basis as patients are enrolled and treated in the study.  They will receive the reports and the 
assignment  of infants to groups A, B, or C . If serious adverse events are increased in one group

CONFIDENTIAL  23 compared to the other, then the randomization code will be used to determine which of the reported 
Serious  Adverse Events occurred in patients treated with the study drug.  If the DSM B determines at 
any point during the study, using appropriate medical judgment, that there appears to  be a greater 
incidence of Se rious  Adverse Events related to the study drug among the treated patients than would 
be expected among similar p atients  (even if not statistically significant) , they will contact the  PI and  
Sponsor and enrollment of patients will be suspended until a determination can be made as to whether 
the events are  related to administration of the study drug.  
8 EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
Several measures of efficacy in reducing respiratory morbidity in the short and long term will be 
explored .  The trends and effects observed in this study will be used to determine  appropriate efficacy 
outcome variables and  the numbers of infants that would be required to be enrolled in a larger Phase 2 
or Phase 3 study.    
8.1 Primary E ndpoint : Long Term Efficacy  – 12 months  
The primary  outcome of the study will be survival without CRM  through  12 months CGA as 
measured by a validated respiratory diary based scoring system (presence of wheezing and/or 
coughing 2 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks)  and pulmonary questionnaires ( decrease in 
respiratory illness requiring medications , unscheduled medical visits and/or ER or hospital admissions ) 
which have been shown to correlate closely with abnormalities on pulmonary function testing . The 12  
month CGA endpoint has been shown to be more predictive of respiratory morbidity at two years of life 
than a diagnosis of BPD at 36 weeks CGA in previous studies of high frequency oscillatory ventilation 
in preterm infants.   
8.2 Secondary Endp oints: Long Term Efficacy – 6 & 18 months  
A secondary outcome of the study will be survival without CRM through  6 months CGA as 
measured by validated respiratory diaries (presence of wheezing and/or coughing 2 days per week for 
3 consecutive weeks) and pul monary questionnaires (decrease in respiratory illness requiring 
medications and/or hospitalization) which have been shown to correlate closely with abnormalities on 
pulmonary function testing.  Infants will be also be evaluated by physical examinations at  18 months 
CGA to evaluate respiratory status, growth , and neurological development.   
8.3 Second ary Endpoint s: Short Term Efficacy  
Short term efficacy evalu ations will include time of mechanical ventilation , oxygen requirement at 36 
weeks CGA, and survival without BPD at 36 weeks CGA  (or NICU discharge)  as measured by oxygen 
challenge testing.  Oxygen challenge testing involves the withdrawal of supplemental oxygen for a 30 
minute  period , during which the infant is closely monitored .  At the end of the 30’ pe riod, oxygenation as

Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  24 measured by pulse oximetry  is recorded  and the infant is placed back on supplemental oxygen. The 
infant ’s BPD status is then de termined by oxygen saturation ; a diagnosis of BPD will be made if the 
infant’s oxygen saturation is 90% or less  (<90%)  at or before the end of the thirty minute period.  If the 
infant’s oxygen level remains above 90% for the entire period, then the diagnosis will be “No BPD”.  
Failure to  complete the test due to respiratory distress would be scored as severe BPD.   The severity of 
BPD will be assessed using NIH consensu s guidelines  for infants born at <32 weeks PMA  based on 
oxygen requirements at 28 days post -natal age and at 36 weeks PM A or at NICU discharge (whichever 
comes first) , as described in  Jobe and Bancalari . (2001 ), as follows:   
NIH criteria for assessing severity of BPD  
Gestational age at birth             < 32 weeks PMA  
Time point of assessment  36 w eeks PMA or DC home, whichever comes first  
Treatment with oxygen > 28 days plus 
Mild BPD  Breathing room air at 36 weeks PMA or DC , whichever 
comes first  
            Moderate BPD  Need * for <30% oxygen at 36 weeks PMA or DC , 
whichever comes first  
           Severe BPD  Need * for >30% oxygen and/or positive pressure (PPV 
or NCPAP) at 36 weeks PMA or DC , whichever comes 
first 
Definition of abbreviations:  BPD = bronchopulmonary dysplasia; NCPAP = nasal continuous positive airway pressure; PMA = 
postmenstrual ag e; PPV = positive -pressure ventilation; DC = discharge.  
* Physiologic n eed for oxygen is determined by oximetry during oxygen withdrawal challenge.

8.4 Secondary Endpoint s: Safety and Efficacy - Adverse Events  
  The s afety of the study drug will continue to be assessed by comparing the incidence of adverse 
events and serious adverse events in the treatment and placebo groups to each other and to the 
historical incidence of the adverse events at each institution. Safety evaluations will include all serious 
adverse events up to  at least 12 months CGA , and routine laboratory monitoring prior to NICU 
discharge (CBC, electrolytes, liver function studie s, urinalysis, head ultrasound) .  In addition to 
evaluating the safety of rhCC10, preliminary  efficacy of rhCC10 in this patient population may also be 
indicated by decreases in the numbers of all SAEs and/or specific types of SAEs  (ie. IVH, PVL, ROP, 
sepsis, infection, etc.).

CONFIDENTIAL  25 8.5 Statistical Considerations.  
Power Analysis:  A total of 88 preterm infants will be randomized to placebo, lower dose, or 
higher dose rhCC10 with an allocation ratio of 2:1:1.  The primary analysis will be the comparison of 
placebo versus  both rhCC10 dose groups combined.  The prior trial demonstrated that the two doses 
are likely to yield similar results.   Two doses  will be used  for the purpose of extending the safety profile 
for each individual dose, as that safety data may facilitate th e choice of dose for a future Phase III 
confirmatory study.  For SAEs or AEs with background rates of 5%, 10%, or 15%, the sample size of 22 
in either dosing group will provide a probability of observing it of 68%, 90%, and 97%, respectively.  
The proposed  trial is powered for the comparison of the two doses combined versus placebo for the 
composite endpoint of death or development of CRM.  Secondarily, the study will yield effect size 
estimates for each individual dose versus placebo.  Our assumptions rega rding the comparison of 
placebo versus rhCC10 are based on the previous study with 7 placebo, 8 lower dose, and 7 higher 
dose infants (one infant in each of the rhCC10 treatment groups died).  It is important to address the 
combined endpoint of death or re -admission to the hospital for respiratory problems.  In the previous 
study, one loss -to-follow -up occurred in each of the three experimental groups and one death occurred 
in each of the rhCC10 groups.  At 6 months, 3 of the 6 infants on placebo with follo w-up were re -
admitted to the hospital for respiratory problems and none of the 11 subjects treated with either rhCC10 
dose with follow -up data were re -hospitalized. A realistic and conservative assumption for the 3 lost -to-
follow -up babies is that they all  either died or had respiratory disease.  Then the proportions with 
disease or death on placebo and rhCC10 are assumed to have been 0.57 and 0.27.  If the proportions 
in the proposed study are similar, with 44 subjects on placebo and 44 subjects in the two  dose groups 
combined, power will be 82% with =0.05.  nQuery Advisor version 6 was used.  
Data will be summarized for the total cases and by treatment group with respect to: 1) baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics and 2) efficacy and safety ob servations and measurements. 
Analyses will be conducted on both the intention -to-treat (ITT) and ‘per protocol’ cases.  Between -
treatment or between -group comparisons will be examined using chi -square tests ( or Fisher’s Exact 
tests when cell frequencies ar e small) for categorical outcomes and Student t -tests (alternatively, 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) for scalar measures. Two -sided statistical tests will be conducted and the 
significance level will be set at 0.05 for each primary test. The efficacy and safety a nalyses will be 
conducted on both the ITT and per protocol population. ITT cases will be all randomized subjects who 
receive the study medication, while per protocol cases will be randomized subjects who complete the 
study (including all cause deaths) with out any major deviations from the protocol procedures. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to detail the sample characteristics. Between -treatment arm

CONFIDENTIAL  26 differences on key baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be tested. This latter step wil l 
be used to identify potential pre -treatment covariates for subsequent secondary analyses. Key baseline 
variables include race, gender, length, weight, head circumference, SNAP PE-II score, and gestational 
age. Descriptive statistics for the total exposure  to study drug during the treatment period (number of 
doses), timing of initial study dose, timing of discontinuation in the event of early termination, and rate 
of study dropout will be provided. Between -treatment differences will be tested using the stat istical 
methods described earlier. Concomitant medications will be summarized by 
therapeutic/pharmacological class and treatment group. In addition, they will be listed by treatment 
group, name of drug, dates administered, dose, frequency and indication.  
Efficacy evaluation: If CC10 is mor e efficacious than placebo, the  CC10 treatment groups  will 
have a higher rate of survival without BPD at 36 weeks CGA and/or survival without CRM at 12 months 
CGA  (we are exploring which of these factors are more accurate predictors of long term respiratory 
morbidity) . A 2 x 2 chi square test will be conducted to examine treatment differences in this binary 
endpoint  and Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be construc ted and any differences between the 
treatments will be tested using a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model. Secondly, a logistic 
regression will be employed to further detail the main and interaction effects of treatment and centers 
on the primary out come. Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be provided. 
Subjects who die  from respiratory causes  before 12 months CGA will be considered treatment failures 
in both the ITT and per protocol analyses, and the last observation carried forw ard (LOCF) imputation 
method will be applied for early dropouts. For those subjects without diary data at any time point, 
respiratory status will be estimated based on available data during the follow -up period, including O 2 
challenge test, pulmonary quest ionnaires, and use of asthma medications.

CONFIDENTIAL  28 APPENDIX A :     DEFINITIONS OF SPECI FIC ADVERSE EVENTS  
CRITERIA FOR ADVERSE  EVENTS A SSOCIATED WITH NOSOC OMIAL INFECTION , 
AIR LEAKS AND PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE  
 
1. Sepsis  
A number of terms confuse the definition of sepsis, including infection, bacteremia, sepsis syndrome, 
and septic shock.  For the purpose of this study, only the term sepsis should be used for AE reporting.  
Sepsis occurring in the first 3 days after birth (early onset) is considered congenital and should be 
recorded under past medical history, not as an AE.  Sepsis will be defined as the systemic inflammatory 
response to infection, with criteria adapted from the Centers for Dise ase Control (CDC) Surveillance of 
Nosocomial Infection Control Program.  All infants with suspected sepsis should have at least 2 sets of 
blood cultures from 2 separate sites, a urine cul ture and a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) culture, with other 
cultures a s determined by the investigator.  If a central line is in place, one blood cult ure should be 
drawn from the ce ntral line (if possible) and one peripherally.  A diagnosis of sepsis will require meeting 
at least one clinical sign or symptom, one invention s urvey, and one therapy condition.  
Definition of nosocomial sepsis  
Clinical signs/symptoms Criteria - must meet at least one  
Lethargy  
Fever (>38°C), hypothermia (<37°C) or t emperature instability  
Apnea (increase in frequency and severity from baseline)  
Bradycardia (< 100 beats/min) or tachycardia (>170 beats/min) (increase frequency and severity from 
baseline)  
Hypotension (mean bp > 10 mm hg below the gestational age with capillary refill time > 5 secs and/or 
metabolic acidosis on a blood gas)  
Oliguria  (<1 ml/kg/hour over a 12 hour period)  
Infection survey Criterion – must meet  
No apparent infection or alternative cause at another site  
Therapy Criterion – must meet  
Anti-infective drugs given for > 4 days  
While all cases meeting the definition of nosocomial  sepsis must be recorded as AEs, additional 
information will be collected on each episode to permit classification of the diagnosis into definite, 
probable, and no agent identified. Criteria for confirmation of a case of definite sepsis require 
microbiolog ic confirmation of an infecting organism.  All cases of definite sepsis must meet one of the 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  29 criteria defined above .  In addition to meeting the definition of nosocomial sepsis, cases of probable 
sepsis will have one positive blood culture for coagulase ne gative staphylococcus.  
Criteria for the confirmation of a diagnosis of definite sepsis  
One blood culture positive for all bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens other than coagulase negative 
staphylococcus.  
Two positive blood cultures coagulase negative st aphylococcus  
One positive blood culture and one culture from an otherwise steril e site (CSF, joint, pleural, or 
peritoneal fluid , bone or deep tissue abscess material) Coagulase negative staphylococcus; urine is 
excluded as a sterile site unless from a sup rapubic tap  
Nucleic acid testing , Latex fixation , or PCR assay  
Diagnostic single -antibody titer (IgM) or 4 -fold increase in paired sera (IgG) for pathogen  
2. Pneumonia  
Although pneumonia is an important nosocomial infection in the NICU, the diagnosis is often  difficult to 
make due to the inadequacies of current diagnostic methods. For the current trial, pneumonia will be 
more rigorously defined according to the Centers for Disease Control  prevention algorithm.  Pneumonia 
occurring in the first 3 days after bir th (early onset) is  considered congenital and should be recoded 
under past medical history, not as an AE.  All AEs of pneumonia must meet at least one radiographic, 
one gas exchange, and 3 clinical or vital signs criteria listed below.  Respiratory manifes tations not 
meeting these criteria should be listed by an alternative etiology (i.e. pneumothorax, aspiration, 
sepsis, etc.) or by symptom (i.e. apnea, bradycardia).  
Definition of nosocomial pneumonia  
Radiographic Criteria – must meet at least one  
Persiste nt new or progressive infiltrate consistent with infection (interstitial, bronchial, or alveolar)  
Consolidation  
Cavitation  
Abscess  
Pneumatocele  
Gas exchange Criteria – must meet at least one  
Oxygen desaturation episodes (increased in frequency and severity  from baseline)  
Increased oxygen requirement of at least 10 percentage points  
Increased ventilation requirement  
Clinical/vital signs Criteria – must meet at least 3  
Cough

Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  30 Wheezing, rales or rhonchi  
Apnea, tachypnea, nasal flaring with retraction of chest w all, or grunting  
New onset of lower respiratory tract secretions , change in character of secretions, or increase in the 
quantity of secretions  or suctioning requirements  
Temperature instability  
Bradycardia (<100 beats/min) or tachycardia (>170 beats/min)  
While all cases meeting the definition of nosocomial pneumonia must be recorded as AEs, additional 
information will also be collected on each pneumonia episode to permit classificatio n of the diagnosis 
into probable  or definite pneumonia.  Criteria for conf irmation of a case of definite pneumonia require 
microbiologic confirmation of an infecting organism.  All cases of definite pneumonia must meet one of 
the criteria defined below.  
Criteria for the confirmation of a diagnosis of pneumonia  – must meet at lea st one  
Endotracheal aspiration >106 cfu/ml  
Bronchoscopy with BAL >104 cfu/ml  
Positive blood culture for a respiratory tract pathogen  
Positive pleural fluid cultures  
Isolation of virus or detection of viral antigen in respiratory secretions  
Diagnostic single -antibody titer (IgM) or 4 -fold increase in paired sera (IgG) for pathogen  
Histopathologic evidence of pneumonia  
PCR or other genomic identification of respiratory pathogen from lower respiratory tract specimen  
3. Air leaks  
The group of AEs comprising “air leaks”, and including pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial 
emphysema  (PIE), and pneumomediastinum , are typically related AEs and often occur in the same 
patient.  Pneumothorax occurs when air collects in the pleural space between the lung and chest wa ll 
and can make breathing difficult.  PIE occurs in connection with pneumothorax and is detected by 
radiologic imaging of the lungs. Pneumomediastinum occurs when air leaks into the mediastinum , 
putting pressure on the heart and lungs . 
Pneumothorax  
Definitive diagnostic criteria for pneumothorax include increased requirement for respiratory support 
and chest X -ray showing free air in the chest, collapsed lung and/or displacement  of the heart and 
mediastinum . The most serious cases of pneumothorax req uire a chest tube to alleviate the pressure 
on the affected lung.  
PIE 
Therabron Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Clarassance, Inc.)  
Clinical Protocol  
Recombinant CC10 Protein  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  31 PIE is diagnosed radiologically  and appears as small round, oval, and/or linear pulmonary lucencies 
which may be focal or diffuse. Lung volumes are increased and the heart size decrease s as 
intrathoracic pressure increases.  If subpleural cysts rupture, PIE potentially may lead to pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastinum, or even pneumopericardium.    
Criteria for the confirmation of a diagnosis of PIE.  Confirmation of a diagnosis of PIE is made  by a 
second neonatal radiologist who concurs with the positive diagnosis.   
Pneumomediastinum  
Pneumomediastinum is confirmed radiologically when a radiolucent outline around the heart and 
mediastinum is observed in the thoracic cavity.  
 
Air leak s can be life-threatening. For purposes of this study, all air leak AEs will be reported as SAEs 
and followed closely.  
 
4. Pulmonary Hemorrhage  
Pulmonary hemorrhage occurs when blood leaks into the lungs of infants in respiratory distress.  It is 
diagnosed by an increased requirement for respiratory support, bradycardia, drop in blood pressure, 
and is often associated with patent ductus arteriosis  (PDA) .  Severe pulmonary hemorrhage is treated 
with increasing end expiratory pressure and supportive  blood transfusion s. This condition can be life -
threatening and will be reported as a SAE.

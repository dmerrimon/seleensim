Primary 
Endpoint:  Change from baseline in Drop  Discomfort VAS  score 1 -minute post Dose 1 
instillation .  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Key Secondary Endpoints : 
• Change from baseline in Drop Discomfort  VAS  score   
• Change from baseline in each of the 6 Individual Symptom Severity 
Assessments (VAS)  score s 
• Change  from baseline in the sum of the Individual Symptom Severity 
Assessments score (VAS  Total Symptom Summary Score )  
• Change from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Ey e (SANDE ) 
score  
• Change from baseline in unanesthetized STT score   
• Change  from baseline in Fluorescein Corneal Staining (FCS) total 
score ( National Eye Institute (NEI)/Industry Workshop 0- 15 scale)   
Safety Endpoints : 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Change from screening in BCVA   
• Changes from baseline in Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy  
• Changes from screening in Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
Procedures:  At Visit 1 ( screening) informed consent will be obtained from subjects and 
eligibility will be determined . A Schirmer Tear Test (STT) will be performed at 
this visit. The score will be used as the baseline and eligibility. During this visit, 
all subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus® , in both 
eyes to assess ability to self -admini ster study product.  At Visit 2 (Randomization) 
continued eligibility will be confirmed. During this visit, all subjects will self -
administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus® , in both eyes to evaluate ability 
to tolerate ocular drops . Individuals who are unable to successfully instill the drops 
or who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable, based on a post -instillation 
Drop Discomfort  VAS  score , will not be eligible for participation in the study. 
(Note:  For subjects meeting the Screening and Rand omization Criteria, the Visit 2 
Drop Discomfort  VAS score will be used as the baseline value.)   
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 9 of 95 
 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment 
groups: VOS BID or Restasis® BID. The first instillation of IP will be 
administered, at least 2 -hours following administration of Refresh Plus® and by 
clinic personnel to both eyes (OU) during Visit 2. I nvestigational Product  will be 
administered to the subject by a n unmasked dedicated dosing coordinator (the  
subject and the  Investigator will be masked to study treatment  for the first post 
randomization instillation ). Tolerability, safety and efficacy assessments will be 
performed at this visit.  
At Treatment Visits 3 and 4, tolerability , safety  and efficacy evaluations will be 
performed. At the End of Treatment, Visit 5 , tolerability, safety and efficacy 
evaluations will be performed. Subjects who discontinue before Visit 5 will 
undergo all Visit 5 evaluations (Early Termination). IP will be administered to the 
subject by a dedi cated dosing coordinator  at the clinic visits . A Drop Discomfort  
VAS will be administered in the clinic at 1 and 5 minutes following instillation of 
IP at Visits 2 through 5  (Investigator is to remain masked) . With the exception of 
clinic day visits, subje cts will self -administer IP twice a day OU over the 4 -week 
treatment period. On the evening of Visits 2 through 4 and in the evening prior to 
Visit 5 , the study coordinator  will contact the subject by phone to prompt 
administration of IP followed by comple tion of the dosing diary and the Drop 
Discomfort  VAS (1 - minute and 5 -minutes post -instillation).   
At Visit 6, there will be a 3 -day post -treatment Follow -Up, in which safety 
assessments are performed and all remaining study materials are collected. The subjects will be instructed to continue to withhold all other concomitant topical 
medications as outlined by the protocol for the duration of their participation 
(through Visit 6).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) ongoing as of Visit 6 will be followed until th ey 
have resolved, stabilized in the opinion of the Investigator, or returned to baseline.  
This study will be conducted per the schedule shown in the Schedule of Events  
(Table 1 ) and the Study Schematic ( Figure 1). 
Sample Size:  The study will include 60 male or female subjects.  
• The primary analysis will assess the difference in change from baseline 
in Drop Discomfort  VAS  scores 1-minute post -Dose 1 instillation  
between the two treatment groups . 
• A sample size of 26 subjects per group (52 in total) will provide at least 
90% power assuming:  
o a mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of 
+30 mm for subjects randomized to Restasis® 
o a mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of 
+10 mm for t hose randomized to VOS  
o a common standard deviation of 21 
o a 2-sided alpha of 5%  
• Under the same assumptions, the study will have at least 80% power if the common standard deviation for the discomfort score were to be 25 . 
• The study also provides 80% power should the treatment difference in 
discomfort scores be 16 (common standard deviation =20) . 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 10 of 95 
 • To allow for 15% dropouts, a total of 60 subjects will be randomized . 
Statistical 
Methods:  The primary endpoint is measured on a VAS and will be summarized and analysed  
as continuous data. Summaries of VAS scores (absolute and change from baseline) 
by treatment group will be displayed for each VAS assessment (minutes 1, 5 and 
overall mean) at each visit. Should the data meet the necessary assumptions 
(normality a nd equal variance in both treatment groups) then the treatment groups 
will be compared using a t -test. If assumptions are violated , the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test will be used.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options  
Dry Eye Disease (DED), also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is a common clinical 
problem as over 7 million people in the U nited S tates experience dry eye symptoms.  
Symptoms of DED include a sensation of dry eyes, foreign body sensation, irritation, burning, 
tearing, ocular pain, and itching , among others.  DED affects quality of life and work 
productivity, and patients with moderate to severe DED may experience reduced visual 
function in addition to ocular dysfunction.  
DED is  a multi- factorial disease, defined  by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and 
accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyper -osmolarity, ocular 
surface inflammation and damage , and neuro- sensory abnormalities play etiological roles  [1].  
DED patients are classified by the overlapping etiologies of aqueous deficient and evaporative dry eye.  Evaporative dry eye tends to be more prevalent than aqueous deficient ; however, as 
the disease progres ses, both components become apparent [1].  The common pathway for both 
groups is that desiccating stress leads to ocular surface inflammation [7,10,12]   
1.1.1 Limitations of Current Treatment 
Current therapy includes a stepped approach which starts with over the counter  (OTC)  
lubricants and artificial tear replacements, and then expands to include topical anti -
inflammatory therapy and punctal occlusion [1]. There are currently two FDA -approved 
prescription medication s used for DED, topical cyclosporine ( Restasis®) and lifitigrast 
(Xiidra®).  A significant number of patients using Restasis® experience the following 
problems: ocular irritation upon instillation, slow onset of response, and limited efficacy  
(Restasis® Package Insert , see Appendix 8) .  Problems with Xiidra® include instillation 
irritation, dysgeusia  and reduced visual acuity which occurred in 5-25% of subjects in clinical 
trials ( Xiidra® Package Insert ). There is a clear unmet clinical need for improved therapeutic 
options for patients with moderate to severe DED. 
1.2 Rationale for the Use of Calcineurin  Inhibitors in Dry Eye Disease  
In patients with DE D, tear production has been shown to be increased with the use of topical 
immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine. It is believed T -lymphocyte infiltration and 
activation in the lacrimal gland represents an underlying pathogenesis for DED. Calcineurin 
inhibitors (CNI s) reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 23 of 95 
 
 
 T-lymphocytes, in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cy cle and also reversibly inhibit the 
production and release of lymphokines  [9].  Calcineurin is a calcium - and 
calmodulin -dependent serine -threonine phosphatase. CNIs inhibit the ability of calcineurin to 
dephosphorylate the nuclear factor of activated T -cells (NFAT), which is required for 
translocation of NFAT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby preventing activation of 
various transcription factors necessary for the induction of cytokine genes during T -cell 
activation (e.g., interleukin -2, interleukin- 4, tumor necrosis factor -α, granulocyte-macrophage 
colony stimulating factor, and interferon-γ,[ 11,13]) . 
Voclosporin is a next generation CNI that is currently being evaluated for a variety of systemic 
and topical indications. Voclosporin is structurally similar to  cyclosporine A  (CsA), except for 
a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid- 1 residue of the molecule. This 
alteration has changed how voclo sporin binds calcineurin leading to an improved potency 
when compared to CsA .  This modification has also changed the metabolic profile of 
voclosporin by shifting metabolism away from amino acid- 1 which is the major site of 
metabolism for CsA. The altered metabolic profile has led to a faster elimination of metabolites resulting in lower metabolite exposure as compared to CsA. The combination of increased 
potency and decreased metabolite exposure, for voclosporin as compared to CsA, has led to 
better pharma cokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) predictability.  
1.2.1 Non-Clinical Studies of Voclosporin in Dry Eye 
Two Good Laboratory Practice  toxicology studies [3,4]  have been conducted to evaluate the 
safety of voclosporin ophthalmic solution (VOS ) in the eye of the New Zealand White (NZW) 
rabbit and the Beagle dog with dosing for 14 days. Test animals were euthanized on Day 15, 
and recovery animals were sacrificed on Day 29. Animals received two, four, or eight bilateral 
topical applications of 0.2% VOS within 8 hours daily, corresponding to doses of 
approximately 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 mg/eye/day, respectively. Control animals received 8 doses 
of the vehicle within 8 hours daily. Safety was evaluated using macroscopic and mi croscopic 
ophthalmologic evaluation, tonometry, electroretinography (ERG) evaluation, gross and microscopic pathology of the eyes (including optic nerve), submandibular lymph nodes, spleen 
and thymus, and hematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation parameters. Blood voclosporin 
concentrations were obtained on Day 1 and Day 13 at pre -dose, 8, 8.5, 10 and 12 hours after 
the first VOS instillation.  
In the NZW rabbit study, no VOS ocular treatment -related changes in serum chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, gross pathology or organ weights were found at the completion of the dosing period or following a 14- day recovery (without treatment). Similarly, no 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 24 of 95 
 
 
 treatment -related macroscopic or microscopic ophthalmological changes or effects on 
intraocular pressure associated with the administration of VOS were reported. There were no 
histologic findings in the spleen, thymus, or rostral and caudal sections of the mandibular 
lymph nodes. A standard battery of bilateral full -field flash ERGs was performed; sporadic 
statistically significant differences were seen , but as these were all limited to one eye, were not 
dose- dependent, and were not supported by corresponding changes in related ERG parameters 
(for example, a change in a- wave implicit time was not accompanied by a change in a -wave 
amplitude), they were judged to have no significance. The ocular no observed adverse 
effect -level (NOAEL) for VOS in NZW rabbit s was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There 
was some accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough levels on Day 13 of 0.028, 0.154, and 0.325 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, 
respectively. The mean maxi mum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose 
group) was 2.29 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In the Beagle dog study, similar results were reported for all safety parameters. The ocular 
NOAEL for VOS in Beagle dogs was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There was some 
accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough levels on Day 13 of 0.017, 0.173, and 0.297 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. 
The mean maximum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose group) was 
1.178 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In an additional  13-week NZW rabbit study [5], no mortality, systemic toxicity or effects on 
specific ocular indices were observed following daily bilateral topical ocular administration of 
placebo or VOS (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily (hourly intervals; 
~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4-week recovery period. The NOAEL for 
repeat topical ocular administration of VOS (0.2% voclosporin) to male and female NZW rabbits for 13 weeks is >0.56 mg/eye/day.  
In summary, the two repeated -dose ocular toxicology studies  [3,4]  demonstrated that there 
were no specific ocular indices or histopathology, and no systemic toxicity observed in either 
dogs or rabbits with 14 days of dosing. In addition, there was no mortality, systemic toxicit y 
or effects on specific ocular indices observed following daily bilateral topical ocular administration of placebo or VOS (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily 
(hourly intervals; ~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4-week recovery period, in 
the S08711 study.  
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 25 of 95 
 
 
 In addition to the three repeated dose toxicology studies, the safety and efficacy of VOS 0.2% 
has been evaluated in dogs with naturally occurring KCS [6] , diagnosed by the Schirme r Tear 
Test (STT) of >1 mm/min and <8 mm/min in one or both eyes  (OU) . Thirty -five dogs 
≥6 months old were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either VOS (n=25) or 
Optimmune Ophthalmic Ointment (n=10) for 28 days twice daily ( BID). Results showed t hat 
treatment with VOS resulted in a statistically significant within group increase in mean STT 
from baseline of 4.6 mm/min to each post -treatment visit. Qualitatively, this increase in 
magnitude was higher than seen in the concurrent Optimmune control group. For the Optimmune group, the change from baseline to Visit 2, 3 and 4, respectively was not 
statistically significant, whereas for the VOS treated group, each change from baseline was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001), demonstrating that VOS was both safe and effective in 
treating KCS in dogs. 
In order to determine potential melanin binding of 
14C-LX214, ocular tissue 
14C-LX214-derived radioactivity concentrations were compared between data obtained from 
albino NZW rabbits given a single bilateral instillation in a separate study and similarly treated 
pigmented Dutch- Belted rabbits . Ocular pigments in Dutch- Belted rabbits are widely spread 
in multiple structures including iris (stroma and epithelium), ciliary body (stroma and one epithelial layer), c horoid (stroma), retina (epithelium), eyelids and conjunctiva. The total 
radioactivity in these ocular tissues of Dutch -Belted rabbits was not statistically significantly 
different from NZW rabbits at the six sampling time points. Therefore, there was no e vidence 
of melanin binding of 
14C-LX214 after a single ocular administration. These data were 
confirmed in an in vitro model.  
1.2.2 Clinical Studies of Voclosporin in  Dry Eye 
VOS  has been investigated in one Phase 1 dose -escalation study (LX214 -01) in 30 healthy 
volunteers, followed by an open- label evaluation of VOS in 5 subjects with DED. In that study, 
both 0.02% and 0.2% concentrations were found to be safe and well tolerated following 
multiple instillations in healthy subjects. Adverse events (AEs) and ocular findings were mild 
and similar between VOS and placebo groups. Although the sample size was small, results 
from the 5 subjects with DED suggest VOS may be beneficial in t he treatment of DED and is 
supported by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores, which were improved in all subjects at all time  points while on study drug. Overall, the results indicated VOS can be used 
safely when administered BID for two weeks .

 These factors form the basis for the rationale to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
voclosporin in subjects with DED.  Study AUR -VOS -2017- 01 will evaluate the tolerability 
and efficacy of VOS versus Restasis® in subjects with DED.

 2. RATIONALE  
2.1 Dose Ratio nale 
Based on Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and all clinical trials to date in the clinical 
development program in other indications, oral voclosporin is generally well tolerated at doses 
up to 0.8 mg/kg BID with no unexpected safety concerns compared to the profile expected for 
CNIs.  
VOS was evaluated in a Phase 1 parallel, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, 
dose- escalation (0.02% and 0.2%) study assessing the safety and tolerability of VOS in healthy 
volunteers, followed by an open- label evaluation of VOS (0.2%) BID in subjects with DED  
(see voclosporin Investigator’s Brochure  (IB)). Although the sample size was small, results 
from the five  subjects with DED suggest VOS may be beneficial in the treatment of DED and 
is supported by the OSDI  scores which were improved in all subjects at all timepoints while 
on study drug. The mean improvement in STT scores between baseline and the end of treatment 
provides further evidence of efficacy. It is anticipated that 0.2% VOS BID will be an effect ive 
dose in the treatment of immune- mediated ocular surface disease.

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, m ulti-center, Investigator- masked, randomized, parallel -group study to 
evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and safety of VOS  versus Restasis® over a 28-day treatment 
period in subjects with mild to moderate DED .  Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 
to either VOS or Restasis® at approximately 5 centers located in the US .   
At Visit 1 ( screening), informed consent will be obtained from subjects and el igibility will be 
determined .  A STT will be performed at this visit. The score will be used for eligibility  and 
baseline.  During this visit, all subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh 
Plus®, OU to assess ability to self -administer  study product. 
At Visit 2 (Randomization) , continued eligibility will be confirmed .  During this visit, all 
subjects will self -administer an OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus®, in both eyes to evaluate 
ability to tolerate ocular drops.  Individuals who are unable to successfully instill the drops or 
who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable, based on a post -instillation Drop Discomfort  
VAS  score, will not be eligible for participation in the study.  (Note:  For subjects meeting the 
Screening and Rand omization Criteria, the Visit 2 Drop Discomfort  VAS score will be used 
as the baseline value.)   
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups :  
VOS BID or Restasis® BID.  The first instillation of Investigat ional Product (IP) will be 
administered , at least 2  hours following administration of Refresh Plus® and by clinic personnel 
to OU during Visit 2.  IP will be administered to the subject by a dedicated dosing coordinator 
(the subjec t and the Investigator will be masked to study treatment for the first post 
randomization instillation).  Tolerability, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at 
this visit.  
At Treatment Visits 3  and 4 , tolerability , safety  and efficacy evaluations will be performed.  At 
the E nd of Treatment , Visit 5, tolerability, safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed.  
Subjects who discontinue before Visit 5 will undergo all Visit 5 evaluations ( early 
termination) .  IP will be admin istered to the subject  by a dedicated dosing coordinator  at the 
clinic visits  (single masked: the Investigator and study staff  will remain masked to study 
treatment) . A Drop Discomfort  VAS will be administered in the clinic at 1 and 5 minutes 
following ins tillation of IP at Visits 2 through 5.  With the exception of clinic day visits, 
subject s will self -administer IP twice a day OU over the 4- week treatment period.  On the 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 31 of 95 
 
 
 evening of Visits 2 through 4 and in the evening prior to Visit 5, site staff will contact the 
subject  by phone to prompt administration of IP followed by completion of the dosing diary 
(See Appendix 9) and the Drop Discomfort VAS  (1- and 5-minutes post- instillation).  
At Visit 6, there will be a 3-day post- treatment Follow-Up, in which safety assessments are 
performed  and all remaining study materials are collected .  The subject s will be instructed to 
continue to withhold all other concomitant topical medications as outlined by the protocol for 
the duration of their participation (through Visit 6). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) ongoing as of Visit 6 will be followed until they have resolved, 
stabilized in the opinion of the Investigator, or returned to baseline. 
This study will be conducted per the schedule shown in the Schedule of Events  (Table 1 ) and 
the Study Schematic  (Figure 1). 
4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study  
The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 5 weeks . The treatment 
duration is 28 days  with a follow -up visit 3 days after last dose (completion or early 
termination).

pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of birth control.  
5.4 Adequate/Effective Contraception  
An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is at least 1 year 
post- menopausal or 3 months post -surgical sterilization. All WOCBP  must have a negative 
urine pregnancy test  (UPT) result at Visit 1  and must not intend to become pregnant during the 
study.   Women of child bearing potential who are not abstinent must have been using one of 
the following acceptable methods of birth control for the times specified:  
1. Intrauterine device ( IUD) in place for  at least 4 weeks  prior to Visit 1 through Visit 5 or 
last administration of IP or until completion of the subject’s first menstrual cycle following 
last administration of the IP, whichever period of time is longer. 
2. Barrier method (condom or diaphragm) wit h spermicide for at least 4 weeks  prior to Visit 
1 through Visit 5 or last administration of the IP or until completion of the subject’s first 
menstrual cycle following last administration of the IP, whichever period of time is longer.  
3. Stable hormonal cont raceptive for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 through Visit 5 or last 
administration of the IP or until completion of the subject’s first menstrual cycle following 
administration of the IP, whichever period of time is longer.  
NOTE:  For Depo- Provera inj ection contraceptives, the statement regarding first menstrual 
cycle following administration of the IP is not applicable as females receiving this form of 
contraception will not have menses. 
4. In a monogamous relationship with a surgically sterilized (i.e.,  vasectomized) partner at 
least 6 months prior to Visit 1 through Visit 5 or last administration of the IP or until 
completion of the subject’s first menstrual cycle following administration of the IP, 
whichever period of time is longer.

 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any  reason. 
Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s 
best interest.  
Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study, either voluntarily or at the Investigator’s discretion, to undergo end of study assessments (Visit 5), if possible. If 
possible, the subject should also be advised to come for the Follow -up V isit, 3 days  after last 
dose (Visit 6). If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal should be 
fully documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ). It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the study without providing 
a reason. In this case, the source documents and the eCRF should document the reason for 
discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent.” Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
5.6 Discontinu ation of Study Treatment  
If any subject is discontinued from study treatment , the reason for discontinuation will be 
documented in the eCRF . If the reason for discontinuing study treatment is an AE, the specific 
event or test will be recorded in the eCRF.  The subject should also be advised to come for the 
Safety Follow -up V isit, 3 days  after last dose.  
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from study treatment will be treated as deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator. 
5.6.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  Due to an Adverse Event  
Subjects may be permanently discontinued from study treatment  because of the appearance of 
an unacceptable AE. It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of 
an AE. In any case, every effort must be made t o evaluate protocol- specified safety follow -up 
procedures (see Section 9.3, Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy ). If a subject 
is withdrawn due to an AE, the event should be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred. All AEs should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted.

 6. RANDOMIZATION , MASKING AND UNMASKING PROCEDURES  
6.1 Randomization  
A computer -generated randomization schedule will be used to assign subjects into treatment 
groups.  The r andomization ratio will be maintaine d within each study center .  A randomization 
list will be generated and provided by an  unmasked statistician.  
The Sponsor , the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations (CROs), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to study 
product assignments. There will be an unmasked dedicated dosing coordinator who wil l 
dispense the IP to the subject and who will perform drug accountability on the returned IP.  This individual will be otherwise uninvolved in the study operations.  Further more , there will 
be a Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ) dedicated to drug accountability who will be 
unmasked to the treatment assignment by default but will be uninvolved in review of the 
clinical trial data beyond the scope of IP accountability.  In case of medical emergency, or 
occurrence of an SAE, the randomization code may be unmas ked and made available to the 
Investigator, Sponsor , and/or other personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of this 
study. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the study is completed and the database is locked.   
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no specific antidote to VOS, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary. If the 
Investigator feels it is necessar y to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency situation, 
the Investigator may call the Medical Monitor and notify the Sponsor. The IP assignment will 
be revealed on a subject -by-subject basis with the approval of the medical monitor and 
Sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact.  
A randomization schedule will be generated by an unmasked statistician who will also be 
responsible for loading the schedule into the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system .  No other 
 or Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Aurinia) staff will have access 
to the schedule.  
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. 
With the exception of the dedicated dosing coordinator  and drug accountability CRA, all other 
study personnel , the Sponsor , and project teams at the CROs involved in the study will be 
masked  to study product assignments.

 6.2 Masking  
On Day 1 Dose 1, this study is double-masked. T he IP allocation ( VOS versus Re stasis®) will 
be masked to the Sponsor, the subject  and the investigative staff with the exception of a 
dedicated dosing coordinator  and unmasked CRA.  The dosing coordinator will be responsible 
for dispensing and retrieving IP to/from subjects, instructing subjects regarding dosing of the 
IP, addressing study subjects’ questions regarding IP, and reviewing daily dosing diaries .  As 
a consequence of these interactions, the dosing coordinator will be unmasked to the study 
treatme nt for each subject. In order to ensure subject masking, at Visit 2, first dose, the dosing 
coordinator will not provide any IP related information prior to instilling the IP. The IP will be 
instilled in a masked  manner.  Instructions regarding storage and dosing will be provided after 
this first instillation.   
On Days 2 -28, s ubjects will not have visibility to the study product assignment ; however, as 
VOS and Restasis® have different storage conditions and appearance , it may be  possible that 
the subjects who have previously used Restasis®, may know that those differ from their prior 
experience.  Therefore, the study will be considered Investigator- masked during this timeframe.  
The randomization schedule will be generated by the Randomization S tatistician (who is not 
on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and limited -access location 
separate from the study Investigator and members of the project team.  
6.3 Unmasking  
The treatment assignment for an individual subject may be obtained in the ca se of a medical 
emergency when knowledge of the IP identity is essential for the clinical management of the 
subject. The Investigator must make every effort to contact the study medical monitor or the 
Clinical Study Manager before unmasking the treatment assignment.  
In the event of emergency unmasking, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately, without revealing to the Sponsor personnel the treatment assignment.  
If unmasking is required for emergency subject management,  the Investigator must document 
the medical rationale for unmasking and forward the information to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of unmasking. 
If an SAE is assessed as unexpected and related to the IP, and therefore meets the requirement 
for expedited regulatory submission, the Sponsor’s Drug Safety Surveillance department will 
unmask the treatment assignment for the individual subject. Expedited reports will be submitted to Regulatory Authorities in accordance with applicable regulations. Expedited 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 38 of 95 
 
 
 reports will be distributed to Investigators without revealing the treatment assignment and will 
be submitted to Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ). 
If emergency unmasking is required, withdrawal of the subject from the study is not mandatory 
unless there are other circumstances that requi re the subject’s discontinuation.  At the 
Sponsor’s discretion, the subject may remain in the study without continued use of the IP.   
In the event of accidental unmasking, the event would be reported as a protocol deviation and escalation to the Sponsor.  The subject may remain in the study.  If identified by the study 
center, a Sub-I nvestigator may be asked to assume clinical study assessments for a subject if 
the PI was inadvertently unmasked.

 7.2.2 Dosing Guidelines 
7.2.2.1 VOS /Restasis®– Study  Treatment  
7.3 Package and Labeling  
All study treatments provided by Aurinia will be packaged and labeled for Aurinia by 
appropriately qualified vendors according to all applicable local and country regulatory 
requirements. All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to GMP and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
7.4 Study Treatment Allocation  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either VOS or Restasis® in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be 
allocated a kit number for the duration of the study.  Subjects will be assigned to treatment 
groups using the randomization module within the EDC  system.   As e ligible subjects are 
enrolled and the corresponding Randomization eCRF  completed, a kit number will be 
assigned.  
7.5 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability  
7.5.1 Site Supply  
Once a site has been approved for study initiation, the site will be supplied with an initial stock 
of IP. Each site will receive one shipment of  both Restasis® and VOS prior to study enrollment.  
Additional shipments of both Restasis® and VOS will be provided to each site as needed. 
7.5.2 Storage 
VOS should be stored refrigerated between 2º C and 8º C (35º F to 49º F) but may be brought to room temperature prior to use. Subjects should be consistent in their use of VOS IP.  
Opened ampules must not be stored for re -use as the formulation does not contain 
preservatives.  
STUDY DRUG SHOULD NOT BE FROZEN. DO NOT USE IF THE VIAL CONTENT 
DOES NOT APPEAR CLEAR.  
Restasis
® should be stored at room temperature ( 15-25°C/59-77°F) . 
Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. Th e log should be updated by site personnel 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 41 of 95 
 
 
 during normal working hours. This log must be available for review by the Site Monitor during 
on-site monitoring visits.  
7.5.3 Accountability 
The Investigator at each site is responsible for IP supplies. The Investigator  will ensure that 
adequate records of the receipt, dispensing , and return of the IP  are kept and that the IP is used 
only for subjects enrolled in the study. All data regarding the IP must be recorded on the 
relevant forms provided. 
Each study site will ma intain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all IP dispensed and 
returned. At the end of the study, one copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be 
sent to Aurinia or designee for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files.  
After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all un dispensed IP will be 
returned to Aurinia. The decision to destroy IP at a site must be made by Aurinia. If the  
dispensed/returned IP is destroyed at a site, the Investigator mu st receive Aurinia approval of 
the site’s standard operating procedure addressing the destruction process and forward 
documentation of destruction to Aurinia. 
7.6 Procedures for Overdose  
Preclinical findings suggest that systemic effects from an overdose are u nlikely, as the peak 
blood levels after ocular instillation are below those achieved with oral doses of voclosporin. Based on clinical experience with voclosporin, symptomatic treatment of AEs is indicated. In 
the event of overdose, discontinuation of trea tment should be considered. 
7.7 Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment  
Any concomitant treatment given for any reason during the study must be recorded in the eCRF 
and in the subject’s source documents, including dosage, start and stop dates , and reason for 
use. 
Any class of medications not mentioned in Section 7.7.1, Prohibited Medications  and with the 
potential to interfere with evaluation of the study treatment must be discussed and documented 
with the Medical Monitor.

 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
8.1 Description of Study Assessments  
8.1.1 Dry Eye Disease Activity Assessments 
The following a ssessments will occur as part of the evaluation of D ED (See Appendix 2).  
8.1.1.1 Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye ( SANDE )  
Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate the frequency and severity of their dry eye symptoms 
at Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5  using the SANDE.  The total length of the line from “rarely” to “all the 
time” (frequency of symptoms) and from  “very mild” to “very severe”  (severity of symptoms)  
is 100 mm. Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate the frequency and severity of their 
symptoms (OU) by placing an “X” on the relevant horizontal line. The length of the line 
between the “rarely” or  “very mild”  starting point and the first point where the subject’s mark 
crosses each line will be measured and recorded in millimeters. This assessment is a general 
assessment of both eyes.  There will not be a question for each individual eye.  This assessment 
should be performed prior to assessing for AEs and prior to any other invasive visit assessment  
(See Appendix 3).  
8.1.1.2 V isual Analogue S cale (VAS)  Symptom Assessment s  
Individual Symptom  Severity Assessments  using VAS:  
Subjects will be asked to rate their  current symptoms (unrelated to study drug instillation) at 
Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5.   The following six symptoms will be evaluated:  Burning/Stinging, Foreign 
Body Sensation, Photophobia, Eye Pain, Eye Dryness, and Itching. 
The subject will be asked to subjectively rate each of six ocular symptom (OU) by placing a 
vertical mark on the horizontal line to indicate their  level of discomfort. 0 corresponds to “No 
Symptoms” and 100 corresponds to “Severe Symptoms .” The linear dimension of the scale is 
measured in millimeters.  This assessment is a general assessment of both eyes.  There will not 
be a question for each individual eye. This assessment should be performed following SANDE , 
and prior to assessing for AEs and prior to any other invasive visit assessment  (See Appendix 
4).  
8.1.1.3 F luorescein Corneal S taining   
Corneal staining will be performed at Visit 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Corneal staining assessment will be 
performed using methods developed by the NEI Dry Eye Workshop ( See Appendix 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 45 of 95 
 
 
  
Evaluation Technique  
NOTE:  All steps in this procedure should be completed for the right eye ( OD) prior to 
repeating the procedure for the left eye ( OS). 
• Place Slit-Lamp magnification at 10x (it is acceptable to use 16x if no reticle is used)  
• Use a yellow barrier filter (Wratten or Tiffen #11 or #12)  
• Place 5 µL of non-preserved, 2% fluorescein into eye , gently touch ing the drop at the 
tip to the lower palpebral conjunctiva of the eye 
• In order to thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film, ask the subject to blink 
several times and move his/her eye around 
• Wait 2 .5 minutes to assess cornea  
• Measure staining under Cobalt blue light (465 nm to 490 nm) 
• Compare staining with the standard with scor ing in each of 5 areas of the 5 corneal 
sections  
Scoring system 
• Grade each of 5 sections of cornea (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal, central) 
• Provide grades for each of the 5 sections: 
o Grade by NEI scale (definition  in Appendix  7) as 0,  1 (mild),  2 (moderate),  or 3 
(severe)  
• Total score is obtained by summing each of the 5 sections of the cornea 
o NEI score will be from 0 -15  
(See Appendix 7). 
8.1.1.4 Unanest hetized Schirmer Test  (STT)  
Schirmer Tear Test (without anesthesia) will be conducted at Visit 1 and Visit 5 .  This 
procedure should be conducted 1 hour following administration of IP and at least 20 minutes 
following FCS at Visit 5 : 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 46 of 95 
 
 
 Identical Schirmer strips will be supplied to each site.  When conducting assessments room 
temperature and humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each visit and throughout 
the study.  
• While still in the plastic sheath, fold the notched end of the Schirmer  strip at the apex 
of the “v. ”  Additionally, make a partial second fold at the halfway point of the strip so 
that the strip does not lie directly in the subject’s line of sight  
• Remove the right eye strip from the sheath  
• Ask the subject to look up and gently draw the right lower lid in a downward and 
temporal direction  
• Place the rounded end of the strip toward the temporal one- third of the lower eyelid  
• Repeat this procedure in the left eye  
• Dark en the room but ensure that the largest letter(s) of a Snellen or ETDRS chart is 
visible  
• Instruct the subject to relax and look at the chart while blinking normally or have 
patients gently close eyes  
• Remove the strips after 5 minutes  
• After removing the strips, with a sharp pencil draw a horizontal line across the leading 
edge of moisture and a second horizontal line across the lowest point of moisture 
• Using a ruler and/or the millimeters recorded on the strips, measure a point halfway between the two lin es and record this as the amount of wetting 
8.1.2 Post- Instillation Tolerability  Assessments 
8.1.2.1 Drop  Disc omfort Assessment   
Drop dis comfort will be assessed  by the subject  through a Drop Discomfort VAS  (0-100 mm) 
where 0 corresponds to “no discomfort”  and 100 corresponds to “maximal discomfort.” (S ee 
Appendix 1).  
At Visit 2,  prior to randomization, i n order to evaluate the subject’s ability to tolerate ocular 
drops, all subjects will self -administer an  OTC ocular lubricant , Refresh Plus®, in both eyes. 
Upon instillation of the ocular lubricant in both eyes, subjects will be instructed by the site staff to rate their eye discomfort at 1 - and 5 - minutes post -instillation  by placing a mark on the 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 47 of 95 
 
 
 Discomfort VAS . Subjects who rate OTC ocular lubricant as uncomfortable , defined as a VAS 
score ≥ 30 mm, will not be eligible for participation in the study.  Th ese Drop Discomfort  VAS 
scores will be used as the baseline values.  
At Visit 2, after randomization, a dosing coordinator will instill the IP in both eyes. S ubjects 
will be instructed by a masked site staff to rate their eye discomfort  at 1- and 5- minutes post -
instillation of IP as described above.   
Subject s will complete this assessment in the clinic following the  AM dose of IP at Visits 2, 3, 
4 and 5 and again at home following the  PM dose on the evenings of Visits 2, 3, 4 and the 
evening prior to V isit 5.   
 
8.1.3 Safety Assessments 
The following assessments will occur as part of the safety evaluation of the subje cts: 
8.1.3.1 B est Corrected Visual Acuity  (BCVA)   
BCVA will be conducted at Visit 1 and Visit 6.  Visual acuity testing should precede any 
examination requiring contact with the eye or instillation of study dyes.  LogMAR visual acuity 
must be assessed usin g an ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart.  Visual acuity testing should be 
performed with best correction using subject’s own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pinhole refraction. 
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used, and charts may be reflectance o r 
retro -illuminated .  If a 24.5” by 25”  chart is used , the subject must view the chart from exactly 
4 meters (13.1 feet).  If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are used, 
the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet.  Reflectance wall charts should be 
frontally illuminated (60 -watt bulb or a well- lit room).  
The subject should be positioned per the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle.  The right eye should be tested first.  The 
subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at the 
top of the chart.  The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers.  If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and 
the examiner should then request a letter instead of the number.  The subject should be asked 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 48 of 95 
 
 
 to read slowly, about 1 letter per second, to achieve the best identification of each letter.  He/she 
is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  If the subject 
changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted.  
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart encouraging the subject to 
guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the 
examiner should stop the test.  The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be 
noted.  ( See Appendix 6). 
8.1.3.2 Op hthalmoscopy  
Dilated ophthalmoscopy exam will be performed per the Investigator’s standard procedure  at 
Visit 1  and Visit 6 .   
The Investigator will determine if findings are within normal limits or are abnormal.  For 
abnormal findi ngs at Visit 1, the Investigator will determine whether the abnormality would 
exclude subject from study participation.  A clinically significant change from baseline may 
indicate an AE. 
8.1.3.3 Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy  
The biomicroscopy exam will be perfo rmed at Visit 2 and Visit 5.  It should be performed with 
the Slit-Lamp using a beam of width and intensity to provide optimal evaluation of anterior 
segment.  
This procedure will be performed in the same manner for all subjects observed at the Investigator ’s site  (See Appendix 5). 
8.2 Schedule of Assessments  
A detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol -required assessments, visits , and 
visit windows) is located on the Schedule of Events  (Table 1 ). No study -related assessments 
will be performed (including changes to current medications to meet study eligibility) until the subject has provided signed and dated informed consent. Every effort will be made to keep the 
subject within the requested visit schedule. If a subject is seen outside of the visit window listed on the Schedule of Events , the reason must be clearly documented in the source notes.

 9. EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES AND 
SAE S 
9.1 Definitions 
9.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
9.1.2 Adverse Drug Reaction 
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medical product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means  that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
9.1.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
A Suspect Adverse Reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For purposes of Investigational New Drug  (IND) safety reporting , 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
9.1.4 Unexpected  
An AE or SAR is considered “une xpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  
9.1.5 Life-threatening 
An AE/SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the pati ent or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not 
include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 57 of 95 
 
 
 9.1.6 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE  is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  meets one or more of the following 
criteria : 
• Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) 
• Is life -threatening (Note: the te rm “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe)  
• Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a con genital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event or reaction  
The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. 
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will also usually be considered serious. 
Hospitalizations for elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -exist ing conditions, which 
have not worsened after initiation of treatment, will not be classed as SAEs. Previously 
scheduled hospitalizations must be documented in the subject’s source documents before the 
subject signed the informed consent form ( ICF).  
9.1.7 Suspe cted Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) 
Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opinion of the 
Investigator or Aurinia, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product is a susp ected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (SUSAR) .

 9.2 Adverse Event Descriptors  
9.2.1 Intensity/Severity Categorization 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction);  however , the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by 
the subject during the course of the eve nt. The medical assessment of intensity will be 
determined by using the following definitions: 
Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. 
Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to fu nction. 
Severe:  The AE is incapacitating,  and the subject is unable to work or complete usual 
activity.  
9.2.2 Causal Relationship Categorization 
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to 
the study treatment for each AE and SAE. The Investigator must decide whether, in his or her 
medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE /SAE must 
be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause -and-effect relationship between the study treatment and the 
occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be considered related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of 
causal relation ship on the SAE reporting form. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 59 of 95 
 
 
 Term  Relationship  Definition  
Related  Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration 
indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.  
Not related  No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration does 
not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatment is determined to be 
“related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator  has not yet provided 
his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify 
for expedited regulatory reporting. 
9.2.3 Outcome Categorization 
Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequel ae; improved; 
worsened; ongoing; ongoing at end of study ; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as 
recovered with sequelae for a n SAE , the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on 
the SAE reporting form. SAEs  that are ongoing at the time  of death will have an outcome of 
“unknown” recorded.  SAEs resulting in a fatal outcome will have an outcome of “fatal” 
recorded.  
9.2.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms and fluctuations in laboratory parameters related to the disease under study will  not 
be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation of the disease.  
An explanation of these circumstances must be written in the source documents. 
Worsening of the symptoms or laboratory parameters , however, will be recorded as an AE and 
clearly marked as worsening or by the subject’s worst observed intensity.  The Investigator will 
be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for each AE as related or not 
related. An AE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under study and related 
to study treatment.  
9.2.5 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error 
All AEs of special interest such as study treatment abuse, misuse, overdose, and medication 
error must be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. If any occurrence 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 60 of 95 
 
 
 of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors leads to any event that fulfils any seriousness 
criteria, the event has to be reported as an SAE.  
9.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs , and Pregnancy  
9.3.1 Adverse Events 
All AEs observed from time of signing of the ICF will be  recorded  in the subject's source 
documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study  drug. 
For screen failure subjects, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the scree ning period (after 
informed consent) will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation only and will not be 
collected on the eCRF. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug must be 
collected.  
If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to disease under study, relationship to 
study treatment , any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has 
become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not , will be recorded. Use of 
colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only one AE term should be recorded in 
the event field on the AE eCRF. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis 
rather than signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation  of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis 
is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should 
be nullified  by the Investigator  and replaced by one AE report based on the single diagnosis, 
with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. For screen failure 
subjects, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the screening period will be recorded in the 
subject’s source documentation only . For enrolled subjects (i.e., those  who successfully 
complete screening),  the AE reporting period ends at the Follow-U p visit ( Visit 6). Adverse 
events persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by the Investigator through 
contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred (or the subject is lost to 
follow- up and cannot be contacted) and recorded in the source documents . If the subject reports 
an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess 
causality. T his may require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone 
contacts, etc.  In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to contact with the subject, the 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 62 of 95 
 
 
 All SAEs, regardless of causality, will be reported from the time the ICF is signed until 30  days 
following the last study visit or 30  days after last study treatment administration in subjects 
who withdraw or discontinue prior to study completion. No formal study visit is required but 
Investigators must report any SAEs that occur during this 30-day period on the eCRF. If the 
Investigator has not seen the subject at a clinic visit at the end of the reporting period, the Investigator must make reasonable efforts to contact the subject to inquire about SAEs. 
All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to disease under study  or relationship to study 
treatment , will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow- up 
and cannot be contacted. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact 
with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., “related”) to the study treatment and 
discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study will be reported. A rationale for the 
assessment of a caus al relationship must be provided by the Investigator. The Investigator will 
also be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for each SAE as related or not related. An SAE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under s tudy and 
related to study trea tment. Any safety information that is obtained after  the follow-up visit 
(Visit 6) will be documented in the safety database only. 
A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit (including the follow -up visit) or until 30 days after the last 
study treatment administration, whichever is longer, whether considered treatment  related or 
not, must be reported to Aurinia. If the subject  died, the SAE report should include the cause 
of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related to study treatment, as well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed by detailed 
descriptions which will i nclude copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports/certificates and 
other documents when requested and applicable. 
Additional follow-up information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness 
following Investigator (or site) awareness of  the information. The Investigator should not delay 
reporting a n SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional information, when 
available, should be reported to  by the reporting procedures described above. The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the study Medical Monitor when the issue of 
seriousness is unclear or questionable.

 An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) if appropriate , according 
to local requirements.  
The Sponsor or its representative will be responsible for determining and, in turn, reporting 
SAEs to Regulato ry Authorities according to the applicable regulatory requirements. 
9.3.3 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy occurring in a female subject or in the partner of a male subject should be reported 
to  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using the pregnancy eCRF . The 
Investigator should counsel the subject, and in the case of a male subject, the subject’s partner, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. A 
female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she b ecomes pregnant during the 
study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in a female subject should continue until conclusion of the 
pregnancy. In case of a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the Investigator should 
obtain informed consent of the pregnant partner prior to monitoring of the pregnancy. 
Women who have a positive pregnancy test during the study will be withdrawn from the study 
treatment  and the procedures for withdrawal will be completed. The Medical Monitor must be 
contacted immediately to break  the blind (if applicable). 
All pregnancies , subject or partner of a subject, that  occur during the study or come  to the 
attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit (including the Follow -up 
Visit) or until 30 days after last study treatment administration, which ever is longer, must be 
reported to  by the reporting procedures described above. 
The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and 
documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made 
to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as 
appropriate) post -partum. It will be the responsibility of Aurinia, together with the appropriate 
support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. 
Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or 
congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported following the reporting 
procedures as outlined in Section 9.3.2, Serious Adverse Events .

 In the event that the site experiences a temporary disruption of the EDC system , a back -up 
paper Pregnancy  Reporting Form will be available for site staff to complete.  The Investigator 
must complete, sign and date the Pregnancy form and verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents.  
• Site staff will complete the paper Pregnancy report form and e -mail it within 24 hours 
to the following add ress, Email:  
• Only in cases where the email system is unavailable, site staff will send the  Pregnancy 
form  by fax to:  
If notification is made via email or fax, site staff must enter the Pregnancy information into the 
EDC  system as soon as the system becomes available.

 10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
10.1 Statistical Methods  
Complete details of the statistical and analytical methods will be provided in a formal 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to the database lock . A general 
description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the C linical Study Report. 
All statistical analyses will be undertaken at study closure and will incorporate all endpoints. 
10.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The study will include approximately 60 male or female subjects.  
The primary analysis will assess the difference in change from baseline in  Drop Discomfort 
VAS scores  (range 0 to 100 mm) 1-minute post-Dose 1 instillation  between the two treatment 
groups.   
A sample size of 26 subjects per group (52 in total) will provide at least 90% power 
assuming: 
• A mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of +30 mm for subjects 
randomized to Restasis® 
• A mean change from baseline Drop Discomfort  VAS score of +10 mm for those 
randomized to VOS 
• A common standard deviation of 21 mm 
• A 2-sided alpha of 5% 
Under the same assumptions, the study will have at least 80% power if the common standard deviation for the discomfort score were to be 25. 
The study also provides 80% power should the treatment difference in discomfort scores be 
16 (common standard deviation=20). 
To allow for 15% dropouts, approximately  60 subjects will be randomized.

 10.3 Populations  
10.3.1  Intent -to-Trea t Set  
The tolerability and efficacy analysis will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) principles and 
will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment.  
10.3.2  Per Protocol  
The per -protocol set will be a subset of subjects in the ITT population who do not have any 
major protocol violations (to be defined prior to un masking). 
10.3.3  Safety Set  
The safety analysis will consist of  all randomized subjects  who receive at least 1 dose of study 
treatment.  The subjects in this group will be analyzed based on the treatment they received.

 10.4 Concomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications will be coded by the  World Health Organization ( WHO) 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Drug Reference List classification. The version used will 
be provided in the C linical Study Report. 
10.5 Endpoint  Evaluations 
10.5.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 1- minute post -instillation of IP in Drop 
Discomfort  VAS score at Visit 2.  The baseline measure will be taken 1-minute  following 
Refresh Plus®  administration at least 2 hours prior to IP  adm inistration . 
10.5.2  Secondary Endpoints  
10.5.2.1 Key Secondary/Effica cy Endpoints  
• Change from baseline in Drop Discomfort VAS score  
• Change f rom baseline in each of the 6 Individual Symptom Severity Assessments 
(VAS ) 
• Change from baseline of the sum of the  Individual Symptom Severity Assessments 
(VAS  Total Symptom Summary Score )  
• Change from baseline in SANDE  score  
• Change in unanesthetized STT score  
• Change from baseline in FCS total score (NEI/Industry Workshop 0- 15 scale) Safety 
Endpoints 
10.5.2.2 Safety Endpoints  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Change from screening i n BCVA  
• Changes from baseline in Slit-L amp Biomicroscopy  
• Changes from s creening in Dilated Ophthalmoscopy

 10.6 Statistical and Analytical Methods  
10.6.1  Primary Analysis 
The primary endpoint is measured on a VAS and will be summarized and analyzed as 
continuous data.  Summaries of VAS scores (absolute and cha nge from baseline) by treatment 
group will be displayed for each VAS assessment (minutes 1, 5 and overall mean) at each visit.  Should the data meet the necessary assumptions (normality and equal variance in both 
treatment groups) , then the treatment groups will be compared using a t -test.  If assumptions 
are violated , the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used.  If needed, transformations will be 
considered in order to meet the necessary assumptions. 
10.6.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Descriptive statistical summary  (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum) will be presented  by treatment group  for each endpoint .  Changes from 
randomization/baseline will be compared between VOS and Restasis® using a two -sample t -
test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  Further d etails will be addressed in the SAP.  
10.6.3  Safety Analysis 
Adverse events will be aggregated by System Organ Class and preferred term and presented as summary tables.  Other safety endpoints will be summarized by visit a s absolute values and

 12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The Investigator must ensure that all study- related site source data, study -related documents , 
and reports will be available, and that the provision of direct access for monitoring and auditing 
by Aurinia or its designees will be permitted. In addition, the Investigator must ensure that all 
study- related site source data, study -related documents, and reports will be made available for 
inspection by the appropriate Regulatory Authority and review by the IRB/EC/IEC. 
The Investigator is responsible for notifying Aurinia in advance of an impending regulatory 
inspec tion. He/she may request that Aurinia provide suppor t for preparation, if necessary.  The 
Investigator is required to provide updates to Aurinia on the ongoing activities during the 
inspection, respond to any citations/objectionable findings (i.e., U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration Form 483) and to share any follow -up responses from the Regulatory 
Authority. 
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross -check of the 
eCRFs against the Investigator’s records by the Study Monitor (source document verification). 
An unmasked Monitor  will also review the Investigator’s drug accountability records to ensure 
that the drug supplies are stored and dispensed appropriately. A comprehensive validation program will verify the data and queries will be generated for resolution by the Investigator. 
Throughout the study, Aurinia or its  design ee may review data as deemed necessary.

 13. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
13.1 Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
13.1.1  Study Supplies  
Sites will be provided with all supplies required to manage this study. This will include but not 
be limited to  the following: 
• Investigator file(s) (for filing of all study -related documentation)  
• Contact list of all relevant study personnel 
• eCRF and completion guidelines (or equivalent EDC  system ) 
• Study reference manual  
• All study forms (e.g., SAE, P regnancy, Drug Accountability, etc.)  
13.1.2  Insurance  
Aurinia confirms that it carries liability insurance which protects nonemployee physicians or 
Investigators/study staff against claims for which they may become liable as a result of 
damages caused by Aurinia products used in clinical studies. Insurance coverage is not extended to damages that the Investigators or third parties may suffer by reason of acts of 
commission or omission on the part of such Inves tigators or third parties and that are not in 
accordance with accepted common medical practices ( lege artis  procedures). Aurinia will 
reimburse the subject for all study -related injuries provided that the injury does not arise from 
the subject’s misuse of the IP or failure to follow the Investigator’s instructions. 
13.1.3  Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by representatives of Aurinia (or designee, which may include a CRO ). If not monitored by Aurinia, documentation of delegation will be described in th e 
Clinical Trial Agreement.  It is understood that the responsible Monitor will contact and visit 
the Investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records of the 
study (eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements.  
It will be the Monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study (frequency outlined in a separate procedural document), to verify the adherence to t he 
 
 
 
 
AUR -VOS-2017 -01, Version 1.0  Confidential  
12 March 2018  Page 73 of 95 
 
 
 protocol and the completeness, consistency , and accuracy of the data being entered on them. 
The Monitor must have access to subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The 
Investigator (or his/her deputy) agrees to co- operate with the Monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
13.2 Investigator’s Responsibilities  
13.2.1  Reporting and Recording of Data 
All required study data must be entered in the e CRF created for the study. Training on the 
syste m will be provided to all sites, including instructions on how to address missing data, 
corrections, query procedures , and electronic signatures. Only individuals who are identified 
on the authorized signature page may enter/correct data in the eCRF. For those subjects who withdraw before completion of the study, all available efficacy and safety data must be entered 
in the eCRF. Incomplete or inconsistent data on the eCRF will result in data queries addressed 
to the Investigator for resolution. 
13.2.2  Investigator Training 
All Investigators and their study personnel will receive training regarding the study procedures, 
study treatments, and GCP/regulations specific to the conduct of clinical studie s. This training 
will take place prior to enrollment of the first subject at the study site and must be documented 
and filed in the Investigator’s Study Site File.  
13.2.3  Source Documentation 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the 
study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. 
Subject clinical source documents would include subject hospital/clinic records, physician’s 
and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, signed ICFs, consultant 
letters, and subject enrollment logs. These are to be separate and distinct from eCRFs. All data 
for the study must be available in source documentation, including oral and written 
communication with the subject regarding the study treatment (including the risks and benefits 
of the study). The date of informed consent must be recorded in the source documentation. 
The Investigator must arrange for the retention of all study documentation (such as eCRFs, 
research files, and master files) for the duration specified in their respective site contract. The 
Investigator must keep these documents on file after completion or discontinuation of the study

 14. PROCEDURE FOR MODIFICATION OF PROTOCOL OR 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
14.1 Protoc ol Waivers, Deviations and Violations  
Protocol waivers shall not be permitted.  
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without 
written agreement from Aurinia and prior documented approval/favorable opinion from the 
IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study . If the Investigator must implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior written approval , the 
implemented deviation or change and the reasons for it should be submitted in a timely manner 
to Aurinia and to the IRB/IEC as required by applicable local requirements.  
The Investigator, or person designated by the Investigator, will document and record the preventative and/or corrective measures for any deviation from the approved protocol. 
Accidental deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be assessed as minor or major on a case- by-case basis. The criteria describing the 
deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be documented in the SAP. 
Any amendment to the protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC 
prior to its implementation unless there are overriding safety reasons.  
In some instances , an amendment may require a change to the ICF. The Investigator must 
receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion concerning the reviewed document prior to 
administering to study subjects.  
14.2 Study Termination  
Aurinia reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time. Reasons for termination may include but  are not limited to  the following: unsatisfactory subjec t 
enrollment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete.

 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
 
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion is indicated to increase te ar production in patients whose tear production is 
presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation a ssociated with keratoconjunc tivitis sicca. Increased tear 
production was not seen in patients currently taking topical anti-inflamma tory drugs or using punctal plugs. 
 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
Invert the unit dose vial a few times to obtain a uniform, white, opaque emul sion before using. Instill one drop 
of RESTASIS
® ophthalmic emulsion twice a day in each eye approximately 12 hours apart. RESTASIS® can 
be used concomitantly with lubricant eye drops, allowing a 15-minute interval between products. Discard vial 
immediately after use.  
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 
Ophthalmic emulsion containing cyclosporine 0.5 mg/mL 
 
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 
RESTASIS
® is contraindicated in patients w ith known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in 
the formulation. 
 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
 5.1   Potential for Eye Injury and Contamination 
Be careful not to touch the vial tip  to your eye or other surfaces to avoid potential for eye injury and 
contamination. 
 
5.2   Use with Contact Lenses 
RESTASIS
® should not be administered while wearing contact  lenses. Patients with decreased tear production 
typically should not wear c ontact lenses. If contact lenses are wor n, they should be removed prior to the 
administration of the emulsion. Lenses may be re inserted 15 minutes following administration of RESTASIS® 
ophthalmic emulsion. 
 
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 
 
The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:  
• Potential for Eye Injury and Contamination [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 
 
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  
Because clinical trials are conducte d under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the 
clinical trials of a drug cannot be dir ectly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not 
reflect the rates observed in practice. 
 In clinical trials, the most common adverse reaction following the use of RESTASIS
® was ocular burning 
(17%).  Other reactions reported in 1% to 5% of patients included conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, epiphora, eye 
pain, foreign body sensation, pruritus, stinging, a nd visual disturbance (m ost often blurring). 
 
 
 6.2 Post-marketing Experience 
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of RESTASIS®. Because these 
reactions are reported voluntarily from  a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably 
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
 
Reported reactions have included: hype rsensitivity (including eye swelli ng, urticaria, rare cases of severe 
angioedema, face swelling, tongue swelling, pharyngeal edema, and dyspnea); and superficial injury of the eye (from the vial tip touching th e eye during administration).  
 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
 8.1   Pregnancy 
Risk Summary 
Clinical administration of cyclos porine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% is no t detected systemically following 
topical ocular administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], and maternal use is not expected to result in 
fetal exposure to the drug. Oral admi nistration of cyclosporine to pregnant  rats or rabbits did not produce 
teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses [ see Data ]. 
Data 
Animal Data 
At maternally toxic doses (30 mg/kg/day in rats a nd 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits), cyclosporine oral solution 
(USP) was teratogenic as indicated by increased pre- and postnatal mortalit y, reduced fetal wei ght and skeletal 
retardations. These doses (normalized to body surf ace area) are 5,000 and 32,000 times greater, respectively, 
than the daily recommended human dose of one drop (approximately 28 mcL) of cyclosporine ophthalmic 
emulsion 0.05% twice daily into each eye of a 60 kg pers on (0.001 mg/kg/day), assuming that the entire dose is 
absorbed. No evidence of embryofetal toxicity was obser ved in rats or rabbits r eceiving cyclosporine during 
organogenesis at oral doses up to 17 mg /kg/day or 30 mg/kg/day, respectivel y. These doses in rats and rabbits 
are approximately 3,000 and 10,000 times greater, respec tively, than the daily recommended human dose. 
An oral dose of 45 mg/kg/day cyclos porine administered to rats from  Day 15 of pregnancy until Day 21 
postpartum produced maternal toxicity and an increase in postnatal mortality in offspring. This dose is 7,000 
times greater than the daily recommended human dose. No  adverse effects in dams or offspring were observed 
at oral doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (2,000 times gr eater than the daily r ecommended human dose). 
 
8.2   Lactation 
Risk Summary 
Cyclosporine is known to appear in human milk following systemic admini stration, but its presence in human 
milk following topical treatment has not been inves tigated. Although blood concen trations are undetectable 
following topical administration of RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , 
caution should be exercised when RESTASIS® is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and 
health benefits of breastfeeding should be consid ered along with the mother’s clinical need for RESTASIS® and 
any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from cyclosporine. 
 
8.4   Pediatric Use 
Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 16. 
 
 
 8.5   Geriatric Use 
No overall difference in safety or effectiveness has been observed between elderly and younger patients. 
 
11 DESCRIPTION 
RESTASIS® (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion) 0.05% contains a topical ca lcineurin inhibitor 
immunosuppressant with anti-inflammatory effects. Cyclosporine’s chemical name is Cyclo[[( E)-(2 S,3R,4R)-3-
hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-6-octenoyl]-L-2-aminobutyryl- N-methylglycyl-N -methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-
N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-D-alanyl- N-methyl-L-leucyl- N-methyl-L-leucyl- N-methyl-L-valyl] and it has the 
following structure: 
 
Structural Formula 
 
                                                
Formula: C 62H111N11O12        Mol. Wt.: 1202.6 
 
Cyclosporine is a fine white powder. RESTASIS® appears as a white opaque to slightly translucent 
homogeneous emulsion. It has an osmolality of 230 to  320 mOsmol/kg and a pH of  6.5-8.0. Each mL of 
RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion contains: Active:  cyclosporine 0.05%. Inactives:  glycerin; castor oil; 
polysorbate 80; carbomer copolymer type A; purified water; and so dium hydroxide to adjust pH. 
 
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
 
12.1  Mechanism of Action 
Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent when administered systemically. 
 In patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca, cyclospori ne emulsion is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator. The exact 
mechanism of action is not known. 
 
12.3  Pharmacokinetics 
Blood cyclosporine A concentrations were measured us ing a specific high pressure  liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry assay. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine, in all the samples collected, after topical 
administration of RESTASIS
® 0.05%, twice daily, in humans for up to  12 months, were be low the quantitation 
limit of 0.1 ng/mL. There was no detectable drug accumu lation in blood during 12 mont hs of treatment with 
RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion. 
 

 
 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
 
13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,  Impairment of Fertility  
Carcinogenesis 
Systemic carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female mice and rats. In the 78-week oral (diet) 
mouse study, at doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg/day, eviden ce of a statistically signi ficant trend was found for 
lymphocytic lymphomas in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose males significantly exceeded the control value.  In the 24-month oral (diet) rat study, conducted at 0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day, pancreatic islet ce ll adenomas 
significantly exceeded the control rate in the low dose leve l. The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet 
cell adenomas were not dose related. The low doses in mice and rats are approximately 80 times greater 
(normalized to body surface area) than the daily r ecommended human dose of one drop (approximately 28 
mcL) of 0.05% RESTASIS
® twice daily into each eye of a 60 kg person (0.001 mg/kg/day), assuming that the 
entire dose is absorbed.   Mutagenesis 
Cyclosporine has not been found to be mutagenic/genot oxic in the Ames Test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the 
micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone-
marrow, the mouse dominant lethal  assay, and the DNA-repair test in  sperm from treated mice. A study 
analyzing sister chromatid ex change (SCE) induction by cyclos porine using human lymphocytes in vitro  gave 
indication of a positive eff ect (i.e., induction of SCE). 
 Impairment of Fertility 
No impairment in fertility was demonstrated in studies in male and female rats receiving oral doses of 
cyclosporine up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 ,000 times the human daily dose of 0.001 mg/kg/day 
normalized to body surface area) for 9 weeks (mal e) and 2 weeks (female) prior to mating. 
 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
 
Four multicenter, randomized, adequate and well-controlled clin ical studies were performed in approximately 
1,200 patients with moderate to severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca. RESTASIS® demonstrated statistically 
significant increases in Schirmer we tting of 10 mm versus vehicle at si x months in patients whose tear 
production was presumed to be suppresse d due to ocular inflammation. This effect was seen in approximately 
15% of RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion-treated patients versus a pproximately 5% of vehi cle-treated patients. 
Increased tear production was not seen in patients curre ntly taking topical anti-inflammatory drugs or using 
punctal plugs.  No increase in bacterial or f ungal ocular infections was repor ted following administration of RESTASIS
®.

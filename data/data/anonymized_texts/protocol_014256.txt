Abstract  
ACTH , given  in the form of a long -acting, repository injection,  has recently been shown to 
be effective in inducing disease  remission in adult patient s with nephro tic syndrome.  Side 
effects are decreased  compared to corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents , making 
it an attractive therapeutic choice for patients with frequently relapsing and steroid dependent 
nephrotic syndrome (FRNS and SDNS).   No published data exist  on the use of long -acting 
ACTH  gel in the pediatric nephrotic population.  We propose a multi -center, prospective, 
controlled open label, randomized  trial to  evaluate the effects of ACTH on the symptoms and 
biochemical profile in children with FRNS and SDNS .   
Introduction  
Treatment of frequently relapsing and steroid dependent nephrotic synd rome (FRNS and 
SRNS) in children remains challenging.  Current treatment exposes patients to morbidity from 
prolonged, high -dose corticosteroids as well as various immunosuppressive agents that have a 
variety of serious side effects, including nephrotoxici ty1.  Chronic corticosteroid exposure leads 
to growth retardation, obesity, decreased bone density, and other complications. Short -term use 
of corticosteroids is associated with behavioral changes.  Furthermore, relapses of nephrotic 
syndrome are associated with potential complications such as infection and thromboembolic 
disease2,3.  
During the 1950s, parenteral adrenocortico tropic hormone (ACTH) was an effective 
treatment for nephrotic syndrome.  ACTH was utilized in frequent, often four times daily, high 
dose injections for days to weeks, necessitating hospitalization for treatment and monitoring4-7.  
Oral prednisone ultimately replaced ACTH.  
In recent years, there is renewed interest in ACTH for the treat ment of nephrotic syndrome, 
stemming from adult studies demonstrating its ability to induce remission and improve serum 
lipid profile in cases where other immunosuppressive regimens have failed8-10.  In the United 
States, ACTH is now administered in the form of ACTH gel (HP Acthar Gel®, Questcor 
Pharmaceuticals, NY, USA), a long -acting, repository injection isolated from porcine pituitary 
extracts containing ACTH 1-39, as well as other pro -opiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides.  The 
most common  adult  dosing regimen is 80 units twice weekly11.  A randomized pilot trial by 
Ponticelli et al showed that t reatment with twice weekly ACTH for 1 year is comparable to 6 
months treatment with methylprednisolone and chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide in achieving 
and sustaining remission, with mild and reversible side effects in the ACTH treatment arm12.  It 
has recently been proposed that ACTH produces antiproteinuric, lipid -lowering, and 
renoprotective effects via the melanocortin system, in addition to its effect on increasing 
endogenous steroidogenesis11.   
With its side effect profile, ACTH would be an attractive therapeutic alternative for  the 
treatment of  FRNS and SDNS in children, who are especially vulnerable to the long -term 
adverse effects of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents on growth, bone health, and 
weight gain.  To our knowledge, there has not been any published experience with long -acting

 ACTH gel for children with nephrotic syndrome.  We propose a study to evaluate the efficacy of 
ACTH on the symptoms and biochemical profile in children with FRNS and SDNS.   
Definitions  
 FRNS   ≥2 relapses within 6 months after initial therapy or ≥4 relapses in any 12 - 
month period.  
 NS  Edema, Up/c >2,000mg/g, or ≥300mg/dl or 3+ protein on  
Albustix, hypoalbuminemia ≤2.5 mg/l  
Relapse  After remission, an increase in the first morning Up/c ≥2 or Albustix  
reading of ≥2 for 3 of 5 consecutive days.  
 Rem ission  Up/c <0.2 or Albustix negative or trace for 3 days.  
 SDNS   Relapse during taper or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of steroid  
therapy.  
 SRNS   Inability to induce a remission with 4 weeks of daily steroid therapy.

    Height in cm, serum creatinine in mg/dL   
Hypotheses and End -points  
 
Our hypotheses  are the following:  
 
Hypothesis 1:  ACTH gel is superior to no treatment in maintaining remission in children 
with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome.  
Hypothesis 2:  Relapses in children with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent 
nephrotic syndrome receiving ACT H gel will increase when the dose of ACTH gel is 
reduced by 50%. 
Hypothesis 3:  ACTH gel will increase the percentage of children with frequently 
relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome that remain relapse free off 
medication.  
Primary end -points:  
The primary end -point related to Hypothesis  1 is the proportion of patients in each arm with a 
relapse during the initial 6 months of treatment.  
The primary end -point related to Hypothesis  2 is the proportion of relapse -free patients during 
the first 6 mon ths and second 6 months of treatment with ACTH. This will include patients 
initially randomized to ACTH and patients who receive ACTH as rescue therapy following their 
initial relapse in patients randomized to no treatment.  
The primary end -point related to  Hypothesis  3 is the proportion of patients who have relapses in 
the 6 months following completion of one year of ACTH. This will be compared to the 
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
4 
 proportion of patients with relapses during the initial 6 months in the patients randomized to no 
treatment . 
Secondary end -points:  
Our secondary end -points are the following:  
1. The total prednisone exposure over the initial 12 months in the two groups.  
2. The number of relapses over the initial 6 months in the two groups.  
3. The change in BMI, heigh t SDS, and cholester ol over  the study period for both groups  
Study Design and Methods  
The experimental design is a multi -center, prospective, controlled open label , randomized 
trial comparing ACTH gel and no treatment in preventing relapses in pediatric patients with 
frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome.  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either no treatment or treatment with ACTH gel. 
The primary outcome will be the presence of a relapse within 6 months of starting ACTH gel or 
no treatment.   
After initial recruitment, enrollment will begin with a screening visit to determine eligibility 
and obtain informed consent and assent. Randomization and weaning of all other medications for 
the treatment of NS will begin after remission has been achieved for those with active relapse.  
There will be a 2 w eek overlap of ACTH and current  immunosuppressive medications:  
1. ACTH will be initiated 2 weeks prior to the completion of the prednisone taper for 
patients who are receiving prednisone at the time of consent.  
2. ACTH will be initiated 2 weeks prior to stopping  preventive medications such as 
tacrolimus, cyclosporin, and mycophenolate.  
Patients randomized to no treatment will  be followed for up to 6 months or until disease relapse, 
whichever occurs first.  Patients who relapse  within 6 months  will be given the o ption of 
reassignment to the ACTH treatment group after remission has been achieved using conventional 
corticosteroid therapy.  
Patients randomized to ACTH treatment will  be given ACTH for 12 months.  During the 
second 6 months, the ACTH dose will be reduce d to 50% of the starting dose.  The outcome of 
interest is the presence of relapses after dose reduction.  Follow -up will occur throughout the 12 
months of therapy, and also for 6 months following the completion of ACTH therapy.  The 
outcome of interest is  the percentage of patients with relapses in the 6 months after completing a 
12 month course of ACTH treatment.  
Visits  
Screening visit:  The study will be explained to the patient and family. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to determine eligibility. Consent and assent will be obtained as 
appropriate. Medical history will be recorded. A physical exam will be performed. If indicated, a 
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
5 
 plan for prednisone tapering will be explained to the family. The date of the baseline visit will 
either be determined at that visit or via telephone for patients who are currently in relapse.  
Baseline visit:  The patient will be seen and have baseline labs (renal function panel, cholesterol, 
urinalysis, urine protein/creatinine ratio).  A urine pregnancy test will be performed in females of 
childbearing age  (achieved menarche) who are randomized to ACTH treatment along with 
counseling in requir ed birth control .  An interval medical history and quality of life  (QOL)  
survey will be performed.  Patients will have a physical examination.  Patients will be 
randomized to either ACTH gel or no treatment.  Patients will be given Albustix and instruction s 
for daily monitoring of the urine and recording the results.   Patients randomized to ACTH gel 
will receive their first injection in clinic and be taught how  to perform injections at home.   A stop 
date for other immunosuppressive medications will be provi ded, if appropriate, 2 weeks after 
starting ACTH.  
ACTH Treatment ACTH will be dosed by body surface area (BSA), with an initial dose of 80U 
per 1.73m2.  After 6 months of treatment, the initial dose will be reduced by 50% (1st reduction), 
to complete the second 6 months of ACTH therapy.   
 
If patients develop significant side effects on the initial dose, they will have an early dose 
reduction by 50% at the discretion of each individual site PI (1st reduction).  They will comple te 
a total 6 months of treatment with the initial and reduced dose.  After 6 months, ACTH will be 
reduced again by 50% (2nd reduction), to complete the second 6 months of ACTH therapy.  
 
Patient s who do not tolerate ACTH therapy despite an early dose reduct ion will exit the study 
with reporting of adverse events as appropriate.  
 
Patients who relapse on a reduced dose of ACTH during the second 6 months of treatment will 
have their dose reverted to the previous dose and complete a total of 12 months of treatment with 
no further dose reductions.       
 
Patients with two relapses on t he highest tolerated ACTH dose will exit the study.

 *Note: there is rounding of the doses to the closest administrable amount by subcutaneous 
injection.  
 
Interval Visits  
Telephone contact  will occur weekly for the first 3 weeks after randomization. This will include 
screening for adverse events, reviewing medications and timing of medication changes, review 
of Albustix testing, and reviewi ng dosing of ACTH if applicable .  Patients randomiz ed to  ACTH 
treatment will have two additional telephone contacts one month after ACTH dose reduction or 
discontinuation.  This is to screen for symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.  
Follow -up visits  in patients randomized to ACTH will occur 1 month, 2 months,  4 months, 6 
months, 8 months, 10 months, 12 months, 15 months and 18 months after the baseline visit.  An 
interval medical history (including screening for adverse events) will be performed. Patients will 
have a physical examination. A renal function pane l, cholesterol, urinalysis , urine 
protein/creatin ine ratio , and QOL survey  will be obtained at months 6 and 12. Urine pregnancy 
test, if applicable, will be obtained at months 4 and 8.  
The dose of ACTH will be reduced by 50% after 6 months of treatment  Patients who have  
significant  side effects attributed to ACTH will have an earlier dose reduction (i.e., before 6 
months)  at the discretion of each individual site PI . The PI will be asked to review possible side 
effect s with the patient at each visit and decide if a dose reduction is warranted.   A telephone 
contact will be made 1 month after dose reduction to screen for symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency.  
Relapses will be treated with prednisone, at 2mg/kg/day or 60mg/m2/day (maximum dose 60 
mg) until remission is achieved , with a  subsequent  taper off therapy over 4 weeks.  For patients 
receiving  a reduced dose of ACTH, the dose will be reverted back to the last effective dosage on 
which remission was sustained, and continue at that dose until the end o f the study .  If >1 relapse 
occurs on the initial ACTH dose, ACTH therapy will be considered a failure and terminated.  
The total ACTH therapy duration will be 12 months, after which, the subjects will be seen at 
follow -up at 15 and 18 months.   
Patients w ho are randomized to no treatment will have follow -up visits up to the time of 
relapse, at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months . An interval medical history (including 
screening for adverse events) will be performed. Patients will have a physical exam ination.  A 
renal function panel, cholesterol, urinalysis, and urine protein/creatinine ratio, and QOL survey 
will be obtained at month 6.  They will be treated with prednisone for any relapses and have the 
option to be placed on ACTH during the last 2 weeks of the prednisone taper if the relapse 
occurred within 6 months of the baseline visit.  The subsequent visit schedule and procedures 
will be identical to the schedule for subjects initially randomized to  ACTH  (i.e., it will include a 
baseline  visit, telephone contact s, and 18  months of follow -up). Alternatively, the patient may 
elect to be treated via standard of care in collaboration with the treating nephrologist , and the 
patient w ill then exit the study .

Statistical Analysis  
The primary end -point of the study and on which the statistical power is based is the 
proportion of patients who have a relapse in the 6 months following randomization to either 
ACTH or no ACTH.  
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
9 
 We hypothesize that the 6 month relapse rate for patients receiving no treatment is 70%.  In 
order to detect a 6 month relapse rate of  30% for patients receiving the ACTH gel, we will 
randomize 30 patients in each arm using a two sided z test with alpha=.05.  Our statistical power 
to detect such a difference is 91% which assumes two interim analyses at 50% and 100% of 
accumulated informa tion. That is, once 30 patients have 6 month relapse data, we will conduct 
the first interim analysis. The last one will be completed once we have relapse data on all 60 
patients.  The table below gives the operating characteristics for such a design:  
 
Number of Patients with 6 Months Data  Boundary p -value  
30 0.006  
60 0.045  
 
Using the method of Lan -DeMets, we list the boundary p -value for this sequential design. 
Thus, after our first interim look, we will reject the null hypothesis of equal 6 month re lapse rates 
between ACTH gel and no treatment if our test statistic renders a p -value < .006.  According to 
the intent to treat principle, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they have been 
assigned to during the randomization procedure.  The odds ratio of ACTH versus no ACTH, plus 
the Wald 95% confidence interval, will be also be calculated.  
The primary end -point related to specific aim 2 is the proportion of relapse -free patients 
during the first 6 months and second 6 months of treatment with ACTH. This will include 
patients initially randomized to ACTH and patients who receive ACTH as rescue therapy 
following their initial relapse. We will estimate 6 month and 12 month relapse -free rate using the 
method of Kaplan -Meier and compare treatme nts using a log -rank test.  
The primary end -point related to specific aim 3 is the proportion of patients who have 
relapses in the 6 months following completion of one year of ACTH. This will be compared to 
the proportion of patients with relapses during th e initial 6 months in the patients randomized to 
no treatment using a z test statistic. Odds ratios of ACTH vs no ACTH will also be calculated.  
We will also compare patients as randomized by secondary endpoints such as total 
prednisone exposure in 12 month s, number of relapses, cholesterol and change in BMI with two 
sample t -tests.  If normality assumptions do not hold, appropriate non -parametric methods will 
be used.  
Growth data collected during the study will be summarized descriptively for each treatment  
group at each time point. Based on height data collected during the study and published reference 
height information, the height standard deviation score (SDS, also called z -score) will be 
computed for each patient at each time point as:  
 
(Height  - mean h eight for that age category) / SD of height for that age category.  
 
Descriptive statistics of this endpoint will be presented by time point and the z -scores will 
allow identification of potential outliers.  
Treatment Assignment and Randomization  
Treatment a ssignments will be stratified according to clinical center. The treatment 
assignments will be generated by the Data Coordinating Center  (DCC)  with the use of a pseudo -
random -number generator with randomly permutated blocks that will be used to ensure balance 
between the number of subjects assigned to each treatment (AC TH or no ACTH). Before the 
study starts, the institutional research coordinator at each clinical center will be given a batch of 
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
10 
 20 sealed, sequenced, opaque envelopes containing the trea tment assignment and will have a 
unique ID consisting of the clinical center stratum.  
Patients will be assigned to one of the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1.  
 
Data Collection and Management  
Data confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will b e kept confidential and managed under the applicable 
laws and regulations. Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the 
subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this stud y 
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization, the Investigator , by regulation, retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
follow -up safety information (e.g. has the subject experienced any new or worsened AEs) at the 
end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Data collection  
Data collection and a nalysis will be facilitated by the  Data Coordination Center (DCC), 
which will be led by Traci Leong, PhD .  They will interact  with the PI s, local site investigators, 
and study coordinators to collect data, analyze the results, and provide reports to the DSMB in a 
timely manner.  
REDC ap will be used for data collection and management.  The data collection system for 
this study use s built -in security features to encrypt all data for transmission in both directions, 
preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant information. Access to the system will 
be controlled by a sequence of individually assigned user identification  codes and passwords, 
made available only to authorized personnel who have completed prerequisite training.  
Using the REDCap Electronic Data Capture (EDC), the designated investigational staff will 
enter the data required by the protocol into the Electroni c Case Report Forms (eCRF). The 
eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web -enabled software.  
Site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Validation 
programs will check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and, allow modification or verification 
of the entered data by the investigator staff.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for 
assuring that the data entered into eCRF is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are 
performed in a timely manne r.  There will be regular reports of enrollment by site.  
 
Database Management and Quality C ontrol  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will review the data entered by investigational staff for 
completeness and accuracy. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and 
requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing valu es and sent to the 
investigational site via email. The Principal Investigator and site investigator will be copied on 
all correspondences.  Designated investigator site staff members  are required to respond 
promptly to queries and to make any necessary cha nges to the data.  
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
11 
 After these actions have been completed and the data have been verified to be complete and 
accurate, the database will be declared locked and made available for data analysis.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Screening for adverse events will be gin at each telephone contact via interview and screening 
questionnaire.  Formal evaluations of side effects from ACTH will be made at each monthly visit 
with direct interview, physical examination, questionnaire, and laboratory evaluation.  Subjects 
will be provided with home urinary dipsticks to monitor relapse of nephrotic syndrome.  All 
Serious Adverse Events will be reviewed within the applicable guidelines and submitted to the 
sponsor and appropriate IRB.  Acute exacerbations of the subject’s conditi on that is not in 
keeping with the natural history will also be reported.  
A serious adverse event is defined as:  death; life -threatening event;  requires or prolongs 
hospita lization; results in disability  significant, persistent, or permane nt; pregnancy with a 
resultant birth defect; causes cancer;  or overdoses of a study medication.  
In addition to the completion of the appropriate forms, any serious adverse event or serious 
and unexpected suspected adverse reaction occurring during the study or in a post -study period 
of one month  will be  reported to the principal investigator , the Data Monitoring Committee  
(DMC ), the loc al IRB , the sponsor , the study supporter,  and participating sites  within 2 business 
days. The IND sponsor will make an assessment of whether the event constitutes an 
unanticipated problem posing risks to subjects or others (UP). This assessment will be provided 
to the Emory University IRB, which, in turn will make a final determination.  If the Emory IRB 
determines an event is a UP it w ill notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and institutional 
officials.  
Adverse events that do not meet criteria for Serious Adverse Event will be reported using the 
Adverse Event Form during the follow up visit. Information regarding the diagnosis, da te of 
occurrence, severity of the event , and therapy will be recorded. A determination of the 
relationship of the adverse event to the study participation will be made by the Participating Site 
investigator.   Should a relationship be found, results will be  reported to the sponsor , the study -
supporter,  and the DMC within 1 business week.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
An external  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will be constituted prior to the 
randomization of the first patient.  The DMC will  consist of a minimum of three  individuals 
outside the Division of Pediatric Nephrology.  The individuals shall be practicing clinicians with 
experience in clinical research.  At least one member will be a nephrologist, and two members 
will be pediatric subspecialists.  Details on the membership, responsibilities and working 
procedures of the DMC will be described in the DMC Charter.  
The DMC will perform the first safety review using a data cutoff 6 months after 
randomization of the first patient and every 6 months there after, unless otherwise requested by 
the Chairman of the DMC. The DMC will also receive reports on a regular basis on all SAEs 
reported for this trial. One interim analysis and one final analysis are planned. These analyses 
will coincide with the timing of  the scheduled DMC meetings.  Recruitment will not be 
interrupted unless otherwise requested by the Chairman of the DMC.  Results of the  DMC 
review will be shared with the PI and all particip ating sites within 1 business week.   
The study would be stopped if the DMC  and the PI believe that there is a significant safety 
issue or that the interim analysis indicates that completing the study is not appropriate .  Should a 
ACTH Protocol, version March  2014  
12 
 decision be made to stop the study, a report will be made to al l participating sites within 2 
business days.

Study Protocol  52 
  53 
Study Overview : This study will involve a randomized waitlist control design to in vestigate the 54 
rapid and sustained antidepressant effects following two experimental sessions in which an oral 55 
dose of psilocybin is administered to patients with major depressive disorder. The study will 56 
include clinician and participant ratings of depress ion and anxiety pre - and post -drug-session, 57 
monitor and participant ratings of subjective drug effects during and after each drug session, 58 
tests of executive functioning at baseline and post -drug-session, and magnetic resonance 59 
imaging (MRI) of the brain a t baseline and post -drug-session to assess the effects of psilocybin 60 
on cortical glutamate levels, neural response to emotional stimuli, and resting -state functional 61 
brain connectivity.  62 
  63 
Twenty -four participants will complete two experimental drug sessio ns. Each session will last 64 
approximately eight hours, and experimental sessions will be separated by at least one week. 65 
Acute physiological, subjective, and behavioral effects will be assessed during and at the end of 66 
sessions (e.g., ratings completed by s ession monitors and questionnaire measures of subjective 67 
effects completed by participants), consistent with our well -established psilocybin session 68 
protocols. During the first experimental drug session, each participant will be administered a 69 
moderate dos e of psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg), but one that we do not expect to have full 70 
therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of the first psilocybin session is to familiarize participants with 71 
the subjective effects that may be encountered at a higher dose. The first psilo cybin session will 72 
also allow for assessment of both the suitability of each participant to the study procedures and 73 
drug effects, and the safety of administering a higher dose to each participant. The second 74 
session will occur about one week after the fir st session. If the study team decides that the 75 
participant can safely be administered the higher dose, then the participant will be given 30 76 
mg/70 kg psilocybin during the second session. If the decision is made that the participant might 77 
clinically benefi t from another session but not the high dose, the participant will receive 20 78 
mg/70 kg psilocybin on the second session, with the dose determined by the clinical judgment of 79 
the study team.   80 
  81 
Depressive symptoms will be assessed during visits at our rese arch unit (the Behavioral  82 
Pharmacology Research Unit, or BPRU), at baseline and repeatedly after each session. 83 
Participants will also be contacted for clinical assessment 3, 6, and 12 months after the second 84 
experimental psilocybin session.   85 
Waitlist Control Condition : After screening and enrollment, participants will be randomized to an 86 
immediate treatment group or a delayed treatment group (waitlist control condition). Participants 87 
in the delayed treatment group will wait 8 weeks after enrol lment before beginning the study 88 
interventions and neuroimaging assessments. As a safety precaution, participants in the 89 
delayed treatment group will be assessed weekly via telephone calls or in -person visits during 90 
the wait period (i.e., telephone assessm ents during post -randomization weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 91 
7; in-person assessments during post -randomization weeks 5 and 8) to assess depressive 92 
symptoms and suicide risk to determine if intervention is warranted (as described in more detail 93 
in the section " Steps taken to minimize risk."  94 
MRI Assessment : MRI measures will be collected for all 24 participants at two timepoints: 1. 95 
during the week before beginning the first treatment intervention; and 2. one week after the 96 
second psilocybin session. Only partic ipants who successfully complete the initial MRI 97 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  5  
assessment will be eligible for inclusion in the post -treatment MRI assessment. [The MRI data 98 
are not reported in this primary study manuscript but will be reported later.]  99 
  100 
 eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  6  
103  We anticipate the following approximate timeline for study participation:  
104    
105 Screening and  Preparation   
106 Visits 1 -2 (BPRU): Medical and psychological screening; cognitive testing; initial 107 
 depressive symptom measures. Randomization to immediate or delayed 108 
 treatment groups will occur at the end of Visit 2.  
109    
110 Telephone and in -person safety assessments for delayed treatment group:  As a 
safety  
111 precaution, participants in the delayed treatment group will be assessed weekly  
112 via telephone calls or in -person visits during the 8 -week wait period (i.e.,  
113 telephone as sessments during post -randomization weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7; 
in114  person assessments during post -randomization weeks 5 and 8) to assess  
115 depressive symptoms and suicide risk. For clarity in describing the study  
116 procedures, none of these safety assess ments are designated as a study "visit." 
117  In addition to the safety assessments at weeks 5 and 8, primary outcome 
118  assessments (GRID -HAMD) will also be conducted.  
119    
120  Visit 3 : Immediate treatment group : Initial MRI assessment and neurocogn itive testing 121 
 (KKI; 1 hour). This visit will occur within about one week after Visit 2.  
122    
123 Delayed treatment group : Initial MRI assessment and neurocognitive testing  
124 (KKI; 1 hour). This visit will occur about 8 weeks after Visit 2. In addition t o the 
125  brain imaging and neurocognitive testing, depressive symptom measures 
will be 126  reassessed in the delayed treatment group (BPRU; 1 hour).  
127    
128  Visits 4 -5: Preparation for the first psilocybin session consists of 2 meetings over 2 129 
 weeks (BPRU; 6 hours total). Visit 4 will occur within about 1 week after Visit 3.  
130  Visit 5 will occur about one week after Visit 4.  
131    
132 Psilocybin Session 1 and follow -up visits   
133 Visit 6 : First psilocybin session (20 mg/70 kg) at BPRU; clinical, physiological, & 134 
 behavioral measures (8 hours total). Visit 6 will occur within about 1 week of Visit  
135  5.  
136    
137  Visit 7 : Post -session 1 integration; meeting with study clinician & staff; clinical & 138 
 behavioral measures (BPRU); (2 hours total). Visit 7 will occur within 3 days after  
139 Visit 6.  
140 Visit 8 : 1-week post -session 1; meeting with study clinician & staff; clinical & 
behavi oral  
141 measures (BPRU) (2 hours total)  
142    
143 Psilocybin Session 2 and follow -up visits   
144 Visit 9 : Second psilocybin session (20 or 30 mg/70 kg) at BPRU; clinical, 
physiological, &  
 eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  7  
145 behavioral measures (8 hours total). Visit 9 will occur within about 1 week  of Visit  
146 8.  
147 Visit 10 : Post -session 2 integration; meeting with study clinician & staff; clinical & 
148  behavioral measures (BPRU); (2 hours total). Visit 10 will occur within 3 
days  
149 after Visit 9.  
150 Visit 11 : Week 1 post -session 2; meeting with study clinician & staff; clinical & 
behavioral  
151 measures; cognitive testing (BPRU; 3 hours total); brain imaging for all  
152 participants (KKI) (1 hour total)  
153 Visit 12: Week 2 post -session 2  – clinical & behavioral ratings  
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  8  
Telephone safety assessment: Week 3 post -session 2  – To assure at least weekly 154 
safety assessment for depressive symptoms and suicide risk during the 155 
intervention period (for both treatment groups), there will be one telephone safety 156 
assessment (in between Visits 12 and 13). This telephone safety assessment i s 157 
not designated as a study "visit."  158 
Visit 13: Week 4 post -session 2  – meeting with study clinician & staff; clinical & 159 
behavioral measures; cognitive testing (BPRU); (3 hours total)  160 
  161 
Additional visits for immediate treatment group only   162 
Visit 14 & 15: Week 9 & Week 12 post -session 2  – Participants in immediate treatment 163 
group will come to BPRU for assessment of depressive symptoms (1 hour). The 164 
purpose of these visits is to keep the number and timepoints of primary outcome 165 
assessments consistent between  treatment groups.   166 
  167 
Long -term follow -up (LTFU)   168 
LTFU 1 : 3 months post -session 2; questionnaire assessments (2 hours total)  169 
LTFU 2 : 6-months post -session 2; open -ended clinical interview; questionnaire 170 
assessments (2 hours total)  171 
LTFU 3 : 12-months post -session 2; questionnaire assessments (2 hours total)  172 
  173 
Preparation Meetings with Monitors Before and After Session Days : Before the first session, 174 
participants wil l meet with one or more of the session monitors on at least 2 occasions, for a 175 
total of about 6 hours of contact time before the first session day. The main purpose of the 176 
participant -monitor meetings is to develop rapport and trust, which we believe helps  minimize 177 
the risk of fear or anxiety reactions during the psilocybin sessions. Additional meetings and 178 
contact hours will be scheduled if it is judged necessary to establish rapport and trust. 179 
Consistent with our previous psilocybin protocols, the partici pant’s life history and current 180 
situation in life will be reviewed, and intentions and expectations for the psilocybin sessions will 181 
be discussed. Details regarding the conduct of the supportive psychotherapy provided have 182 
been published elsewhere.1  183 
  184 
The participant will meet with the session monitor(s) one day and one week after each session 185 
and four weeks after the second session to support integration of session -day experiences. 186 
Additional clinician and monitor contact hours will be scheduled if it is judged that the participant 187 
would benefit from additional meetings in order to discuss experiences from their session(s) or 188 
prepare for the next session.  189 
  190 
Session Monitor Telephone Meetings : In order to provide ongoing clinical support after the 191 
session experiences, telephone discussions may occur throughout study participation if the 192 
clinician, or monitor judge that this additional support would be helpful.  193 
  194 
Conduct of Psilocybin Sessions (Vis its 6 and 9) : Procedures for psilocybin administration and 195 
the conduct of the session will be similar to procedures used in our previous2,3 and ongoing 196 
studies with psilocybin. Participants will be instructed to consume a low -fat breakfast before 197 
reporting  to the laboratory for the psilocybin sessions. Before psilocybin administration, the 198 
participant will provide a urine sample, which will be tested for the presence of abused drugs 199 
(e.g., various opioids, stimulants and sedatives). In addition, a urine pre gnancy test will be 200 
conducted in females of child bearing potential. A negative pregnancy test will be required in 201 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  9  
order to continue in the study. Participants and staff will also complete pre -session 202 
questionnaires. Before each psilocybin session, study p ersonnel will interview the participant. If 203 
the investigator believes that the session is contraindicated, the session will be cancelled or 204 
postponed.  205 
  206 
Psilocybin will be administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 ml water. At 207 
least o ne session monitor, under the supervision of the investigators, will be present in the room 208 
and available to respond to participants’ physical and emotional needs during the full cour se of 209 
the session (at least 7 hours). A physician on the study team will be immediately available via 210 
pager or mobile phone for at least 3 hours or until the peak effects of psilocybin have subsided, 211 
whichever is longer.   212 
  213 
During the session, participants will lie on a couch, wear eyeshades, and listen to a program of 214 
music t hrough headphones. The participant will be encouraged to focus her or his attention 215 
inward. The eyeshades and music are intended to encourage this inward reflection.  216 
  217 
Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured pre drug administration, at 30, 60, 90, 120 218 
minutes after drug administration, and then at least hourly until at least 6 hours after drug 219 
administration and until drug effects have subsided. Heart rate and blood pressure assessments 220 
will be obtained after the participant has been sitting or recu mbent for at least 5 minutes. 221 
Sessions are expected to last approximately 7 to 10 hours.   222 
  223 
At about the same time of each heart rate/blood pressure measurement, monitors will complete 224 
questionnaires to rate the presence and intensity of behaviors, signs,  and reported symptoms, 225 
including sleepiness, amount of speech, anxiety, stimulation/arousal, tearing/crying, 226 
nausea/vomiting, yawning, restlessness, feelings of unreality, visual changes, euphoria, and 227 
peacefulness. Video and audio recordings will be made  throughout the session.  228 
  229 
At the end of the experimental session, participants will complete paper or computer -based 230 
questionnaires designed to assess acute subjective experiences associated with the psilocybin 231 
session. Study monitors will complete asses sments of mood and safety. Subjects will also be 232 
asked to write a narrative description of the experience of the psilocybin session before their 233 
next in -person meeting.   234 
  235 
In-person post -session meetings (Visits 7, 8, 10, and 11) : During the meetings with  the monitors 236 
after each session (1 -3 days post -session, or Visits 7 and 10, and 1 week post -session, or Visits 237 
8 and 11), participants will complete questionnaire assessment measures. During visits 7 and 238 
10, the monitors will also complete questionnaires retrospectively rating various behaviors and 239 
experiences observed on the session day and reported by the participant during the meeting 240 
(e.g., Next -Day Monitor Rating Form), and participants will be asked to recite and discuss the 241 
narrative description of their most recent psilocybin session.  242 
  243 
Long -term follow -up visits : [Long -term follow -up assessment is ongoing and results will be 244 
reported later.]   245 
  246 
Timing and Location of Meetings, Sessions, and Measures : Although much effort is put in to 247 
scheduling volunteers within the stated time frames, these are only estimates. Variables out of 248 
the study team’s control (e.g., volunteer availability, university cl osings, availability of study 249 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  10  
rooms, illness) may prevent the scheduling of volunteers within the stated time frame goals. 250 
There is no evidence to suggest that the difference in timing of sessions, meetings, and 251 
measures will adversely affect the volunteer  or the validity of the study. On those occasions 252 
when the timing of meetings, sessions or measures deviate substantially from the time frames in 253 
the protocol, we will report these as deviations in the Continuing Review.  254 
  255 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  256 
    257 
Overview of Screening Procedures : Participants will be initially screened via telephone or an 258 
online questionnaire to determine whether they meet major inclusion/exclusion criteria, and thus 259 
whether they are eligible for an in -person screening session.   260 
  261 
Participants who do not fail telephone or online screening will be invited to BPRU on the Johns 262 
Hopkins Bayview Campus for in -person screening.  263 
  264 
Written informed consent will be obtained at the BPRU at a scheduled meeting after participants 265 
have passe d telephone screening. Participants will be allowed to take as much time as 266 
necessary to decide whether or not to sign the consent form. Study staff will discuss the consent 267 
form with the participant after the participant has read the consent form. Study s taff will ask 268 
questions to assess the individual’s u nderstanding of the consent form. Participants may take 269 
the consent form home to review and return to sign consent if they wish.   270 
  271 
Participants will be physically healthy adult participants (approximate ly equal numbers of males 272 
and females) 21 to 75 years old who have a DSM -5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and 273 
are currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Potential participants will self -report their 274 
history of antidepressant use and th e effectiveness of antidepressant use during the initial 275 
telephone or online screening. Persons currently taking an antidepressant will be excluded at 276 
this initial screening. Potential participants that have previously used antidepressant 277 
medications will provide a written list of these medications.    278 
  279 
Non-English speakers and those with language or hearing impairments will not participate in the 280 
study. Participants will be recruited primarily from the Baltimore/Washington DC area. 281 
Participants may or may  not have used hallucinogens in the past. Potential participants will be 282 
carefully screened to eliminate those with significant medical or psychiatric illnesses other than 283 
major depressive disorder (see below for specific inclusion/exclusion criteria).  284 
  285 
Screening evaluation will include a history and physical examination, ECG, a 30 cc blood draw 286 
for study measures and medical screening, a personal and family medical history questionnaire, 287 
psychiatric/psychological assessments, and a urine drug test. As pe r standard BPRU screening 288 
procedures, screening physical examination and ECGs will be performed by BPRU medical staff 289 
(nurse, mid -level, or physician). ECGs will be interpreted by cardiologists credentialed and 290 
privileged to read ECGs at Bayview Medical Ce nter to determine if a significant abnormality 291 
exists. Participants will be requested to refrain from illicit drug use during the course of the study 292 
and a urine test will be conducted before each drug session (e.g., testing for various opioids, 293 
stimulants  and sedatives). Pregnant or nursing women are ineligible; female participants will 294 
receive a urine pregnancy test at intake and before each drug session, and must use effective 295 
methods of contraception during the study. Psychiatric screening will be condu cted by study 296 
team members. Psychoactive drug -use history, history of antidepressant treatments, and 297 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  11  
information about employment status and current functioning (including mood and psychological 298 
and psychosomatic symptoms) will be obtained. All inclusion a nd exclusion criteria are 299 
described below.  300 
  301 
Based on testing and interviews, if a psychiatric/psychological problem of a crisis nature (e.g., 302 
acute psychosis or suicidal intent) is discovered during screening, we will refer that individual to 303 
the Emergen cy Department for treatment.   304 
  305 
Study participants will not be enrolled if they are currently taking antidepressant medication. 306 
Study physicians will assume the role of mental health provider upon participants enrolling in the 307 
study through the final primary outcome timepoint (Visit 13, 4 weeks post -psilocybin session 2).   308

Psilocybin dose : All participants will receive a moderate dose of 20 mg/70 kg on the first 397 
psilocybin session. The psilocybin dose for the second session will be increased to 30 mg/70 kg 398 
unless a participant experiences a strong unpleasant reaction during the first sessi on and the 399 
clinical judgment of the study team is that the given participant would have a similar or greater 400 
reaction at a higher dose that would reduce the possible therapeutic benefits of psilocybin.   401 
  402 
Primary outcome variable.  403 
  404 
Depression Measures : The primary outcome measure for depressive symptoms is the 17 -item 405 
GRID -Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID -HAMD)4,5 assessed by blinded clinician raters.  406 
All participants will have this measured at screening (Visit 2), at post -randomization weeks 5, 8 , 407 
13, and 16, and at long -term follow -ups. Post -randomization weeks 5 and 8 correspond to the 408 
primary endpoints of 1 and 4 weeks post -psilocybin session 2 for the immediate treatment 409 
group; weeks 13 and 16 correspond to primary endpoints for the delayed tr eatment group. 410 
Having the same number and timepoints of primary outcome assessments will allow for 411 
between -group comparisons. This scale assesses severity of depressive symptoms with a 412 
higher score indicating more severe depression. Screening measurements for the immediate 413 
treatment group will be considered as baseline measurements for this group, and 414 
measurements at the end of the wait period for the delayed treatment group will be considered 415 
baseline measurements for this group for the purposes of assessi ng treatment outcomes.  416 
  417 
Secondary outcome variables.  418 
  419 
Depression Measures : Secondary outcome measures for depressive symptoms are the Beck  420 
Depression Inventory II (BDI -II),6 the 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9),7 and the 421 
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Rated (QIDS -SR).8,9 These will be 422 
administered at the same timepoints as the primary depression measures.   423 
  424 
Safety Measures : The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)10 will be used to 425 
assess severity of suicide  ideation during every in -person visit. It was developed by researchers 426 
at Columbia University and is widely used in clinical and research settings  427 
(www.cssrs.columbia.edu). As a safety precaution, participants in the delayed treatment group 428 
will have wee kly assessments of depressive symptoms (using the PHQ -9) and suicide risk 429 
(using the C -SSRS) to determine if intervention is warranted.  430 
  431 
Measures taken throughout each drug session :   432 
  433 
Heart rate and blood pressure:  Vital signs will be assessed before capsule 434 
administration and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes after capsule 435 
administration.   436 
  437 
Within -session Monitor Rating Form:  At the same time points at which the heart rate and 438 
blood pressure will be taken, the two session monitors will complete the Monitor Rating 439 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  14  
Form, which involves rating or scoring several dimensions of the participant’s behavior 440 
and mood.  441 
  442 
Video and audio recordings:  Video and audio recordings may be taken throughout the 443 
drug sessions and will be reviewed by investigators.   444 
  445 
Measures taken about 7 hours after capsule administration :   446 
  447 
Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)11,12   448 
  449 
Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ27)13    450 
  451 
Longitudinal measures assessed at baseline, post -session time -points, and follow -up:   452 
  453 
Anxiety and emotion regulation rating scales : Participants will complete a number of 454 
questionnaires that assess anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory, or STAI,14 and 455 
Hamilton Anxiety Inventory, or HAM -A)15 during screening and 1 week and 4 weeks after 456 
Session 2.  457 
  458 
Measures taken 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after Session 2 :   459 
  460 
Persisting Effects Questionnaire:  This questionnaire was developed to assess 461 
attributions that participants retrospectively make with respect to the psilocybin 462 
experience.2,3,16   463 
  464 
Monitor Rating of Enduring Effects:  This questionnaire will assess the monitors’ 465 
observations of persisting effects of sessions on participant attitudes and behaviors.  466 
  467 
Measures taken at baseline only :  468 
  469 
Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) : If a participant has a 470 
history of antidepressant use, we will use the ATRQ  to determine effectiveness of past 471 
trials for purposes of characterizing that participant’s degree of treatment -resistance.17–20    472 
  473 
[Other tertiary measures were examined in this trial that are not reported here. These measures 474 
will be included in forth coming manuscripts.]  475 
  476 
Statistical plan.  477 
  478 
Questionnaire Measures : Repeated -measures ANOVA will be used when appropriate to assess 479 
change between groups and over time within groups in primary and secondary longitudinal 480 
questionnaire outcome measures, inc luding measures of depressive symptoms and executive 481 
function. Planned comparisons will be used to test for early antidepressant effects (between 482 
baseline and 1 -week post -session ratings), and to test for sustained antidepressant effects 483 
(between baseline and 4 -week post -session ratings) of psilocybin. Planned comparisons will 484 
also be used to investigate change in questionnaire and executive function test scores between 485 
pre-session (e.g. Visits 2, 5 and 8) and post -session (e.g. Visits 7, and 10 - 15) timep oints for 486 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  15  
secondary outcome measures, and between depressive assessments of immediate and 487 
delayed treatment groups at 5 and 8 weeks post -randomization. We will also assess 488 
correlations between primary and secondary outcome measures.  489

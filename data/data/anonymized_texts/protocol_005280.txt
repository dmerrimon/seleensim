 INTRODUCTION 
Dr
y eye disease (DE D) is a prevalent chronic eye condition affecting between 5% and 34% of 
the population worldwide. More than 16 million Americans suffer from DED, including 
approximately 1 million to 4 mil lion between 65 to 84 years of age (Fiscella 2011,          
Messmer 2015). F urthermore, th e age of onset is decreasing rapidly due to the widespread 
increase in electronic “screen time” such that teenagers are now more frequently showing signs 
and symptoms of DED. S ymptoms include severe ocu lar burning, discomfort, pain, and in more 
severe cases compromised visual function, including symptomatic blurred vision. T hese 
symptoms are associated with tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, inflammation, and 
wounding of the corneal epithelium and the collagen substrate (Bowman’s layer) that is part of 
the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to which t he epithelium  adheres and renews. As is now 
recognized, even the early stages of DED tissue damage  penetrates well beyond the surface 
epithelial layer and involves the ECM, i ncluding disruption of the collagen that is contained in 
Bowman’s layer and the underlying corneal stroma (Shetty, Deshpande et al. 2016 ).  
Epi
thelial cell apoptosis incites the release of inflammatory cytokines and proteinases, most 
notably IL- 6, IL -8 and m atrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the eye, MMP -9 partially digests 
collagen via its collagenase activity leading to structural and functional disruptions in the 
collagen matrix underlying t he corneal epithelium (Baratta et.al. , in press ). Topical anti-
inf
lammator y therapies (e.g., Restasis®, Xiidra®, Cequa™) have been used to interrupt this 
process, but they act extremely slowly. F ull restoration of corneal homeostasis requires a fully 
regenerated surface epithelium , which f irst requires the repair of the  collagen substrate. Such 
repaired collagen then shows the tightly structured and organized fibrillar pattern characteristic 
of native type I collagen, leading to a resumption of the functional activities of collagen in 
modulating structural integrity of the ocular ECM and in mediating certain signal transduction 
activities. This restoration of collagen and ECM homeostasis in turn promotes the rapid 
regeneration of the corneal epithelium (see, e.g., Kivanany et al., 2018; Hapach et al., 2015).  
Dis
ruptions in the epithelial basement membrane , which comprises several collagen types, are 
also a critical part of ocular surface pathology. Disruption in the basement membrane collagen 
network l eads to adverse effects on the integrity of Bowman’s membrane and allows 
inflammatory cytokines to pass through, increasing inflammatory cell infiltration in the area of 
the wound ( Shetty, Deshpande et al. 2016). In addi tion to the se anatomical a nd physiological 
changes, certain changes in cellular signaling a ctivities occur as well. This is both a hallmark and 
a cause of DED (see, e.g., Baratta et al. (2021, in press)).  
No 
topical therapeutic to date fully addresses the collagenase- mediated damage to the collagen-
containing ocular surface tissue that is associated with DED. Topical but indirect therapies for 
treating tissue damage in DED are available (e.g., amniotic membrane implants, soft contact 
lenses, and topical anti- inflammatories such as those described above) but these indirect topical 
treatments and anti -inflammatories only allow the body to heal collagen secondarily, slowly and 
quite unpredictably. Thus, there remains an urgent and unmet medical need for a dir ect, rapidly 
acting and therefore more efficacious treatment option with favorable safety and comfort profiles 
that also will promote actual repair of the ocular tissue damage that is a hallmark of DED. 
ST-100, a formulation comprising a synthetic collagen mimetic peptide, is being developed to 
topically treat the signs and symptoms of DED.  Stuart Therapeutics  
ST-100 Ophthalmic SolutionProtocol 
IND 143015
Confidential Page 13 of 68
ST-100 is believed to rapidly repair damaged collagen via in tercalat ion into the disrupted 
collagen and reform ation of the native collagen I triple helix.  
Currently, t he most common prescription therapeutics for DED are topical anti-inflammator ies 
such as Xiidra®, Restasis® and Cequa™. These traditional therapies, however, do not directly 
treat a major underlying cause and effect of DED – damage to the ocular surface tissue and 
specifically to the collagen in the ECM within and underlying the corneal epithelium. The 
Sponsor has therefore sought to identify and evaluate potential therapeutic  formulations which 
directly repair ocular surface tissue damage which would provide a more rapid and enduring 
relief of symptoms  compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. To date such a therapeutic 
has not been available. ST-100 addresses this gap as it is thought to rapidly repair damaged 
collagen via intercalation into damaged collagen triple helices, thereby  repairing  the ocular 
surface damage that underlies the signs and symptoms associated with DED. It is  anticipate d that 
by healing the underlying collagen matrix of corneal tissues, ST-100 will also reduce the 
necessity for l ong-term use of traditional anti -inflammatory regimens.  
In a non-clinical, proof -of-concept study in mice, application of ST-100 to the wounded eyes of 
mice was shown to induce significant recovery of the corneal epithelium, stromal matrix and 
Bowman’s lay er following lamellar keratectomy  compared  to phosphate- buffer ed saline negative 
controls. Together with corresponding data obtained using in vitro  models of the corneal 
epithelium, these results encouraged the Sponsor to examine the potential for use of ST-100 as a 
topical, rapidly acting therapeutic for DED in humans. 
 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The
 objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two different concentrations 
of ST-100 Ophthalmic Solution to placebo for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry 
eye. 
 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
The
 clinical hypotheses for this study is  that low dose and high dose ST-100 Ophthalmic 
Solution twice daily  (BID) is superior to its vehicle (BID) for the primary endpoints of signs and 
symptoms  of dry eye, as fol lows :  
•Sign: Pre -Controlled A dverse Environment (CAE®) total corneal fluorescein staining
score on the Ora Calibra® scale, measured by 
•Symptom: Pre-CAE® ocular discomfort scale on the Ora Calibra® Ocular Disco mfor t
scale, measured by Stuart Therapeutics

COMPLIANCE WITH P ROTOCOL 
Subjects will be instruc ted on proper use of the subject daily diary and proper instillation and 
storage of study drug at the end of Visits 1 through 6 and given w ritten instructions. To assess 
dosing and symptom assessment compliance, the subject daily diaries will be collected at Visit 2 , 
5, 6, 7, and the subject’s used and unused study drug a mpules will be collected at Visit 2 , 5, 6, 
and 7. Dosing compliance will be based o n the used and unused ampule count.  If the subject is 
less than 80% or more than 125% compliant with dosing based on the expected number of used 
ampules, then the subject will be deemed non-compliant and a dosing deviation should be 
recorded.  Subjects will be reinstructed on dosing compliance and this will be documented in the 
source doc uments. T hese guidelines will be used by the Investigator for determining the 
subject’s necessary compliance for the study and for recording deviations from this compliance.
A protocol deviation occurs when there is any non-adherence to a study procedure or schedule 
that is specified by the protocol. The term “protocol deviation” includes those departures from 
the protocol previously described by the term “protocol violation”; all departures from the 
protocol are now described as protocol deviations, regardless of the potential impact on subj ect 
safety. A Protocol Deviation Log shall be maintained by the site(s). Protocol deviations will be 
summarized in the final clinical study report. 
SUBJECT DISPOSITION 
8.6.1 Co
mpleted Subjects  
A completed subject is one who has not been discontinued from the study. 
8.6.2 Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued prior to their completion of the study due to: 
•subject request/withdrawal
•lack of efficacy
•AEs
•protocol violations
•administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue, lost to follow up)
•sponsor termination of study
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for any sound medical reason. 
COVID- 19 Related Discontinuations will be indicated as well with a reason for COVID -19 
relatedness.  
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason f or discontinuation will be made to Ora 
and/or sponsor and will be clearly documented on the e CRF.

STUDY DURATION 
An i
ndividual subjec t’s part icipation will involve 7 visits over approximately a 35-days period (7 
days pre- screening, 28 days of treatment). 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
During the course of the study an O ra monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess I P accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records 
will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details 
of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, qu ality assurance and or its designees 
may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits which may include source data checks. 
Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. 
All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as 
subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
ADVERSE EVENT (A E) 
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE  can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an IP , without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise from any use of the IP (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, 
implantation, or use of a medical device, including medical device failure, subject characteristics 
that may impact medical device performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic 
parameters (e.g., energy applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit ) associated with medical 
device use . 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate pages of the case report form ( CRF ). 
Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical find ing is considered an AE and must be 
recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should 
be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP , action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject upon indirect questioning. 
Exacerbation of conditions related to the signs and symptoms of DE D will not be  reported as an 
AE. Stuart Therapeutics  
ST-100 Ophthalmic SolutionProtocol 
IND 143015
Confidential Page 32 of 68
9.1.1 Severity  
S
everity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject. The assessment of severity 
is made irrespective of relationsh ip to IP  or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated 
according to the following scale:  
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.2 Relationship to Investigat ional Product  
The Investigator must assess whether they consider an AE to be drug related. In assessing this 
relationship, the Investigator must use information about the conditions/concurrent medication, 
and chronology of the event relative to drug. The  investigator should initially classify the 
relatedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s 
determination unless revised by the Sponsor, which has the ultimate responsibility for judging 
relatedness.  The relationship of  each AE to the IP  should be determined by the investigator using 
these explanations:  
• Definitely Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is 
confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and no other reasonable cause exists. 
• Probably Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is 
confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and the suspect IP is the most likely of all 
causes.  
• Possibly Related : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from  
the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by the su bject’s clinical  
state or by other drugs administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely to be Related : Relationship uncertain to the investigational product.  Likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational product but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty.  
• Not Related : Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause is clearly 
responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time, or exposure to IP has not occurred.

9.1.3 Expectedness 
Th
e expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IP  using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the Investigational Brochure ( IB) at the specificity and 
severity that has been observed.  
• Not applicable : An AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered 
unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classif y the expectedness of an AE , but the final classification is 
subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An
 AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcom es: 
• Death;  
• Is life-threatening; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours), unless the inpatient admission was pre- plann ed prior to the signing of the 
informed consent. For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient 
hospitalization does not include: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory 
procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; 
nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for the 
initial admission as determined by the investigator or treating physician. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve) .

• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Im
portant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING SERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS  
All SAEs and their outcomes , regardless of causality or expectedness,  must be reported to Ora 
and the Sponsor as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing 
health authorities and recorded on the appropriate case report form ( CRF ). Adverse events will 
be collected after  the signing of the Informed Consent). 
9.3.1 Reporting a Serio us Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
All SAEs that are both ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, the Sponsor, and 
the IRB/IEC and the regulatory authorities as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local 
regulations and governing health authorities. 
9.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IP, must be immediately 
reported. All information relevant to the SAE  must be recorded on the appropriate CRFs . The 
investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by Ora and/or the sponsor in 
addition to that information reported on the CRF . All subjects experiencing a SAE  must be 
followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE , the investigator mu st notify Ora and the Sponsor immediately using the 
contact information below ; obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up 
of the subject; provide Ora and the sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a 
statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IP ; and

 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, ETHICAL 
CO
NSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE S 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practices 
(GCPs), including the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, and in 
general, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all applicable loc al, state, and 
federal requirements relevant to the use of IP in the countries involved will be addressed . 
 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
11.1.1
 Subject Informed Consent  
Informed consent/assent must take place before any study specific procedures are initiated. 
Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the 
subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study.  
All informed consent forms must be approved for use by the Sponsor and receive 
approval/favorable opinion from an IRB prior to their use. If the consent form requires revision 
(e.g., due to a protocol amendment or significant new safety information), it is the I nvestigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that the amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by Ora 
prior to submission to the governing IRB and that it is read, signed and dated by all subjects 
subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study. 
If informed consent is taken under special circumstances (o ral informed consent), then the 
procedures to be followed must be determined by Ora and/or Sponsor and provided in writing by 
Ora and/or Sponsor prior to the consent process. 
11.1.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
This study is to be conducted in accordance with IRB regulations (U.S. 21 Code of F ederal 
Regulations Part 56.103). The Investigator must obtain appropriate IRB approval before 
initiating the study and re-approval at least annually. 
Only an IRB approved version of the informed consent form will be used. 
 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
T
his study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that originated with the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
A
ll personal study subject data collected and processed for the purposes of this study should be 
maintained by the Investigator and his/her staff with adequate precautions as to ensure that the 
confidentiality of the data is  in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

A repo rt of the results of this study may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities 
i
n any country in which the IP  may ultimately be marketed, but the subject’s identity will not be 
disclosed in these documents. 
 DOCUMENTATION 
S
ource documents ma y include a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the 
Investigator’s study subject files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X -rays, 
laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms . The Investigator’s copy of the CRFs serves as the 
Investigator’s record of a subject’s study- related data.  
11.4.1 Retention of Documentation  
All study related correspondence, subject  records, consent forms, record of the distribution and 
use of all IP, and copies of CRFs  should be maintained on file for at least two years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or until at least two years have elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP . These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an 
agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to w hen these documents no longer need to be retained. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept 
the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian. 
 RECORDING OF DATA ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND CASE REPORTS 
FO
RMS (CRFS)  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and accurately recorded 
on each subject’s CRF , source document, and all study- related material. All study data should 
also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded datum should only be 
corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g., 
by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected 
data). An individual who has corrected a data entry should make clear who made the correction 
and when, by adding to the c orrection his/her initials as well as the date of the correction.  
Data entry of all enrolled and randomized subjects will use software that conforms to 21 CFR 
Part 11 requirements, and will be performed only by staff who have been trained on the system 
and have access to the system. Data will be entered in eCRF  for screen failure subjects. An audit 
trail will be maintained within the electronic system to capture all changes made within the 
eCRF database. After the end of the study and database lock, compact  discs (CDs) containing 
copies of all applicable subjects’ eCRFs will be provided to each Investigator Site to be 
maintained on file by the Investigator. 
 PUBLICATIONS  
A
ll data derived from the study will be the property of the Sponsor and must be kept stri ctly 
confidential. The Investigator must not submit any of the data from this study for publication 
without prior consent of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will have the final decision regarding any 
manuscript and publication.    Stuart Therapeutics
